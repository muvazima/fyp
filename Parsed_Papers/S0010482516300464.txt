                  Automatic segmentation of ultrasonographic breast lesions is very challenging, due to the lesions′ spiculated nature and the variance in shape and texture of the B-mode ultrasound images. Many studies have tried to answer this challenge by applying a variety of computational methods including: Markov random field, artificial neural networks, and active contours and level-set techniques. These studies focused on creating an automatic contour, with maximal resemblance to a manual contour, delineated by a trained radiologist. In this study, we have developed an algorithm, designed to capture the spiculated boundary of the lesion by using the properties from the corresponding ultrasonic image. This is primarily achieved through a unique multi-scale texture identifier (inspired by visual system models) integrated in a level-set framework. The algorithm׳s performance has been evaluated quantitatively via contour-based and region-based error metrics. We compared the algorithm–generated contour to a manual contour delineated by an expert radiologist. In addition, we suggest here a new method for performance evaluation where corrections made by the radiologist replace the algorithm-generated (original) result in the correction zones. The resulting corrected contour is then compared to the original version. The evaluation showed: (1) Mean absolute error of 0.5 pixels between the original and the corrected contour; (2) Overlapping area of 99.2% between the lesion regions, obtained by the algorithm and the corrected contour. These results are significantly better than those previously reported. In addition, we have examined the potential of our segmentation results to contribute to the discrimination between malignant and benign lesions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women all over the world and about 12% of women will suffer from this disease during their lifetime [1]. B-mode ultrasound (US) is widely used for breast imaging [2] as an adjunct imaging modality to mammography, especially in young (less than 30 years), pregnant and lactating women, and women with dense breasts. In addition, US is a relatively low-cost, noninvasive and non-radiating imaging modality.

The quality of most B-mode images, however, is problematic. The images typically have low contrast, blurry boundaries and a speckle-like appearance. Moreover, there may be a number of artifacts resulting from the imaging technique, such as: enhancement, shadowing, side lobes, and multiple reflection echoes [3].

The interpretation of breast US images by radiologists is based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS lexicon) [4]. The radiologist usually supplies a coarse contour and a measurement of the diameter of the lesion, in order to mark its size and location in the image. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist the radiologist in identifying abnormalities with objective measures [5], but because of the low quality of US images, this requires an objective and accurate segmentation of the lesion. In addition to assisting in diagnosis, an exact automatic segmentation supplies a tool for the delineation of the cancer borders. This is useful in order to ensure that none of the cancerous mass is missed and to protect the welfare of women by avoiding unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions.

A considerable amount of research has been done in the area of US image segmentation, in order to cope with this challenge. A number of algorithms, which include different computational methods, have been proposed [5]: Histogram thresholding [6–8], Markov random field [9–11], artificial neural networks (ANN) [12–14], active contours and level-set [15–20].

The histogram thresholding algorithms [6,8], for example, determines the potential lesion margins through gray-value thresholding of a processed version of the US image and maximization of a utility function. Markov random field algorithms alternatively approximate the maximization of the posterior (MPM) estimation of the class labels of image pixels, and estimate the class parameters. One of the studies which utilized Besag׳s iterative conditional mode [10], considered texture by using discrete wavelet transform.

ANN algorithms employ different lesion properties, such as wavelet analysis [13] and auto-covariance [14] as measures for texture, in order to distinguish the lesion from the background. A recent study obtained improved clinical results, relative to those previously reported by using a single-scale texture property, an intensity property [17], and the phase from two dimensional Fourier transform [12]. However, it seems that the algorithm′s results are still not clinically satisfactory.

Different intensity, spatial and texture properties have been incorporated in both active contour and level-set frameworks [21]. The intensity property was applied through the use of distribution functions, such as Rayleigh distribution [16,19,22] or the intensities distribution of the image itself [17,23,24]. The texture was also represented by statistical models, such as Gaussian distribution functions with different means and variances [25–27]. Additional measures for texture such as the difference of the intensity of each pixel in the image with the mean of its nearest neighbors and feature vector of directional derivatives have also been suggested [17,23]. The spatial properties have been applied through convolution of the image with different spatial functions, such as Gabor functions, and the computation of a distance map [15].

Even though many studies and computational methods have been applied to US image segmentation, it seems that a solution for accurate lesion segmentation that defines the lesion precisely and satisfies clinical requirements has not been reached yet. Our study proposes a solution to this challenge.

The organization of the paper is as follows. The suggested algorithm and its parameters are presented in Sections 2 and 3, respectively; Results are shown in Section 4; Section 5 concludes the study.

A database of biopsy-proven 78 sonograms (43 benign and 35 malignant) has been used to test our algorithm. The database was collected between the years 2010 and 2013 and includes a large repertoire of lesion manifestations. The images were acquired by Siemens Acuson S2000 ultrasound system with 6–18MHz linear probe, and stored in bit-map (BMP) format.

We propose a segmentation algorithm inspired by computational models for visual system [28,29], which include adaptation and induction effects, that increase and enhance the differences between adjacent regions. This enables the algorithm to detect non homogeneous textures and un-sharp edges, such as those typically seen in the noisy B-mode ultrasound images.

The algorithm can be divided into four main sections: (1) Region of interest (ROI) generation; (2) Computation of multi-scale response map; (3) Level-set segmentation of an ultrasonic lesion and (4) Post-processing (
                        Fig. 1).

The first part is related to an ROI, containing a suspected breast abnormality. The ROI, denoted as I
                        
                           ROI
                        , is marked by an expert radiologist and cropped from the input US image I. The radiologist defines the ROI such that it includes the entire lesion and the surrounding breast tissue with different echogenicity [4].

In the second part (Section 2.3), a multi-scale response map, denoted as M, is computed for the ROI. This response map emphasizes the texture properties of the object to be segmented. The multi-scale response map is based on a texture measure building block in the computational model for adaptation mechanism of the visual system [28].

In the third part (Section 2.4), we use a region-based level-set segmentation [30], which is based on the response map [28,29] from the previous stage. This is done in order to obtain an optimal and fine contour for the breast lesion. The optimality is with respect to minimization of an energy cost functional, defined for the ROI.

In the last part (Section 2.5), due to clinical considerations, the segmentation result from the previous part is post-processed. We create a simple curve for the segmented object and perform a morphological opening process. The resulting contour is the suggested lesion boundary C
                        
                           LS
                        . In addition to this contour, we compute a convex-hull contour (Section 2.6), denoted as C
                        
                           CH
                        . The latter contour is computed in order to evaluate the potential of the algorithm׳s segmentation results to distinguish between malignant and benign lesions (Section 5). This information may be used for further processing, regarding classification of B-mode ultrasound lesions. Classification of malignant and benign lesions is outside the scope of this work and we plan to report this in a future manuscript.

In order to capture the un-sharp edge of a lesion in the B-mode US modality, we have chosen to identify the lesion through a unique multi-scale texture measure [28]. An un-sharp edge is usually not identified by a single resolution, thus, a multi-scale measure is required. For this purpose, we applied a variation of such a measure from a proposed model of visual system adaptation mechanism [28].

Following this rationale, a Multi-Scale Response Map (Fig. 1), termed MSRM, is computed by using achromatic opponent receptive fields (RFs). An opponent RF is composed of two sub-regions, center and surround. It is often modeled by a difference of Gaussians (DOG) spatial mask [31].

The center and surround signals are defined as a convolution between the ROI image, I

The MSRM aims to identify different texture zones in the B-mode image, which are usually not specified by a single specific resolution. This is done through the use of DOG spatial masks with different resolutions, which model opponent RFs. In addition, the blurred edges of the ultrasonic lesion can appear in different sets of resolutions. Thus, in order to enhance the dominant responses from the relevant RF resolutions adaptively, we apply the power coefficient (Eq. (2)). This enables the automatic enhancement of the dominant responses, regardless of their specific resolutions. Since the dominant resolutions are not known in advance, the responses from all resolutions are averaged, after applying the power coefficient. The inverse power coefficient is applied to the averaged response in order to obtain the MSRM in the same order of magnitude as the responses of the RFs.

The polarity of the lesion is taken into account by considering the sign of the RF responses and the sign of the averaged response in the computation of the MSRM (Eq. (2)). The lesion usually appears with darker texture, relative to its surroundings, so that the MSRM in the lesion region has mainly negative responses, while adjacent healthy tissue has mainly positive responses (
                        Fig. 2). Note that the automatic relevant resolutions with the most influence on the sign calculations will be the coarse resolutions. The MSRM, which incorporates both the texture and polarity properties of the lesion, can therefore emphasize the lesion over the background.

Level-set framework [32] (Fig. 1) is employed, in order to obtain an optimal and fine lesion border. The resulting contour obtained from the level-set framework is optimal in the sense that it minimizes an energy cost functional, which is defined in the B-mode ROI (Section 2.1).

In order to differentiate the lesion from its background, we incorporate the lesion texture property, expressed by the MSRM, in the level-set framework. For the sake of clarity, a brief overview of the level-set framework, based on [32], will be given.

Let I be a real function, defined on a two dimensional domain Ω, such that I:Ω→
                           
                              ℜ
                           . Segmentation of the image I is obtained by partitioning the image domain Ω into two disjointed regions, object and background, denoted as Ω
                           
                              o
                            and Ω
                           
                              b
                           , respectively. The contour defined by the segmentation is C=∂Ω
                           
                              o
                           
                           =∂Ω
                           
                              b
                           .

Let ϕ:Ω→
                           
                              ℜ
                            be an auxiliary real function, termed level-set function [32]. ϕ is defined such that it is negative at Ω
                           
                              o
                            and positive at Ω
                           
                              b
                           . Thus, C is defined implicitly by the zero level set of ϕ.

In order to determine an optimal segmentation of the object, an energy functional of ϕ, denoted as E(ϕ), is defined and minimization with respect to ϕ is performed. In our algorithm, we use a region-based level-set approach [30]. With this approach, the partition of the object and background is according to the different properties of these regions.

Ultrasonic lesions usually appear with a different texture, relative to their surrounding tissue. Due to the large amount of speckle noise and poorly defined edges, the region-based level-set method, incorporating the MSRM, is applied.

An energy term is formulated using the MSRM and the Chan-Vese “fitting” term [30]:

Regularization terms, based on the contour length or the area inside it [30], have not been applied here as part of the energy functional. The reason is that these terms can impair the accuracy of the resulting contour, which has a lacy nature in cancerous tissue. Since we do not use regularization terms, which play a role in preventing over segmentation, we have to deal with this issue with a different way, by the implementation of a post-processing procedure for the result of the level-set algorithm (Section 2.5).

We use the gradient descent method for minimizing the energy functional E(ϕ), using the following Euler-Lagrange equation [32]:

                           0. The seed point for each lesion is defined by an expert radiologist who determines the width and depth of the lesion, according to the BI-RADS lexicon [4] and marks them on the lesion. The intersection point is then used as the seed point for the lesion.

The Heaviside function H and the Dirac delta function δ are approximated by the following smooth functions [30]:

                              i,j
                           
                           =M(iΔx,jΔy) and M(x, y) is defined in Eq. (2). The level-set function is evolved according to Eq. (9), until either a maximum number of iterations is reached or a stopping criterion is met [16,30].

The initial lesion region is regarded as the part of the object region, resulting from the level-set algorithm (Section 2.4), which contains the seed point inside the lesion, denoted as (x
                        0
                        ,y
                        0) (Section 2.4.4). Due to clinical considerations, the initial lesion region is post-processed (Fig. 1), in order to cope with potential undesired outcomes of the level-set algorithm, as explained hereafter.

As a result of using the Chan-Vese fitting term, internal echoes, which appear as bright foci inside the lesion, can be detected [30]. These internal echoes lead to formation of “holes” inside the lesion region. Due to the fact that internal echoes inside the lesion region are part of the lesion, holes in the initial lesion region are closed [34]. This permits the presentation of the lesion border as a simple closed curve.


                        
                        Fig. 3 presents an example of a lesion with an internal echo. The internal echo has a different texture compared to the lesion. It is, thus, excluded from the initial lesion region. In the post processing procedure the internal echo is added to the initial lesion region and regarded as part of it.

An additional undesired outcome of the level-set algorithm, that has to be dealt with, involves potential edge leakage [16]. This may occur because of the nature of the images being used (Section 1), in which the lesion can have an ill-defined and sometimes even an unclosed boundary. In such a case, an edge leakage can apparently connect the actual lesion region to regions of healthy tissue. In order to overcome this problem, we perform morphological opening [35] as follows.

After the holes in the initial lesion region are closed, the resulting region is eroded by D pixels. In the erosion process, an edge of width D pixels around the lesion, without holes, is omitted. This process disconnects outlier regions, which were connected to the actual lesion region by a thin thread. The disconnected regions are then omitted and the remaining region, which contains the seed point (x
                        0
                        ,y
                        0) (Section 2.4.4) is dilated by D pixels in order to return the border of the remaining region to the position it held before the erosion process was applied. The region obtained from the dilation process is regarded as the proposed lesion region. Its edge is the proposed lesion contour, which is denoted as C
                        
                           LS
                         (Fig. 1).


                        
                        Fig. 4 demonstrates the morphological opening process. There are no internal echoes in the initial lesion region, thus no holes are formed (Fig. 4(b)). The lesion in Fig. 4(a) has a weak edge at its lower left part and its border is open at the lower right part. As a result, edge leakage occurs and the resulting region is connected to healthy tissue (Fig. 4(b)). The morphological opening process (Fig. 4(c)–(e)) disconnects these healthy regions from the actual lesion region (Fig. 4(f)).

Post-processing of the initial lesion region, as obtained from the level-set algorithm, is done instead of employing regularization terms in the level-set functional. This approach enables the derivation of a fine lesion contour, which has the potential to follow the border of the lesion more precisely.

In addition to the fine contour C
                        
                           LS
                         (Fig. 1), derived by (Eqs. (5)–10) and post-processing (Section 2.5), we compute a coarse contour – a convex-hull [36], which is denoted as C
                        
                           CH
                         (Fig. 1). The rationale for this contour is to assess the potential to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. This topic is discussed in Section 5.

@&#METHODS@&#

The MSRM (Eq. (2)) is calculated over eight resolutions (N=8) with opponent RFs. The surround mask has an annular shape, with an inner diameter that equals the center diameter and an outer diameter, which is twice as large. The spatial functions f
                        
                           c
                        
                        
                           k
                         and f
                        
                           s
                        
                        
                           k
                         are represented by Gaussian decaying profiles, with appropriate variances. The total weights of these functions are normalized to 1. Mask properties at different resolutions are summarized in 
                        Table 1. The power coefficient λ in the computation of the MSRM is set to 2.

In our numerical implementation, we chose the parameter values as follows: r
                        0=40 (Eq. (6)), ε=1 (Eq. (7)), Δx=1, Δy=1, Δt=5 (Eq. (8)) and D=5 (Section 2.5). The seed point (x
                        0
                        ,y
                        0) (Eq. (6)) was chosen manually for each image, according to the lesion position determined by an expert radiologist.

The algorithm was used on a database of 78 B-mode ultrasound images, as described in Section 2.1. The algorithm׳s parameters were obtained after a trial and error process, through iterative feedback from a trained radiologist. The mask properties in Section 3.1 (Table 1) were chosen such that they encompass the different edge resolutions, which can appear in the lesion sonogram.

The power coefficient λ influences the contribution of different resolutions in the computation of the MSRM (Section 3.1). It automatically enhances the relevant dominant resolutions, which results in adaptive enhancement of the lesion boundary. If λ is too large, few resolutions contribute to the MSRM and its accuracy is compromised. A small λ results in a noisy outcome, since weak responses are taken into account. The value of λ has been set such that it balances these two effects.

The radius of the initial zero level set, r
                        0 (Section 3.2) has been set to give a good approximation for both small and large lesions. The other level-set parameters ε, Δx, Δy and Δt (Section 3.2) have been determined according to numerical considerations of the level-set implementation. D (Section 3.2) has been chosen such that the post processing procedure can handle over segmentation and not impair the fitness of the obtained lesion boundary.

The chosen values (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) have been used across all of the processed images.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of gold standard for clinical evaluation of automatic lesion segmentation schemes [17]. The most popular method is the comparison between an automatic computer-generated contour and a manual subjective contour, delineated by one or more expert radiologists. This approach may suffer from significant inter- and intra-observer variability [17,37].

In light of this situation, we suggest a different approach. In our approach, an expert radiologist is required to make corrections to the automatically derived contour. The corrected contour is denoted as C
                        
                           RC
                        . This approach is demonstrated in 
                        Fig. 7. Our approach may reduce the person to person variability, since the radiologist is modifying a suggested contour, instead of creating a new manual lesion contour.

In order to avoid cognitive bias of the radiologist, each image is presented first without any contour. The radiologist then determines the lesion boundary on this image and only afterwards is presented with the contour generated by the algorithm and is requested to make any necessary corrections to it.

Quantitative comparison has been done between the computer-generated contour C
                        
                           LS
                         and the corrected contour C
                        
                           RC
                         (
                        Table 2, bottom row). We have used the following error metrics: (1) Edge-based [38]: (a) Hausdorff distance (HD); (b) Mean absolute distance (MD); and (2) Region-based [39]: (a) True positive fraction (TPF); (b) False positive fraction (FPF); (c) Similarity (SI).

In addition, we have tested whether the suggested approach for clinical evaluation, through the usage of corrected contours, yields better clinical performance than the common approach, which employs manual contours. A manually delineated contour is denoted as C
                        
                           MD
                        . Due to technical considerations, the test has been done on a sample of 26 images from our database (Section 2.1), for which the expert radiologist has delineated the lesion contour manually.

We employed the common approach, despite its drawbacks, in order to be able to compare our performance to previous studies, which used this evaluation approach. Since we suggested a different approach for clinical evaluation, we settled for a sample of images from the database for evaluation with the common approach.

The algorithm-generated results for this sample were evaluated quantitatively with respect to the expert radiologist׳s manual contours, by using the above same contour-based and region-based error metrics (Table 2, fourth row).

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 2 presents a lesion (Fig. 2(a)) and its corresponding MSRM (Fig. 2(b)). It can be seen that the lesion appears with a darker texture than its surroundings, but with no sharp edge. The corresponding MSRM has negative values in the region of the lesion and positive values in the adjacent healthy tissue, i.e., it emphasizes the lesion over the background region. Thus, the MSRM enables the level-set algorithm to capture the ill-defined boundary of the lesion.


                        
                        Fig. 5 presents the results of the algorithm for both malignant and benign cases and shows that the green contour C
                        
                           LS
                         succeeded in delineating the spiculated shape of a carcinoma type cancer (Fig. 5(b)). In the case of a benign lesion (fibroadenoma), the contour appears much smoother (Fig. 5(d)).

In addition, we have computed a coarse contour C
                        
                           CH
                        , presented as a red contour in 
                        Fig. 6. It is a convex-hull [36] for the green contour (Section 2.6). The difference between these two contours is more obvious for the malignant lesion (Fig. 6.(b)).

The lesion area was regarded as the number of pixels inside the contour C

                        , resulting from the level-set algorithm. The area results for the lesions in our database were in the range of 0.0529cm2 and 0.767cm2, with a mean of 0.247cm2. The mean area corresponds to a circle with radius of 0.28cm (35 pixels). The radius of the initial zero level set, r
                        0 (Section 3.2) was set to a larger value, in order to accommodate the spiculated shape of malignant lesions, which deviate from a circular geometry.

As described, the common method to evaluate the clinical performance of automatic segmentation algorithms is by comparing the algorithm-generated results to a manually delineated lesion contour, produced by an expert observer [14,37]. Radiologists determine the lesion location and evaluate whether it is malignant or benign by using BI-RADS lexicon properties, such as shape, orientation, margin, echogenicity, etc. [4].

There is however, no clinical standard for manual delineation of the lesion boundary, which is subjective so that different radiologists may determine different contours for the same lesion [17,37]. Furthermore, the radiologists usually do not attempt to follow the tortuous border of a lesion [37].

In order to try to overcome this difficulty, we propose a different evaluation approach, which relies on a radiologist making corrections to the algorithm׳s results. This approach is also useful due to the nature of the lesions′ contours as determined by our algorithm. The algorithm yields precise lesion borders, which follow the tortuous shape of the lesion while radiologists do not usually perform this fine delineation manually. Nonetheless, in order to compare the performance of our algorithm to that of previous algorithms, we have evaluated of the results of our algorithm with the common evaluation approach [14,37] (Table 2, fourth row).

Quantification of the algorithm׳s performance, by both the common and the suggested clinical evaluation approaches, has been done with several error metrics, both contour-based and region-based (Table 2). These error metrics are detailed in the following section (Section 4.4).

The evaluation of the algorithm-generated results is done by comparing the automatically derived fine contour C
                        
                           LS
                         (Sections 2.3–2.5) to a corrected version C
                        
                           RC
                        , as well as to a manually delineated contour C
                        
                           MD
                         (Section 3.4). Fig. 7. presents an example of such corrections. The corrected contour C
                        
                           RC
                         is built such that the manual correction lines (Yellow lines) replace the automatic contour C
                        
                           LS
                         (Green contour) at the relevant contour zones. The remaining automatic contour is left intact and added to the correction lines. 
                        Fig. 8 presents an example of manual delineation, performed by an expert radiologist on the image without any prior knowledge of the algorithm׳s result.

In order to evaluate the algorithm׳s performance quantitatively, two types of error metrics are used: contour-based (Section 4.4.1) and region-based (Section 4.4.2).

The Hausdorff error metric, thus measures the worst disagreement between the two contours, while the mean absolute error metric measures the average disagreement over the two outlines. Thus, low values for these metrics are desirable.

The bottom row in Table 2 presents the results for the HD and the MD metrics, derived by employing the suggested clinical evaluation approach (Section 4.3). These metrics have been averaged over all the images in our database. In addition, we have computed normalized values of HD and MD, through division by the number of points on the corrected contour (denoted as l). The average HD and average MD were found to be just 2.95 and 0.5 pixels, respectively. The corresponding normalized HD and normalized MD were 1.3% and 0.2%, respectively.

Results for these metrics (Table 2, fourth row) have been also obtained by comparing the algorithm׳s results for a sample of images from our database to manually delineated lesion contours (Section 4.3). The average values for these error metrics were found to be: HD and MD of 7.8 and 2.0 pixels, respectively; normalized HD and normalized MD of 3.9% and 0.9%, respectively. The above results clearly indicate a very good agreement between the automated and both the corrected and manually delineated lesion contours.

The goal is to reach high TPF, low FPF and high SI. High TPF means that most of the real lesion region is covered by the automatically derived lesion region; when the FPF is low, small amounts of healthy tissue pixels are covered by the automatically delineated lesion area; higher SI means that the computer-generated lesion region is more similar to the radiologist׳s delineation.


                           Table 2 presents the results for the area error metrics. The bottom row presents the results that have been obtained by employing the suggested clinical evaluation approach (Section 4.3). The average results, averaged over all the cases in our study, were found to be: TPF of 99.2%; rate of miss classified normal pixels of 2.6%; and similarity percentage of 97.3%. The comparison between the lesion contours, as derived by the algorithm, and the corresponding manual delineations (Section 4.3) yielded TPF, FPF, and SI of 94.3%, 7.6%, and 87.8%, respectively. These are the average results for a sample of cases from our database. Similarly to the contour error metrics, a successful match has been achieved in terms of the region error metrics.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our algorithm performs accurate segmentation of breast ultrasound images, using a multi-scale texture measure, [28]. The algorithm incorporates the multi-scale texture measure in the level-set framework [30] in order to obtain a fine contour, describing the lesion boundary with high accuracy, despite the large variations in shape and size, and the poorly defined edges typical of lesions. A coarse convex-hull contour, based on the fine version, is also computed in order to provide information about suspicious masses.

Preliminary clinical evaluation of a database of 78 biopsy proven images, performed by our proposed methodology (Section 4.3), yielded very good results for both the boundary-based and region-based error metrics. The average of the Hausdorff distance and mean absolute distance over all the images in our database were found to be 2.95 and 0.5 pixels, respectively (Table 2, bottom row). The results for the region-based error metrics, averaged over the whole image database, were TPF of 99.2%, FPF of 2.6% and SI of 97.3% (Table 2, bottom row).

Previous studies that performed segmentation of US B-mode images, were predominantly focused at creating an automatic contour that resembles as far as possible the contour delineated by a radiologist [12,16,17] (Table 2). The evaluation of our algorithm׳s results compared to this common clinical approach (Section 4.3) showed a trend of improved performance for the contour-based error metrics (Section 4.4.1), while the obtained region-based results (Section 4.4.2) were close to the state of the art (Table 2, fourth row). The performance obtained by our proposed clinical approach (Table 2, bottom row) showed significant improvement over previous studies. It should be noted, however, that the previous studies [12,16,17] used the common evaluation approach.

Several recent studies, which proposed algorithms for segmenting breast ultrasound images, also used boundary and region error metrics [12,16,17]. Their results are presented in Table 2. It can be seen that the HD and MD were in the range of 19.72–25.07 and 5.8–6.6 pixels, respectively (Table 2). Our results for boundary error metrics, however, are significantly smaller, by approximately an order of magnitude (Table 2, bottom row). The results for region-based error metrics have been improved in recent years. The TPF and SI have been increased to 94% and 88%, respectively, and the FPF has been reduced to 7% (Table 2). Our algorithm yielded better performance for all the region-based error criteria (Table 2, bottom row).

One can query whether the quantitative results, obtained by evaluating the algorithm׳s results with our proposed clinical evaluation method, derive from employing different methodology for clinical evaluation (Section 4.3), or whether it stems from the qualities of the algorithm itself. An additional possibility is that the high performance derives from both options.

In order to answer this question, previously suggested algorithms (Table 2), should be implemented and their performance evaluated with our suggested approach (Section 4.3). If this results in an improved performance, it would imply that our clinical evaluation approach contributes to the performance. However, if the evaluation of previous algorithms with the suggested approach yields an inferior performance relative to ours (Table 2, bottom row), it would suggest that our algorithm׳s qualities contribute to the better performance. This test is far beyond the scope of this work and belongs in a further study.

However, we do suggest that the algorithm contributes to the high segmentation performance as well as the use of the suggested clinical evaluation method. This claim is made due to the following reasons: (1) The performance of the contour-based error metrics, obtained for our algorithm by employing the common evaluation method, is better than previously reported (Table 2, first to fourth rows); (2) Our results for the region-based error metric, obtained by employing the common evaluation approach, are close to the state of the art results, although they do not outperform them (Table 2, second and fourth rows); and (3). The new clinical evaluation method yielded improved results for our algorithm in all error criteria, in comparison to those obtained by the common method (Table 2, fourth and bottom rows).

We would like to mention here that different reports have used different image databases. Thus, a difference in database might also contribute to the difference in algorithm performances. The comparison between our algorithm and previous ones can be improved if a common database of B-mode images is used for the evaluation of lesion segmentation algorithms.

It should be noted that the corrected contour in the suggested evaluation approach (Section 4.3 is dependent on the algorithm-generated results. Therefore, the algorithm׳s qualities influence the performance obtained by employing the suggested clinical evaluation approach. In other words, an inaccurate lesion contour will require substantial corrections, which will impair the performance obtained by using the suggested evaluation method. As mentioned before, conclusive conclusions, can only be derived after a further thorough study comparing previous algorithms.

Feedback from a physician concerning the results of a segmentation algorithm has been reported previously [40]. In this study, the feedback was integrated as a subsequent phase of the segmentation process, in order to correct the initial results and to improve the segmentation performance. In our study, the radiologist′s corrections were part of the performance evaluation, rather than the segmentation algorithm.

We would like to argue, even at this stage, that the use of our unique multi-scale texture quantifier with the level-set framework has enabled the algorithm to delineate the ultrasonic lesions accurately. Thus, our algorithm has attained a high clinical performance. The uniqueness of the texture measure derives from: (1) The usage of multiple resolutions; (2) The inherent enhancement of edges in the appropriate resolutions, through the use of the power coefficient; and by (3) considering the sign of the responses (Eq. (2)).

Previous studies, related to multi-scale approaches, generally performed consecutive segmentation at each resolution [10,11]. These studies used Gaussian distribution functions with different means and variances as a measure for texture at each resolution. Other studies employed different texture measures [10–12], including their incorporation in level-set framework [16,17,23,24]. These texture measures included auto-covariance; mean and variance of different statistical distributions, such as Gaussian and Rayleigh distribution; wavelet decomposition; derivatives vector, and the difference between the intensity of a pixel in and its nearest neighbors. However, none of these algorithms have used a texture measure based on multi-resolution opponent RFs (Section 2.3), and in addition have not enhanced edges at each resolution adaptively (Eq. (2)).

In order to obtain the precise lesion contour and resolve potential edge leakage of the level-set algorithm, we post processed the level-set outcome, instead of using regularization terms. Level-set regularization terms can prevent over segmentation by restricting the contour length, but at the cost of a coarser contour result. Our post processing included morphological opening, which might also impair the accuracy of the contour. However, the results showed that the scale of the outliers′ connections to the lesion region is much smaller than scale of the counter deformations. Thus, the contour accuracy was not compromised.

It is possible that edge leakage could be avoided by employing localized level-set formulation [41], in which segmentation is performed in a local neighborhood around each point of the segmentation contour. However, such a method cannot deal with edge leakage in our case, since the lesion might have unclosed borders, where the appearance of the lesion is very similar to the adjacent healthy tissue.

It is also possible that minimization of the level-set functional by the gradient descent method, which we have used in our research, does not reflect the state-of-the-art minimization approach [42]. Brown and his colleagues [42] suggested a completely convex level-set formulation. However, the global minimum of a convex formulation might differ from one of a non-convex problem. These two minimization approaches, therefore, should be evaluated on medical images and their performance compared.

Our accurate and precise lesion contour has the potential to contribute significantly to the diagnosis of the lesion type, and distinguish whether it is benign or malignant. We can evaluate this potential by calculating the difference between the area enclosed by the convex-hull contour [36] (Section 2.6) and area enclosed by the fine lesion contour ((Eqs. (5)–10) and post-processing, Section 2.5). The rationale for this calculation is derived from the fact that malignant lesions usually have a spiculated shape, while benign lesions often have an elliptical shape with a relatively smooth contour. We therefore predict a larger area difference in the case of malignant abnormalities.

The area difference result for each image in our database is presented in 
                     Fig. 9. Most of the data points obtained for benign images (Green points) have relatively low values for the area difference. However, for malignant cases (Red points), most of the points have higher values, although the variance of the area difference property is larger for malignant than for benign cases.

Statistical evaluation of the area difference property was performed by two procedures: (1) By using a one-tailed student t-test for independent samples, we found that the average area difference for malignant lesions was larger than that for benign lesions, with significance level of P<0.01; (2) For a maximum 5% restriction on misdetection rate of malignant cases, we were able to classify 77% of the benign cases correctly by using only the area difference property. Further work will be needed to include additional lesion properties in order to improve the discrimination performance. This is beyond the scope of this study and will be the subject of future work.

In conclusion, we have presented a novel segmentation scheme based on a new multi-scale texture measure and employing level-set framework. This unique texture measure enabled us to obtain a very accurate segmentation, which has been tested in both engineering and clinical contexts. We have also suggested a new method of clinical evaluation, based on a radiologist׳s corrections of the algorithm-generated segmentation result. Using this suggested evaluation approach, our segmentation algorithm has attained an excellent clinical performance, better than those reported previously. Furthermore, we have shown that the algorithm′s results have the potential to discriminate malignant from benign lesions automatically, more successfully than previously reported.
