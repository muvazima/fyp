                  Inspired by the development of the matrix completion theories and algorithms, a low-rank based motion capture (mocap) data refinement method has been developed, which has achieved encouraging results. However, it does not guarantee a stable outcome if we only consider the low-rank property of the motion data. To solve this problem, we propose to exploit the temporal stability of human motion and convert the mocap data refinement problem into a robust matrix completion problem, where both the low-rank structure and temporal stability properties of the mocap data as well as the noise effect are considered. An efficient optimization method derived from the augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Besides, a trust data detection method is also introduced to improve the degree of automation for processing the entire set of the data and boost the performance. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on both predicting missing data and de-noising.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, with the rapid development of motion capture (mocap) techniques and systems, motion capture data have been widely used in computer games, film production and sport sciences [38,39,42,52]. The great success of animated and animation enhanced feature films Avatar provides a compelling evidence for the values of mocap techniques. However, even with the most expensive commercial mocap systems, there are still instances where noise and missing data are inevitable [1,3,18,21]. Fig. 1
                      presents some real examples captured by ourselves using an optical mocap system. It can be seen that the acquired raw mocap data contains imperfections which should be refined before used for animation production. Thus, an important branch of motion capture research focuses on handling two highly correlated and frequently co-occurred sub-problems: one is to predict the missing values in mocap data and the other is to remove both the noise and outliers. These two sub-problems are collectively referred to as mocap data refinement problem. Meanwhile, the prevalence of some novel yet cheap mocap sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect), which are able to capture human motion in real-time but whose outputs are not very accurate especially when significant occlusions occur, makes the mocap data refinement problem much more pertinent and important [13,45,48,54,60].

Although many researchers have studied this problem and numerous techniques have been proposed to deal with this problem, often the performance and application of these methods are hindered by their inherent drawbacks. For example, the interpolation methods used in some commercial mocap systems such as EVaRT and Vicon are only suitable to deal with the short-time (<0.5s) data missing problem [1]. The data-driven methods often suffer from the out-of-sample problem [4,5,37]. It is not exaggerated to say that the refinement problem is far from being solved and has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years [1,2,4,5,12,19,23,37,47,58].

To handle this problem, a new optimization method is presented to process the input motion clip directly without the support of any motion database. We convert the mocap data refinement problem into a robust matrix completion problem with a smooth constraint. The proposed Temporal Stable and noise robust Matrix Completion (TSMC) model takes into account both the low-rank structure and temporal stability properties of motion data as well as the effect of noise. Additionally, we present an efficient trust data detection method to automate the data processing and boost the performance. The overview of our proposed approach is shown in Fig. 2
                     .

Briefly speaking, our research makes three main contributions:
                        
                           1.
                           We can successfully convert the traditional mocap data refinement problem into a robust matrix completion problem with the smooth constraint and propose a new model to exploit both the low-rank structure and the temporal stability properties of mocap data at the same time.

We present a fast optimization method to solve the derived mathematic model with its convergence guaranteed theoretically.

An efficient trust data detection method is designed to increase the degree of automation for data processing and boost the performance of our model.

In the remainder of this paper, we will first review some closely related work in Section 2. Then the detail of our proposed approach is given in Section 3 with extensive experiments following in Section 4. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.

When motion data is acquired using a mocap system, data refinement is an indispensable subsequent post-process step. More precisely, in this step two sub-problems must be solved: one is to predict the missing values in mocap data and the other is to remove the noise and outliers. These two seemingly separate issues often co-occur in practice, although they have been discussed largely separately in the literature. For the purpose of our discussion, we briefly review some of the closely related work on these two sub-problems.

Due to reasons such as markers falling off or occlusion, the loss of marker information is a frequent challenge in human motion capture. How to predict missing values in mocap data has been studied by many researchers [1,4,17,23,30,31,57,58] in the past twenty years. The interpolation methods are widely used owing to the advantages that they are very fast and easy to implement. However, they are off-line methods and only efficient for handling missing values for a very short period of time, typically less than 
                        
                           0.5
                        
                     
                     s [1]. To overcome these drawbacks, Herda et al. [17] introduced a real-time method using an anatomical human model to predict the position of the markers. It is unfortunately very difficult and time consuming to setup such a model. Aristidou et al. [1] used Kalman Filters to estimate missing markers in real-time without the support of any human model. However, the filtered human motion exhibits visible short latency. Moreover, Kalman Filters may fail when markers are missing or the motion data is corrupted by noise for an extended time period [12]. To discover hidden variables and learn their dynamics, Li et al. [30] built a probabilistic model to estimate the expectation of missing values conditioned on the observed parts. Their next work [31] imposed bone-length constraints in a linear dynamical system (LDS) to boost the performance. The method [31], however, has to rely on the existence of other markers on the same segment to make inter-marker distance measurement possible [4].

Recently, data-driven methods have attracted a lot of attention. Xiao et al. [58] adopted sparse representation to predict the missing values and Baumann et al. [4] fixed missing data via searching poses with a similar marker set from a prior-database and then optimizing an energy minimization function to synthesize the positional data of the missing markers. The shortage of data-driven methods is the out-of-sample problem and they require an additional data preprocessing step which will increase the human labor cost.

The out-of-sample problem will be overcome, if one can refine mocap data without the support of a database. Lai et al. [23] noticed that the low-rank property of mocap data has not been explicitly exploited in the previous work, and they proposed to handle the mocap data refinement problem based on low-rank matrix completion theory and algorithm. The key point of their method is that it does not need any training data. Inspired by [23], our model also takes the low-rank structure property into account. Besides, we include two other properties into our design: the temporal stability and the noise effect. Compared with [23], our model does not only take the low-rank structure property into account but also the temporal stability property of motion data and noise effect. Our proposed model can handle both sub-problems of mocap data refinement at the same time, while in [23] they used two separate models to achieve the same goal. Another significant difference between our model and its counterpart in [23] is that we do not need to guess the standard deviation of the noise which is used for solving the de-noising model in [23]. More importantly, the optimization method for solving our model is much faster and robust than SVT [23], which has been proven both in theory and in experiment [33]. In Section 4, we also have observed that our method is not only faster than the work [23] but also outperforms it in the experiments on both synthetic and real data. Meanwhile, we also notice that two low-rank matrix based methods [19,47] have been proposed almost at the same time as ours following the work [23]. However, both papers [19,47] aim to well use the low-rank property of the trajectory matrix of human motion data by reorganizing mocap data into sequences of trajectory segments. Moreover, they can be used to handle just one sub-problem of mocap data refinement (i.e., predicting missing values), while our method can simultaneously solve both sub-problems.

There are also a lot of research focusing on removing the noise and outliers from mocap data, which is called mocap data de-noising [20,23,24,26,27,37]. Lee and Shin [26] formulated rotation smoothing as a nonlinear optimization problem and iteratively minimized the energy function to smooth the motion. In their later work [27], they proposed a linear time-invariant filtering framework for filtering the orientation data by transforming the orientation data into their analogues in a vector space; applying a time-domain filter on them; and transforming the results back to the orientation space. Lou and her colleagues [37] learned a series of filter bases from prerecorded mocap data and then used them in a robust nonlinear optimization framework to perform mocap data denoising. In [23], Lai et al. simply modified the objective function of SVT [7] by imposing an inequality equation so that it is able to handle the mocap data de-noising problem. However, in their work, the user has to guess the standard deviation of noise, which is difficult in practice. Moreover, only taking the low-rank property into account, the recovered motion is not so stable that some poses will shake. Some corrupted markers cannot be recovered.

                        [43,50]. As we can see from Fig. 3
                        , the top five biggest singular values can well approximate the whole variance in all of the diversity activities. This result suggests that mocap data exhibits a low-rank structure.

Additionally, natural human motion satisfies the temporal stability constraint, i.e., the motion trajectories of markers are smooth most of the time [9,44,49]. As shown in Fig. 4
                        , it is smooth and stable in the direction of frame index (i.e., the temporal direction which is the x-axis in Fig. 4). We believe there are two reasons leading to this situation. One is because that the velocities of each markers are stable in a short period of time. The second reason is that the capture speed of the current commercial mocap systems is very high (more than 60–120fps
                           2
                           Now, the capture speed of Eagle-4 high speed video camera can achieve up to 500fps at

                         is both low-rank (the rank is 2) and temporal stable, even in the case that each markers with different velocities.

Meanwhile, Candès et al. [8] proved that it is possible to recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. If an imperfect motion sequence is refined by matrix completion methods, the result also should be both low-rank and temporally stable. In order to enhance the robustness of our model, we only assume that the noise is sparse in the observed part. It is a weak but reasonable assumption, because the observable data from the current mocap systems usually contain a little amount of noise and outliers. It means only a small percentage of the available data is corrupted. Here we propose a robust low-rank matrix completion model to well exploit the low-rank structure and temporal stability properties of mocap data as follows:

                         are two regularization parameters. In the above model (i.e., Eq. (8)), the first nuclear norm term restricts the refined motion Y to be low-rank, the second term takes the effect of sparse noise into account and the last one incorporates the temporal stability constraint into our model. We call it the Temporal Stable and noise robust Matrix Completion (TSMC) model.

                         and O. As O depends on the dimension of X, it is easy to set. If we know X only contains missing values and some relatively small noise, we can simply set

                         according to these trust data as shown in Fig. 2. In the following part, we propose an efficient method to find out the trust entries in X based on the smoothness property of human motion data in each pose feature dimension, as mentioned earlier.

                         represents a weight assigned to the observed ith entry of x. The main drawback of the penalized least squares regression models is their sensitivity to the outliers. We should choose robust weighting functions to minimize or cancel the side effects of the outliers. Several weighting functions are available to achieve this goal, such as the bisquare weight function [14,16] and the Welsch robust function [37] and so on. In order to mitigate the effect of noise and outliers, we define G as follows:

                        Indeed, the above low-rank matrix completion problem Eq. (21) can be efficiently solved via many algorithms such as the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm [34,55], the SVT algorithm [7] and the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm [33]. In [33], the authors have compared all of these algorithms and demonstrated that the ALM algorithm is much faster than the other methods and its precision is also higher [33]. More importantly, the ALM algorithm has a pleasing Q-linear convergence speed. Therefore, we adopt the ALM algorithm to solve the above objective functions. And, the corresponding augmented Lagrange function is

We have conducted several experiments on two mocap datasets to show the effectiveness of our method. The first one is the CMU mocap dataset
                           5

                         which contains a huge collection of mocap data. We pick out 12 motion sequences from 8 subjects
                           6
                           The selected subjects include

                         including multiple types of actions such as walk, jump, run, boxing, and tai chi. Because data from CMU dataset are very clean and complete [37], we used them in the synthetic experiments. In order to test for real applications, we captured 3 long motion sequences using Motion Analysis Eagle-4 Digital RealTime System
                           7

                           7
                         and these data consists of three daily actions (i.e., walk, run and jump) and the total frame number is 3178. Different from the CMU dataset, our own captured motion sequences naturally contains incomplete and noisy data as shown in Fig. 1.

Our method does not need the support of databases. To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it with the other four methods: Linear interpolation (Linear), Spline interpolation (Spline), Dynammo [30] and SVT [23]. The first two are widely used in practice and the third and fourth are two state-of-the-art methods. For Linear and Spline, we combine them with a Gaussian filter to handle the de-noising problem. In particular, we first use the Gaussian filter to remove the noise and then use a simple threshold method to find out the clear entries, and finally apply these two interpolation methods based on the detected entries to predict and correct the noise entries. This way, all methods can handle both of the two sub-problems of the mocap data refinement problem and can make a fair comparison. To quantify the refined results, following the work [4,19,30,47,51,58], the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) measurement is adopted:

Since it is at most about 30–40% of the data is missing or noisy in practice [29], we fix the ratio of the missing or noisy data to 30–40% to evaluate all the algorithms. Using the selected 12 motion sequences, we systematically simulate four classical situations to synthesize four different kinds of corrupted data, which are listed as follows.
                           
                              
                                 Randomly lose data. In this case, we randomly removed 
                                    
                                       40
                                       %
                                    
                                  data from each sequence, so that both the missing markers number and missing time are random.


                                 Regularly lose data. Different from the first case, we regularly removed about 
                                    
                                       30
                                       %
                                    
                                  data wherein the number of selected missing markers is fixed to 10 for each incomplete frame and each selected markers miss 60 frames. Thus some long gaps appear in the motion sequence under such condition.


                                 Randomly corrupt data. To evaluate the de-noising capability, we randomly added gaussian noise (
                                    
                                       σ
                                       =
                                       2
                                    
                                 ) on 
                                    
                                       30
                                       %
                                    
                                  data for each motion sequence.


                                 Mixed corrupt data. In this case, we randomly remove 
                                    
                                       30

                                  data and then corrupt 
                                    
                                       30
                                       %
                                    
                                  of the observed part data with gaussian noise (
                                    
                                       σ
                                       =

                                 ), so these data can be used to simultaneously evaluate the prediction and de-noising capability of all the methods.

Note that we add noise on the original motion data recorded in the ASF

                         We use the above generated data to evaluate the prediction and de-noising capability of each algorithm. In order to investigate the proposed trust data detection method, we compare the performance of TSMC with and without the step of trust data detection using the mixed corrupted data. The experimental results are shown in Figs. 6–10
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         one by one. From these evaluation results, we obtain the following conclusions:
                           
                              •
                              From Figs. 6–9, we can see that our method outperforms all competitors not only in predicting missing values but also in de-noising most of the time. More importantly, the variance of RMSE obtained by our proposed TSMC is relatively small, which means that the outcomes of our method are very stable. We believe the reason is that our model does not only exploit the low-rank structure, but also the temporal stability property. Moreover, the trust data detection method boosts the performance of our method as shown in Fig. 10.

SVT [23] and our method are much more suitable to handle long sequences (e.g., boxing and tai chi sequences in Fig. 7(k) and (i)) than short sequences (e.g., run and walk sequences in Fig. 7(a) and (b)).

Linear and Spline methods are suitable for handling short time randomly missing data as Fig. 6. However they are unable to handle long time data missing as Fig. 7 and the special case that the missing data appears at the end of a sequence as Fig. 7(g)–(i).

Dynammo [30] works very well in handling periodic actions such as walking and running. However, it will corrupt when the noise increases or some data are randomly missing as Figs. 6 and 8.

We also have evaluated all of these methods using our own captured three long sequences of mocap data. In these mocap data, some markers are missing for a long period of time and what is more serious is that some missing markers appear at the end. Fig. 11
                         shows the refinement results using different methods. As mentioned above, Spline and Linear methods are only suitable for short-time data missing so they are easy to fail under such a condition. When the missing markers appear at the end, both linear and spline method are unable to correctly predict the missing values as shown in Fig. 11. Some markers predicted by these two methods deviate significantly from the correct positions due to lack of control points at the end of the motion data. SVT [23] only exploits the low-rank structure of motion data and cannot handle the cases where markers are missing for a long period of time. From the last two columns of each sub-image in Fig. 11, the shortcoming of SVT [23] is shown that it is unable to correctly predict some missing values. Relatively speaking, we find that Dynammo [30] offers the best performance for all the three motion sequences. However, when some markers are missing for a long period of time, Dynammo [30] also fails to correctly predict the missing values. As shown in the last sub-image of Fig. 11(c), one head marker predicted by Dynammo [30] drifts a little away due to the reason that this marker is missing for a long period of time at the end of the motion data. With exploiting both the low-rank structure and temporal stability of motion data, our method works demonstrates the robustness on all three real sequences.

                        . From Fig. 12
                         we see that 
                           
                              α

                         are insensitive for a large range. Thus we simply set 
                           
                              α

                              =
                              
                                 
                                    10

                         in our experiments. More importantly, our method is faster than Dynammo [30] and SVT [23] most of the time as shown in Fig. 13
                        . Meanwhile, one can notice that our method takes up more time than SVT [23] in two human activities: boxing and basketball. This may appear contradicting to our early claim that our method was much faster and robust than SVT [23]. To demystify this inconsistency, we find that SVT [30] convergences too early in handling a large-scale imperfect human motion matrix in these two cases where the total frame numbers are 4840 and 4905. Therefore in Fig. 9(k) and (f), SVT [30] is unable to correctly refine such a large-scale motion data, as opposed to our method, as shown in Fig. 9(k) and (f), which demonstrates the robustness of our method.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Motion capture data typically consists of imperfection elements, such as noise and missing makers. Cleaning up the imperfect data is known as the mocap data refinement. A lot of research efforts have been made to automate this process. In this paper we have made the following contributions towards solving the problem: presented a new method making full use of both the low-rank structure and temporal stability properties of the motion data and convert it into a matrix completion problem; developed a fast optimization method derived from the ALM algorithm to solve the proposed model; presented an efficient trust data detection method to automate data processing and boost the computation performance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed technique.

However, in the current development, the foot contact with the ground has not been taken into account, which may sometimes lead to feet sliding. Fortunately, this issue has been well investigated [22,25,46]. Since human motion data contains strong structural information, we would like to incorporate the human skeleton information into our proposed model in the future. In addition, techniques such as key-frame reduction [35,40,41,59] and motion data segmentation techniques [36,61] allow human motion data to be dealt with considering the specific features, which can be used with our framework to further improve the speed of our algorithm.
