                  We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is responsible for periodic somitogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is one of the main regulators of various cellular functions, and switching of various oscillating states by investigating p53–Wnt model. The variation in Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin2 concentration in Wnt could able to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and GSK3 interaction rate, due to hypothetical catalytic reaction or external stimuli, can able to regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control their dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     p53, one of the largest hub in cellular network (Collavin et al., 2010; Oren et al., 2002), is considered to be one of the most important key regulators of cellular metabolic pathways (Itahana et al., 2001; Vogelstein et al., 2000), regulates a number of cellular functions (Agarwal et al., 1998) and its dynamics control even the fate of the cell when stress is given to the cell (Purvis et al., 2012). Further, p53 suppression is observed in various types of cancer either due to mutations or by ambiguous expression of control systems like MDM2 (or HDM2 its human equivalent) (Lowe et al., 2004). p53 is negatively regulated by the MDM2 (Momand et al., 2000), and MDM2 functions as an E3 ligase which mediates the proteosomic degradation of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Honda et al., 1997), facilitates the diffusion of p53 in the nucleus (Kobet et al., 2000), which in turn lowers the level of p53 within the cell (Oliner et al., 1992). In stressed cells, the p53 triggers the cell to cell cycle arrest forcing it to choose its fate, either to repair or apoptosis (Chen et al., 1996; Haupt et al., 1996; Arora et al., 2013).


                     p53 dynamics is regulated by various signaling molecules as evident from various experimental and theoretical reports (Oren, 2003). One of the most important inhibitor of p53–MDM2 is nutlin (Shangary and Wang, 2009). It is a selective small molecule which directly binds to binding pocket of MDM2 (Momand et al., 1992), to activate p53 pathway (Momand et al., 1992; Vassilev et al., 2004), and inhibiting p53 binding to MDM2 (Logan et al., 2007). Nutlin
                     −3a and 3b are the two most active enantiomorphs that are found to up-regulate the p53 in p53 dependent manner i.e. Nutlins (3a and 3b) allows to increase the response or activation of p53 pathways (Villalonga-Planells et al., 2011). Further, it is also demonstrated that Nutlin-3 induces anti-angiogenic activities in endothelial cells probably via three mechanisms; first by inhibiting endothelial cell migration; second by inducing cell cycle arrest; and third by increasing apoptotic tendency in endothelial cells (Binder, 2007). Further, it was also shown that Nutlin-3 treatment in these cells leads to accumulation of p53 (Lee et al., 2013), indicating the important impacts of Nutlin-3 which interferences the p53–MDM2 regulatory mechanism. As a consequence, it was shown that Nutlin-3 stabilizes the p53 dynamics and causes the activation of survival pathways (Lee et al., 2013).

Somitogenesis in vertebrates is periodic formation of somites (vertabrae precursors) in the anterior presomitic mesoderm tissue (PSM) controlled by complex gene network known as segmentation clock (Aulehla and Pourquie, 2008), where, Notch, Wnt pathways (Gibb et al., 2009, 2010) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are the main components (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008). Further, it has been shown that these three main pathways generate rhythms of specific oscillation relationships (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008), and cross-talk among them (Dequeant et al., 2006) as a basis of spatio-temporal self-organization of patterns during somitogenesis (Pourquie, 2003). This physiological oscillations is responsible for periodic spacing of somites, dynamic structures and regular segmented development in vertebrates (Pourquie, 2003). In some studies in normal (stress) and cancerous cells, it has been reported that p53 and Wnt modules are being coupled and cross-talk between them via different intermediate proteins or genes or signaling molecules (Peng et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2012). The studies also reported that p53 network suppresses the Wnt signaling cascade (Kim et al., 2011). The Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role in determination of cell fate, which may probably through p53 interaction (Kim et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2012), but still it is not clear yet. Further, several other works reported that the intercellular signaling of Wnt depends on the β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3) (Tauriello and Maurice, 2010). Moreover, p53 can regulate the dynamics of Axin2 and GSK3 (Kim et al., 2013). Recently, it is also reported that the miR
                     −34 family, which is directly transcribed by the p53, links p53 with Wnt signaling (Cha et al., 2012), in this process, and a set of GSK3-related Wnt genes, are directly targeted by p53 and miR
                     −34. These observations clearly suggest the close connection between the p53 functionalities and Wnt in stress and cancer cells (Peng et al., 2014; Cha et al., 2012). However, the way how p53 interacts with Wnt during somitogenesis and its impact on somite organization/reorganization at molecular level is still an open question.


                     GSK3, which is an important coupling molecule between p53 and Wnt pathways, is widely expressed in broad range of cellular processes and being a Ser/Thr kinase it is a multifunctional protein (Doble and Woodgett, 2003; Woodgett, 2001). It is active under resting condition and act as a core regulator in various disease pathways like cancer (Doble and Woodgett, 2003). Being a kinase, it confers selectivity and substrate specificity (Doble and Woodgett, 2003). It also largely acts as a phosphorylating and an important signaling agent for the degradation of large number of proteins, such as β-catenin in Wnt pathway (Aberle et al., 1997). Further, it is a central player in Wnt signaling pathway recruited with the Axin2 at the Frizzle receptor for the activation of Wnt signaling (Nakamura et al., 1998). In absence of Wnt signals GSK3 shows its activity in the protein destruction complex with Axin2, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and other partners mediating the destruction and phosphorylation of β-catenin (Taelman et al., 2010). GSK3 also mediates p53 dependent apoptosis signaling by suppressing p53-AKT pathway. The role GSK3 as a mediator of p53 and Wnt cross-talk is not fully understood. The impact of other Wnt regulators in Wnt pathway and how they regulate p53 dynamics, and vice versa, are needed to be investigated in order to understand how segmentation clock works.

Previous model have not yet modeled the effect of synthetic molecule (like nutlin3a) on the coupling of p53 and Wnt oscillator together. They have only accessed the external stimulus using Dsh via Wnt as surface receptor. We have provided the external stress from Nutlin
                     −3a. Our model also throws some light the control of p53 oscillator on intoxication created by the β-catenin inside cell during somatogenesis. Our model for the first time couples the effect of p53 on affiliated β-catenin degradation via Gsk3, β-catenin to decrease toxicity in the cells. Since wnt is the key player in the recruitment of many other down regulated proteins or molecules like Axin2 and GSK3 and not much is known about its regulation experimentally So, We have tried to figure out the interaction of two oscillators via GSK3. Since we want to focus on somatogenesis. Our model gives an understanding of the underlying process of somite formation and also the regulation of the two oscillator to get information on pattern recognition.

We study the coupling of Wnt oscillator which is one of the three important clocks in somitogenesis in vertebrates and p53 regulatory network to understand how does these two oscillators regulates each other and process information during somite formation and pattern organization. Since p53 interferes various other cellular functions, it will be interesting to understand its regulating impacts on segmentation clock and vice versa. Presently we study these phenomena by modeling this p53–Wnt two oscillator model with updated interaction between them from various experimental reports and how do they regulate each other. We organize our work as follows. The detailed description of the model and techniques is provided in materials and methods section. It is followed by mathematical treatment of the model, the numerical simulation results and its discussion in the next section. We then draw come conclusions based on the results we obtained and discussion on it.

The Wnt signaling pathway is authorized by β-catenin regulation via various intermediate interaction steps (Fig. 1
                        ) (Logan et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2010). In this signal processing, Wnt promotes the synthesis of Dishevelled (Dsh) protein, and then inhibits GSK3 protein kinase (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008). GSK3, then interacts with Axin2 (with rate constant K
                        1 and K
                        2 for forward and backward reactions as in Fig. 1) in the presence of β-catenin to form transient complex which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin into β-catenin-P (with rate constant K
                        6) (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008; Jensen et al., 2010). The β-catenin-P degraded quickly with rate constant K
                        14, on the other hand it is dephosphorylated with rate constant K
                        11 to form free β-catenin and then degraded with a rate constant K
                        13 (Clevers, 2006). The free β-catenin is then transported to nucleus (β-catenin-n) with rate constant K
                        4, on the other hand β-catenin-n is transported from nucleus to cytoplasm with another rate constant K
                        5. Then β-catenin-n promotes the transcription of set of target genes including mAxin2 (mRNA of Axin2, specifically homolog Axin2 in PSM tissue) at the rate constant K
                        15, with rate constant K
                        16, and mAxin2 also degrades with a rate constant K
                        18 (Huelsken and Behrens, 2002). On the other hand mAxin2 translates to Axin2 with a rate constant k
                        22, Axin2 protein which also degrades with a rate constant K
                        23. This mechanism of Axin2 is just like a negative feedback loop which drives the oscillations in the network components. Thus Axin2 is the essential target of the Wnt pathway because it inhibits the Wnt signals by degrading the β-catenin by forming a negative feedback loop (Wang et al., 2013).

The Wnt pathway communicates with the p53 oscillator (Proctor and Gray, 2008; Alam et al., 2013; Devi et al., 2015) through GSK3 by formation of a binary complex p53–GSK3 with the free available p53 at the rate constant k
                        39. Then this complex p53–GSK3 dissociates at the rate constant k
                        40 to the free p53 and GSK3 proteins (Proctor and Gray, 2010). p53 and MDM2 regulate each other with feedback mechanism where formation and decay of various intermediate complexes are involved with different rate constant (Fig. 1) as described in Tables 1 and 2
                        
                         (Proctor and Gray, 2008). The freely synthesized Nutlin directly interacts with MDM2 with a rate constant k
                        36 to form a complex Nut
                        _
                        MDM2, and then this complex dissociates to release back free Nutlin and MDM2. Then Nutlin indirectly interacts with p53 via MDM2 by affecting the feedback mechanism between p53 and MDM2. The Nutlin then degrades with rate constant k
                        38. Thus the activated p53 can now go to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of a number of target genes including MDM2. MDM2 is essential in controlling the concentration of p53 through a positive feedback loop mechanism by making complex (Chickarmane et al., 2005; Lahav et al., 2004).

                        The coupled ODEs (Eq. (1)) are very difficult to solve analytically. However, one can get approximate analytical solution of these equations by using quasi-steady state approximation (Murray, 2003; Schauer and Heinrich, 1983). In general, any biochemical reactions network involves two basic types of reaction, namely slow and fast reactions (Murray, 2003). Therefore, the N
                        =13 variables in the system can be divided into sets of slow and fast variables respectively. If

                        Since the rate constant of complex formation is fast, and after this fast complex formation, the fast variables immediately retain steady state (equilibrium). Then using Henri–Michaelis–Menten–Briggs–Haldane approximation (Pedersen et al., 2007), one can take quite fair assumption that the ODEs of variables of complex molecular species reach steady state equilibrium quite fast compared with the time evolution of slow variables (Murray, 2003). Then one can straight forward put,

We used standard Runge–Kutta method (order 4) of numerical integration to simulate Eq. (1) to find the solution of the variables listed in Table 1 for the parameter values given in Table 2. We then analysed the constructed mathematical model to get possible approximate analytical solutions of the variables (slow variables) using quasi-steady state approximation.

The cross talk between p53 and Wnt via Gsk3 subjected to different stress conditions induced by Nutlin
                     −3a, as well as Axin2 concentrations available in the system. In order to understand how they regulate each other, we numerically simulated the coupled ordinary differential equations (1) with the parameters listed in Table 2. The simulation results for the variable in the model are presented and compared to understand the switching of different oscillating states induced by different stress conditions. The reason is that these states of the oscillations in Wnt network are responsible for different behavior of regular somite formation, and many other periodic phenomena during somitogenesis. The roles of Axin2, Gsk3, β-catenin and Nutlin on the p53 network dynamics is discussed in the context of the model we presented. Further, the signal processing between the two coupled network modules via the GSK3 during somitogenesis is studied under the stress p53 generating effect due to Nutlin
                     −3a. On the other hand, we also studied the regulation of p53 by Wnt due to available Axin2 concentration in the system.

The p53 in p53 regulatory network can be induced stress by the available concentration of stress inducer molecular species, Nutlin
                        −3a. The concentration level of Nutlin
                        −3a is proportional to the creation rate constant of Nutlin
                        −3a, k
                        35 (Fig. 1). Therefore, computationally we can able to monitor the amount of stress induced to p53 by changing the value of parameter k
                        35 and supervising the dynamical behavior of p53 (Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        ).

The dynamics of p53 (Fig. 2 upper left panels) for small values of k
                        35(k
                        35〈0.07) show single spike due to sudden stress, and due to small k
                        35 values, the dynamics become stabilized indicating normal nature of the system. Then, as the value of k
                        35 increases, p53 dynamics show damped oscillation indicating the inducing oscillation for certain interval of time (t
                        ≈[0, 4000]min for k
                        35
                        =0.18), and then its dynamics become stabilized. The time interval of damped oscillation regime depends on the value of k
                        35 and increases as k
                        35. This indicates that if the stress given to the system is small, the system first will go to the stress or excited state (indicated by oscillatory behavior), repair back the changes in the system and come back to the normal condition. For sufficiently large values of k
                        35(0.23≤
                        k
                        35
                        ≤0.55) the p53 dynamics become sustain oscillation, where the responsed stress is optimal and sustains the stress for t→∞. Further increase in the value of k
                        35(k
                        35
                        >0.55) force the sustain oscillation of p53 to damped oscillation whose time interval of damped oscillation decreases as k
                        35 increases. This indicates that excess stress in p53 due to Nutlin
                        −3a may become toxic to the system reflected in p53 dynamics. If we increase the value of k
                        35(k
                        35
                        >1.3) the p53 dynamics become stabilized. This may probably the case of apoptosis of the system. The results obtained are in consistent with the experimental observations which indicates that acetylation of p53 is responsible for its activation and stabilization (Gu and Roeder, 1997). If we further increase the value of k
                        35, p53 activation decreases maintaining p53 stability, but at higher values (≤35).

The two dimensional plots between p53 and Nutlin
                        −3a (Fig. 2 upper right panels) for different values of k
                        35 show different behaviors of the system, namely stable fixed point, damped oscillation towards a fixed point, sustain oscillation, then damped and stabilized fixed point. This behaviors show the same behaviors as shown in p53 dynamics for different values of k
                        35.

Similarly, we study the dynamics of GSK3 as a function of k
                        35 (Fig. 2 lower left panels) for corresponding values which we took for the case of p53. In this case also we found the similar behaviors as we got in p53 case (Fig. 2), namely, stabilized, damped, sustain, then damped and stabilized states for the corresponding values of k
                        35 taken in p53 case. The two dimensional plots of GSK3 and Nutlin
                        −3a (Fig. 2 lower right hand panels) show the evidence of the existence of the mentioned states.

Now we study the dynamics of Axin2 (Fig. 3 upper left panel) imparted by stress p53 via GSK3 induced by Nutlin
                        −3a concentration in the system. The signal of the stress p53 is processed by Axin2 via GSK3 and reflected the same states in Axin2 dynamics as obtained in p53. The Axin2 and β
                        −
                        Catenin dynamics as a function of k
                        35, as well as two dimensional plots of these two molecules with Nutlin
                        −3a are similar qualitatively with the dynamics of stress p53 and GSK3 (Figs. 2 and 3). This means that depending on the values of k
                        35 the stress p53 can able to generate and arrest the Axin2 and β
                        −
                        Catenin cycles. Thus the dynamics of Axin2 and β
                        −
                        Catenin can be regulated by p53 and probably can control the Wnt oscillator. This means that p53 regulation has strong impact on Wnt oscillation, and regulate various mechanisms during somitogenesis.

The activation of Axin2 occurs after the Gsk initiation from the signal received at the membrane. The Nutlin synthesis rate constant (k
                        35) is kept constant in this case (k
                        35
                        =0.36), giving a slight stress to the system. In order to understand how does Wnt oscillator regulate p53, we allow to change Axin2 synthesis rate constant k
                        22 and see the dynamical behavior of p53 induced by Axin2, which is one of the most important molecular species in Wnt network module. The dynamics of the Axin2 and p53 for different values of k
                        22 (Fig. 4
                        ). For small values of k
                        22(k
                        22
                        <0.0002), Axin2 dynamics maintains lowest constant level, showing stabilized state of the Axin2 dynamics (Fig. 4 lower left panels). The increase in the value of k
                        22 allows the Axin2 dynamics to switch from stabilized state to damped state for certain range of time and then become stabilized. The co-existence of these two states (damped and stabilized states) takes place for a certain range on k
                        22(0.0003<
                        k
                        22
                        <0.008). If we increase the value of k
                        22, the duration of damped oscillation also increases. The switching of damped state to sustain oscillation state takes place for certain range of k
                        22, 0.0087<
                        k
                        22
                        <0.015. Further increase in k
                        22 force the sustain oscillation state to damped oscillation state again, where the time interval of damped oscillation becomes smaller as k
                        22 increases. If we increase k
                        22 value, then Axin2 dynamics landed to stabilized state.

We then show the dynamics of β- Catenin as a function of k
                        22 (Fig. 4) which indicates the switching of the three different states driven by k
                        22. In this case we could able to find sustain oscillation very quickly indicating that the β-Catenin can be quickly switch to stress condition and easily. Similarly, β-Catenin can reach second stabilized state (probably cycle arrest) quickly and easily as compared to other molecular species. The dynamical behavior of β-Catenin is supported by two dimensional plots of β-Catenin and Axin (Fig. 3 middle right panels) which exhibit fixed point oscillations (corresponding to two stabilized states), attractor towards the stable fixed points (corresponding to two damped oscillations), limit cycle (corresponding to sustain oscillation).

Wnt signaling cascade target Axin2 directly (Jho et al., 2002). Further Axin2 gene is expressed by increasing the pool of Axin2 proteins (Robey et al., 1996) allowing transcribed population of Axin2
                           m
                        
                        RNA and translated population of Axin2 protein highly unstable. This engaged interaction cause the periodic switching of Wnt signaling between active and inactive states. If the pool of Axin2 is abundantly available, then this periodicity will probably be sustain causing periodic formation of somite formation. However, if the Axin2 available is small or excess, the dynamics become damped which affect the periodic somite formation leading to different diseases which may cause in periodicity in the bone formation. These changes will drastically affect in the p53 dynamics also causing in different states. And even axcess Axin2 population can trigger apoptosis. We have updated the changes wherever it is needed in the revised manuscript.

Now the dynamics of p53 as a function of k
                        22 (Fig. 4 upper left panel) show that the patterns in the dynamics of molecular species in Wnt oscillator are well captured in the p53 dynamics. The p53 dynamics exhibit the corresponding states, namely, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, as observed in Axin2 and β-Catenin as a function of k
                        22 with similar patterns and dynamics.

The important dynamical behaviors those have been captured in p53 dynamics due to change of states in molecular species in Wnt oscillator are synchronous in states and time periods of dynamics. If we look at the dynamics of Axin2 and β-Catenin as a function of k
                        22, we can easily observe two important changes, (1) change in time period of oscillations of the molecular species, and (2) change in the pattern of states. The increase in k
                        22 force to decrease the time period of the Axin2 and β-Catenin dynamics. At the same time the switching of the various states takes place. These changes in the Axin2 and β-Catenin are systematically and synchronously well captured in qualitative sense in the p53 dynamics (Fig. 4) during the communication of the two p53 and Wnt oscillators via GSK3.

We now study the impact of interaction of GSK3 and p53(k
                        39) on Wnt and p53 cross talk driven by Nutlin concentration level in the system (Fig. 5
                        ). The rate of interaction of p53 and GSK3 can modulated by external catalytic action or external stimuli regulating the interaction in the system.

We calculated amplitudes of four molecular species Axin2, β−Catenin, GSK3 and p53 as a function of k
                           35 for five different values of k
                           39 (Fig. 5 upper two rows). The amplitudes of the molecular species for every values of k
                           35 are calculated by averaging the amplitudes within the interval of time [100,1500]min. From the results we observe three different regimes for each value of k
                           39: first amplitude death (AD) regime (for small k
                           35); second finite amplitude or oscillation regime (OR) (for moderate k
                           35); and third amplitude death regime again (for large k
                           35). The first AD regime may correspond to normal state (stable state) of the system, and second AD regime may correspond to apoptosis (cycle arrest) of the system. Further, we calculated maximum values of molecular species Axin2, β-Catenin, GSK3 and p53 for the corresponding values taken above (Fig. 6
                            lower two rows of plots). The patterns obtained in these plots are similar to the patterns of the amplitude plots of the corresponding molecular species.

In OR, the amplitude is finite and increases monotonically as a function of k
                           35, then reaches a maximum amplitude, after which amplitude decreases slowly and then decreases monotonically. This is the regime where the system is in activated or stress condition. It is also to be noted that as k
                           39 increases the amplitude also increases and the range of activated regime also increases. This means that increasing k
                           39 force the system to get activated quickly and protects the system from next stabilized regime (cycle arrest or apoptosis regime). Therefore, even though increase in Nutlin concentration drives the system to apoptosis regime quickly, one can modulate the interaction of p53 and GSK3 to protect the system from apoptosis upto significant range of Nutlin concentration level, so that the system can repair back from toxic due to excess Nutlin to come back to normal condition.

Now we study the impact of p53 and GSK3 interaction on the condition of activation of molecular species of both the p53 and Wnt oscillators. We calculated the amplitudes of these molecular species as a function of Axin2 concentration level in the system (k
                           22) (Fig. 6 first two rows) for the same parameter values as we had taken in the case of calculation of amplitudes of these molecular species with the variation of Nutlin concentration in the system. For the same parameter values we also calculated the maxima of these molecular species (Fig. 6 lower two rows).

The change in k
                           22 drives the amplitudes of all the molecular species to different oscillation states (AD, OR, AD) as we have obtain in the case of Wnt cycle arrest by k
                           35 variation. The increase in Axin2 concentration level in the system forces amplitudes of the molecular species variables to pass the trajectories of first AD (normal condition), then OR (stress condition) and then second AD (cycle arrest condition). However, in this case the amplitudes of the variables do not change much as a function k
                           22, but significant change in the range of second AD as a function of k
                           39. The results indicate the Axin2 induced p53 cycle arrest, however, interaction of p53 and GSK3 can able to protect the system from apoptosis upto significant range of k
                           22 so that the system can repair back to its normal condition.

Since the direct and exact analytical solution of the set of coupled nonlinear differential equations (1), we used quasi steady state approximation (Murray, 2003; Schauer and Heinrich, 1983) to obtain approximation solution of the system.

                        1 becomes constant (steady state) as t→∞. However, x

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The cross talk between p53 and Wnt oscillators can influence each other such that the dynamics one oscillator can regulate the dynamics of the other and vice versa. The concentration level of Nutlin can drive the p53 network module to different oscillating states corresponding to different stress states of the system. This changes in the oscillating states can be well communicated to Wnt network module via GSK3 and could able to regulate the Wnt functionalities. Further, this changes can well interfere and give impact on the process of somitogenesis of Wnt network module. On the other hand, the available concentration level of Axin2 in Wnt network module can also influence the dynamics of molecular species variables in Wnt network module at different stress states. Then the information of these changes is well process by the p53 network module via GSK3 and capture the changes accordingly. This means that the p53 and Wnt network modules can cross talk between them and regulate each other due to changes in each oscillator by processing information between them. However, excess changes in each network module can act as toxic to each module and arrest the cycle of the other, and vice versa.

We then demonstrate that any other changes in the regulation of the network module, may probably by catalytic reaction or external stimuli which alters the rate constant of the reaction of a particular reaction, can probably try to protect the system from apoptosis upto certain range of system's condition within which the system can repair back the changes to come back to normal condition. We attempt to numerically demonstrate this phenomena by allowing the change in the rate constant of p53 and GSK3 interaction and clearly give a chance to both the p53 and Wnt network modules upto certain range of excess concentration levels of Nutlin and Axin2 to protect themselves from cycle arrest, namely apoptosis. This means that one important role of catalytic reaction and external stimuli (which do not affect the reactions and network but rate constant of reactions) is to protect the system from apoptosis or system's failure by giving a chance of repair the failure or defect by itself within the system automatically. Therefore, we need to find out various such reactions and stimuli in cellular network in order to control and prevent the cell from cell death, due to cellular breakdown by diseases or other external mechanisms, by regulating these important reactions and stimuli.
