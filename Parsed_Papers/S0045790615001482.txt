                  We propose a new optical reconfigurable Network-on-Chip (NoC), named ReFaT ONoC (Reconfigurable Flat and Tree Optical NoC). ReFaT is a dynamically reconfigurable architecture, which customizes the topology and routing paths based on the application characteristics. ReFaT, as an all-optical NoC, routes optical packets based on their wavelengths. For this purpose, we propose a novel architecture for the optical switch, which eliminates the need for optical resource reservation, and thus avoids the corresponding latency and area overheads. As a key idea for dynamic reconfiguration, each application is mapped to a specific set of wavelengths and utilizes its dedicated routing algorithm. We compare the proposed reconfigurable optical NoC with traditional electrical NoCs, as well as non-reconfigurable optical NoCs in terms of data transmission delay, power consumption, and energy dissipation. The simulation results show that on average, ReFaT reduces power and energy consumption by 54.75% and 40%, respectively, compared to the non-reconfigurable ONoC.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With advances in semiconductor technology in recent years, current multi-core systems-on-chip (SoCs) have rapidly grown in size and complexity. Future SoCs will consist of complex integrated components communicating with each other at very high rates. The microprocessor industry has moved from single-core to multi-core and eventually will lead to many-core architectures containing tens to hundreds of identical cores arranged as chip multiprocessors (CMPs) [1]. The lack of scalability in bus-based systems-on-chip, large area overhead and unpredictability of electrical parameters for point-to-point dedicated links in multi-core SoCs have motivated researchers to propose packet-switched network-on-chip [2]. However, traditional NoC architectures cannot continue to satisfy future requirements such as bandwidth and latency within the package power budget [1,3].

Since power dissipation is an important issue in NoCs, capability of on-chip optical interconnects in power reduction has introduced optical interconnects as an excellent candidate for transmitting data. This structure is a physical approach and novel technology solution with high transmission capacity, low power consumption, low latency and low crosstalk [4,5]. Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC), as a novel solution, provides low power dissipation that remains independent of data capacity and distance, as well as wavelength parallelism, ultra-high throughput, and minimal access latencies. Hence, low propagation loss in optical switching elements [6] and bit rate transparency [7] of optical on-chip interconnection make ONoCs attractive as a high-bandwidth, low-power, and low-latency interconnection network in Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs).

In application-specific multi-core SoCs, application-specific optimization is one of the most effective approaches to provide optimal conditions across a range of applications, and bridge the exiting gap between the current and the ideal NoC in terms of power/performance metrics [8]. This method of optimization tries to customize the architecture of an ONoC for a target application in the case where the application and its traffic characteristics have been specified at design time. However, recent technology advances try to map different applications onto a single SoC as a cost effective approach. Since different applications have different functionalities, interconnection networks for this highly complex SoCs should closely match the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of different target applications. Consequently, an ONoC that is customized to run one application will not meet the constraints of other applications. By considering dynamic behavior of an on-chip traffic pattern, reconfigurable communication architectures are inevitable to fully utilize network resources for various communication requirements.

In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable ONoC whose topology changes dynamically to efficiently route various traffic patterns. Specifically, the proposed architecture can be reconfigured either as flat-based or tree-based networks with negligible area overhead. Our proposed architecture, named as ReFaT ONoC (Reconfigurable Flat/Tree Optical Network-on-Chip), customizes the network topology and routing algorithm based on the communication requirements. As well, passive routing is adopted in the proposed photonic architecture, which is performed by routing optical data streams based on their wavelengths. Utilizing wavelength routing method, ReFaT ONoC eliminates the need for optical resource reservation at the intermediate nodes, and thus avoids the corresponding latency and area overheads. Moreover, passive micro-architecture of the proposed optical switch reduces energy consumption and power dissipation, compared to non-reconfigurable architectures, and it also provides the ability to implement multiple Butterfly networks simultaneously. ReFaT utilizes wavelength division multiplexing scheme to support simultaneous unicast and multicast data transmission.

In summary, we make the following contributions in this paper:
                           
                              •
                              We introduce an application-based reconfigurable Optical NoC which dynamically configures the optical network under various traffic patterns.

ReFaT can be extended to map various flat-based and tree based topologies.

ReFaT architecture facilitates simultaneous multicast and unicast data transmissions.

Compared to non-reconfigurable topologies, ReFaT improves power and energy efficiency under various traffic patterns.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the proposed reconfigurable data plane for optical NoCs. In Section 3, we describe the control plane. Section 4 explores the developed simulation environment. In Section 5, we present our experimental results and compare the proposed architecture with alternative optical on-chip architectures. Related work is reviewed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and presents the future work.

The selected topology for optical network-on-chip plays an important role in the performance of ONoC, and addresses some key issues in design of on-chip networks, as well. These critical issues, such as node degree, planner layout, scalability, and symmetry, have considerable effects in the simplicity of the photonic switch as well as its implementation cost.

Most recent optical networks are built upon traditional topologies such as Mesh, Torus, Fat-Tree, Butterfly and Spidergon while each of them optimizes the network performance under a limited range of traffic patterns. For example, the n-dimensional mesh is the most popular direct topology which is best suited for the planar, regular layout of the CMPs. In this regard, most recent optical NoC architectures have been implemented on top of Mesh or Torus topologies [1]. In addition to their simple layout, these topologies provide a good tradeoff between network diameter, connectivity, and area requirements for on-chip network architectures. On the other hand, tree-based topologies, such as butterfly, are excellent in huge data transform and clustering operations. These kinds of topologies are widely used in applications such as Fast Fourier Transform due to their small diameter [9–11].

Since well-designed NoCs are required to run a wide range of applications, the proposed architecture should enable runtime reconfiguration according to the dynamic behavior of the traffic pattern. This paper proposes a new application-based ONoC which can be dynamically reconfigured either as flat-based or tree-based networks with negligible area overhead.

Schematically, an N-node ReFaT topology is implemented as a 2D topology with m columns and n rows, where N=m×n. Each node communicates with its neighbors through four diagonal, two horizontal, and two vertical links. The proposed topology is shown in Fig. 1
                        a.

Flat-based and tree-based topologies adopt their specific deterministic routing algorithms. Specifically, Torus-based network adopts XY routing algorithm, while in the case of Butterfly topology, either of first common ancestor or the dimension order routing algorithms is chosen to route packets to the destination node. Utilizing diagonal links by common ancestor algorithm may lead to shorter path in terms of number of hops. However, non-uniform traffic distribution may result in more contention and increased overall delay. To investigate this trade-off, Section 3.4 illustrates the paths taken by common ancestor and XY routing algorithms in the case of Butterfly and Torus topologies, respectively, in a 16-node ReFaT.

Switching can be accomplished by adding microring resonators [12] alongside waveguide [13] intersections. These silicon microring resonator based electro-optic switch arrays coupled with waveguide crossings can constitute a potential architecture for on-chip photonic crossbar interconnection. Various studies have focused on the design of efficient optical switches customized for existing topologies. However, most of them are controlled electrically, which enforces reservation phase prior to optical data transmission.

Utilizing Optical Add/Drop (OAD) filters [14], we propose a passive optical switch which adds (drops) optical wavelengths to (from) the optical transmission stream without any electronic processing. The proposed optical switch eliminates optical resource reservation at intermediate nodes. The key idea of passive optical switching is based on wavelength routing method, which passively routes optical data streams based on their wavelengths. For this purpose, one wavelength is associated to each node in the network. For data injection, optical streams targeted to a specific node are modulated on its dedicated wavelength. Hence, the address of the target is not contained in the packet; rather, it is embedded in the wavelength of the optical signal [14].

As a key idea of wavelength routing mechanism, the addresses of the destination nodes are embedded in the wavelengths of the optical signals. Hence, optical packets targeted to different nodes should be modulated on distinct wavelength channels to avoid optical interference. As a key idea of topology reconfiguration, wavelength assignment should be dynamically adopted for various topologies; In other words we assign different sets of wavelengths to each topology to map them dynamically. On the other hand, distinct wavelength sets for various topologies increase the number of required wavelengths, and thus degrades the network scalability. Specifically, unique wavelength assignment leads to (m
                           ×
                           n) and n distinct wavelengths for Torus and Butterfly topologies, respectively. To achieve more scalability, we propose to partition each network into two sub-networks. While distinct wavelengths are assigned to the nodes in each sub-network, the sub-networks reuse the same wavelength set. In other words, ReFaT assigns each wavelength channel to two different nodes. In this manner, ReFaT provides multicast data transmission, as well as more scalability. The following equation specifies wavelength channels dedicated to node (x, y):

                           Fig. 1b shows data transmission by using two injection channels. For more clarity, only the utilized links are shown. Now, we require 
                              
                                 ⌈

                                 /

                                 )

                            and 
                              
                                 ⌈
                                 n

                                 ⌉
                              
                            distinct (sets of) wavelengths in a Torus and Butterfly architecture, respectively. This way, the less the number of assigned wavelengths in ReFaT, the more the scalability is provided. To avoid interference between the sub-networks in each topology, ReFaT topology is augmented by some wraparound links.

According to the ReFaT topology, two dimensional m
                           ×
                           n optical switches interconnect the corresponding local IPs to neighbor nodes. Utilizing Optical Add/Drop (OAD) filters, we propose a passive optical switch which is based on wavelength routing. To send data to a destination node, source node modulates optical data based on the destination node’s wavelength.

The destination node extracts its own data according to the wavelength. To implement different routing algorithms, the ReFaT switch has more microrings compared to a non-reconfigurable switch, which may increase delay and power consumption. However, as simulation results show, and discussed in details in Sections 2.4 and 5.2, power consumption and energy dissipation are reduced by ReFaT due to reconfiguration capability. Fig. 2
                            depicts micro-architecture of the proposed switch, while various paths of the switch are discussed as follows.
                              
                                 (a)
                                 
                                    Injection: To support multicast as well as unicast transmissions, ReFaT switch injects data packets to the network via double injection channels to send packets to n destination nodes simultaneously, 
                                       
                                          1
                                          ⩽
                                          n
                                          ⩽
                                          N
                                       
                                    . By doing this, the number of wavelengths will be reduced by half, which leads to better scalability. The appropriate injection port for data injections is chosen based on destination node. As each wavelength is assigned to two nodes, we can consider two wavelength groups. The first (I1) and second (I2) injection links are utilized for optical data transmission to the same and the other wavelength groups, respectively.


                                    Ejection: To extract optical data streams targeted to the local IP from those streams passing through the switch, the ReFaT switch benefits from Ejection Microring Resonators (EMRs) which are briefly shown by E in Fig. 2. EMRs are activated when the modulated wavelength of the optical stream matches the dedicated wavelength of the local node.


                                    Routing: Routing Microring Resonators (RMRs), such as N, NE, NW, S, SE and SW, are utilized for appropriately demultiplexing optical data streams targeted to different destination nodes. These elements are optically controlled, and multiplex optical data streams transmitted from the source node with those passing through the optical switch. N, NE and NW are utilized to send data to north, north-east and north-west neighbors, respectively. S, SE and SW microrings send data to south, south-east and south-west neighbors, respectively. For example, microring NW is activated when N1 wants to send data to N2, its northwest neighbor. In the case of sending data to north, e.g. communication from N0 to N2, microring N is activated. To transfer data from N2 to its right neighbor N3, no microring will turn on.


                                    Dummy microrings: In ReFaT, we add more microrings to support different turns of routing algorithms, which lead to negligible increase in power consumption. Moreover, routing data through diagonal channels includes passing through the crossing where two waveguides cross each other. These crossings affect power in terms of Y conjunctions crossing and Y coupler, which lead to 0.12dB and 0.51dB power losses, respectively. To decrease power consumption, we insert dummy microrings in place of Y conjunctions; each Y crossing consumes 51 (0.51/.01) times more power than an off microring.

ReFaT can dynamically map two classes of topologies. In general, choosing between topologies and changing the networks parameters can be classified into two types, static and dynamic. In the static method, parameters are set based on the application characteristics in advance, while dynamic methodologies allow runtime parameter adjustments. Comparing these two categories, static methods reduces design efforts at the expense of reduced network efficiency. Since ReFaT ONoC adopts wavelength routing mechanism, distinct sets of wavelengths are assigned to each topology. In this way, dynamic topology reconfiguration is achieved by dynamic management of modulation wavelength channels. For each topology, optical data modulates on its dedicated set of wavelengths.

It is worth noting that resonant wavelengths of various microrings in each optical switch passively determine optical data traversal through the optical switch, such that in the case of Torus topology, data traverses solely through horizontal and vertical links, while in case of Butterfly topology, diagonal links are incorporated for data traversal, as well. Fig. 4 shows various scenarios for optical data routing in the case of Torus and Butterfly networks.

In addition to regularity, constant node degree, high degree of connectivity, and symmetry, the key advantages of ReFaT are listed as follows:
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 Reconfigurability: Although customizing SoC for a specific application is an effective way to improve performance and power efficiency, nowadays mapping different applications on a single SoC has been proposed as a cost effective design approach. In these highly complex SoCs, reconfigurable communication architectures are inevitable to fully utilize network resources for various communication requirements of different applications. Reconfigurable ONoCs usually suffer from huge area overhead, low efficiency and lack of ability to implement various kinds of topologies. To address the shortcomings, we offer ReFaT, an optical reconfigurable ONoC which enables network reconfiguration based on different application patterns utilizing the minimum amount of microrings and wavelengths. To keep cost in a reasonable state, ReFaT is able to implement various topologies which belong to either flat-based or tree-based categories.


                                 Scalability: Increase in the number of processing cores increases the number of distinct wavelengths. Also, wavelength constraints limit the feasibility of photonic architecture for future SoC designs. For routing data correctly without contention, ReFaT utilizes

                                 Multicasting: The proposed architecture benefits from WDM technique and double injection channels in the proposed switch for simultaneous transmission of unicast and multicast packets. In this regards, it is capable of handling multicast optical messages without imposing area, power, and energy overheads.

To achieve reconfigurability, we insert more microrings, wavelengths and crossings. In this regard, there are some issues which need to be handled in order to keep ReFaT feasible. Our tact to control these issues can be described as follows:
                           
                              (a)
                              
                                 Waveguides Crossing: One of the major concerns through ReFaT is the huge number of crossings, which leads to increase in delay and power consumption, and threats the feasibility of the proposed architecture. Although, we insert more crossing links and microrings, the experimental results show that ReFaT improves power and energy consumption compared to non-reconfigurable optical networks. Comparing to reconfigurable electrical NoC, ReFaT decreases power and energy by 46% and 40%, respectively, while [15] reports 20% increase in power and 22% decrease in energy consumption, and [9] reports more delay under lower traffic load. Fig. 2 shows the layout for connecting four cores together in order to reduce the effect of waveguide crossing.


                                 Y connection: Increasing the number of Y connections increases power consumption. In order to decrease the number of this kind of connections, we utilize dummy microrings which consume 51 times less power than a Y connection.


                                 Microrings: ReFaT inserts additional microrings per router, by 30% and 16% in comparison with non-reconfigurable Torus and Butterfly ONoCs, respectively. As Fig. 2 shows, we placed these extra microrings such that the area overhead is kept as low as possible.

Due to limitation on the number of received wavelengths in each node, optical data transmission phase proceeds checking the state of destination node. In the following, we explain the control architecture and its procedure to start data transmission.

For control network, we use the model presented in [14], where every four nodes make a sub local network and each row of nodes has its dedicated receiver channel, as is shown in Fig. 3
                        .

All nodes in each local network are electrically connected to a control unit, which monitors the status of the ejection channels in the local network. To do so, optical control packets, such as destination checking and acknowledgement packets, are transmitted and received by the control unit.

In the optical network, control network indicates whether destination node is ready to start data transfer. If destination node is ready, source will modulate data on the destination node’s wavelength, and will send it through the network. Otherwise, it reattempts to send data after a period of waiting time.

To check the status of the corresponding ejection channels in destination node, a destination-checking packet is routed to the destination before initiating optical data transmission. If all of the ejection wavelength channels at the destination are fully occupied, checking packet is sent back to the transmitter IP. Then, transmitter waits for a period of waiting interval and reattempts to transmit the optical data [16]. Otherwise, an acknowledgement packet is sent to the source node to initiate optical transmission with the corresponding free ejection wavelength set.

After verifying the existence of a free ejection wavelength channel at the destination node, optical message can be transmitted without buffering. The switching state of the micro resonators on the data stream path is optically controlled by modulated wavelengths of the optical data streams.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows a routing sample between source node and destination node in the case of Torus and Butterfly topologies. We route data by applying different routing algorithms for each topology. Specifically, common ancestor and XY routing algorithms are adopted in Butterfly and Torus topologies, respectively. In this figure, source and destination nodes are shown by red and green colors, respectively. For each topology, only the active links are shown, while the traversed path is highlighted by red arrows. Details of selected links and microrings in each middle node have been indicated in the blocks that are marked by numbers assigned to the corresponding visited node.

We developed a behavioral simulator based on OMNet++ [17] to validate the functional behavior, and investigated the efficiency of the network along with its power consumption, data transmission delay, and energy dissipation for various traffic patterns, including varying percentages of unicast and multicast traffics.

As a case study, we have implemented a parameterized ReFaT ONoC in a two-dimensional layout. Assuming a chip size of 1.8cm×1.8cm [18], we analyze a 64-node topology, 8×8 planar layout, which will be built in a 22nm CMOS process technology [19]. According to the chip dimensions and 2D layout, optical links between adjacent nodes have an approximate length of 2mm. We assume a propagation velocity of 30.8ps/mm in a silicon waveguide for the optical signals [19]. Also, propagation delay in an optimally repeated wire for the electronic signals traveling along electrical wire is 262ps/mm. Since in each switch, local link to the IP block is shorter than the three other links, we assume a length of 0.5mm for local links, which leads to delay values of 15.4ps and 131ps for the local optical and electrical links, respectively. Moreover, 8-bit electrical links are utilized for transmitting electrical destination-checking packets through the network with 5GHz clock speed [19].

Traffic pattern in an on-chip network is defined by packet size distribution, packet injection process and distribution of the packet destination. Packet sizes are uniformly distributed in the range of [128B–1KB] for unicast and [10B–500B] for multicast [19] traffics, respectively. The load offered to the network (α) is defined as [20]:

The parameter μ models inter-message gap as a Poisson random variable. This parameter indicates the amount of traffic load in ONoC. Increase in Poisson variable leads to much longer inter message gap, and offers less load to the network. The exact amount of load depends on data rate and packet average length. 10, 1, 0.05(μs) values for this parameter indicate 0.29, 0.81 and 0.99, which respectively represent light, fair and heavy traffic loads in the network. At the behavioral level, multicast traffic is defined by three different parameters, i.e. multicast percentage (5%), number of destinations and destination distribution. For investigating efficiency of the proposed ONoC, we perform various simulations under different synthetic workloads: uniform (Un), neighborhood (Ne), tornado (To), bit reversal (BR), bit complement (BC), matrix transpose (MT), hotspot (HS) and perfect shuffle (PS) [21].

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Main contributions to the data packet transmission at 22nm CMOS process technology with 5GHz clock frequency are listed in Table 1
                         
                        [20]. In this section, we compare the total transmission latency of data packets at ReFaT ONoC against traditional reconfigurable ENoC and non-reconfigurable ONoC under different traffic loads. Our results are depicted in Figs. 5 and 7
                        a and Table 3. Under light unicast traffics, total latency of network is dominated by the optical data routing through the waveguides. Under high traffics, the destination-checking phase dominates total data transmission latency.


                        Fig. 5 shows that our optical architecture reduces the delay by 86.76% and 89.95%, in comparison with electrical reconfigurable network for mesh and butterfly, respectively. Moreover, as mentioned before, RePNoC [9], as a recent reconfigurable ONoC, reports a huge increase in delay for traffic loads which are more than 0.8%, while the simulation results for ReFaT are reported under higher traffic loads.

According to the simulation results, which are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 7a for Torus and Butterfly topologies, respectively; delay of ReFaT is increased for both topologies in comparison with non-reconfigurable ONoC. In reconfigurable topology, inserting more microrings and links increases area and waveguide length. Consequently, this increase in number of microrings and waveguide lengths leads to more delay. Increased number of microrings and waveguides, increases data transmission delay by 0.3% and 4.3% in Torus and Butterfly topologies, respectively. In addition to the increased number of resonators and waveguides, adopting first common ancestor routing algorithm also increases the data transmission delay in the case of Butterfly topology. In first common ancestor, the average traversed distance decreases; however, most of the traversed paths are situated on common links. This increases waiting time, and consequently leads to delay increment.

By using an off-chip light source, the input laser power is constant and determined by the worst-case optical loss in the network. The main advantage of this approach is that the electrical power dissipated by the optical source is outside the chip and will not heat the electronic circuits [13]. The total optical power loss for transmitting an optical data message is briefly described as Formula 3.

The Formula 4 describes the total loss in any optical link as the sum of losses (in dB) of all optical components [22]. In this formula, P
                        CV is the coupling coefficient between the photonic source and optical waveguide, P
                        W is the waveguide propagation loss per unit distance, P
                        B is the bending loss, P
                        WC represents waveguide crossing insertion loss, P
                        Y is the Y-coupler loss, and finally, P
                        CR is the coupling loss from the waveguide to the optical receiver. The optical power loss for transmitting an optical data message is computed as follows:

                        ON and N
                        OFF are the number of activated and off-resonance microring resonators in the traveled path, respectively; P
                        MR,DP and P
                        MR,TP stand for the drop-port and through-port insertion losses for a passive microring, respectively. L shows the length of optical links, which is approximately 1.5mm. HopCount is the number of hops passed by the optical message. P
                        W is the waveguide propagation loss per unit distance; P
                        WC is the waveguide crossing insertion loss per unit distance. NWC and NY stand for the number of waveguide crossings and Y-couplers, passed by the optical message, respectively. P
                        Y is the Y-coupler loss, P
                        CV is the coupling coefficient between the photonic source and optical waveguide. P
                        CR is the coupling loss from the waveguide to the optical receiver. Finally, WDM shows the number of wavelength channels on which corresponding optical data is modulated [7,23]. Another source of optical loss is due to control message routing through the proposed control architecture. Power dissipation for transmitting an optical control message is computed as shown in Formula 6. In this formula, L
                        CW represents the length of the optical control waveguide, WDMCU shows the number of wavelengths on which corresponding optical control packet is modulated, and m is the number of control units located on each control waveguide. P
                        T and P
                        R represent the powers of transmitter and receiver, respectively. These power contributions are listed in Table 2

                         compare average power consumption of ReFaT ONoC with the corresponding reconfigurable ENoC and non-reconfigurable ONoCs, respectively. In comparison to non-reconfigurable ONoCs, increased number of microrings, waveguides and their lengths increases the power consumption of ReFaT by 4.07% in Torus topology. Although, the number of resonators and waveguides has been increased, adopting first common ancestor routing algorithm decreases power consumption of ReFaT by 54.75% compared to non-reconfigurable optical butterfly.

In the first common ancestor, decrease in the average traversed distance, as well as reduction in the number of visited hop-counts and microrings, leads to saving power consumption in ReFaT while mapping butterfly.

Indeed, ReFaT reduces power consumption by 96.57% and 96.95% in comparison to reconfigurable electrical network for Torus and Butterfly topologies, respectively. Meanwhile, the reconfigurable ONoC, which is described in [15], results in 20% increase in power and only 22% decrease in energy consumption.

Average energy dissipated in ReFaT ONoC in comparison to reconfigurable ENoC and non-reconfigurable ONoCs are shown in Figs. 7c and 8
                         and Table 3, respectively. As a Torus case, increment in delay and power of ReFaT increased energy consumption by 6% compared to non-reconfigurable optical topology. For the Butterfly topology, power consumption decreases significantly, while the delay increases on a lower weight; therefore, the energy consumption decreases by 40%.

Also, ReFaT reduces the energy consumption by 96.95% and 99.69% in comparison with reconfigurable electrical Torus and butterfly, respectively.

Several optical on-chip architectures have been proposed so far. However, most of them are bus-based. The Cornell hybrid electrical/optical architecture [4] comprises an optical ring and assigns distinct wavelengths to each node. Firefly [5] hybrid electrical/optical network implements reservation-assisted single-write-multi-read buses. HP’s Corona crossbar architecture [28] has several multiple writers, single reader buses. The hybrid optical/electrical network proposed by Shacham et al. [1] is one of the few that implements optical switch network.

It combines a high-speed photonic circuit switched network with an electronic packet-switched control one. CONoC [20] improves the hybrid architecture proposed by Shacham et al. [1]. The nano-photonic NoC architecture proposed in [19] eliminates the need for optical resource reservation at intermediate nodes and utilizes all-optical request–grant arbitration architecture to resolve end-point contention. In this architecture, the utilization of per-receiver wavelength in the data network prevents optical contention at the intermediate nodes. Moreover, optical contention at the destination nodes is resolved by electrical arbitration architecture.

Although several reconfigurable ONoCs have been proposed so far, they either suffer from considerable area overhead and low efficiency as a result of fully interconnected architecture [9,15], or they cannot be adopted to different topologies [10,29]. Some methods use a comprehensive topology that enables wide range of communication requirements between different nodes. It is possible to implement all topologies in this general architecture; however, this approach significantly increases area overhead [9,15]. On the other hand, reconfigurable architectures proposed in [10,29] utilize a few long-range links which are embedded in a regular network. As follows, we briefly review some reconfigurable optical NoCs.

Reconfigurable Photonic Network on Chip (RePNoC) architecture [9] reconfigures network topology to achieve ultra-low latency for various traffic patterns. Considering different communication patterns of applications, photonic network topology is configured as a logical topology on top of a real physical one. The main drawbacks of this topology are area, power, and energy overheads, due to the large number of optical links. Moreover, under heavy load, RePNoC increases network delay due to severe congestion in the network. ReFaT, however, provides network reconfiguration to flat-based and tree-based topologies, while decreases power and energy by 46% and 40%, respectively. It is worth noting that ReFaT slightly increase delay by 4.3%.

Artundo et al. [10] present a reconfigurable NoC for Distributed Shared-Memory (DSM) multiprocessors; the proposed interconnection architecture consists of a Torus-based network interconnecting all nodes (i.e., processors and local memories) as well as a limited number of reconfigurable optical links. The latter links are added periodically for a given time span to connect communicating nodes with large bandwidth requirements. However, this architecture is solely applicable for Torus topology and cannot be adopted to other topologies. In [29], a reconfigurable photonic NoC is presented for shared-memory CMPs. The proposed network utilizes optical paths during the span of a dynamic reconfiguration interval to improve the network performance. This method is not able to implement different topologies in the same platform. Unlike the reconfigurable networks proposed in [10,29], ReFaT is able to switch between two popular classes of topologies with negligible area overhead. Furthermore ReFaT improves power and energy efficiency.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

Although customizing the architecture of an ONoC for a target application is a way to improves performance and power consumption, mapping different applications on a single SoC is more cost effective. In these highly complex SoCs, interconnection network needs to match the traffic characteristics of different applications. To this end, reconfigurable communication architectures are inevitable to fully utilize network resources for various communication requirements of different applications. In this paper, we proposed ReFaT ONoC as a dynamic reconfigurable optical network, whose architecture can be reconfigured either as flat-based or tree-based networks, based on the communication requirements, with negligible area overhead. This photonic network adopts passive routing, which is performed by routing optical data streams based on their wavelengths. Utilizing wavelength routing method, ReFaT ONoC eliminates the need for optical resource reservation at the intermediate nodes, and thus avoids the corresponding latency and area overheads. Moreover, passive micro-architecture of the proposed optical switch reduces energy consumption and power dissipation, compared to non-reconfigurable architectures, and it also provides the ability to implement multiple Butterfly networks simultaneously.

The simulation results depict that compared to a non-reconfigurable ONoC, ReFaT reduces energy consumption and power dissipation around 40% and 54.75%, respectively; while increases delay negligibly around 4.3%. Moreover, in comparison to reconfigurable electrical NoC, ReFaT reduces power and energy consumption and delay up to 98.35%, 99.69% and 89.95%, respectively. As a future work in this line, ReFaT can be improved to map different classes of topologies such as hypercube. Moreover, as a new approach, we can address adaptive routing algorithm to achieve better performance.
