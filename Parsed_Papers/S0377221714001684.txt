                  In DEA, there are two frameworks for efficiency assessment and targeting: the greatest and the least distance framework. The greatest distance framework provides us with the efficient targets that are determined by the farthest projections to the assessed decision making unit via maximization of the p-norm relative to either the strongly efficient frontier or the weakly efficient frontier. Non-radial measures belonging to the class of greatest distance measures are the slacks-based measure (SBM) and the range-adjusted measure (RAM). Whereas these greatest distance measures have traditionally been utilized because of their computational ease, least distance projections are quite often more appropriate than greatest distance projections from the perspective of managers of decision-making units because closer efficient targets may be attained with less effort. In spite of this desirable feature of the least distance framework, the least distance (in) efficiency versions of the additive measure, SBM and RAM do not even satisfy weak monotonicity. In this study, therefore, we introduce and investigate least distance p-norm inefficiency measures that satisfy strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier. In order to develop these measures, we extend a free disposable set and introduce a tradeoff set that implements input–output substitutability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In data envelopment analysis (DEA), mathematical programming is applied to observed input–output data in order not only to assess efficiency performance but also to provide efficient target information for managers of entities such as banks, hospitals and business units. Each entity responsible for transforming multiple inputs to multiple outputs is called a decision-making unit (DMU). In DEA, there are basically two frameworks for efficiency assessment and targeting: the greatest and the least distance framework. The greatest distance framework provides us with the efficient targets that are determined by the farthest projections from the DMU being assessed. Such measures include Tone’s (2001) slacks-based measure (SBM), or equivalently Pastor, Ruiz, and Sirvent’s (1999) enhanced Russell graph measure (ERGM), as well as Cooper, Park, and Pastor’s (1999) range-adjusted measure (RAM). These greatest distance efficiency measures and projections are often used because of their computational ease. However, closest or least distance projections are often more relevant than greatest distance projections from the perspective of managers of private or public entities. This is so because closer efficient targets may be reached with less effort (Aparicio, Ruiz, & Sirvent, 2007; Frei & Harker, 1999; Gonzalez & Alvarez, 2001). In a p-norm (

                     -norm) framework, RAM and SBM are considered to be greatest distance 1-norm measures, i.e., they are obtained by maximizing the 1-norm over the strongly efficient frontier E.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an axiomatic analysis of least distance inefficiency (or efficiency) measures within a p-norm framework. It is well-known that the standard radial measures of CCR (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978) and BCC (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984) do not satisfy strong monotonicity: a decrease in any input (output) raises (lowers) the value of the efficiency measure, or such a change has the opposite effects on the inefficiency measure. This is due to the fact that the CCR and BCC measures identify targets on the boundary or weakly efficient frontier

                      (weakly efficient subset) of the production possibility set T, that is, the one-step procedure of CCR or BCC may identify efficient targets on

                                 W
                              
                           
                        
                     , but not on E, where 
                        
                           E
                           ⊆
                           
                              
                                 E
                              
                              
                                 W
                              
                           
                        
                     . Hence, CCR and BCC require two steps in order to identify an efficient target: measuring the efficiency score in the first step and finding an efficient target on E in the second step. However, these measures are not strongly monotonic.

As will be shown in this paper, the least distance (in) efficiency versions of the additive measure, SBM and RAM do not even satisfy weak monotonicity not to mention strong monotonicity. These least distance versions were introduced by Aparicio et al. (2007) and Tone (2010) to set efficient targets but not to define (in) efficiency measures. Somewhat more directly related to the goal of the present research is the Portela, Borges, and Thanassoulis (2003) study, in which a multiplicative nonp-norm objective function is minimized.


                     Briec (1998) proposed the family of least distance inefficiency measures under an arbitrary p-norm,

                     , and showed that the p-norm least distance efficiency measure is reduced to the CCR measure when p is equal to positive infinity. It follows that Briec’s (1998) inefficiency measure satisfies weak monotonicity, which implies that the inefficiency (efficiency) score does not always decrease when an input (output) decreases or an output (input) increases. His inefficiency measure may find an efficient target on the weakly efficient portion of the boundary, i.e.,

                     . Recently, Aparicio and Pastor (2012) modified Aparicio et al.’s (2007) Euclidean norm (2-norm) model, which is based on mixed integer quadratic programming.


                     Ando, Kai, Maeda, and Sekitani (2012) showed that there does not exist any least distance p-norm measure that satisfies weak monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier, and presented a weakly monotonic least distance measure with the incorporation of a free disposable set (or reverse domination cone). The free disposable set is constructed under the assumption of non-substitutable inputs and outputs. In this paper, we extend the free disposable set and develop what we call the tradeoff set, which allows for input–output substitutability. The exploitation of the tradeoff set helps us develop least distance p-norm inefficiency measures that satisfy not only strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier, but also some other desirable properties.

Now let us clarify where our research stands in the axiomatic efficiency measurement literature. This literature starts with Färe and Lovell (1978), who provided three fundamental axioms: input-indication, input-homogeneity and strong monotonicity in inputs. Input-indication shows that an efficiency measure takes a value of one if and only if the input vector is Koopmans input-efficient given a fixed level of outputs, and input-homogeneity shows doubling all inputs leads to the halving of the efficiency score. Strong monotonicity in inputs indicates that an increase in one or more inputs, while holding outputs constant, leads to a decrease in the efficiency score.


                     Färe, Lovell, and Zieschang (1983) showed that the input-oriented Russell measure introduced by Färe and Lovell (1978) does not satisfy input-homogeneity.
                        2
                        
                           Färe et al. (1983) showed that the input-oriented Russell measure satisfies sub-homogeneity in inputs, which is weaker than input-homogeneity. See also Russell (1985).
                     
                     
                        2
                      
                     Russell (1985) showed that this measure is not strongly monotonic in inputs (see also Russell & Schworm, 2009). Bol (1986) concluded that there does not exist any efficiency measure that satisfies the Färe–Lovell axioms for all general technologies. In respond to these theoretical findings, Dmitruk and Koshevoy (1991) provided a framework that satisfies all the Färe–Lovell axioms, by relaxing some axioms of the input requirement set representing industry technology.

Input-homogeneity is closely related to input-oriented radial measures. Since the radial measures fail to satisfy input-indication, the current study focuses on the nonradial measures, which allow nonproportional reductions in inputs and augmentations in outputs. Moreover, due to the nonexistence of efficiency measures satisfying all the Färe–Lovell axioms, we relax the axioms by eliminating input-homogeneity and develop strongly monotonic efficiency measures in a least distance p-norm DEA framework.

Two of the obvious extensions to the least distance DEA class are the 1-norm least distance-based SBM and RAM. However, as stated in the introduction, these least distance versions fail to satisfy strong monotonicity. Baek and Lee (2009) proposed a weighted Euclidean (2-norm) distance-based RAM and claimed that it satisfies strong monotonicity. Despite Baek and Lee’s (2009) assertion, Pastor and Aparicio (2010) showed that this measure is not even weakly monotonic. Recently, Ando et al. (2012) showed that strong monotonicity does not hold in the standard least distance framework for any 
                        
                           p

                           ,
                           ∞
                           ]
                        
                     , and then proposed a weakly monotonic least distance measure with the introduction of the free disposal set without resorting to Dmitruk and Koshevoy’s framework. But this modified measure is not strongly monotonic as will be shown in this paper. Therefore, the current study develops a strongly monotonic least distance measure within a p-norm framework.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2.1, we provide the basics and discuss some limitations of previous research contributions. Section 2.2 formally defines the p-norm and its general least distance p-norm measure and Section 2.3 discusses Ando et al.’s (2012) measure and its implications. Section 3 provides our proposed framework. Section 3.1 introduces the tradeoff set and provides the meaning associated with input–output substitutability. In Section 3.2, we develop a least distance inefficiency measure that satisfies three desirable properties including strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier. Section 4 shows that the developed p-norm measures satisfy the unit invariance property and the translation invariance property as well. The final section concludes with a summary and some possible future directions of research. All the proofs are relegated to Appendix A.

However, Pastor and Aparicio (2010) provided a counterexample to Baek and Lee’s (2009) assertion on strong monotonicity and presented an open problem on whether there exists a strongly monotonic efficiency model that yields closest points over the strongly efficient frontier E. That is, their open problem on the p-norm is whether for any T (without assuming a particular returns to scale) there exists a

In the counterexample provided by Ando et al. (2012), the candidates for least distance efficient targets are the strongly efficient frontier as a whole. On the other hand, the least distance efficient targets of SBM, RAM and the additive measure are confined to a part of the strongly efficient frontier, because the associated projections are obtained only by reducing some inputs and/or increasing outputs.

                           The idea of free input disposability is that while the firm has to purchase additional inputs it throws away, it does not have to pay anyone to dispose of them. Similarly, the idea of free output disposability is that while the firm can sell part or all of the produced outputs, it does not have to pay for reducing the outputs. Note that free input–output disposability implies that the production possibility set is unbounded and it is possible to dispose of all outputs (possibility of inaction).

To be more precise, we assume that the industry technology is represented by the production possibility set (2) where inputs and outputs are substitutable, but the industry technology is not accessible without efforts or costs to an inefficient DMU, which operates using its own technology (DMU specific technology). Due to the free disposability assumption, however, the

                         can be thought of as the Leontief or fixed proportion (non-substitutable) technology (Gould & Ferguson, 1980; Hougaard & Keiding, 1998). The assumptions related to the industry technology and DMU specific technologies are utilized to justify the model (10) as will be explained after the following theorem.

                        Ando et al. (2012) showed that Theorems 1–3 hold not only for the variable and the constant returns to scale technology, but also for the non-increasing and the non-decreasing technology.

According to Proposition 2, Ando et al.’s measure (10) is weakly monotonic but is not strongly monotonic over the efficient frontier.

This study extends the model (10) to a least distance framework, in which strong monotonicity is satisfied, i.e., all of Axioms A, B and C are satisfied. For this purpose, we replace

                         in practice? It is important to construct it by avoiding the possibility that the set 
                           
                              Ω

                        Proposition 4 states that the proposed inefficiency measure (18) satisfies strong monotonicity without imposing additional assumptions on the convex DEA (polyhedral) technologies. The measure (18) is a natural extension of Ando et al. (2012), although the simple use of Ando et al.’s (2012) method does not lead to strong monotonicity as Proposition 2 indicates.

It should be noted that the optimal projection point obtained from (18) is not equivalent to the one given by Aparicio et al.’s (2007) method. To see this, consider the point (2,4,10) in Fig. 1 and Appendix C. The projection based on Aparicio et al.’s (2007) method is the point (2,2,10.125) on the red line connecting (1,1,10) and (5,5,10.5). By contrast, the path based on (18) is (2,4,10)→(4,4,10)→(4,4,10.375). This shows that the two optimal projections are different. Appendix C also provides a comparison of the result of

The present paper has some connection with Fukuyama and Sekitani’s (2012b) study, which was motivated by the studies of Dmitruk and Koshevoy (1991) and Russell and Schworm (2006), but the latter two do not deal with the least distance efficiency measurement. Assuming the existence of full dimensional facets, Aparicio and Pastor (2013) have recently developed an output-oriented strongly monotonic least distance measure. However, there are differences between our proposed p-norm measure and Aparicio and Pastor’s (2013) measure. Aparicio and Pastor (2013) explicitly assumed: (a) that there exist full dimensional facets, and (b) that the projected points can be located on an extended facet portion of the extended frontier. On the other hand, we assume neither the existence of full dimensional facets, nor projections on an extended facet portion. The latter point can be seen with the help of Fig. 3
                     , which is adapted from Fig. 2. Consider the inefficient DMU represented by

There was no documented evidence in the scientific DEA literature on the existence of practical least distance p-norm (

                     ) measure that satisfies several desirable axioms including strong monotonicity on the strongly efficient frontier, without using extended efficient faces or facets. Introducing DMU (or firm) specific technologies that allow for input–output substitutability, therefore, we have developed a least distance p-norm inefficiency (efficiency) measure satisfying strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier as well as efficiency indication, zero-unity requirement and unit invariance.


                     Ando et al. (2012) obtained weakly monotonic least distance measures under the assumption that DMU specific technologies are represented by the free disposable set, i.e., the Leontief or fixed proportion technology whose specification assumes non-substitutable input–output relationships. For the development of the proposed measures, we extended the free disposable set (or reverse domination cone) and introduced the tradeoff set under the assumption of input–output substitutability. We have shown that the use of the tradeoff set allows us to develop the strongly monotonic class of inefficiency measures.

An important difference between the free disposable set and the tradeoff set is that, whereas the use of the former set guarantees only the weak monotonicity of least distance measures, the use of the latter set allows us to construct strongly monotonic least distance measures.

It should be noted that the proposed least distance p-norm efficiency measurement framework is easily extendable to its weighted version, in which many of the existing inefficiency and efficiency measures can be analyzed in a unified way. Accordingly, an efficiency measure and the corresponding inefficiency measure can be related to each other within the extended unified framework, as was shown in Section 4.

The least distance approach has an important practical merit because it identifies a closest or easy-to-accept efficient target for decision makers. Therefore, it is of great interest to learn the differences and similarities in both the choice of p-norms and the identification of efficient targets through various empirical studies within the proposed framework. We are looking forward to seeing many such applications. It should be noted that one of the theoretical issues needed to be solved is whether or not we can construct (in) efficiency measures that satisfy the continuity property proposed by Russell (1990).
