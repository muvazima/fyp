                  Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease with red and scaly plaques on skin and affecting about 125 million people worldwide. Currently, dermatologist use visual and haptic methods for diagnosis the disease severity. This does not help them in stratification and risk assessment of the lesion stage and grade. Further, current methods add complexity during monitoring and follow-up phase. The current diagnostic tools lead to subjectivity in decision making and are unreliable and laborious.
                  This paper presents a first comparative performance study of its kind using principal component analysis (PCA) based CADx system for psoriasis risk stratification and image classification utilizing: (i) 11 higher order spectra (HOS) features, (ii) 60 texture features, and (iii) 86 color feature sets and their seven combinations. Aggregate 540 image samples (270 healthy and 270 diseased) from 30 psoriasis patients of Indian ethnic origin are used in our database. Machine learning using PCA is used for dominant feature selection which is then fed to support vector machine classifier (SVM) to obtain optimized performance. Three different protocols are implemented using three kinds of feature sets. Reliability index of the CADx is computed.
                  Among all feature combinations, the CADx system shows optimal performance of 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and specificity, when all three sets of feature are combined. Further, our experimental result with increasing data size shows that all feature combinations yield high reliability index throughout the PCA-cutoffs except color feature set and combination of color and texture feature sets. HOS features are powerful in psoriasis disease classification and stratification. Even though, independently, all three set of features HOS, texture, and color perform competitively, but when combined, the machine learning system performs the best. The system is fully automated, reliable and accurate.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting about 125 million people worldwide [1]. The prevalence of psoriasis in different geographical regions such as Europe, USA, Malaysia and India is about 0.6–6.5% [2], 3.15% [2], 3% [3] and 1.02% [4], respectively. It can influence the patients’ quality of life due to its embarrassing physical appearance [5]. This results in increased risk of contemplating suicide (∼30%) which makes it an equally dangerous disease at par with depression, heart disease and diabetes [6]. Psoriasis appears in a variety of forms namely plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. For 80% of the cases, plaque is found to be the most common form of psoriasis [7] and thus the work presented in this paper is focused on plaque type psoriasis.

Dermatologists generally follow visual examination and sense of touch to predict the severity which requires skilled training for better diagnosis and analysis. Still the subjective assessment is inefficient, unreliable and a laborious process. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system could be useful in clinical applications.

Over the years, researchers developed many CADx systems for classification of various skin diseased images. The authors presented a review on CADx system for psoriasis severity risk stratification [8]. A psoriasis CADx system has been proposed in [9] to automatically classify images into psoriatic lesion and healthy skin utilizing color and texture features in SVM framework.

In the current study, the objective is to analyze the performance of psoriasis CADx (pCAD) system using different feature sets i.e., 11 higher order spectra (HOS), 60 texture, 86 color and their combinations. Overall, we have formed seven sets of feature combinations: (i) HOS by itself (FC1); (ii) Texture by itself (FC2); (iii) Color by itself (FC3); (iv) HOS+Texture (FC4); (v) HOS+Color (FC5); (vi) Texture+Color (FC6); (vii) HOS+Texture+Color (FC7). Along with the aforementioned objective, the paper brings following novelties: (i) to the best of our knowledge, first time HOS features have been extracted for psoriasis images. The random distribution of pixels of psoriatic lesions and nonlinear behavior among the frequency components, innovates us to use HOS features; (ii) optimization procedure to estimate the set of radon angles for optimization of HOS features; (iii) largest set of mathematical features ever computed in psoriasis skin disease framework consisting of 157 features including HOS, texture and color; (iv) comparative analysis of systems with different feature sets in changing data size framework; (v) understanding the reliability analysis of the CADx system while switching between combinations sets.

Three sets of experiments are performed for all the aforementioned feature combinations. (i) optimization of the SVM kernel type in PCA-based feature selection paradigm while keeping the data size (N) fixed. Classification is performed for four different kernel functions, where kernel function of polynomial of order two showed the best results for FC2–FC7 and polynomial kernel of order one for FC1. (ii) Compare and contrast the effect of feature sets in psoriasis disease classification with fixed data size (N). The highest classification accuracy of 100% with sensitivity and specificity both of 100% have been achieved using FC7 (HOS+Texture+Color) at PCA-cutoff of 0.94. (iii) The last and third experiment presents the effect of change in data size on the machine learning paradigm for all seven sets of feature combinations while computing the reliability of the system. Our experimental results conclude that all feature combination yield high reliability index throughout the PCA-cutoffs except FC3 (Color alone) and FC6 (Texture+Color). Therefore, our observations on experiments performed using different feature combinations clearly shows the dominant behavior of HOS features.

The psoriasis image data required for this study were collected from Psoriasis Clinic and Research Centre, Psoriatreat, Pune, Maharashtra, India. Images of Indian ethnic origin patients were acquired by digitally photographing using Sony NEX-5 camera with 22mm lens and 350dpi under the supervision of dermatologist. The images were processed in Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) format with color depth of 24 bits per pixel. The ethics approval was generated for the dataset and the image dataset were anonymized.

For this work, a total of 540 subjects (270 healthy skins and 270 diseased skins) were acquired from the images of 30 patients. The preparation of database was done by manually cropping the healthy and diseased skins freehand to capture any shape through MATLAB from the images of each patient. First row of Fig. 1
                      shows the samples of diseased skin while second row shows healthy skin samples.

The objective of the paper is to compare the performance of the pCAD system using different feature sets i.e., HOS, texture, color and their combinations. Our pCAD utilizes the machine learning paradigm in PCA-based SVM framework shown in Fig. 2
                     . The spirit of this machine learning framework and risk stratification comes from methods developed by Suri and his team [10–13]. Our pCAD has two components as shown by the dotted line. The left side reflects the offline system while the right side reflects the online system. In the offline system, HOS, texture and color features were extracted. The dominant features were selected using PCA in order to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted feature set and to select only unique and highly discriminating features without altering the original values of the features. The dominant feature set and a priori physician classified labels (ground truth) are used as inputs to the offline classifier in order to determine the machine learning parameters. The dominant features generated in offline system were extracted from the test images. Subsequently, the machine learning parameters from the offline system and dominant features of test images were used to determine the class label of the test images.

Higher order spectra-based features are used to analyze the nonlinear and dynamic nature of the given signal [14]. The random distribution of pixels of psoriatic lesions and nonlinear behavior among the frequency components encourage us to use HOS features. Higher order statistics deal with higher order cumulants among which bispectrum is one of the most commonly used for HOS features. Bispectrum [15] is defined as the Fourier transform of the third-order cumulant sequence given by Eq. (1). But, before bispectrum computation, psoriasis color images were converted to grayscale images and then radon transformation [12] was performed to transform the 2D image into one dimensional signal at various angles. We have extracted the HOS features for every 1° of the Radon transform between 0° and 180°. Eq. (1) represents the bispectrum of signal x(k) for

Texture features are the most traditional way to explore the information about a particular pattern in an image. It distinguishes one pattern from another and quantifies the texture present in a lesion. To extract texture features, psoriasis color images were converted to grayscale images. One of the most common texture analysis techniques is Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). We have extracted 18 features using GLCM [16]. Another prominent texture feature extraction technique is Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM). In this paper, a total of 11 features were extracted using GLRLM [16]. Other than these two well-known texture feature extraction techniques, there are many other techniques such as Intensity Histogram (IH) [16], Invariant Moment (IM) [16], Gray Level Difference Statistics (GLDS) [17], Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) [18], Statistical Feature Matrix (SFM) [19] and Fractal Dimension [9]. Overall, 60 texture features were extracted from eight different texture feature extraction techniques. Readers may refer to [20] for comprehensive texture analysis.

Since the acquired images of psoriasis are color images, color features may provide valuable information to discriminate psoriatic lesion and healthy skin. To extract the color features, an exhaustive color feature space consisting of 14 color spaces are considered namely: RGB, normalized-RGB, YCbCr, HSV, HSI, CIE XYZ, CIE Lab, CIE Lch, CIE Luv, hunter-Lab, SCT, opponent, CMY and CMYK. All of these color spaces are known in the literature [21–24]. Two statistics, i.e., mean and standard deviation is calculated for each color component of all the color spaces. The mean value characterizes the average color and standard deviation represents the color variation corresponding to color component considered. Since each color space contains three color components except CMYK which has four color component, overall 86 color features ({13 color spaces×3 color components×2 statistics}+{1 color spaces (CMYK)×4 color components×2 statistics}) are extracted for each sample image [25].

Feature selection technique avoids the redundant and less dominant features and improves the efficiency and time consumption of machine learning algorithm. One such popular technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Individual application of PCA only gives reduction in dimensionality of feature space with altered feature values. Hence, we adapted a polling methodology along with PCA [26] which extract the indices of the dominant features. The benefit of the polling method is that the original feature values are never lost in the process of dominant feature selection. The algorithm for feature selection is as follows:


                        Step 1. Calculate the average across each feature space dimension and subtract it from each value in the corresponding dimension.


                        Step 2. Compute the covariance matrix of the data set.


                        Step 3. Compute the eigenvectors (V) and eigenvalues (λ) of the covariance matrix.


                        Step 4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and arrange the corresponding eigenvectors in the same order.


                        Step5. Choose the # of principal components (m) to be considered using condition:

The main objective of the paper is to compare the ability of HOS, texture and color features in classification of psoriasis disease framework. We have made seven sets of feature combinations from these three sets of features i.e., (i) HOS alone (FC1); (ii) Texture alone (FC2); (iii) Color alone (FC3); (iv) HOS+Texture (FC4); (v) HOS+Color (FC5); (vi) Texture+Color (FC6); (vii) HOS+Texture+Color (FC7). We have performed three experiments for all the aforementioned feature combinations. The first experiment is performed to optimize the SVM kernel type in PCA-based feature selection paradigm while keeping the data size (N) fixed. The experiment two is performed to compare and analyze the effect of feature sets in psoriasis disease classification with fixed data size (N). The last and third experiment presents the effect of change in data size on the machine learning memorization vs. generalization concept for all seven sets of feature combinations and yields the reliability of the system.

In this experiment, we are interested in selection of the best SVM kernel function for each feature combination. Here, N
                        =540 images are considered consisting of equal number of psoriatic lesion and healthy patient images, i.e., 270. The best SVM kernel was selected among four different conventional SVM kernels i.e., linear and polynomial kernel of order one, two and three. The least square method is adopted here to find the separating hyper-plane. To generalize the SVM classification process, cross-validation strategy with K
                        =10-fold method is adapted. Since the partitions of the data set is random, we thus repeat the protocol T
                        =20 number of trials. The average accuracy over 20 trials is computed and considered as the final classification accuracy. Finally, the best SVM kernel function is chosen on the basis of classification accuracy. Accuracy as a function of PCA-cutoffs is plotted for all the four kernel functions. Our observation shows that the polynomial kernel of order two behaved uniformly over all the possible PCA-cutoffs for feature combination FC7 as depicted in Fig. 3
                        . Similarly, it is observed that the polynomial kernel of order two produced the highest accuracy throughout the PCA-cutoffs for all feature combinations except FC1 for which polynomial kernel of order one is found to be the best SVM kernel. As a result, we fixed our analysis on subsequent experiments using this polynomial kernel of order two for FC2–FC7 and polynomial kernel of order one for FC1.

The role of this experiment is to analyze the overall performance of the pCAD system using different feature combinations. Five performance parameters i.e., sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve i.e., AUC are computed. Accuracy as a function of PCA-cutoffs is plotted for selected kernel in experiment one for all feature combinations (Fig. 4
                        ).

Further, we also exhibit how the number of dominant features grows with the gradual increase in the PCA-cutoffs (Fig. 5
                        ). The performance parameters of the pCAD system for FC1 are depicted in Table 1
                        . This clearly shows that the highest classification performance with accuracy of 99.31% has been achieved at PCA-cutoff of 0.94. This is shown by the shaded color in the table. This process is repeated for all feature combinations and the best performance parameters at best cutoff (R
                        *) are shown in Table 2
                        . It can be clearly seen from Table 2 that the best classification results were achieved using FC7.

The behavior of the pCAD system is influenced by (a) the number of subjects (data size) present in its training-based model and (b) cutoff values chosen during the data mining process. Thus, it is important to understand the pCAD's accuracy with increasing populations in terms of subjects and increase in cutoff values during the PCA-based selection. This experiment thus consists of 11 data sizes ranging from N
                        =50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 to N
                        =540. Each data size consisted of equal number of diseased and normal patients. For each data size selected, classification accuracy is calculated for 10 cutoffs ranging from 0.90 to 0.99 with an interval of 0.01.


                        Table 3
                         shows classification accuracy for each data size using FC1. Similarly, these observations have also been recorded for other feature combinations. The average accuracy value for all cutoffs at each data size is calculated using different feature combinations and displayed in Fig. 6
                        . These curves clearly demonstrate that as the population size increases the average accuracy increases and further reaches point of diminishing returns for all feature combination. The curve of average accuracy vs. data size becomes plateau at N
                        =300 for all feature combination which shows that at least 300 samples are required for stable performance.

To evaluate the reliability of the system, we take the ratio of standard deviation to average accuracy on running the proposed system by considering all PCA-based cutoffs on all data sizes (N). The concept is to see how reliable system is with increasing feature population and selecting the optimal features using PCA while increasing the data size.

Further, the system accuracy and system reliability is calculated by taking the mean corresponding to all data sizes using Eqs. (21) and (22).

It can be observed that the span of lowest to highest system accuracy and system reliability among feature combinations are only 2.23% and 4.14%, respectively, as shown in the last row of Table 4. This shows that adequate system accuracy and system reliability has been obtained by using all the feature combinations.

We have performed similar above experiments to validate our pCAD system on facial skin image database SFA [27]. For this, we have taken 2000 skin and 2000 non-skin images from SFA. There are three major validations performed: (i) Accuracy as function of PCA-cutoffs for all feature combinations for fixed data size of 4000; (ii) Accuracy and reliability as function of changing data size and (iii) System accuracy and system reliability of the pCAD system.

In (i), Fig. 8(a) shows the accuracy as function of PCA-cutoffs for all feature combinations for fixed data size of 4000. The best PCA-cutoffs chosen on the basis of highest classification accuracy and it is shown using an arrow. It can be observed that FC2 (Texture by itself), FC3 (Color by itself) and FC6 (Texture+Color) have produced better accuracy throughout the PCA-cutoffs than other feature combinations. Further, it can be noted that here, the feature combinations which involve HOS features are producing little lower accuracies in contrary with the results of psoriasis database. So, as discriminating power of different feature sets may vary depending on the datasets, it justifies the objective of this study that why analysis of different feature sets is necessary for psoriasis database. Moreover, the number of dominant features grows with the gradual increase in the PCA-cutoffs as shown in Fig. 8(b). In (ii), the experimental protocol with changing data size, we have divided the dataset in 10 sets ranging from 400 to 4000 as follows: 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, 2800, 3200, 3600 and 4000 consisting equal number of skin and non-skin images. Fig. 9(a) shows the average accuracy as a function of data size while Fig. 9(b) shows the reliability index as a function of data size. These curves clearly demonstrate that as the population size increases the average accuracy increases and further reaches point of diminishing returns for all feature combinations. The curve of average accuracy vs. data size becomes plateau at N
                        =2400 for all feature combinations which shows that at least 2400 samples are required for stable performance. Further, the system accuracy and its reliability are also calculated and are shown in Table 5
                         for all feature combinations. The last row of the table shows the span of lowest to highest system accuracy and system reliability among feature combinations are only 8.27% and 5.26%, respectively. It demonstrates that adequate system accuracy and system reliability has been obtained by using all the feature combinations. Thus, the analysis with facial skin image database confirms and validates our protocol and pCAD system.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper presented a first time comparative study of performance of HOS, texture and color features in CADx system using psoriasis images. We have formed seven sets of feature combinations (FC1–FC7) from these three sets of features. Thus, our objective was to present an in-depth analysis of psoriasis disease classification in support vector machine framework using seven different feature sets. In each of these scenarios, our paradigm adapted a PCA-based feature selection technique to choose the dominant features without altering their true feature values. We further established the reliability index of the pCAD system in all seven scenarios.

Our first step of experiment was to choose the best SVM kernel on the basis of classification accuracy. It is observed that the polynomial kernel of order two produced the highest accuracy throughout the PCA-cutoffs for all feature combinations except FC1 for which polynomial kernel of order one is found to be the best SVM kernel. This allowed us to fix our analysis on subsequent experiments using polynomial kernel of order two for FC2–FC7 and polynomial kernel of order one for FC1. The results obtained using selected kernel function clearly shows that FC4 (HOS+Texture) and FC5 (HOS+Color) have produced better accuracy throughout the PCA-cutoffs than other feature combinations (Fig. 4). Further, we have compared the best performance parameters for each feature combination at particular PCA-cutoff. The observation revealed that the highest classification accuracy of 100% with sensitivity and specificity both of 100% have been achieved using FC7 (HOS+Texture+Color) at PCA-cutoff of 0.94 (Table 2). The clinical interpretation of 100% accuracy implies that the dataset which were truly abnormal were classified as abnormal and the dataset which were truly normal were classified as normal.

Our results of experiment with changing data size show that the curve of average accuracy vs. data size becomes plateau at N
                     =300 for all feature combination which shows that at least 300 samples are required for stable configuration (Fig. 6). The experiment to analyze the reliability of the system using different feature combinations concluded that all feature combination yield high reliability index throughout the PCA-cutoffs except FC3 (Color by itself) and FC6 (Texture+Color). Finally, system accuracy and system reliability is computed for all feature combinations. The highest system accuracy of 97.28% has been achieved using FC5 (HOS+Color) and interestingly the FC2 (Texture by itself) has produced the highest system reliability of 98.38%. Though a very high system reliability of 98.34% and 98.13% have also been obtained using FC4 (HOS+Texture) and FC7 (HOS+Texture+Color), respectively. So, our observations of experiments performed using different feature combinations clearly show the dominant behavior of HOS features.

In addition to exploring the performance analysis of pCAD system using different feature combinations, we have designed an PCA based optimization procedure to estimate the set of radon angles for which the highest classification accuracy is achieved. In this study, the radon transform of the input image is taken for every 1° interval between 0° and 180°. The set of radon angles which corresponds to the highest accuracy were: {24°, 26°, 27°, 28°, 32°, 55°, 56°, 58°}.

It is noticed that psoriasis public data bases are not prevalent and there is not much literature available for psoriasis CADx system, hence we have presented a comparative performance of proposed model with existing works on dermatology diagnosis as shown in Table 6
                     .

The pCAD system proposed based on PCA, SVM and different feature combinations here for psoriasis disease classification has been found successful. Further, it provides an automated method of segregating the diseased and healthy skin in large population. It still has a good scope of improvement. Better validation on larger dataset is essential for clinical translation of the proposed prototype. Secondly, one of the possible extensions of this study involves grading of psoriasis data by another pathologist. This could be useful in inter-observer variability analysis. Further, automatic segmentation of lesions would avoid the laborious and time consuming task of manual cropping of lesions. Lastly, with more resources and cost, we intend to bring diversified data representing multiple classes of different severity.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The paper presented a comparative study of performance of computer-aided diagnosis systems for psoriasis image classification using different feature sets i.e., higher order spectra, texture, color and their combinations. As in today's world, CADx system became a tool for physicians and therefore it is important to have accurate and reliable CADx system. Our pCAD system passed all the significant data mining protocols ensuring all classification parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reliability for all seven feature sets. Further, it shows the dominant behavior of higher order spectra features. Overall, this study shows encouraging results and confirms the ability to develop CADx system for diagnosis of psoriasis and its clinical translation.
