                  In Winkel (2001) a generalization of Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves based on umbral calculus has been introduced. In the present paper we describe new geometric and algorithmic properties of this generalization including: (1) families of polynomials introduced by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985), i.e., families that include both Bernstein and Lagrange polynomial, are generalized in a new way, (2) a generalized de Casteljau algorithm is discussed, (3) an efficient evaluation of generalized Bézier curves through a linear transformation of the control polygon is described, (4) a simple criterion for endpoint tangentiality is established.

                      are popular because of easy elementary arithmetic operations. However, coefficients do not carry much obvious geometric meaning. When geometrically intuitive approximation properties and numeric stability are required, the Bernstein polynomials of degree n

                      in a tangential fashion and follows the course of the control polygon in variation diminishing way. Since the Bézier curve can be intuitively controlled by moving the control points and since there are several efficient evaluation algorithms – de Casteljau, subdivision, blossoming – available, Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves are the cornerstone of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) (Farin, 2001).

However, if the control points are assumed to be fixed for some reason, e.g., in data smoothing, the geometric connection between the control polygon and its Bézier curve is also fixed. Therefore several generalizations that allow a more flexible response of the resulting curve on the control points have been introduced. Most prominent are certainly rational Bézier curves that change the response of the curve to the fixed control points by weighting the control points. Since this approach does not permit changing the resulting curve in a uniform way – one point can only gain attraction at the cost of others – families of polynomials that interpolate between Bernstein and Lagrange polynomials have been invented: the polynomials by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985) reappearing as h-Bernstein bases in Simeonov et al. (2011). These families are further generalized by Farin and Barry (1986) and Barry and Goldman (1991). A generalization of the Bernstein–Lagrange family in a completely different direction is achieved by the generalized Bernstein polynomials introduced in Winkel (2001) (see Theorem 2.1 below).

                        =

                        t
                     , and divide by

Do polynomials exist that fulfill (1.5)? The study of binomial polynomials that fulfill (1.5) is at the center of the Umbral Calculus founded by John Blissard in the 1850's (Bell, 1938) and revived by Gian-Carlo Rota and Steven Roman in the 1970's (Roman and Rota, 1978; Roman, 1984, 1992). In fact, one can find such polynomials for every sequence 
                        
                           
                              a

                      of real parameters. In order to make the present paper self-contained some crucial formulas are repeated here.

                      via formulas (1.8), (1.6) and (1.3) (in this order) is however quite cumbersome, in particular, the final evaluation of (1.11). At first sight the fast algorithms available for the evaluation of Bernstein polynomials do not seem to have a counterpart in the generalized case. However, in Section 4 we show that the generalized Bézier curve can be computed as an (ordinary) Bézier curve of a certain linear

                        )
                     . The examples from Winkel (2001) are revisited in the light of this new computational approach.

We emphasize once more that our generalized Bernstein polynomials and generalized Bézier curves are completely in line with the direction of development that began with the rational case, namely, fix the control points and change the polynomials to get a different response of the resulting curve to the control polygon. The transformation of the control polygon 
                        C
                        (
                        b

                      is not visible and relevant for the designer or data analyst who manipulates the responsiveness of the curve via parameters. In Section 2 we show that the generalized Bernstein polynomials include as special cases the Lagrange and the h-Bernstein polynomials. There we introduce the “responsiveness” c that controls as a master parameter all single parameters of

As a starting point for this investigation we give a summary of simple properties of generalized Bernstein polynomials:

We finally remark that the different q-generalization of Bernstein polynomials fit well into the umbral calculus based framework as displayed here, but we defer the investigation of this topic to another paper.

If the parameter sequence

                      is chosen suitably one gets the Lagrange polynomials. With an additional “master” parameter c one gets a whole family of generalized Bernstein polynomials that interpolates between Bernstein and Lagrange polynomials. This family is identical with the ones described by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985) and reappears in Simeonov et al. (2011) as h-Bernstein bases. The further generalizations of these families by Farin and Barry (1986) and Barry and Goldman (1991) are completely different from our approach. In the following theorem one sees that the “master parameter” c controls the parameter sequence

                        Remark 2.3
                        The proof of Theorem 2.1 showed that the Lagrange polynomials are a “convolution” of the falling factorials. In an analogous way other classical sequences of associated polynomials like exponential polynomials, Gould polynomials, and Abel polynomials (see Roman, 1984) could be used to define corresponding generalized Bernstein polynomials. That this does not seem to lead to geometrically interesting families of polynomials is not surprising, because these polynomials have not been designed with a geometric but rather with combinatorial and other applications in mind. But the choice of the parameter sequence

                            of course leaves much room for geometric exploration.

                     Figs. 3
                     (A), (B) show that the generalized Bézier curves can be stiffer than ordinary Bézier curves, whereas (C) shows a very responsive almost interpolating generalized Bézier curve.


                     Figs. 3(D), (E), (F) show generalized Bézier curves that are attracted or repelled by different parts of the control polygon.


                     Fig. 4
                      shows two well possible but odd variants of generalized Bézier curves: The first is an example that generalized Bézier curves need not be variation diminishing and the second is an example for the curve flipping over when a zero of

As expected in each case the generalized Bézier curve mimics closely the

                            either the choice of i determines j and the sum over j collapses or the choice of j determines i and the sum over i collapses. This gives (4.16)–(4.17).  □
