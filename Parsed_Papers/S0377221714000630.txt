                  This paper discusses the way that different operational characteristics including existing capacity, scale economies, and production policy have an important influence on the capacity outcomes when firms compete in the market place. We formulate a game-theoretical model where each firm has an existing capacity and faces both fixed and variable costs in purchasing additional capacity. Specifically, the firms simultaneously (or sequentially) make their expansion decisions, and then simultaneously decide their production decisions with these outputs being capacity constrained. We also compare our results with cases where production has to match capacity. By characterizing the firms’ capacity and production choices in equilibrium, our analysis shows that the operational factors play a crucial role in determining what happens. The modeling and analysis in the paper gives insight into the way that the ability to use less production capacity than has been built will undermine the commitment value of existing capacity. If a commitment to full production is not possible, sinking operational costs can enable a firm to keep some preemptive advantage. We also show that the existence of fixed costs can introduce cases where there are either no pure strategy equilibrium or multiple equilibria. The managerial implications of our analysis are noted in the discussion. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of the strategic analysis of capacity expansion and well-known

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The objective of this paper is to increase our understanding of how the competitive asymmetries between existing capacities and between investment/production costs affect firm capacity decisions. When a firm faces a challenge from a competitor who can introduce new capacity (either an incumbent firm with existing capacity or a potential entrant), it can be hard to decide whether to respond aggressively to rivals through adding capacity (Hayes, Pisano, Upton, & Wheelwright, 2005). The firm needs to make a trade-off: making no response or making too small a capacity addition will result in accommodating the rival, while making too large a capacity addition will result in unused capacity or depressed prices. Furthermore, capacity decisions affect most, if not all, other operating decisions including production planning and inventory levels, human resource decisions, and decisions on logistics and distribution (Hendricks, Singhal, & Wiedman, 1995). So capacity response in a competitive environment is a crucial operations challenge with a significant impact on firm profitability. An important feature of this paper is that the combined impact of existing capacities and fixed costs of investment is considered in our formal analysis. Thus we can shed light on the means by which ex ante asymmetries in operational factors can influence the firm decision on responding to its rival’s capacity expansion.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

There are two linked ideas that are important in understanding strategic capacity decisions. First, there is the notion that capacity can be accumulated. A firm may have some pre-existing capacity which is then added to by further investment. The second idea is that capacity acts as a constraint on production. Indeed, a firm’s capacity is often defined as its maximum production rate. But research on competitive capacity investment has often dropped the second of these ideas: while maintaining the idea of accumulation, problems of analytic tractability have frequently led researchers to assume that a firm makes decisions on production and capacity at the same time (e.g., Anand & Girotra, 2007; Goyal & Netessine, 2007; Swinney, Cachon, & Netessine, 2011). This leads to a clearance strategy in which a firm will use all of its capacity in production even if this turns out to be to its disadvantage. In our view this is only an appropriate model in cases where a firm has no option to make production decisions before discovering its rival’s capacity choices (such as may occur if there are long lead times for major components); or, needs to maintain high capacity utilization because of high fixed costs of starting and stopping the production process; or, has available some mechanism to make a credible full production commitment to preempt the market (Hayes et al., 2005). Hence even though we use the terminology of a clearance strategy, as is normal in the operations management literature (see Van Mieghem & Dada, 1999), we do not mean to imply that a firm necessarily makes a choice about the strategy to use. It is more likely that a clearance strategy is a consequence of industry structure (Lieberman, 1987b; Goyal & Netessine, 2007).

In many circumstances firms first invest in capacity through building a factory or production line, and then operate the production facility over a period of months or years. When decisions on production quantities are made at a later time, it is often not possible to commit to a certain production level at the time when the capacity investment is made. In such cases firms may well choose to produce at a lower level than their maximum capacity (Hayes et al., 2005) and we refer to this as a holdback strategy following the operations management literature (see Van Mieghem & Dada, 1999). Note that we view the production policy, either holdback or clearance, as a fixed characteristic of the industry, but in practice the situation can be more complicated as firms need to make adjustments over time in response to market conditions. For instance in semiconductor manufacturing a firm may need to cut production when demand levels are falling, since if it sells all its capacity to the marketplace the resulting surplus production can push prices even lower (Wu, Erkoc, & Karabuk, 2005). In this case the degree to which holdback is employed is a function of changing market conditions which are unknown at the outset. However, in this paper we concentrate on the simplest case in which a production quantity is set only once (following the operations literature including Anupindi & Jiang (2008)) and uncertainty in market conditions is sufficiently small that it can be ignored (following the economics literature including Dixit (1980)).

We will assume full information and in this case a firm can deduce its competitor’s capacity investment decisions at the time that it makes its own investment. Thus no further information becomes available and there is nothing to stop a production decision being made at the time of investment (as occurs for example in Rhim, Ho, & Karmarkar (2003)). But holdback production simply reflects the common circumstance that there is no mechanism for commitment to such a production decision in advance (Chen, Venkataraman, Black, & MacMillan, 2002; Hayes et al., 2005). It is unclear in the literature whether, with holdback production, there might be a situation where in equilibrium a firm invests in capacity and this is not used. For example we might guess that when an aggressive large investment can ensure that a competitor will not invest, then this may lead to an equilibrium solution where the investing firm ends with more capacity than is needed. Our detailed analysis will show that this never happens in the holdback setting. Nevertheless using holdback will result in different equilibrium outcomes than the clearance case when only one of the firms invests.

The history of Du Pont fighting with Kerr-McGee in the U.S. bulk chemical industry (see Ghemawat, 1984) illustrates the fact that lead time is important in strategic capacity investment. In this case, the challenger in the industry, Kerr-McGee, announced its own capacity investment plan before the expansion of the incumbent, Du Pont, had fully materialized. The presence of significant lead time for adding capacity provided Kerr-McGee with the ability to force its competitor, Du Pont, to revise its initial capacity plan. This strategic response to a capacity expansion announcement meant that Du Pont was unable to increase its market share and allowed Kerr-McGee to avoid being in the strategically disadvantaged position of investment follower. This case shows that given the long lead time involved in capacity expansion, neither firm can move fast enough to establish a leader–follower environment. Koeva (2000) indicates that average lead time for significant capacity investments is 26months for a range of 23 industries including utilities, chemical plants, and rubber processing plants. Thus, when there is a long lead time, capacity investment is best considered as a simultaneous move competition rather than a sequential move competition.

There is often a significant fixed cost that is incurred in capacity expansion in capital-intensive sectors for line production and process industries such as semiconductors, petrochemicals and flat-panel-monitor manufacturing, where production capacity is expensive and can take a long time to build (Hayes et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005). In an empirical study of the U.S. petroleum refining industry, Asano (2002) shows that the size of fixed cost of investment is important to firms’ investment decisions regardless of firm size. From the point of view of capacity strategy, we might expect that a fixed cost will raise a hurdle against small levels of investment and may make it easier for an incumbent to deter a new entrant by building excess capacity (e.g., Rhim et al., 2003).

In this paper, we will try to unravel the impact of a number of different operational factors mentioned above that can play a part in determining the outcomes of competitive capacity expansion.

We propose a game-theoretical model explicitly addressing the four factors we have mentioned: existing capacity, lead time, production policy, and investment fixed costs. Our work differs from the majority of papers in this area by explicitly considering the ex-ante asymmetries that exist in both existing capacities and investment costs.

By including a pre-existing capacity endowment for the two firms we are able to model both cases with an incumbent and an entrant. We will give a complete analysis including situations where one of the firms has a capacity endowment which is larger than would be optimal. This may happen when the game we analyze comes after some decisions on preliminary investment that are made with an uncertain forecast of the market size. Thus our model can be useful in analyzing the later stages of a more extended strategic competition with uncertainty at the first stage about final demand. Specifically, we are able to discuss a situation in which an incumbent firm has already taken the opportunity to build or buy additional capacity prior to an entering firm deciding on its capacity investment. In this environment an incumbent firm can still take the opportunity to build more capacity at the same time as the entering firm and our model is designed to reflect this.

We model a duopoly where each firm decides to invest (INV) or not to invest (NI), and then chooses its capacity expansion level if it selects the INV strategy. The two firms produce the same or perfectly substitutable product; they both have access to the same deterministic forecast of demand; and, at the production stage, they know the capacity level of the other firm. Thus, after the capacity investment decisions have been made (the capacity game), the firms can evaluate their profit in a capacity-constrained production game. The market price is a function of the total production amount offered to the market by the two firms, and the production policy available to each firm (holdback or clearance) is fixed according to the industry structure.

We first characterize the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the production game and develop a best response function for each firm, given the capacity of its competitor, as a function of the initial capacities, the investment and operational costs, and the market structure parameters. Then, given plausible assumptions that the variable cost of capacity is not too high, we characterize the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in the capacity game with simultaneous decisions. The equilibrium outcome in the alternating decision scheme is developed later for the sake of comparison. In the simultaneous decision setting, we show that all the various equilibrium possibilities can arise depending on the magnitude of existing capacity, even when other problem parameters are fixed. In this paper we will spend most time giving a thorough analysis of the problem with fixed costs, production holdback strategies, and simultaneous capacity decisions. This is the most difficult case to analyze and has been neglected in the literature up to now: arguably, this is the case that occurs most often in practice (see Hayes et al., 2005).

The lead time determines whether the appropriate model is one where the firms move simultaneously or where they move sequentially. Sequential capacity decisions can only occur when the lead time (i.e., the time required to make a firm commitment on capacity) is short enough so that one firm can act prior to its competitor making a capacity decision. In any other case it is better to model the game using simultaneous capacity decisions.

The operations literature on competitive capacity expansion is not very extensive, since most attention has been focused on the monopoly setting: see Van Mieghem (2003) for a comprehensive survey. The majority of capacity expansion models with a single firm have given explicit consideration to fixed costs in order to demonstrate economies of scale in operations (e.g., Ye & Duenyas, 2007). However, most oligopoly models in this research stream ignore the existence of fixed costs in order to obtain analytical results (e.g., Anand & Girotra, 2007; Goyal & Netessine, 2007). For example, Van Mieghem and Dada (1999) consider several firms that produce the same product and face a linear demand curve with a stochastic intercept. Each of the firms has to decide on its capacity, production quantity, and price. They show that the price, capacity, inventory, and profit are increasing in demand variability. They consider firms that all employ holdback in production, but their results rely on firm symmetry to find a subgame perfect equilibrium in pure strategies for capacity competition. We complement this stream of research by incorporating fixed costs into a competitive capacity model without assuming that firms are symmetric (see, e.g., Chevalier-Roignant, Flath, & Trigeorgis, 2011).

We will analyze duopoly models where two firms, with or without existing capacities, strategically invest in capacity in the presence of fixed costs and lead time. Similar models, frequently referred to as “commitment (entry) games” in the industrial organization (IO) literature, use deterministic demand and sunk/fixed costs in order to explain whether or not strategic excess capacity can be built either to deter new entry or to preempt existing rivals (e.g., Spulber, 1981). The entry-deterrence argument is that existing excess capacity enables incumbents to threaten to expand output and cut prices following entry, thereby making entry unprofitable. Hence, deterrence is achieved by intensifying the post-entry competition anticipated by the entrant. This strategic preemption increases the first mover’s profit but lowers overall industry profit through this excess industry capacity (Dearden, Lilien, & Yoon, 1999). Most IO models assume that firms use all of their available capacity (i.e., exercise clearance in production) even if the market-clearing price is below their variable costs. This assumption allows the interactions of firms’ best response functions to be greatly simplified. However, Dixit (1980) and Ware (1984) point out that the pre-commitment is generally not perfect. While the investment decision is irrevocable, the capacity having been invested will be used only if it is profitable to do so (Krishnan & Röller, 1993). In other words, when competing firms can employ holdback in production then it becomes much harder to use a preemptive capacity expansion to deter an entrant. Our paper complements existing IO research by considering a simultaneous move game and allowing each firm to have some existing capacity; this allows a better match to situations that are prevalent in practice.

                      in a duopoly: the firms are profit maximizers and risk neutral. This is a two-stage sequential game: specifically, investments are made in the first period (the capacity game) and production decisions are made in the second period (the production game). At the second stage a firm’s output is subject to its capacity constraint: this is its initial capacity endowment plus any additional capacity arising from the investment in the first stage. We only consider the profits made from decisions on capacity investment in period 1 and production in period 2; so we ignore any production activity that takes place prior to period 2 using pre-existing capacity. Throughout this paper, we assume that all information is common knowledge.

In period 1, each firm can decide to either keep the same capacity level as the existing capacity amount (NI), or increase capacity over the existing capacity amount (INV). At the start of the game, firm i’s pre-existing capacity is

We assume that neither firm can delay its investment decision until it discovers the investment decision of the other; that is, any delay between the two firms’ investment decision is sufficient small so that the first stage can be considered simultaneous. In period 2, the firms simultaneously decide their production quantities (denoted by

                      summarizes the timing of our model. In Section 6 we will briefly discuss an alternating investment decision scheme, where the first stage is a sequential-move noncooperative game and the second stage remains as a simultaneous-move noncooperative game.

                      is the total supply put into the market by the two firms and the demand intercept A is a positive constant. It has been argued that this model with firms competing in quantities (Cournot competition) is appropriate for the description of the medium to long-term equilibrium in a spot market (see Tirole, 1988). Within a capacity constrained environment even allowing Bertrand type price competition can lead to a Cournot competition at the point of capacity investment (Kreps & Scheinkman, 1983). In the same way Anupindi and Jiang (2008) have suggested that price competition can also be modeled in this way if firms have some flexibility to exercise control on quantity through production or delivery. Due to its analytical simplicity, the choice of linear demand is conventional and this is often a good approximation to more general demand functions (see Shapiro, 1986). A downward sloping linear inverse demand curve can also be thought of as the result of utility-maximizing behavior of customers with quadratic, additively separable utility functions (see Singh & Vives, 1984).

In the online Supplementary material, we give the proofs that are not reported in the paper.

We begin with the production game. Suppose that firms have already played the first stage capacity game, and are endowed with capacities

                                 x

                      is unique. This assumption is commonly adopted in the analytical literature to ensure that the marginal cost of production and operations is lower than expected maximum price (i.e., A) and both firms have an incentive to sell positive quantities of their products in the market (see, e.g., Tirole, 1988). It also rules out the trivial case wherein it is never profitable to produce and sell products. In fact, many analytical operations management studies implicitly make this assumption by scaling production costs to zero (e.g., Anand & Girotra, 2007; Goyal & Netessine, 2007; Swinney et al., 2011).

                      maps the first-stage capacity choices onto the second-stage equilibrium output choices, according to Lemmas 1 and 2. The combination of capacity levels gives rise to four possible outcomes of the production game. The four regions identified in the figure are defined as follows:

This result is similar to Eaton and Ware (1987) and Krishnan and Röller (1993), but under different cost functions for investment and production activities.

We can write this assumption as

                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      for

                           2
                        
                     . This is an assumption that will be satisfied in most situations unless the market is very price inelastic and the variable cost of additional capacity is high. It is possible to derive best response functions without making this assumption, but it gives rise to a large number of cases and it is still necessary to make some other assumptions to derive an analytical solution to the capacity game. By introducing this assumption, we can avoid trivialities that capacity levels after the investment are less than the equilibrium outcomes in the production game. As for Assumption 1, this assumption and its variants have been implicitly imposed in many analytical capacity-related studies to ensure that capacity investment is still profitable even if both firms expand their capacity levels at the same time, see Section 5 for the details.

                      being unimodal. In our case it turns out that the functions involved may not be unimodal. Nevertheless, using a careful analysis (given in the proof of the next result) we can show that it is still possible to characterize firm i’s best response in the capacity game for a given capacity choice of firm j and the existing capacity of firm i using the same kind of approach. The result is given in Theorem 1 and a symmetric result holds for the best response of firm j.

After analyzing the production game and the best responses in the capacity game, we now consider the firms’ equilibrium behavior in the capacity game. It will be helpful to begin by defining some preliminary quantities.

In Section 5.1, we will give numerical examples for which no SPNE exists for certain existing capacities, and for which either condition (3) or (4) does not hold. Notice that our results in Theorem 2 and Table 1 are general – without the restriction of conditions (3) and (4) – and only restricted by Assumptions 2 and 3.

The firms’ equilibrium behavior in the capacity game is illustrated in Fig. 4. For the sake of exposition, we will assume that both firms have identical costs in the following discussion. Roughly speaking, if both have low existing capacities in comparison with expected future demand, i.e.,

                     ) the weak firm, with lower existing capacity, can expand its capacity level and force its competitor (with higher existing capacity) not to invest, because the other firm cannot get enough revenue to cover its investment expenditure if both of them were to invest. The strong firm, with higher existing capacity, finds it not worthwhile to make an additional investment facing the aggressive challenger, and the challenger (firm i) finally obtains a larger market share.

Our next result relates to the similarity between holdback and clearance in an equilibrium environment. We will return to this issue in Section 6. Suppose that firm i invests in additional capacity and in the production stage of the game does not use all its capacity. Then a small reduction in investment will not effect the production amounts and will result in reduced investment costs and an improved profit. Hence we obtain the following result (which can also be checked directly by considering the production quantities that occur in the different regions in Table 1).

                           Suppose that there is an equilibrium in which firm i invests in additional capacity, then at the production stage firm i will set its production level equal to its capacity.

                        ) over (NI, INV). Hence, it is possible that a non-equilibrium outcome results since firm i plays one equilibrium strategy of (INV, NI) while firm j chooses the other equilibrium strategy of (

                        ). However, if there exists some process of preplay communication then Schelling argues that the players could become focused on one equilibrium. For instance, if firm i can convince firm j of its persistence in the INV strategy we might well expect them to play (
                           
                              INV

In other words, the existence of fixed costs adds more strategic uncertainty in the capacity game, as suggested by Porter (1980). If there are no clues prior to starting the game (i.e., preplay communication), both firms may simultaneously play the INV strategy aiming for an equilibrium in which the other player does not invest.

                           Remark 1
                           When there are fixed costs of investment, for certain existing capacities in the capacity game there may be either multiple equilibria, or no equilibrium.

This formulation also allows us to investigate the consequences of sunk investment costs (represented by

                        ) then this will enable the investing firm to demonstrate greater commitment – hence allowing more effective preemptive investment strategies in the holdback environment. For example, this could happen if firm i was to commit to purchase raw materials at the same time as building capacity; or if firm i was to choose a higher level of automation. If this effect occurs, we can expect that the region where firm j is able to gain from investing, even though firm i has already built a large capacity, will be reduced. In other words, we expect that the region including

                           Remark 2
                           In a production holdback environment, the ability of a firm to preempt an entering firm can be strengthened by moving a cost from the variable cost of production to the variable cost of investment. Profits for the incumbent will be increased except in cases where there is a large excess initial capacity.

As Porter notes (1980: 101): ‘Perhaps the single most important concept in planning and executing offensive and defensive competitive moves is the concept of commitment. … The persuasiveness of a commitment is related to the degree to which it appears binding and irreversible.’ Previous models have usually treated capacity commitment as employing a production clearance strategy. These results show that in this environment a type of commitment can occur that arises from the structure of the costs of investment and production, even though there cannot be any binding or irreversible determination of the future production level. Furthermore this type of commitment, achieved by advancing production costs, will have a positive impact on firm performance if there is not too large an excess capacity. This is a new observation in model-based capacity strategy research (Ghemawat & Cassiman, 2007). This analytical finding fits the empirical observations in competitive strategy (Chen et al., 2002) and suggests that, in a production holdback environment, a firm may benefit from investing in production lines involving higher investment cost but lower operating costs (for example through opting to use a higher degree of automation).

Our model allows us to consider cases with asymmetric costs between firms. We illustrate how our theoretical results apply to asymmetric cases by exploring the following three examples to gain additional insights. It is noted that all of the examples satisfy Assumption 2.

                               is similar to the famous battle-of-the-sexes outcome. Only if there exists a focal point effect such as preplay communication may we have an expectation on which asymmetric equilibrium will occur. The example implies that a firm with significant cost advantage over the other will choose to invest even if the firm has no existing capacity and its competitor owns high existing capacity, i.e.,

                              . Thus, in this instance building excess capacity is not a good strategy for an incumbent with a cost disadvantage. This is because the production holdback environment does not allow the incumbent to commit to full production, and so building excess capacity does not provide a credible commitment. This outcome is similar to the well-known example of the steel industry, where leading integrated steel mills proved to have no incumbent advantage upon encountering the challenge from entering minimills with a disruptive technology of production (e.g., Christensen, 1997).

                                    =

                              , that is, the incumbent (firm 1) has an incumbent advantage in that its fixed cost has already been spent (or sunk). We leave other parameters unchanged. Therefore, firm 1 has an expansion point function that is the same as its expansion level function. The equilibrium behavior of investment in this example is shown in Fig. 6
                              . If the incumbent’s existing capacity is small in comparison with expected demand, i.e.,

                        , will it be possible for an incumbent to invest aggressively in order to eliminate a potential rival from entering a market.

This discussion demonstrates that excess capacity will often not be an effective strategy when symmetric-cost firms employ holdback in production. We therefore would not expect to see an excess-capacity strategy in a competitive environment in which firms are able to use holdback in their production. This result seems to be supported by empirical observations made by Lieberman (1987c), who looked at the chemical industry over a roughly 25year period and found that excess capacity was very rarely used as an entry deterrent.

In this section we will simplify our analysis to isolate the strategic issues governing capacity investment decisions. We wish to eliminate the effects of asymmetric costs and so we will assume that all capacity and production costs for firms are identical, i.e., cost parity, as does Anand and Girotra (2007). This will allow us to omit the subscripts of parameters and functions in Theorems 1 and 2 in the following.

So far our analysis has relied on two presumptions that we will relax in this section: first that the holdback strategy is available in production, and second that in the first stage capacity decisions are made simultaneously due to the long lead time. Section 6.1 studies the competitive environment when holdback is not possible; and Section 6.2 analyzes alternating capacity decisions – where one firm invests first and the other invests later. This alternating scheme is simpler than the model of simultaneous capacity decisions. By investigating it we want to find out whether the holdback (or clearance) strategy has the same impact on the equilibrium behavior in the sequential-decision scheme as it does in the simultaneous-decision scheme?

In order to understand the difference between employing holdback and clearance, we now analyze investment equilibrium behavior in a simultaneous-move game assuming that firms use clearance as a production strategy (so that firms make decisions on capacity and production at the same time). This is an assumption that has been made by most model-based literature on competitive capacity investment.

From Lemma 4 we know that in the event that both firms choose to invest, then the clearance and holdback strategies will be the same. However, we will see that there are substantial differences in behavior when one firm has excess capacity.

The solutions in the clearance case will involve the simpler functions

                           For an incumbent facing a potential entrant in a production clearance environment, strategic preemption with a large amount of existing capacity can deter the entrant.

In general the production clearance environment is more favorable for the incumbent and less favorable for the potential entrant in comparison with the holdback environment. In the online supplementary material we analyze in more detail the case that the fixed costs are zero and where firm i is an entrant with

                        , and we show that in this case profitability for the incumbent is greater with a clearance environment. Other cases are similar.

By comparing the overall profits arising from holdback and clearance, we obtain:
                           Remark 4
                           A production clearance environment gives more profit for the incumbent and less profit for the potential entrant.

In this section, we consider an alternative capacity-decision scheme that of two firms making investment decisions sequentially, as is often assumed in the commitment literature (see Tirole, 1988). We thus assume that the lead time (or at least time to commit to a certain capacity) is short enough to enable the leading firm to have completed this stage prior to its rival’s investment decision. This makes the analysis much easier compared to the simultaneous decision scheme. Assume that firm i is a leader, firm j is a follower, and both have no capacity ex ante (

                        ). As in Section 5.2, we assume identical costs between the firms in order to isolate the industry issues related to the impacts of holdback and clearance production. Moreover, we take

                                    V

                         without loss of generality.

In addition to analytical simplicity, another useful property of this decision scheme is that we can ignore the effect of fixed costs without loss of generality. Specifically, the leader can easily evaluate whether the entrant enters the market or not by deducting the fixed cost from its revenue. If the entrant’s net profit allowing for the fixed cost is positive, it enters; otherwise, it does not. Note that this property does not hold in the simultaneous decision scheme (see Remark 2). As a result, there are no issues of multiple equilibria and non-equilibrium in the sequential setting. Roughly speaking, there is less strategic uncertainty for a short lead time.

Through a careful analysis given in the on-line supplementary material, the following results are obtained.
                           Remark 5
                           The first-mover advantage always exists in the sequential setting no matter what production policy is employed.

No matter what the decision sequence (simultaneous or sequential move), holdback production always reduces the advantage of having more existing capacity, and clearance production reinforces the advantage.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper develops a game-theoretical model to analyze competitive responses for strategic capacity investment. In particular, we consider the joint effect of several operational characteristics including existing capacity, scale economies, lead time, and production policy on capacity investment in equilibrium. Each firm makes two decisions: choice of capacity and choice of production quantity. The capacity decision sequence (simultaneous or alternating) and production policy (holdback or clearance) are both determined by the competitive environment in which the firms operate. We develop the best response of the firms in the capacity decision and use it to develop the firms’ equilibrium behavior for both simultaneous and sequential investment decisions. After introducing plausible assumptions, we are able to solve the entire game in closed form. One novel element in our model is that competing firms are able to have some existing capacity prior to the start of the competitive capacity investment decisions. Furthermore, our work differs from the capacity-related literature by explicitly considering the ex-ante asymmetries that exist in both existing capacities and investment costs. Our findings provide systematic answers to questions about how to restrain competitive responses to a capacity action:
                        
                           1.
                           The existing literature has shown that making simultaneous moves reduces the commitment implied by ex ante capacity in comparison with a sequential move, see Dixit (1980) and Tirole (1988). We confirm that this result holds under our setting as well, and further show that this effect of move sequence is much stronger for firms in a production clearance environment than in a holdback environment. In other words, the commitment value of ex ante capacity can be reduced when there are both a long lead time to build additional capacity and a production holdback environment. So, operational factors do matter to capacity strategy.

We show that in the production holdback environment, excess capacity cannot deter the entry of the potential competitor no matter how large the existing capacity of the incumbent firm. This is different to the clearance environment where an incumbent with sufficient capacity can deter entry. More generally, in the leader–follower game of capacity investment the first-mover advantage is greater in a clearance environment.

Under holdback production, our analytical result shows that the commitment represented by existing capacity can be strengthened by moving a cost from the variable cost of production to the variable cost of investment. This is an example of commitment being increased as the investment action involves more irreversibility (Chen & MacMillan, 1992; Chronopoulos, Reyck, & Siddiqui, 2011; Hayes et al., 2005). In other words, an incumbent firm has a greater preemptive advantage if its production facilities involve higher investment cost but lower operational cost. Usually this leads to an improvement in the incumbent’s profit (though this improved profit can be canceled out by the additional costs in building an initial excess capacity).

We find that in a production holdback environment fixed costs make the problem of simultaneous investment complicated in two different ways: first they introduce the possibility of multiple equilibria in investment competition, and second fixed costs mean that Nash equilibrium in pure strategies may not exist for some existing capacities. However, these complications only arise when the lead time is sufficiently long. In other words, fixed costs and long lead times increase strategic uncertainty (emerging endogenously from the strategic interactions between competing firms) as argued by Porter (1980). So strategic uncertainty is much greater than is suggested by previous studies that do not consider fixed costs and lead time.

These findings provide practical guidelines for competitive moves in capacity races. For firms in a production clearance environment, an incumbent may consider acting aggressively in investment in order to deter potential entrants, but should act more cautiously in order to maintain its market share facing another incumbent. These ‘asymmetric’ responses have been observed in concentrated industries (Lieberman, 1987a). On the other hand, firms in a production holdback environment, no matter whether they are incumbents or new entrants, should recognize that investment is likely to take place by all parties and hence they need to structure their decisions to avoid industry excess capacity. This type of ‘symmetric’ response has been observed in the brick industry (Wood, 2005). For a potential entrant, entering an industry with production holdback possibilities and long lead times gives a greater chance of success, rather than entering an industry with clearance and short lead times. Overall, an entrant should act with aggressive capacity investment under holdback production, but act passively under clearance production.

A central message of this paper is the importance of the link between a firm’s operations (production policy) and its competitive environment (industry structure, production technology, and its costs of investment and production). This paper makes contributions to theory of operations strategy, in particular for capacity strategy. First we characterize the equilibrium solution of the strategic capacity game in a way that is similar to the well-known
