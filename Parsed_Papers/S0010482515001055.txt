                  Gait accelerometry is an important approach for gait assessment. Previous contributions have adopted various pre-processing approaches for gait accelerometry signals, but none have thoroughly investigated the effects of such pre-processing operations on the obtained results. Therefore, this paper investigated the influence of pre-processing operations on signal features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. These signals were collected from 35 participants aged over 65years: 14 of them were healthy controls (HC), 10 had Parkinson׳s disease (PD) and 11 had peripheral neuropathy (PN). The participants walked on a treadmill at preferred speed. Signal features in time, frequency and time–frequency domains were computed for both raw and pre-processed signals. The pre-processing stage consisted of applying tilt correction and denoising operations to acquired signals. We first examined the effects of these operations separately, followed by the investigation of their joint effects. Several important observations were made based on the obtained results. First, the denoising operation alone had almost no effects in comparison to the trends observed in the raw data. Second, the tilt correction affected the reported results to a certain degree, which could lead to a better discrimination between groups. Third, the combination of the two pre-processing operations yielded similar trends as the tilt correction alone. These results indicated that while gait accelerometry is a valuable approach for the gait assessment, one has to carefully adopt any pre-processing steps as they alter the observed findings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Maintaining balance is a challenging activity for the human body, which is an unstable system if not continuously controlled [1], and an increased impairment of the balance control system corresponds to an increase of gait impairments [2,3]. This highlights the need for clinicians to assess patients׳ gait. Clinicians attempt to accurately describe the health state of a patient via gait analysis in order to diagnose a gait disorder or to decide on a treatment that may improve patients׳ gait [4,5]. When dealing with elderly patients, the assessment of balance while standing and walking has proved to be a predictor of falls [6] and is related to self-rated health status [7], cognitive impairment caused by dementia [8,9], mortality and morbidity [10,11].

Over the years, several approaches have been employed to assess gait. In particular, previous publications have utilized various measurements systems for gait assessment such as camera systems (e.g., [12,13]), body-mounted accelerometers (e.g., [14–22]), force platforms (e.g., [1,13,23]) and gyroscopes (e.g., [24–26]). Force platforms and cameras have the advantage of providing a fixed frame of reference whereas body-mounted systems enable subjects to cover longer distances [14].

Gait accelerometry has become a widely adopted approach [27] due to its reliability, high precision and affordability [28]. It also enables computing a wide range of metrics to evaluate gait [29,30,27,31]. Pre-processing of gait-accelerometry signals may be necessary to remove noise or minimize the effect of gravity [14]. In previous publications it has been argued that a correction of the acceleration measurement is necessary due to the spine lordosis in the L3 region, the imprecise positioning of the accelerometer, and the effect of the gravity component over the measured accelerations [14]. Previous contributions also noticed that gait accelerometry signals can be noisy, and some denoising pre-processing may be needed in order to be able to extract gait features (e.g., [32,33]). However, pre-processing can have unintended consequences such as determining potential group differences when they do not exist. It is therefore logical to question the impact of pre-processing on the extracted gait features.

A multitude of processes can be applied to the acquired signals. In this study, we applied two pre-processing operations used in gait analysis (e.g., [14,31–35]): tilt correction and wavelet denoising. As these are commonly applied pre-processing operations on gait accelerometry signals, the purpose of this paper was to understand their influence on signal features calculated in time, frequency and time–frequency domains using signals from different populations in order to understand whether pre-processing operations have detrimental effects on our ability to discriminate amongst pathological groups. We first extracted features from the raw signals. Then, we examined the effects of tilt correction on the extracted features, followed by the effects of denoising on the extracted features. Lastly, we examined the effects of joint pre-processing, i.e., we applied both operations (correction and denoising) to the raw data. However, to understand whether the order of operations plays a significant role, we examined these effects using a two-step approach. In the first step, we corrected data followed by the denoising operation. In the second step, we denoised the data initially, followed by the correction operation.

Additionally, we explored whether the pre-processing operations affected the calculated acceleration features differently in individuals with and without expected gait abnormalities by examining individuals with Parkinson׳s disease (PD), peripheral neuropathy (PN) and healthy older adults. The possible presence of tremor, rigidity, and spinal inflexibility [36] in PD may impact both the position of the accelerometer and signal quality. Similarly, persons with PN typically walk with a wider base of support [37], which also may impact accelerometer recordings. Thus, pre-processing operations may have a greater impact on the values of the extracted acceleration features for these clinical groups. As use of acceleration-based outcomes measures is gaining grounds in rehabilitation randomized controlled trials, it is imperative that the signal processing methodology becomes standardized, otherwise it will become difficult to comparatively analyze the results of different trials.

The major contribution of this paper is our finding that pre-processing has an impact on extracted gait accelerometry features especially after the application of tilt correction. It was important to understand whether pre-processing schemes have detrimental effects on our ability to gain discrimination across pathological groups, as no previous contribution has ever examined the effects of pre-processing operations on features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. However, we need to point out that the manuscript focuses on two commonly used pre-processing schemes for gait accelerometry signals, and it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript to comprehensively analyze all pre-processing approaches typically found in other areas.

@&#METHODS@&#

A total of 35 patients aged 65years and older were enrolled in the experiment: 14 were healthy controls (HC), 10 had Parkinson׳s disease (PD) and 11 had peripheral neuropathy (PN). All of them could walk without human or mechanical assistance for at least 3min. Details of participant have been reported in a previous study [31]. All subjects were assessed using a structured history and physical examination to ensure that they met the general inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. Potential subjects were excluded if they had any undiagnosed neurological (e.g., abnormal neurological examination such as spasticity, or severe paresis), musculoskeletal or cardiopulmonary conditions or inadequate hearing or vision that would interfere with walking. Additionally, eligibility for HCs required no diagnosed neurological, vestibular or sensory disorders plus biothesiometer reading at the malleolus 
                           <
                           20
                         v bilaterally. PDs had established neurologist diagnosis of Parkinson׳s disease for at least one year according to Hoehn and Yahr scale rating of 2 or 3 and a bioesthesiometer measures reading at the malleolus 
                           <
                           20
                         v bilaterally. Subjects were on a stable dosing schedule of Parkinson׳s medications for the prior three months. Subjects with PN had biothesiometer readings of 
                           ≥
                           40
                         v bilaterally, indicating loss of vibratory sense. Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria completed the baseline assessments that included an overground walk used to determine self-selected treadmill speed.

Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria walked on a computer-controlled treadmill (1.2m wide by 2m long). Safety was ensured by a harness system. An accelerometer was attached firmly to each patient over the L3 segment of the lumbar spine using a belt and a 4-inwide elastic bandage wrapped over the accelerometer and the trunk. Linear accelerations were measured along the medial–lateral (ML), vertical (V) and anterior–posterior (AP) directions and sampled at 100Hz. Participants completed walking trials at their preferred speed (i.e., their comfortable walking speed). To establish preferred speed, the treadmill speed was incrementally increased (e.g., 0.05, 0.10m/s) until a participant reported a comfortable walking speed. Comfortable walking speeds were re-established for each participant by increasing and decreasing treadmill speed [38]. At the beginning of each walking trial there was a ramp up period during which the subject׳s walking speed was slowly increased until their previously established preferred pace was reached. After being accustomed to the instrumentation as well as walking on the treadmill, the subjects performed a 3-min walk at a desired (usual) pace. The average treadmill speed was 1.06±0.014m/s ranging from 0.74m/s to 1.30m/s. No treadmill tilt was used in this experiment.


                        Dynamic tilt correction: In previous publications concerning gait analysis while walking [14,39], it has been argued that a correction of the acceleration measurement is necessary due to the spine lordosis in the L3 region, the imprecise positioning of the accelerometer, and the effect of the gravity component over the measured accelerations. We performed tilt correction using the method developed by Moe-Nilssen [14]. Coordinates of the accelerometer were rotated to earth-vertical (Fig. 1
                        ).

The accelerometer is situated near the L3 lumbar vertebra which minimizes the transverse plane offset rotation of the device. Therefore we assume that the AP acceleration is situated in the sagittal plane.

                        Once these values are known, the estimated accelerations can be calculated.


                        Wavelet denoising: Gait accelerometry signals can be corrupted by noise generated by the measurement device. Therefore, a 10-level discrete wavelet transform using Meyer׳s discrete wavelet and soft thresholding [40] was applied to the data. The wavelet analysis is a signal processing tool used to complement the Fourier analysis for understanding the nonstationary nature of many signals, especially biomedical signals (e.g., [41–45]).

Indeed the Fourier transform decomposes a signal in terms of complex exponential functions

                         are the results of a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). However, the CWT implies an infinite number of dilatation and translation operations, which makes it almost impractical in reality. Hence, there was a need for a method to use a reduced number of dilatation and translation operations, while being able to obtain a good reconstruction of the original signal. In 1989, Mallat proposed an algorithm that implements a fast discrete wavelet transform by using a combination of high- and low-pass filters [48]. This technique is also known as sub-band coding in the signal processing community. Fig. 2
                         describes how the algorithm was designed.

Mallat׳s algorithm provides a signal representation in terms of the decomposition coefficients. These coefficients can be then manipulated to process the signal. Wavelet denoising is a signal operation consisting of applying a threshold on each signal coefficient [40,49]. The threshold T is based on the 1st-level detail signal d
                        1 and was calculated as follows [43]:

                        where med is the median function and n is the length of the signal. The idea is that the coefficients associated with noise are below the threshold value, while the coefficients associated with the signal are above the threshold value. Thus wavelet denoising is a more powerful tool compared to the classical low-pass filtering (e.g., using a Butterworth filter) as it enables to remove noise from the whole frequency spectrum.

After the pre-processing stage, statistical, frequency and time–frequency features were extracted from the acceleration signals.

In order to identify differences between participant groups and processing methods, we fit a series of linear mixed models with each extracted feature as the dependent variable; participant group, processing method and their interaction as fixed effects of interest; and a participant random effect to account for multiple measurements from the same participants and resulting stochastic non-independence of observations. We used appropriately constructed means contrasts to compare processing methods within each participant group, compare participant groups under each processing method, and compare participant group differences across processing methods. To compare anatomical directions, we first computed three anatomical direction differences in each of the extracted feature. Next we fitted a similar linear mixed model with each of the anatomical direction differences as the dependent variable; participant group, processing method and their interaction as fixed effects of interest; and a participant random effect. We used least squares means to estimate anatomical direction differences within each participant group and processing method combination. The significance level α was set to 0.05.

SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses.

                           Group differences: In the ML direction we found that signals retrieved from HC subjects had greater peak frequencies than PD (

The four last detail level coefficients held nearly no energy. Thus, we did not consider these levels any further. Denoising did not affect the energy in the time–frequency bands. However applying correction changed the repartition of the energy. Indeed in the vertical direction the energy of the approximation signal decreased whereas the one in the 10th to the 5th detail signal increased. Depending on the decomposed signal studied differences between groups and anatomical directions were also observed. When both pre-processing operations were applied we could observe similar results to the ones we observed when applying correction only.


                           Group differences: We did not observe significant groups differences in any time–frequency band for accelerations measured along the medio-lateral axis (

                           ). More than 99% of the energy of the V acceleration signals was concentrated in the approximation level. We discarded the rest of the coefficients in the V direction as the detail signals contained insignificant amounts of energy. However, no group differences could be seen along this axis (

                           Anatomical direction differences: For all groups, the a
                           10 coefficients from the V direction contained higher energy than the same coefficients in the ML (

                           ). Also, HCs had higher energy contained in a
                           10 coefficients in the AP direction than in the ML direction (

                           ). In the 7th decomposition level, the energy was higher for signals retrieved along the ML-axis compared to those along the V direction (

                           ) for HC subjects. However no difference was noticed when we compared the signals in the V and AP directions (

                              0.08
                           ). In any direction, no differences were noticed for the other groups (

                              0.2
                           ). We noticed that the energy was lower for d
                           6 signals along the V-axis compared to those along the AP-axis for HCs (

                              0.01
                           ). For all groups, the energy in d
                           5 signals was higher along the ML-axis than the V-axis (

                              0.04
                           ). For PD subjects, we noticed that signals in the ML direction had higher energy compared to the AP direction (

                              0.05

Interestingly we noticed that for each group the entropy values in the V direction were close to 0 while they were higher in the other directions (

                           Group differences: After the correction step, we noticed that the energy in wavelet decomposition levels was repartitioned for every group in every direction. HCs had higher energy than PD subjects along the ML-axis in the d

                           Anatomical direction differences: When we analyzed the a
                           10 signals there was no significantly different energy between signals in the V and AP directions for PD and PN subjects (

                              0.05
                           ). For healthy subjects we were not able to distinguish between signals in the AP and the ML directions (

                              0.06
                           ). Similarly for PD subjects, we were not able to distinguish between signals along the V-axis and the ML-axis (

                              0.05
                           ). The signals in the 8th decomposition level followed the same trend as the corresponding corrected signals while d
                           7 and d
                           6 signals followed the same trend as the corresponding raw signals. Lastly we analyzed d
                           5 signals and we noticed for PNs that energy was higher in signals in the ML direction compared to accelerations in the AP direction (
                              p

                           ).

The entropy of signals in the ML direction was not significantly different from one of the signals in the AP direction for the PD group (
                              p

                           Groups differences: Similar to the corrected signals the repartition of the energy was different. In the ML direction, the energy in the approximation signal a
                           10 was higher for PD subjects than for HC ones (

                           Group differences: The results were very similar to the ones we found in the previous step. Energy in signals from PD subjects was higher than in signals measured on HCs in the V direction (

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The major impact of this work is on the analysis of gait accelerometry signals. Our results conclusively show that pre-processing operations such as tilt correction can yield additional discrimination amongst patient groups, while other pre-processing operations such as wavelet denoising have no impacts on discriminatory patterns observed in gait accelerometry signals. Our findings therefore imply that it is beneficial to not only pre-process gait accelerometry signals, but also imply that during a gait assessment procedure, accelerometers do not need to be positioned perfectly perpendicular to the walking surface, as the tilt correction procedure can be used to remove the tilt effects without detrimental effects on the analysis results. We successfully extracted features in time, frequency, time–frequency domains. In the time domain, by applying the tilt correction, we were able to distinguish between healthy controls and subjects with Parkinson׳s disease and peripheral neuropathy. Specifically, we observed greater skewness for subjects suffering from peripheral neuropathy than for healthy controls in the medio-lateral direction. Nevertheless, no difference between participants having Parkinson׳s disease and peripheral neuropathy could be observed using this feature. Concerning harmonic ratios, using the original data the only group differences found were between healthy controls and persons with Parkinson׳s disease, where controls exhibited greater walking symmetry in all directions of motion. The tilt correction led to further discrimination between the groups and showed that participants with peripheral neuropathy had a greater symmetry than those with Parkinson׳s disease, whereas healthy controls had a greater symmetry than subjects with peripheral neuropathy. Also the tilt correction showed that every group had a harmonic ratio higher in the vertical than in the anterior–posterior direction.

In the frequency domain and after tilt correction was applied, peak frequencies in the medio-lateral direction and the spectral centroids in the anterio-posterior direction allowed to distinguish between controls and clinical groups. Also, the bandwidth of signals for subjects with peripheral neuropathy was greater than that for healthy control in the anterior–posterior direction after applying tilt correction.

Time–frequency features were the most difficult to analyze. An obvious observation is that the application of tilt correction changed the energy repartition for every group especially in the vertical direction. The energy was transferred from the approximation signal representing low frequencies to the six first detail signals representing higher frequencies. However it was difficult to distinguish between groups using the features in this domain.

Denoising had practically no effect on the calculated characteristics since, as shown on Fig. 3, the signals had a low level of noise. Finally, when applying both correction and denoising we observed that the results were most of the time the accumulation of the results found when we applied the preprocesses separately.

We believe that tilt correction should be applied to gait accelerometry signals regardless of one׳s intends to analyze gait accelerometry axes independently, as in this paper, or jointly through a resultant vector. With no tilt corrections, the resultant vector denoting walking acceleration would point to an incorrect direction, even if the three anatomical axes are analyzed jointly.

The presented results open up a potential research area dealing with the gait assessment using smart phones. We believe that our results are applicable in those cases as well, as long as smart phones are affixed to a human body in order to avoid non-motion related acceleration components.

Additional features can be extracted if accelerometers are attached to legs/ankles. These additional features can be very advantageous for machine learning applications, which aim to differentiate gait among different pathological groups. However, it may be difficult to relate every feature to a clinical outcome. In these cases, advanced machine learning approaches such as neural networks and artificial intelligence algorithms are suitable to relate a group of features to specific clinical outcomes. These machine learning algorithms can be also used to differentiate between patient groups if needed.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

As accelerometry becomes more widely used to assess age- and disease-related differences in the motor control of walking and changes in gait control with rehabilitation, it is critical that researchers adopt similar methods of pre-processing acceleration data. This will allow for valid comparisons of findings across studies. In this paper, we pre-processed gait accelerometry signals using different techniques in order to understand the impact on the extracted signal features in time, frequency and time–frequency domains. Specifically, we examined the effects of tilt correction and denoising as well as their combined effects. Our data indicate that denoising had minimal or no effect on extracted signal features while tilt correction yielded additional discrimination between healthy and clinical groups. Hence, while denoising may not be necessary for pre-processing of the acceleration signals, tilt correction is recommended as an important component of their pre-processing. Future studies should therefore consider pre-processing gait accelerometry signals before extracting any features.
