                  The paper contributes to the contemporary research on bank efficiency in India. We analyze the efficiency dynamics of the Indian banking industry from 2004 to 2012. Based on the recent methodological developments of the conditional and unconditional directional distances introduced by Daraio and Simar (2014), we apply a conditional directional distance estimator in order to analyze the dynamic effects of industry’s performance levels. The results indicate that foreign banks perform better compared to national and domestic private banks. There is also evidence of technological change at the period before the Global Financial Crisis. However during and after the Global Financial Crisis these gains diminished. The evidence suggests that national banks fail to sustain their high performance levels gained after the industry’s restructuring period. Finally, the findings support the view that ownership structure affects banks’ technical efficiency levels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We find that despite the fact that the Indian financial system has undergone substantial changes including the negative effect of the Global Financial Crisis in last two decades there is a gap in the efficiency and productivity literature on Indian banking. In particular, there is a limited number of studies that analyze the changes within the Indian banking sector after the consolidation and liberalization process i.e. after the second half of 2000s). Most of the relative literature includes the period of 1990s and early 2000s (Bhattacharyya & Pal, 2013; Bhaumik & Dimova, 2004; Casu, Ferrari, & Zhao, 2013; Das & Ghosh, 2006; Das, Nag, & Ray, 2005; Kumbhakar & Sarkar, 2003; Ray & Das, 2010; Sahoo & Tone, 2009; Sanyal & Shankar, 2011; Shanmugam & Das, 2004; Tabak & Tecles, 2010; Zhao, Casu, & Ferrari, 2010). Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) and Fujii, Managi, and Matousek (2014) focus on the recent developments in the Indian banking sector.

By incorporating the latest developments the paper applies a time-dependent conditional directional distance function estimator and examines the efficiency dynamics of Indian banking sector for the period of 2004–2012. Based on the introduction of the time-dependent conditional full and partial frontiers (Mastromarco & Simar, 2014), the probabilistic characterization of the directional distance functions-DDF (Simar & Vanhems, 2012) and the new developments of the operational aspects for computing conditional and unconditional directional distances (Daraio & Simar, 2014),
                        1
                        
                           Daraio and Simar (2014) have extended the work by Bădin, Daraio, and Simar (2012) by introducing the operational aspects for computing conditional and unconditional directional distances and their robust versions.
                     
                     
                        1
                      we propose an innovative application of the original range directional distance model-RDM (Portela & Thanassoulis, 2010; Portela, Thanassoulis, & Simpson, 2004). The applied methodology enriches current research since it enables time effects on the efficiency measurement over the examined time period. Specifically a data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimator of directional distance functions is applied which is conditioned on time under the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS) using a range directional distance.
                        2
                        As has been noted by Portela et al. (2004, p.1113–1114), strictly under the assumption of VRS the RDM model is translation invariant and unit invariant.
                     
                     
                        2
                      By conditioning on time we will be able to analyze the efficiency behavior of Indian banks over the examined period, thus taking into account the dependence of data generating process (DGP) on time effects over the period of financial crisis.
                        3
                        This implies that the applied estimator does not assume that the separability condition holds between time and the boundaries of the attainable set (Simar & Wilson, 2007, 2011).
                     
                     
                        3
                     
                  

We contribute to the banking literature in two distinct ways. First due to its empirical application our paper complements and extends the recent study by Fujii et al. (2014). By introducing the dynamic element into our model we will be better positioned to explore the changes in the Indian banking system. The second contribution of the paper lies in the applied methodological framework that has not been used in the banking literature yet. The applied DEA estimator is based on the latest advances of the conditional directional distance functions (Daraio & Simar, 2014) and on the recent introduction of time-dependent conditional DEA estimators (Mastromarco & Simar, 2014). Therefore the applied approach is able to analyze the dynamic effects of banks’ efficiency levels before and after the period of financial crisis without assuming the separability condition (Simar & Wilson, 2007, 2011).

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the relative literature. Section 3 describes the dataset and presents the applied methodological approach. Section 4 discusses the empirical results, whereas the last section concludes the paper.

Since the rapid growth of Indian economy over the last decade we have observed an additional increase in investment rates and savings (OECD, 2011). Herd, Koen, Patnaik, and Shah (2011) emphasized that the implemented reforms of Indian economy

                           4
                         have increased saving rates during the 1980s and especially during the early 2000s to a comparable levels with other East Asian economies.


                        Bhattacharyya, Lovell, and Sahay (1997a), Bhattacharyya, Bhattacharyya, and Kumbhakar (1997b) discussed that the banking reforms started in 1955 with the setup of State Bank of India. This was later followed by the nationalization of 14 major commercial banks. This policy aimed to break the monopolistic control, spread banking services, mobilize deposits and enhance credit planning as part of national economic planning. In 1980 a second round of nationalization was implemented. However, in the 1980s it was evident that nationalized banks could not compete with private and foreign banks in terms of bank profitability and service quality.
                           5
                           The Indian banking system is composed by three groups of banks: the public-sector banks (or national banks), the private banks and the foreign banks.

                        Herd et al. (2011) argued that during the late 1980s more than 90% of total bank assets were owned by national (state owned) banks. This share was changed after the financial liberalization.

                           For an extensive historical analysis of the Indian banking sector see Sarkar and Bhaumik (1998), Sarkar, Sarkar, and Bhaumik (1998), Kumbhakar and Sarkar (2003) and Fujii et al. (2014).
                        
                        
                           6
                         As a reaction of the deteriorated position of state-owned banks, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), based on the recommendations by of the first Narasimham Committee on Financial Sector Reforms, initiated major reforms in 1991. These reforms were aiming to enhance bank competition and increase bank efficiency and profitability. Koeva (2003, p.4) showed that this financial liberalization was based mainly on five key reforms: (1) interest rate liberalization, (2) reduction in reserve requirements, (3) entry deregulation, (4) credit policies and (5) prudential supervision. As a result during the early 2000s industry concentration has declined, bank profitability and the cost of financial intermediation has decreased and finally, the profitability of national banks have decreased compared to the private and foreign banks. After the mid 2000s and especially in the early stage of the Global Financial Crisis the authorities in India assumed that bank reforms improve bank stability and the banking should be able to withhold external shocks. However, as Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) showed there have been an increased deposit flights and in interbank borrowing rates since the mid 2008. Depositors transferred their financial funds from foreign and private banks to government owned and operated banks. Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) showed that the national banks have faced a faster deposit growth compared to the whole Indian financial system. Finally, they provided evidence that the majority of deposits directed towards the well known (largest) public banks.

Deposits reallocation caused the destabilization in the segment of small and medium-sized private and foreign banks. In addition, this affected bank stability and their performance. Bank efficiency levels dropped because of several reasons. Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) argued that bank inefficiency has increased due to the fact that other banks hold more capital for the shake of liquidity and the reassure of their depositors. In addition the belief that government protects the deposits for the largest public-sector banks decreased efficiency of the other banks and encouraged risk taking.

One of the first studies analyzing the performance of Indian banks during the early stages of economic liberalization is the one conducted by Bhattacharyya, Lovell, and Sahay (1997a). By combining both DEA and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) they analyzed the efficiency of 70 Indian commercial banks over the period of 1986–1991. Their results indicated that public owned banks are most efficient, followed by foreign owned and public banks. However, they emphasized that foreign banks raised considerably their efficiency levels during the end of the examined period mainly due to their ability to extend their branch networks into metropolitan areas. Bhattacharyya, Bhattacharyya, and Kumbhakar (1997b) analyzed the productivity growth of the Indian public sector banks for the post-nationalization period (1970–1992). They provided evidence that nationalization boosted productivity growth especially during the period of economic liberalization. Furthermore the results indicated that deregulation accelerated Indian banks’ technical progress by creating a competitive environment. Sarkar and Bhaumik (1998) investigated the effect of deregulation on competition in the Indian banking sector for the period of 1980–1998. They provided evidence that post deregulation in the banking industry did not revealed any significant changes of banks’ efficiency either for public and private banks. Despite the more deregulated environment, the little change of industry’s efficiency levels was attributed mainly to the oligopolistic dominance of public sector banks and the inability of the policy makers to control the distortions caused by the regulated interests and excessive branch expansion over the last 25years.

Furthermore, Sarkar et al. (1998) provided evidence for the period 1993–1995 that the absence of well functioning capital markets in Indian banking sector resulted on weak ownership effects of private banks over public banks. Additionally, their results indicated greater performance levels of foreign banks compared to domestic banks. Similar results have been obtained in the study conducted by Kumbhakar and Sarkar (2003) investigating the relationship between deregulation and total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the Indian banking sector over the period 1985–1996. Their findings indicated the presence of distortion in input prices for the public banks. For the case of private banks they have found a decline of distortion in the post regulation period. Furthermore, they provided evidence that TFP growth of private bank is slighter higher than the public sector banks and was driven mainly by the scale component. However, they suggested that even though there has been a significant decline in regulatory distortions the increased levels of TFP growth were below the overall expectations suggesting that TFP growth had not materialized during the examined post regulation period.

For the period of 1992–1999, Shanmugam and Das (2004) employed a stochastic frontier function methodology examining the efficiency of 94 Indian banks. They came to the conclusion that state and foreign banks were more efficient during the examined period. In addition they suggested that during the reform period banks’ performance levels were relative high in terms of raising non-interest income, investments and credits. However, they reported that the reforms made in 1992 did not help the banks in raising their interest margin. Bhaumik and Dimova (2004) examined the performance of Indian banks after industry’s deregulation and for the period 1995–2001. They showed that in the second half of the 1990s the private sector and foreign banks performed better than public sector banks. However, at the end of the examined period public sector banks increased their performance levels and closed the performance gap.

For the period 1992–2002, Das and Ghosh (2006) employed three different DEA estimators using the intermediation, the value-added and the operating approach in order to measure Indian banks’ technical efficiency levels. Their results indicated that during the liberalization period banks’ efficiency levels were not significantly increased.
                           7
                           However, Ghosh, Harding, and Phani (2008) provided empirical evidence that during the days in which Reserve Bank of India issued a circular that signalled policy liberalization, private sector and nationalized banks reported significant value gains.
                        
                        
                           7
                         Moreover, they reported that public owned banks performed better compared to the private and foreign banks.
                           8
                           In fact several other studies examining Indian banks’ efficiency levels for similar periods have came to the same conclusion (Das et al., 2005; Ram Mohan, 2002; Ram Mohan & Ray, 2004; Sensarma, 2005).
                        
                        
                           8
                         
                        Sahoo and Tone (2009) have examined a sample of 71 Indian banks over the period of 1998–2005 by applying non-radial DEA models. They provided evidence that after the reform in 2002 the performance of all the banks (regardless the ownership structure) had increased. Ray and Das (2010) estimated via DEA cost and profit efficiency during the post-reform period of the Indian banking industry. In contrast with the findings by Sahoo and Tone (2009), Ray and Das (2010) provided evidence that ownership categories determined banks’ efficiency levels. Furthermore, they reported a rightward-shift of the efficiency distributions over the years which is attributed mainly to the performance of the state owned banks.


                        Tabak and Tecles (2010) applied a Bayesian stochastic frontier examining both cost and profit efficiencies of the Indian banking sector for the period 2000–2006. They provided evidence that national banks are most efficient followed by private and foreign banks. They showed that there is performance convergence of all banks over the examined period. Also they suggested that the presence of foreign banks has increased competition and therefore has been very beneficial for the Indian banking industry. Zhao et al. (2010) examined the performance of Indian banking industry over the period 1992–2004 applying a stochastic frontier model. They have found that public banks performed better than foreign banks, however, foreign banks reacted more quickly to the changes imposed in the Indian regulatory environment. They provided evidence that the main impact of the deregulation was the increased competition and the initiation of performance improvement of the Indian banks. For the same period of time (i.e. 1992–2004), Sanyal and Shankar (2011) have examined the productivity levels of the Indian banking industry by applying the Levinsohn–Petrin production function technique. They showed that Indian private banks had higher productivity levels than both public and foreign banks. Under the effect of competition they provided evidence that the new Indian private banks and foreign banks have decreased their productivity levels, whereas the productivity levels of public banks remained unaffected. Finally, they suggested that only the old private banks have reacted positively to the increased competition by increasing their productivity levels. For the period of 1996–2005, Das and Kumbhakar (2012) proposed a hedonic aggregator function within input distance function framework analyzing the efficiency and total factor productivity (TFP) of the Indian banking industry for the period 1996–2005. Their results indicated that during that period banks have improved their efficiency levels, with the state owned banks to perform much better compared to private banks.

Recently, Casu et al. (2013) estimated for the period 1992–2009 both parametric and nonparametric efficiency frontiers providing evidence of productivity growth of the Indian banking sector. They suggested that this growth was attributed mainly to technological progress, indicating that foreign banks have used the best available technology in the industry based on cost technology innovations. In contrast with the pre-mentioned study, Bhattacharyya and Pal (2013) examined the period 1989–2009, suggesting that public sector banks show higher efficiency levels compared to the foreign and private banks. However, they also agreed that the initial phase of reform had a positive effect on industry’s efficiency levels. Regardless, the extensive literature on efficiency measurement of Indian banking sector, so far, only the study by Fujii et al. (2014) examined the efficiency and productivity of the Indian banking industry in the second half of the 2000s (i.e. after the liberalization and consolidation process and before and after the financial crisis). They have used a directional Russell measure of technical inefficiency allowing for the inclusion of undesirable outputs.
                           9
                           They are referring to as Weighted Russell Directional Distance Model (WRDDM) which initially has been introduced by Chen, Yu, Managi, and Chang (2011) and Barros, Managi, and Matousek (2012).
                        
                        
                           9
                         Furthermore, by extending their model they have measured TFP change and its decomposition. This approach can incorporate undesirable outputs (i.e. not performing loans-NPLs)
                           10
                           For implications when including NPLs in bank efficiency measurement see the studies by Berger and Mester (1997) and Berger and DeYoung (1997).
                        
                        
                           10
                         in order to measure banks’ inefficiency levels. They have applied a directional vector which in banks’ production process framework evaluates their inefficiency levels by allowing desirable outputs to expand and undesirable outputs and/or inputs to contract. They indicated that foreign banks had strong market position and with higher efficiency levels compared to the public owned and private banks. Finally, they argued that the efficiency gains of public owned banks (reported by previous studies) were temporary failing to take advantage of the consolidation and restructuralization process supported by the Indian government.

It is evident that the efficiency and productivity of the Indian banking sector has been extensively examined up to mid 2000s. The majority of the studies have used both nonparametric and parametric techniques in order to measure banks’ efficiency and productivity levels based on their ownership structure. The results presented are contradictive based on the period and the methodology adopted. To our knowledge the only study that examines the productivity levels of the Indian banking sector after the mid 2000s is the one conducted by Fujii et al. (2014). Therefore, this paper fills this gap of the literature providing further empirical evidence using the latest development of the probabilistic characterization of the directional distance functions. As a result we emphasize the dynamic effects of the Global Financial Crisis on the efficiency levels of the Indian banking sector.

A production process can be modeled either by the production approach or by the intermediation approach. As suggested by Berger and Humphrey (1997) the intermediation approach for modeling bank’s production function is more appropriate when we evaluating bank efficiency. Under the intermediation approach (Sealey & Lindley, 1977), banks are considered as intermediates of financial services utilizing financial liabilities and physical factors into financial assets. In the lines of several other studies (Berger, 2007; Berger & Mester, 1997) the inputs used are fixed assets, employee number and deposits, whereas the outputs are loans and other earning assets.

                        Based on the Farrell–Debreu input distance (Debreu, 1951; Farrell, 1957) a bank operating at a point (x,
                        y) is determined by the radial distance between that point and the efficient frontier. This in turn indicates bank’s ability to reduce the input quantities given that the initial level of outputs can still be produced. This can be represented as:

                        This range directional vector refers to the range of possible improvement (input reduction in our case) of a specific bank k′. According to Portela et al. (2004) and Portela and Thanassoulis (2010) these range assumes the existence of an ideal point with minimum inputs observed. Initially the RDM has been introduced in order to handle negative data, however, in this paper is applied due to its ability to impose non arbitrary targets. As such it imposes attainable targets “that either least or alternative most challenging to attain” (Portela & Thanassoulis, 2010, p. 1473).

                        Mastromarco and Simar (2014) applied Bădin et al. (2012) methodology to investigate the impact of time on the performance of units without assuming the separability condition between the attainable sets and the time.
                           17
                           Most of DEA-based banking studies when handling panel data assume that the separability assumption between the attainable sets and time holds. The implications of such an assumption are highlighted by Simar and Wilson (2007, 2011).

                         Therefore, they estimated the effect of time on the frontier shifts and on the distribution of the estimated efficiencies. Based on Mastromarco and Simar (2014, p.5) we can consider the time T as a conditioning variable and we can define Ψt
                         for each time period t as the set of combinations of inputs and outputs feasible at time t. Given that

                        . This also involves the use of kernels with compact support and the calculation of optimal bandwidths (smoothing parameters). For this study the bandwidth estimation has been obtained following Bădin, Daraio, and Simar (2010) procedure, which is based on Least Squares Cross-Validation-LSCV (Hall, Racine, & Li, 2004; Li & Racine, 2007). Even though that the variable T is discrete (and discrete kernels can be applied), we follow the suggestion by Mastromarco and Simar (2014) using continuous kernels.
                           18
                           They suggest that it is more appropriate to use continuous kernels when the discrete variable takes many different values.

                        Moreover and strictly under the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS) the DEA estimator in (14) has been proven to be translation invariant and unit invariant (Portela et al., 2004, p. 1113–1114). Furthermore the DEA estimator for the time-dependent conditional directional distance function (Eq. (13)) for a bank k′ given that t

                         indicates an inefficient bank. This study follows Portela and Thanassoulis (2010, p.1473) and present the unconditional and conditional measures in efficiency rather than inefficiency terms. This input efficiency measures reflect the distance between observed and target input levels. According to Portela et al. (2004) and Portela and Thanassoulis (2010) the observed and target levels are compared indirectly via an ideal unobserved unit.

Based on Daraio and Simar (2014, p. 362) the only difference between the two estimators presented in (14) and (15), is that the estimator presented in (15) describe the local directional distance estimates which are the product of the localizing procedure estimating conditional directional distance function which are determined by the data points in a neighborhood of t. As a result the applied estimator is able to account directly for dynamic effects. This is very suitable for our analysis since it is enabling us to incorporate directly the effects of the Global Financial Crisis period on the estimated efficiency levels.

Finally, by following Daraio and Simar (2014) that extended Bădin et al. (2012)’s approach to conditional directional distances, we can identify the effects on the frontier (frontier shift) of the external variable (in our case time T). This can be obtained if we examine the ratios of conditional to unconditional efficiency measures:

                        Furthermore, we can look these ratios as a function of time (t) and therefore we can investigate the effect of time on the potential shift of banks’ frontier if for a particular level of t there is a shift in the frontier in the direction

                        . For this reason we are using the local linear estimator (Fan, 1992, 1993) in order to regress time on the ratios of the conditional to unconditional efficiency measures. For the input oriented case a decreasing nonparametric regression line indicates a favorable effect of time on banks’ efficient frontier (i.e. the conditional frontier moves up to the unconditional one), whereas an increasing nonparametric line indicates an unfavorable effect.

                        19
                        As explained previously even though the results have been obtained from directional distance functions the transformation by Portela and Thanassoulis (2010) is applied in order to present the estimates in terms of efficiencies rather than inefficiencies. The analytical results are available upon request.

                      When we analyze the original efficiency levels of Indian banks (i.e. the average efficiency levels of all banks), we observe an overall 10% increase in technical efficiency over the examined period. A similar increase is also reported if we account for time effects (conditional efficiency scores). Casu et al. (2013) showed that the changes in regulatory regime enhanced the presence of foreign banks in the industry which in turn have boosted industry’s productivity levels.

The analytical results based on banks’ ownership structure both for the original and conditional estimates reveal an overall increase in banks’ efficiency levels over the examined period. Under the original estimates it appears that national banks remain more stable in term of their efficiency levels during and after the period of financial crisis. This can be observed firstly by examining closely the standard deviation values (Std). The standard deviation values of national banks are reported significantly lower compared to the foreign and private banks indicating lower fluctuations of their efficiency levels. This is evident particularly from 2008 to 2012. Secondly we can notice that for the same period the minimum value (Min) of national banks’ technical efficiency scores (under the original estimates) is significantly higher compared to the private and foreign banks. An explanation of this phenomenon may be attributed to the recent findings presented by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) indicating that from 2008 banks experienced a sharp increase in interbank borrowing rates and deposit flight, when the depositors shifted their money towards national (government owned) banks.

Under the time effect, the efficiency estimates present a different view of banks’ performance levels. In this case, the reported standard deviation values of their conditional efficiency scores are similar for all banks (compared also to the industry’s standard deviation values). Moreover, it is observed that for all banks the standard deviation values of the obtained efficiency estimates are high. This is particularly observed during the period of Global Financial Crisis presenting a view of a high volatility among the performance of banks during that period. This is in contrast with a general view that the Indian banking industry was insulated from the Global Financial Crisis due to conservative management. The results confirm evidence of performance instability, which are also reported in the study conducted by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013). They present evidence that Global Financial Crisis has a direct impact on the Indian banking sector, especially on the performance of domestic private banks.

Moreover, when we examine the minimum efficiency values of the conditional estimates we observe that foreign banks have closed the performance gap from national banks (compared to the original efficiency estimates). Our results confirm the findings by Casu et al. (2013) and Fujii et al. (2014) that show that after the mid 2000s foreign banks have enhanced their performance mainly due to the adaption of cost innovation technologies and the inability of national banks to take advance of the consolidation and restructuralization process.


                     Fig. 1
                      presents the distributions of unconditional and conditional (time depended) technical efficiency estimates.
                        20
                        For this purpose we have used the integrated ‘R’-package ‘hdrcde’ applying Hyndman’s (1996) density quantile algorithm. The software has been developed by Rob J. Hyndman and is available from: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hdrcde/index.html.

                      We apply nonparametric kernel density estimates to visualize the distribution of the estimated efficiencies. Fig. 1a presents the distributions of unconditional (left graph) and conditional (right graph) efficiencies of the entire sample and period. In both cases there is evidence of bimodal distribution and there is a concentration around a 100% level of efficiency.

However, the distribution of original estimates suggests that there is also a second concentration around 90% level of efficiency. This is presented by a second peak positioned left to the main peak. Moreover, when we look at the distributions of the conditional technical efficiency scores we have a similar picture as previously. This time the second peak is located at around 70% level of efficiency, indicating a lot of banks have decreased their efficiency levels when we account for dynamic effects. The bimodal distribution is also confirmed for the case of national banks (Fig. 1b). Here again we have the main concentration around 100% level of efficiency both for the conditional and the unconditional case. However, the second peak for the original estimates is around 87% level of efficiency, whereas for the conditional case this drops at around 65% level of efficiency. In addition the longer left tail (for the conditional estimates-right graph) demonstrates that when we account for the effect of time, then the number of inefficient national banks tend to increase.

In the case of private banks (Fig. 1c) the results indicate a relative symmetric shape of the distribution of banks’ efficiency scores, both for the original and the conditional estimates. Under the original estimates, the efficiencies’ estimates are located at around 60%, where as under the effect of time the peak is wider (i.e. platykurtic), with the efficiencies being more dispersed and ranging from 50% to 70%. For the case of foreign banks (Fig. 1d) we observe two leptokurtic distributions for the unconditional and conditional case. Both distributions have their main concentration around 100% level of efficiency. However, under the original technical efficiencies estimates it is observed a longer left tail indicating a reasonable amount of foreign banks performing at a lower technical efficiency level.

Finally, if we compare the distributions of the Indian banks based on their ownership structure we can conclude (both for the original and the conditional estimates) that foreign banks perform better, with national banks coming second and domestic private banks being the lowest performers. The results support the recent results by Fujii et al. (2014) that show that foreign banks have strong market position. This is also in line with findings by Casu et al. (2013). They report that foreign banks use the best available technology in order to enhance their competitiveness.


                     Fig. 2
                      presents diachronically the number of banks with efficiency levels below and above industry’s average efficiency value both for the original and the conditional estimates. Fig. 2a and b present an overview of the Indian banking sector both for the unconditional (original) and conditional (time dependent) efficiency scores. In general terms is observed that when we account for the dynamic effects (Fig. 2b) fewer banks are having efficiency scores above industry’s average efficiency score in comparison with the original estimates (Fig. 2a). When we look at the original estimates (Fig. 2c, e and g) we observe clearly that the majority of banks both for national and foreign banks are having performance levels above industry’s average efficiency value. However, the majority of domestic private banks are having efficiency scores below industry’s average performance level.

If we account for dynamic effects (Fig. 2d, f and h) we provide evidence that the majority of foreign banks, diachronically perform above industry’s average performance level. The second performers are the national banks and again the last performers are the private banks. The results again support our previous findings and the evidence provided by Fujii et al. (2014) suggesting that after the mid 2000s foreign banks are performing better compared to the national and private banks.

Finally, Fig. 3
                      provides the effect of time on banks’ efficient boundary. Based on Daraio and Simar (2014), by allowing the time dimension as an exogenous variable we are able to account for dynamic effects, especially during the period of Global Financial Crisis. As a result we may observe how those effects impact on banks’ technological change (shift of the frontier).

As analyzed previously the second stage analysis provides a visualization of the time effect on banks’ efficient boundary. Therefore here a nonparametric smoothed regression of

                      over t is applied and in order to investigate the effect of time on the boundary (shift of the frontier).

                        In order to observe the effects on the distribution of the inefficiencies robust measures must be applied which is left to a future research. Furthermore the graphs present the bootstrapped pointwise error bounds (Hayfield & Racine, 2008; Racine, 2008).

                      For the input oriented case (as in this analysis) an increasing regression line indicates an average negative effect of time (the conditional efficient frontier lies below the unconditional one, i.e. as if time would act as an undesired output). Furthermore, a decreasing regression line would indicate an average positive effect (the conditional efficient frontier moves up to the unconditional one when time increases, i.e. as if time would act as an additional free disposal input), whereas a horizontal line would indicate a neutral effect.


                     Fig. 3a indicates a ‘U’ shape relationship between time and bank industry’s efficiency levels. Given that the paper examines the period 2004–2012, it appears that there is a positive effect up to 2008 (fifth year on the horizontal axis). This indicates a shift on the frontier suggesting an acceleration of industry’s technological change. However, after 2008 the effect becomes negative (an increasing regression line). This finding supports the empirical evidence from several studies (Casu et al., 2013; Ray & Das, 2010; Sahoo & Tone, 2009; Tabak & Tecles, 2010) suggesting that the Indian banking sector has initially produced increased productivity levels after the consolidation and restructuralization process. However, the findings also support the study by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) suggesting that the period of Global Financial Crisis has affected the Indian banking sector.
                        22
                        This is presented from the increasing part of the nonparametric regression line in Fig. 3a.

In a similar fashion we can analyze the effect of time on banks’ efficient boundary based on their ownership structure. Initially, a positive effect is reported indicating a shift on national banks’ frontier (Fig. 3b). However, for the period 2005–2008 the effect is nonlinear, with a negative effect for the period 2005–2007 and a positive effect for the period 2007–2008. This finding suggests that in the beginning of the financial crisis the national banks have increased their efficiency levels. This supports the findings by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) reporting that during the specified period national banks have experienced faster deposit growth than the Indian banking system as a whole. However during the period 2008–2012 the effect of time appears to be negative with the unconditional frontier positioned above the conditional one.

Furthermore, the evidence suggest that in average terms the effect of time on private banks’ efficient boundary (Fig. 3c) is positive up to 2009 suggesting a shift on the frontier. However, after that point the effect becomes negative. Finally, Fig. 3d presents a clear overall negative effect of time on foreign banks’ efficient boundary. Clearly foreign banks have been affected the most from the Global Financial Crisis in terms of the dynamics of technology change. Eichengreen and Gupta (2013, p. 145) suggest that foreign banks faced also a heavy reallocation of their deposits towards national banks. They suggest that during the period of Global Financial Crisis foreign banks’ credit growth slowdown was comparable to that experienced also by the private banks.

The paper analyses the efficiency dynamics of Indian banking industry for the period 2004–2012. Based on the probabilistic characterization of directional distance functions (Simar & Vanhems, 2012), we deploy the most recent developments of the operational aspects for computing conditional and unconditional directional distances (Daraio & Simar, 2014) estimating banks’ performance levels. Specifically, we apply a conditional to time DEA estimator of directional distance using a range directional distance as introduced by Portela et al. (2004). Moreover, our empirical findings contribute to the few recent studies (Casu et al., 2013; Eichengreen & Gupta, 2013; Fujii et al., 2014) analyzing the performance of the Indian banking sector after the mid 2000s and specifically during the period of Global Financial Crisis.

More analytically our results from the original estimates (unconditional efficiency scores) indicate that at the start of Global Financial Crisis, national banks’ technical efficiency levels were relatively unaffected compared to the technical efficiency levels of the foreign and domestic private banks. The initial findings also suggest that the estimated efficiency levels are based on banks’ ownership structure. The results also confirm previous studies (Casu et al., 2013; Fujii et al., 2014; Ray & Das, 2010; Zhao et al., 2010) supporting the hypothesis that the ownership structure affects directly banks’ performance levels. When we account for time effects (conditional efficiency scores), the results again indicate that all the estimated efficiency levels are differentiated with respect to banks’ ownership structure. Furthermore, we report higher standard deviation values of banks’ technical efficiency levels especially during the period of Global Financial Crisis. This in turn suggests higher efficiency variability among banks during the specified period.

Next, the results from the nonparametric regression analysis suggest that the Indian banking sector has increased its overall efficiency levels from 2004 to 2008. However after that point, industry’s efficiency levels have started to decrease. Our results confirm the findings by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) suggesting that Global Financial Crisis has caused several distortions on the Indian banking industry even though it was originally believed that it would be isolated from such effects.

Moreover, the nonparametric regression analysis supports our previous findings that national banks (compared to domestic private and foreign banks) are more resistant to the effects of Global Financial Crisis especially in the beginning of the crisis. This result supports also the view by Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) showing that during the period of Global Financial Crisis depositors shifted their money from foreign and domestic private banks towards national banks.

When examining the unconditional efficiency estimators, we provide evidence that the majority of national and foreign banks perform above industry’s average efficiency level. However, there is also evidence that private banks perform significantly lower (below average). This finding contradicts the findings presented by Sanyal and Shankar (2011) suggesting that private banks have higher performance levels compared to the public and foreign banks. The overall evidence both for the conditional and the unconditional case suggest that national and private banks have been less efficient compared to foreign banks.

The managerial implications involved when measuring bank efficiency in a DEA framework have been well highlighted by Fethi and Pasiouras (2010). However, some recent papers (among others, Asmild & Matthews, 2012; Epure, Kerstens, & Prior, 2011; Sahoo, Mehdiloozad, & Tone, 2014) have exploited further those implications on banks’ performance measurement applying different directional distance models. Our paper contributes to those studies by applying a directional distance model which accounts for time effects directly on the efficiency measurement estimation. In respect to the managerial implications involved, this study demonstrates an application of the latest developments of conditional efficiency measurement, in which the bank performance can be measured in the presence of external/exogenous variables without assuming the restrictive separability condition (Simar & Wilson, 2007, 2011). Specifically, the majority of DEA based studies when applying a diachronic analysis to evaluate bank performance assume that the support of the inputs and outputs used in bank’s production framework is not dependent on time (i.e. implying time independence of the attainable sets). In our case the applied estimator assumes that the separability condition with respect to time does not hold. The estimated conditional efficiency scores presented in this study are calculated based on the assumption that time influences the boundary of the attainable set. As a result the effect of Global Financial Crisis is incorporated directly into our estimation.

Finally, from our analysis we can conclude that national banks failed to sustain and further capitalize the gains from the restructuring policy applied by the Indian government in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In fact this result also supports earlier evidence provided by Kumbhakar and Sarkar (2003) and Sahoo and Tone (2009) suggesting that national banks have not responded to deregulations measures and that their output and resource allocation behaviors do not reflect their learning.
