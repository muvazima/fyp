                  Having a direct effect on network lifetime, balanced energy consumption is one of the key challenges in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the effects of node mobility on energy balancing in wireless networks. We construct a Linear Programming (LP) framework that jointly captures data routing, mobility, and energy dissipation aspects. We explore the design space by performing numerical analysis using the developed LP framework. Our results show that mobility has significant effects on the energy dissipation trends of wireless nodes. Mobility can improve the energy balancing up to a certain level, however extreme mobility may lead to a degradation in energy balancing of wireless networks.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The essential building elements of mobile networks are wireless devices which are typically powered by batteries with limited energy. Thus, the design of energy-aware routing protocols is one of the most important and challenging issue in mobile wireless ad hoc networks [1].

From energy consumption point of view, two issues need to be distinguished: energy efficiency and energy balancing. Energy efficiency refers to reduction of unnecessary energy consumption. A routing protocol is the most energy-efficient one if it minimizes the total consumed energy to reach the destination. On the other hand, energy balancing is a different concept. It refers to the maintenance of a balance in energy consumption so that certain nodes in the network do not die earlier than others [2]. Note that if all traffic is sent through the minimum energy path, then the nodes in this path deplete their batteries prematurely. Usually, such a power consumption is undesirable. In the network, minimizing the energy dissipation of each node separately does not provide the maximum lifetime that can be achieved by using a collective energy optimization scheme. As a result, a routing protocol is required to be both energy-efficient and energy-balancing.

Could we design a protocol which achieves both? Is there a protocol which is the most energy-efficient one and still consumes energy of nodes in a balanced fashion? Unfortunately, the short answer is no if certain conditions do not hold. For instance consider a network in which nodes are not mobile and the topology is static. Since multi-hop routing is generally more energy-efficient than direct transmission (a fact that follows directly from the conservation of energy), nodes in the center of the deployment area are utilized more heavily on relaying, thus exhaust their batteries earlier. Only under the assumption of a particular deployment strategy (e.g., denser deployment on the central region), energy efficiency and energy balancing do not contradict with each other.

A particular topology is not a realistic assumption for a network which consists of mobile nodes. However, in order to establish the balanced energy consumption behavior while preserving the energy-efficient operation, we can benefit from one of the inherent characteristics of the network: mobility.

Utilizing mobility for energy balancing is the key insight of our work. In more precise terms, the research problem in our study is the investigation of the effects of mobility on energy balancing in wireless networks. The problem has been investigated by linear programming. By developing a novel problem formulation using Linear Programming (LP), we seek an answer to the important question of whether and when mobility helps energy balancing in wireless networks. The LP-based framework that we propose in this paper evaluates and quantifies the impact of mobility on energy balancing in ideal conditions with optimal routing decisions and abstracts us away from the overhead brought by a specific protocol.

The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of a general framework in which the problem space could be explored in an efficient and consistent manner.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 provides an informal description of the research problem. Section 4 formulates the problem using LP. Section 5 presents the results of numerical analysis. Section 6 closes the paper with the concluding remarks.

Conservation of energy is one of the most important and challenging issues in mobile wireless ad hoc networks [1]. In order to use energy of nodes in a balanced fashion, cost function of a route may take into account of the remaining energy of the nodes on the route. Many power-aware protocols are available in the literature. These protocols differ from each other with respect to the cost metric they adopt. In a simulation environment these protocols were compared using criteria such as network lifetime and packet delay [3,4]. Wang et al. investigated the benefits of a heterogenous architecture for wireless sensor networks composed of a few resource rich mobile nodes and a large number of simple static nodes [5]. Chen and Chang compared routing protocols designed for mobile wireless networks with respect to their energy consumption for various node speeds and under three different mobility models [6]. They concluded that proactive protocols are not speed-sensitive as opposed to reactive ones. Liu et al. analyzed the impact of node movement on energy conservation in mobile wireless networks and proposed a novel resource-aware movement strategy to make better use of some powerful nodes to achieve energy conservation [7].

In the previous work, the impact of mobility on various other system aspects was also investigated [8,9]. Grossglauser and Tse showed that mobility increases the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks [10]. Later, Jafar proved that too much mobility limits the capacity [11]. Wang et al. studied the effects of mobility on connectivity of clustered networks and showed that mobility increases connectivity [12]. Mobility can even help security in wireless ad hoc networks by a technique in which security associations are established between nodes when they are close to each other [13].

In this study we construct an LP framework to characterize the energy balancing behavior for mobile wireless networks. LP is a technique which solves the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function whose variables are required to satisfy a finite set of constraints that are expressed either as linear equalities or linear inequalities. In the context of wireless networks, LP approach has previously been applied in many studies to model the unique characteristics of wireless networks and to determine the optimal solutions to problems that are specific to wireless networks (e.g., [2,14–18]).

In [2], a general LP model for evaluating and maximizing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is proposed. By using the observation that mostly many-to-one traffic pattern occurs in WSNs, it is shown that nodes which are close to the base station consume more energy compared to other nodes and this creates hot spots near the base station. Mitigating the problem of hot spots using different deployment strategies is investigated. In [14], a comparison of two multi-hop routing schemes (the first maximizes the minimum lifetime of the nodes and the second minimizes total energy dissipation) through an LP framework is presented. In [15], lifetime limits of WSNs improving contextual privacy are analyzed using LP by transmitting range control. In [16,17], both topology insensitive lifetime bounds and topology sensitive lifetime bounds with specified topologies are derived. The formalism of feasible role assignments is a key concept utilized in the derivations. It is shown that a class of role assignment problems can be transformed into LP models.

We note that when the nodes are static as in wireless sensor networks, developing an LP formulation is relatively easy. Mobility brings additional concerns to obtain a proper LP formulation of the problem. Using LP, a number of studies have been examined in the case of a network that consists of static sensor nodes and mobile base station(s) (e.g., [18,19]).

In this section, we present an informal description of the problem. Next section formalizes the problem within an LP framework.

                        ) are potential relays. When the network is static, due to the particular topology in Fig. 1(a), the most energy-efficient path for the both of the source-destination pairs uses the same node as a relay. As a result, this relay node becomes a hot-spot and will exhaust all its battery energy earlier than others (with the assumption of equal initial energies of all nodes). To have a more energy-balanced operation, the only solution in this topology is to prefer direct transmission for part of the data sent, diverging from the optimal paths with respect to energy efficiency.

In Fig. 1(b), the relay node, which is not used in static case, moves to a new location (at 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ) before second source starts its transmission. Although the distance between senders and receivers do not change in the mobile case, a more energy-balanced operation now becomes possible without sacrificing the energy efficient operation of the network. Two relay nodes share the load as seen in Fig. 1(b), and none of them becomes a hot-spot.

The toy example we present above is to clarify the concept of energy balancing. It is tempting but premature to generalize the positive impact of mobility on load balancing. It might be difficult to generalize any finding as one can easily find a particular topology and/or movement pattern in which mobility harms the energy-balanced operation rather than helping it.

To clarify the investigated problem and the contributions of this study, below we outline the scope of the problem by providing following assumptions:
                           
                              •
                              Energy consumption in WSNs has three main functionalities of sensing, processing, and communication. The sensing and the processing circuitry consume negligible amounts of power when compared to the communication. We assume that communication is the most dominant factor in energy consumption. We further assume that communication is mostly unicast, from a designated sender to a designated receiver. Energy dissipation for idle listening or overhearing in promiscuous mode is considered negligible.

Communication energy can be largely categorized into two parts. One is the energy overhead spent for the establishment of a routing path from source to destination. Especially when nodes are mobile, this overhead is a significant factor due to frequent topology changes. There is a considerable amount of previous work on routing protocols in mobile ad hoc networks and one particular finding relevant to our research is that energy overhead of proactive protocols is speed-insensitive (i.e., the routing energy overhead remains almost constant at all mobility levels) [6]. In our work, we focus on the second factor in communication energy (i.e., the energy spent for transmission of the user data over the path after it is established). We assume that a specific fixed ratio of battery energy is reserved and updated for the route establishment. As such, we focus on energy dissipation on actual data routing.

In order to avoid shadowing effects of any particular routing protocol, we assume that routing decisions are made optimally. To become more accurate in the next section, our model jointly meets both energy efficiency and energy balancing requirements and finds out optimal routing paths in the network.

To improve the energy efficiency, one plausible scenario in mobile networks is to delay the communication between the source and the destination nodes so that the transmission takes place when these two nodes are close to each other. We do not address such heuristics in our work. We assume real-time transmission requirements are in place and the data generated in each round of operation reach its destination in the same round.

The ultimate goal for utilizing mobility is to extend the network lifetime. We note that unlike complex deployment strategies as suggested for prolonging lifetime of wireless sensor networks [2], mobility is usually an inherent feature of the network itself and could be exploited virtually without any cost.

In this study, our main goal is to investigate the effects of mobility on energy dissipation characteristics of wireless nodes. In this section we define our system model, clarify the assumptions further, and formulate the optimization problem.

We choose an LP based analysis method which has a number of advantages. One of them is the abstraction from a specific protocol which enables us to investigate energy cost in ideal conditions without any shadowing effects. Secondly, with the help of global knowledge in the optimization problem solver, the results can be obtained in an efficient and consistent manner.

There are a total of N mobile nodes in the network. Time is organized into constant duration cyclic rounds. The set of rounds is denoted by T and the total number of rounds is

                         is the distance between node-i (transmitting node) and node-j (receiving node) at round-l. Note that due to node mobility, distance between any node pair can be different at different rounds.

The mobility model is designed to describe the movement pattern of mobile nodes, and how their speeds and directions are changed over the time. The Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility model is simple and is widely and frequently used to evaluate the performance of mobile ad hoc networks [21]. This is by far the most commonly used mobility model for ad hoc networks. The RWP model is representative of an individual movement, each node moves independently from each other. One of the reasons for it’s popularity is the fact that its implemented in network simulations environment such as Ns2 and GlomoSim.

We use a square shaped network topology and a variant of well-known RWP mobility model [22] to generate the mobility scenarios in our framework. In addition to RWP model, we also used Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM) model to observe the movement on energy consumption. This gave us an opportunity to compare energy decreasing between two models depending on mobility [23].

A graphical illustration of the mobility model we use in our framework is presented in Fig. 2

Each node randomly selects a destination point within a disk centered at the node’s current position with radius

                                    step
                                 
                              
                           
                         at the beginning of each round and moves on the straight line connecting its current position and the randomly selected destination at constant speed.

At the end of the round each node arrives to the randomly selected destination point. If a node picks a destination point beyond the boundaries of the network area, then the part of the path outside the network area is reflected back into the network area. Moving a node from point-5 to point-6 in Fig. 2 illustrates the reflecting boundary conditions. The step size determines the average node speed in the network.

Hence, the larger the step size, the higher the average node speed is. All system variables with their acronyms and descriptions are presented in Table 1

In this paper we make the first attempt to carry out an analysis on this subject by building a framework using LP. LP is one of the most successful disciplines within the field of operation research. LP is a powerful tool to solve optimization problems in WSNs. In the context of WSNs, LP approach has previously been applied in many studies to model the unique characteristics of WSNs and to determine the optimal solutions to problems that are specific to WSNs. The LP- based framework that we propose in this paper evaluates and quantifies the impact of mobility on energy balancing in ideal conditions with optimal routing decisions and abstracts us away from the overhead brought by a specific protocol. We choose an LP based analysis method which has a number of advantages. One of them is the abstraction from a specific protocol which enables us to investigate energy cost in ideal conditions without any shadowing effects. Secondly, due to global knowledge in the optimization problem solver, the results can be obtained in an efficient and consistent manner.

The optimization problem is formulated as an LP problem, presented in Fig. 3
                        . The framework we build is similar to well-established models to analyze other aspects of network lifetime optimization problems (e.g., [2,14–19]). Since the objective is to minimize the energy dissipation of nodes (

With this objective function, all nodes dissipate their energies in a balanced fashion and hence deplete their battery energies simultaneously. If network lifetime is defined as the time when the first sensor node in the network exhausts all its energy and dies, then it is trivial to turn our formulation into a lifetime maximization problem.

In Fig. 3, Eq. (1) states that all flows are non-negative. Eq. (2) is used to balance the incoming and outgoing flows in session-k at round-l for relay nodes. This constraint is used for nodes which are members of set

                         either directly or via relay nodes of session-k as stated by Eq. (5). Eqs. (4) and (6) are used to eliminate loops. Eq. (7) is used to limit the energy dissipation of sensor nodes on reception and transmission. Note that we do not include energy dissipation for idle listening or overhearing in promiscuous mode because there are many intelligently designed MAC protocols for wireless networks that avoid energy waste in these modes [24]. We assume such a MAC layer is used in our framework. Without loss of generality, the channel is assumed to be lossless. As noted in [2], retransmissions due to lossy channels do not affect the normalized energy values we report in our analysis.

In our formulation, energy consumption is not optimized for a single round or for a single session. Regardless of their roles (e.g., source, destination, relay), all nodes dissipate their energies during the entire network operation encompassing all rounds and all sessions with the aim of minimizing the energy dissipation per node.

We use the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) [25] for the numerical analysis of the developed LP model. GAMS is a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a language compiler and integrated high-performance solvers which used to obtain the best solutions. It is used widely for the complex, large scale modeling applications. A large number of simulations is performed in order to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Each problem is solved for 200 random scenarios (topologies, mobility patterns and source-destination pairs) and the results are averaged. Source node of each session creates 100Kbits of data at each round. Table 2
                      presents the parameters used in the analysis.

In Fig. 4
                     , normalized energy dissipation for different network operation times is presented as functions of node mobility level. In this scenario, there is only one active unicast session at each round, hence, throughout the network operation time

Normalization is achieved by dividing absolute energy dissipation values by the energy dissipation values of static topologies which are presented in the caption of Fig. 4, hence all absolute values in the figures can be calculated by using the information presented in figure captions. The style for presenting normalized and absolute energy dissipation values are kept the same for the relevant subsequent figures. In all three cases energy dissipation decreases with increasing mobility level. However, the rate of decrease gets lower for higher mobility levels, especially, for larger

                     . The reason for the decrease in energy dissipation is that mobility helps the network to balance energy dissipation (i.e., in static case cooperation is not enough to avoid overutilization of some of the nodes). Conceptually this phenomenon is analogous to the sink mobility in WSNs [18], yet, in this model all nodes are mobile unlike the WSN case where only the sink is mobile. The decrease in the network normalized energy reaches 20% for

As seen in Fig. 4, mobility helps energy balancing. Weng et al. showed the lifetime improvement for networks with one mobile going around in a two hop radius of the sink [5] which support our results. In Fig. 5

                     , drawn for 100 rounds, is helpful in understanding the aforementioned network behavior. In Fig. 6, normalized energy dissipation and normalized weighted distance (NWD) curves are presented. NWD, given in Eq. (8), is a measure of the average hop-distance weighted by the amount of data carried on the links. Energy dissipation and weighted distance have a strong correlation which explains the bimodal behavior in Fig. 5. Increasing mobility creates opportunities for the network to transfer data using lower distance hops until the level of mobility reaches a certain level and after that point increasing mobility does not help in reducing energy dissipation.

It has been shown in [10] that mobility increases the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks, however, it is also proved that too much mobility limits the capacity [11]. Although our problem is not identical with the problem studied in [10,11], the joint conclusions of these studies on capacity coincide with our results on energy dissipation.

                      is due to the relatively smaller area of the network. Since we use reflecting boundary conditions, displacements of nodes in higher mobility levels lead to topologies which are vulnerable to hot-spot phenomenon even more than the static network case. As a result, increasing the mobility in smaller area networks increases the energy dissipation (e.g., energy dissipation with

                      presents normalized energy dissipation for different number of rounds per session. At all rounds of the same session, same nodes are used as source-destination pairs. Energy dissipation decreases by increasing session duration because of larger effect of mobility on energy balancing in longer sessions.

Finally, the N sensor node were placed in an area and moved in groups of 25 using RPGM model. The place of each node was randomly changed during moving of nodes. As a result of the relocation of each node, the maximum value of normalized energy consumption was obtained. In Fig. 12
                     , normalized energy dissipations for 100 nodes in the network are presented as a function of RPGM model level. This model has a positive effect on the energy consumption of mobility as the previous one.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study we investigated the effects of mobility on the energy dissipation characteristics of wireless networks. We constructed an LP framework to model the network behavior under optimal routing conditions. Our results show that mobility can be exploited to eliminate imbalanced energy dissipation patterns and yields to more energy-efficient operation as compared to static networks. However, extreme mobility levels can also lead to energy inefficiencies depending on the network size and node density. LP problems are solvable in polynomial time. Hence, from practical point of view it is preferable to model a problem using LP rather than with a non-polynomial time formulation which makes a comprehensive analysis infeasible. Thus, the novel LP framework presented in this paper can be used with minor modifications for future analysis on different aspects of mobile networks.
