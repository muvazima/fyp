                  This study applies the Dynamic Slacks Based Model (DSBM) developed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010) in order to assess the evolution of input saving/output increasing potentials in major Brazilian Banks from 1996 to 2011. We propose that these potentials or slacks can be used as proxies for an eventual financial distress situation in the future. The main research objective is to determine whether or not different characteristics of bank type – related to ownership, size, and merger and acquisition processes – are significantly related to inefficiency levels and, by extension, to an eventual financial distress situation, since higher inefficiency levels also imply lower input saving/output decreasing potentials. Based on a balanced panel model, secondary data from Economatica were collected and analyzed. Results indicate higher inefficiency levels and slacks in small public and national banks. Policy implications are also addressed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper explores the use of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), applying the Dynamic Slacks Based Model [DSBM] developed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010) to a data panel of major Brazilian banks, from 1996–2011, in order to assess the evolution of the input saving and output increasing potentials over the course of time. Differently from previous DEA models, the DSBM uses a non-radial slack-based measure, which allows a non-proportional changes of inputs and outputs. Moreover, the DBSM defines inter-temporal activities as carry-overs and allows their categorization into four types: desirable, undesirable, discretionary, and non-discretionary. These features can be particularly useful when analyzing credit risk and financial distress within the ambit of banking efficiency, as the limits of capital and equity of each institution typically vary over the course of time in different proportions, not observing a fixed one imposed by radial measures (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984; Varian, 1987).

Efficiency has been the focus of much recent research (Boussemart, Briec, Peypoch, & Tavéra, 2009; Briec & Lemaire, 1999; Briec & Liang, 2011; Camanho & Dyson, 2005) especially on banking (Arif & Can, 2009; Berger & Humphrey, 1992; Berger & Humphrey, 1997; De Borger, Ferrier, & Kerstens, 1998; DeYoung, 1998; Drake, Hall, & Simper, 2009; Epure, Kerstens, & Prior, 2011; Fukuyama & Weber 2009a, 2009b; Fukuyama & Weber 2010; Ray & Das, 2010; Sahoo & Tone, 2009). Deregulation and liberalization have placed Brazilian banks in a much more competitive environment and increased competition amongst them (Beccalli & Franz, 2009; Correa, 2009). As a result, Brazilian banks are now under pressure to upgrade their efficiency relative to their competitors. Benchmarking analysis is one of the ways to drive banks towards the frontier of best practices (Berger, Hasan, & Zhou, 2009).

The current research on banks’ efficiency using non-parametric models such as DEA motivates and guides our research study. Recent empirical studies that focus on Brazilian banks includes Silva (2001), Ceretta and Niederauer (2001), Macedo, Santos, and Silva (2005), Ghilardi (2006) and Jorge and Wichmann (2006). All these papers have adopted traditional DEA models. The advantage of DEA is that it facilitates the computation of multiple input and output production correspondences.

This paper extends the current research on bank efficiency by assessing the role of productive slacks over the course of time as proxies of an eventual financial distress situation in the future. It also innovates in this context, by relating their respective inefficiency levels with several contextual variables associated to bank type: size, mergers and acquisition processes, and ownership. The major underlying hypothesis is that lower efficiency levels, which are linked to bank type, also imply higher slacks and, therefore, a greater chance for an eventual financial distress situation in the future.

The motivation of this paper are as follows: First, it aims to analyze efficiency in a representative emerging economy, Brazil. Although there is some research on Brazilian banks using DEA, the analysis of inter-temporal changes in productive slacks have not been taken so far into consideration. Therefore, this paper aims to contribute to the current theoretical research on bank efficiency using the innovative DBSM proposed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010). Second, the paper expands the existing literature especially due to its practical application that emulates the CAMELS rating systems and interprets its results linked to corporate governance characteristics (Männasoo & Mayes, 2009). Third, we analyze the aggregate carry-over slacks over the course of time, regressing them against different contextual variables. This is a significant contribution to the current research on efficiency in the bank sector in general. Fourth, our analysis covers the period from 1996 to 2011, which allows us to observe changes in banks’ efficiency. Finally, our analysis is based on a representative sample of Brazilian banks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review. The theoretical model of banking profit model appears in Section 3. Section 4 presents the data and the model. The empirical results are presented and discussed in terms of policy implications in Section 5. Conclusions follow in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This section is subdivided into three smaller ones. The first section addresses the institutional setting of the Brazilian banking industry, recently depicted in Barros and Wanke (2014). The second one presents the body of literature on efficiency studies and financial distress. The last one, formalizes the major propositions of this research.

Brazil banking sector is large with a high number of banks. The biger banks are bank Bradesco, Caixa Económica Federal, HSBS bank; Banco J. Safra, SA.; Bank Itaú; Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul; Banco PanAmericano SA; Banco Santander; banco do Brazil and Citibank. This list reveals openness of the Brazilian bank market but also the representativeness of national big banks (Tecles & Tabak, 2010). The market revealed in the financial crises of 1997 and 1998 some weakness of systems for monitoring the credit risk. To answer to this weaknesses, the Brazilian National Monetary Council (CMN) issued Resolution 2099 of 1994 ratified the Basel Accord as the minimum requirement for opening operation of financial institutions.

However this kind of risk regulation resulted that from 2008 to 2012 – also as consequence of the economic crisis, several banks were seized by the Central bank Banco of Brasil: Bank BVA SA, Bank Rural, Bank Cruzeiro do Sul, and a smaller lender Bank Prosper, the biggest collapse of a financial institution since Bank Santos was shuttered in 2005. Bank PanAmericano was shuttered in November 2010 and Bank Morada, a small lender, followed suit a few months later. This intervention resulted when the controlling shareholders failed to deposit the funds the bank needed to shore up the bank’s capital base, and this represents an example of the strain facing the nation’s small-sized lenders following years of fast credit-fuelled growth. As it will be discussed later, this list of seized and shuttered banks is useful to analyze the predictive capabilities of the DSBM in terms of financial distress (Section 5.2).

Banks play a very important role in the society, presenting a pivotal position in the process of promoting economic growth. As a result, bank performance evaluation has received great attention over the past several years for both theoretical and practical purposes. These studies are often grouped into two main approaches; parametric and nonparametric (Berger & Humphrey, 1997; Brandouy, Briec, Kerstens, & Van de Woestyne, 2010; Briec & Liang, 2011; Brissimis, Delis, & Tsionas, 2010; De Borger et al., 1998; Kerstens, Mounir, & Van de Woestyne, 2011; Lampe & Hilgers, 2014). The most popular parametric method is known as the stochastic frontier approach (SFA), whereas, the most popular nonparametric method DEA.

Although applying these methods could determine the efficiency levels they do not give details of the determinants related to inefficiency. In this sense, several studies proposed a combination of measuring and explaining bank efficiency scores (Fethi & Pasiouras, 2010) using DEA or SFA in the first stage to determine the efficiency scores and some regression model in the second stage to explain their drivers. Casu and Molyneux (2003), Ariff and Can (2008), and San, Theng, and Heng (2011) employed Tobit regression in particular, to explain bank performance. More recently, Barros and Wanke (2014) used a Bayesian dynamic frontier model so as to provide a more structural (i.e., one-stage) explanation for the variation in bank inefficiency than has been presented in the previously cited two-stage models. It is important to mention that, although focusing on the efficiency drivers by means of parametric and non-parametric techniques in a dynamic environment, a further step is still missing in the current body of literature: how efficiency drivers translate into several capital and equity slacks so that financial distress situations can be examined, and why it is important to do so.

Since these efficiency measurement techniques return efficiency scores, it is fundamental to establish the linkages between financial (in)efficiency or (inferior) superior performance and financial distress. More precisely, these techniques should be capable of indicating how effective a financial institution is in minimizing variables related to increasing financial distress and maximizing the other ones related increasing financial health. In DEA, this fine tuning between efficiency scores and decision making is often accomplished not only by choosing the proper set of input and output variables, but also by looking at their slacks.

There is a number of variables that are thought to be associated with financial distress. Predicting failure using firm-specific characteristics together with financial structures is originally attributed to the seminal works of Altman (1968) and Altman, Haldeman, and Narayanan (1977), which employed discriminant analysis on financial ratios to derive the Z-score approach. More recently, Männasoo and Mayes (2009) presented a comprehensive literature review on this subject. According to these authors, although there is no universal set of indicators used across previous studies, the CAMELS factors appear to have significant role in detecting distress.

The CAMELS acronym stands for capital adequacy (C), asset quality (A), management efficiency (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L) and sensitivity to market risk (S). Along the past decades, several studies reported the use of such related-variables in risk measurement and monitoring. Some examples can be found in Cole and Gunther (1995), DeYoung (1998), Oshinsky and Olin (2006), Kumar and Ravi (2007), Poghosyan and Cihák (2011) and Ravisankar, Ravi, and Bose (2010). The scenario previously described in the previous sections, lead us to the major proposition of this research. It is given next.

Efficiency levels in the banking industry are significantly affected by contextual variables related to the bank type. For instance, M&A processes in the finance sector are well-known for leveraging financial and operational indicators of banks. The same basic economic principles apply to small banks: they are the first to suffer the consequences of financial, systemic crisis. On the other hand, ownership may be accountable for differences in production technology and managerial style, thus affecting efficiency levels.

Given the close relationship between efficiency levels and input reducing/output increasing potentials, the latter may be considered as proxies of an eventual financial distress in the future. In other words, consistent augments in the input reducing/output increasing potentials over the course of time may constitute a leading distress indicator.

Brazilian banks are heterogeneous; they differ in ownership, and size, and since the 1990s financial liberalization the merger and acquisition [M&A] processes became more frequent. There are a number of public banks in Brazil, some large federal institutions with bank branches in every state of the federation such as the Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal and some smaller public banks that are regional, State owned, such as the Banrisul that serves mainly the State of Rio Grande do Sul. As per private banks, they are either domestic or international. Most of the private banks are small as compared with foreign owned banks. Regarding to M&A some of the regional public banks were acquired by larger private domestic banks such as Bradesco and Itaú. It is well-known that large banks benefit from economies of scale, which allows them to reduce the cost per loan; however smaller, local banks, enjoy local advantages due to closer ties to local public and businesses which allow them to generate private information that is costly to duplicate by other banks.

Given the heterogeneity of the banks some have greater market power than others, exercised frequently through the choice of output prices, paying lower rates to depositors and/or charging higher rates to borrowers. However, banks are also price-takers when dealing with securities, and low-risk loans to large corporations.


                     Humphrey and Pulley (1997) propose a highly stylized model of banking profit function under imperfect competition. They assume that banks maximize profits choosing output prices, p, and input quantities, x, for given output quantities, y, and input prices, r.

                     where (y, −x)’ is the vector of netputs, with negative signs applied to inputs; h(y, x) is a production transformation from input quantities into output quantities; and g(p, y, r, z) is the bank pricing opportunity set for transforming given values of y, r and z into output prices. The vector z reflects bank type, i.e., ownership (public, private, or foreign bank), size (big or small) and whether or not the financial institution went through a M&A process.

An important issue concerns the relation between the vector z and other variables in the model. It is possible to think of some variables in z as partially determined by y and r, since some bank factors such as different bank ownership may have distinct objectives. For instance, while private banks maximize profits, public owned banks may have other, additional, objectives, not necessarily in conflict with profit maximization, such as maximizing social welfare
                        3
                        Of course public owned banks have multiple stakeholders and multiple objectives, which causes several problems and conflicts.

The above model allows the study of the impact of different characteristics of bank type, given by the vector z, on the indirect profit function, which reveals inefficiency levels and potential for financial distress.

DEA is a non-parametric method developed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes in (1978) to measure the performance of a set of decision making units (DMUs). The initial DEA models consider the constant return to scale (CRS) assumption, which ignore the fact that different DMUs could be operating at different scales. To overcome this drawback Banker et al. (1984) introduced variable returns to scale (VRS) model which ensures that each bank is only benchmarked against banks of similar size. This feature makes DEA particularly useful and attractive for bank regulators, especially when their focus is on identifying the best and worst practices within a group of institutions (McWilliams, Siegel, & Van Fleet, 2005).

Over the course of the decades, these seminal models have been superseded by more sophisticated models such as the DSBM slacks-based model by Tone and Tsutsui (2010). In general, under the slacks-based approach, inefficiencies are defined as non-radial excesses in inputs and non-radial shortfalls in outputs, differently from the traditional CCR and BCC. More specifically, the slacks-base approach present some interesting properties for decision-making (Tone, 2001): (i) the optimal solution is not affected by variables measured in different units; (ii) negative values can be handled; (iii) non-proportional input reducing/output increasing potentials are be handled by non-radial functions; and (iv) inputs and outputs are simultaneously, and respectively, minimized and maximized.

The DSBM is designed to measure efficiency changes over the course of time through carry-over variables that connect the production function in two consecutive time periods. The underlying assumption is that these carry-overs, that is, these intermediate inputs or outputs, may potentially influence the input or output levels in the future. More precisely, the DSBM deals with n DMUs (j
                        =1, … , n) over T terms (t=
                        1, … , T). At each term, DMUs have common m inputs (i
                        =1, K, m), p non-discretionary (fixed) inputs (i
                        =1, K, p), s outputs (i
                        =1, K, s) and r non-discretionary (fixed) outputs (1, K, r). Let xijt

A detailed presentation of the DSBM can be obtained in Tone and Tsutsui (2010). It is omitted here for the sake of simplicity.

As previously discussed in Section 2.2, the selection of inputs and outputs should establish linkages between the literature review and the decision to be supported. As a matter of fact, to assist in decision making, the choice of variables in DEA models should reflect the desired perspective on efficiency analysis. Initially, the CAMELS factors are used as a starting point to identify the input and output variables that should be used in this research. However, since the original factors used to determine CAMELS ratings are not disclosed to the general public (Jin, Kanagaretnam, & Lobo, 2011), proxies were selected accordingly, based both on prior studies and on the availability in Economatica database.

On the other hand, Tone and Tsutsui (2010) classify carry-over variables, also called links, into four categories: (i) desirable links, treated as outputs and restricted to be not less than the observed one; (ii) undesirable links, treated as inputs and its value is restricted to be not greater than the observed one; (iii) discretionary links, affecting efficiency levels indirectly and free to vary from one period to another; and (iv) non-discretionary links, also affecting efficiency levels in an indirect way, but kept fixed in a constant level from one period to another.

Putting into perspective that not only the shortage of desirable links (outputs) is accounted as inefficiency in the DSBM but also the excess of undesirable ones (inputs), the rationale for the input/output selection in order to emulate the CAMELS rating under the dynamic slacks approach is discussed next.

Capital adequacy (C) is proxied by Total Equity, a desirable output in DBSM because higher levels are likely to reduce financial distress. On the other hand, asset quality (A) is proxied by Loan Loss Reserves, an undesirable carry-over (input) that should be minimized: lower levels suggest less financial distress. Similarly, management efficiency (M), proxied by the Total Non-Interest Expenses, is treated as an undesirable input. In its turn, earnings (E), is proxied by Net Income and treated as a desirable carry-over (output), since more is desirable. Now, with respect to liquidity (L), its proxy is given by the Liquid Assets and it is treated as a desirable output. At last, sensitivity to market risk (S) is proxied by Total Assets, a desirable output. Total Assets is reported to be negatively related to default risk in many studies including Abrams and Huang (1987), Wheelock and Wilson (2012), Kolari, Glennon, Shin, and Caputo (2002), Lanine and Vennet (2006), and Kato and Hagendorff (2010).

In summary, the carry-overs encompass loan loss reserves (undesirable/input) and net income (desirable/output). Ordinary outputs encompass total equity, liquid assets, and total assets, while total non-interest expenses account for the single ordinary input.

The approaches to the statistical treatment of the variations in the efficiency estimates produced using DEA have evolved over the years; see, for example, Banker (1993), Simar and Wilson (2007), and Simar and Wilson (2011). As a depiction of this evolution, Cooper, Seiford, and Tone (2007) point to the growing number of studies that combine DEA scores obtained in a first stage with those of multivariate data analysis (such as regression analysis) in a second stage, when the scores are incorporated in the form of the dependent variable. According to Fried, Lovell, Schmidt and Yaisawarng (2002), such two-stage DEA approaches are an important recognition that environmental factors or contextual variables can significantly influence efficiency scores.


                        Turner, Windle, and Dressner (2004) advocate the use of Tobit regression on DEA scores. In general, the basic model for Tobit regression is similar to that for OLS. However, Simar and Wilson (2007) argue that truncated regression combined with bootstrapping as a re-sampling technique best overcomes the unknown serial correlation complicating the analysis in two stages, where DEA scores are generated first and subsequently analyzed under a stochastic model. The adequacy of the functional form to the data is a prevalent problem and a common critique leveled against stochastic frontier models (Kumbhakar & Lovell, 2003). In this research, the Simar and Wilson (2007) approach is employed and the following regression specification is assumed and tested:

For the sake of brevity, readers should refer to Simar and Wilson (2007) for the details of the estimation algorithm. The respective computations were carried out with R codes developed by the authors, built on the censReg package (Henningsen, 2012).

In this research, bootstrapped truncated regression was used to assess the robustness of the results obtained when regressing the original efficiency scores against the contextual variables.

This section is structured in two subsections, detailed next. The first subsection presents the desirable/undesirable carry-overs and the contextual variables considered in the DBSM. In its turn, the second subsection encompasses the steps taken throughout the treatment of variations on reducing input and increasing output potentials vis-à-vis heterogeneous impact of ownership, size, and M&A, besides the fixed effects produced by each financial institution.

The data used in this research was obtained from the Economatica website. The list of variable inputs and outputs used in this study and its main descriptive statistics are given in Table 1
                        . They are expressed in BRL – Brazilian real rates.

Correlation analyses were performed, indicating significant positive relationships between the two inputs and the four outputs variables, which are, therefore, isotonic and justified to be included in the model (Wang, Lu, & Tsai, 2011). Table 2
                         shows the correlation coefficients of the pairs of inputs and the pair of outputs, which were calculated from 640 observations – comprising 40 different individuals distributed over the course of course of sixteen years – taken in aggregate. Since their serial correlations are relatively low, all inputs and outputs were retained in the analysis.

The data source also provided information on contextual variables for each bank, such as ownership (public, private, or foreign bank), size (big or small) and whether or not the financial institution went through a M&A process. All of these variables were coded as dummies. It should be noted that control variables such as the number or branches were also collected for each bank.

It is noteworthy that these contextual variables are neither inputs nor outputs, but are deemed to affect the production process. As these variables identify the sources of efficiency variations, they are also directly linked to policy formulation. Past studies in banking have introduced these contextual variables as exogenous ones (Assaf, Barros, & Ibiwoye, 2010, Assaf, Barros, & Matousek, 2011, 2013).

Putting in other words, an important underlying assumption on contextual variables considered by all these banking authors is that these contextual variables are exogenous, that is, they affect efficiency levels without being affected by them. Here, these contextual variables represent, therefore, decision variables based on the banking discretion rather than endogenous variables generated within the ambit of an efficiency model or a production process. However, endogeneity may be present in the regression. Endogeneity refers to the fact that an independent variable included in the model is potentially a variable correlated with unobservable variables, which are relegated to the error term. Here, M&A status may be endogenous if the decision to adopt M&A is correlated with unobservable variables that affect efficiency. For instance, if less efficient banks are more likely to enter a M&A and therefore have lower efficiency ceteris paribus, M&A is endogenous with efficiency, then failure to control for this endogeneity will yield an estimated M&A impact on efficiency that is biased down. Endogeneity may be due to biased omitted variables, measurement errors and simultaneity/reverse causation.

The Durbin–Wu–Hausman test for endogeneity can help determine whether or not there is some biased omitted variables in the regression (Davidson & Mackinnon, 1993). The Durbin–Wu–Hausman test on M&A in efficiency scores resulted in an F (1, 633)=26165.31, Sig.<=0.0000, thus indicating that M&A is endogenous in score regression. Moreover, M&A is also endogenous on log slacks regression with an F (1, 633)=52314.22, F
                        <=0.000. The results for the other contextual variables rejected the endogeneity hypotheses. Therefore the estimation regression will have to take the endogeneity of M&A into account.

The impacts of these contextual/exogenous variables on banking efficiency is further discussed. Here, the comprehensive framework presented in Barros and Wanke (2014), originally used to test efficiency drivers in the Bayesian dynamic frontier model, is adopted here to assess input/output slacks.

Public banks are common in some countries and whether they are more efficient than private banks is a matter of debate (Dinc, 2005; Galindo & Micco, 2004). Although they are not usually tested in efficiency analysis, in the Brazilian context, public banks are representative, justifying, therefore, the testing of whether or not they are less efficient when compared to private banks. This hypothesis was previously examined by Kumar and Gulati (2010) and Mohan and Ray (2004).

Foreign ownership might have an impact on costs by contributing to the transfer of knowledge and economies of scale between banks belonging to the same group. Chiu, Yan, Shen, and Wang (2008), for example, tested this hypothesis on a sample of Taiwanese firms. Other studies have also linked the success of group affiliation to the type of market—firms with group affiliation tending to outperform those without in competing markets, since for the latter it is harder to gain new market share (Cho, 2007; Ghemawat & Khanna, 1998; Griffith-Jones, 2007; Khanna & Palepu, 2000). Therefore, it might be more profitable to join a foreign group, thereby sharing its resources and reputation to compensate for external market failures (Khanna & Palepu, 2000). Chang, Hasan, and Hunter (1998), analyzing the productive efficiency of foreign owned and U.S. owned multinational commercial banks operating in U.S. and using a stochastic cost frontier with specification of translog cost function, found that foreign owned multinational banks in U.S. were significantly less efficient than U.S. owned multinational banks.

Mergers and acquisitions between banks are known as horizontal mergers (Andrade, Mitchell, & Stafford, 2001; Pasiouras, Gaganis, & Zopounidis, 2010) and aim to improve cost performance and synergy through a larger market share. In the former case, the merged companies reduce operating costs but reatain the facilities of the merged or acquired company (Garette & Dussauge, 2000).

Big banks can use more specialized inputs, coordinate their resources better, reap the advantages of economies of scale, and make up for external market failures (Ghemawat & Khanna, 1998; Khanna & Palepu, 2000). Related studies also indicated that firm size has a positive impact on efficiency and decreases costs (Altunbas, Carbo, Gardener, & Molyneux, 2007; Alvarez & Arias, 2003; Berger & Humphrey, 1991). Drake (2001) investigated the efficiency and productivity change in UK banking using Data Envelopment Analysis and the Malmiquist productivity index. The analysis revealed that increasing returns to scale were evident for smaller banks while decreasing returns to scale were suffered by large-scale banks throughout the sample period.

Initially, the DBSM model was executed for the period 1996–2011 and the efficiency scores were collected separately for each year. The results for the efficiency scores are presented in Table 3
                        , which shows their descriptive statistics for this time period. One may easily note that the average efficiency levels dropped dramatically from 2007, when the Brazilian government started an aggressive reduction of SELIC – the base-interest rate of Brazilian economy – besides other massive bank loan and subsidized credit policies for real state financing and durable consumption goods purchasing (automobiles included). This result may suggest the beginning of a movement towards an eventual financial distress in the Brazilian banking industry, since the average input reduction/output increasing potentials tend to be higher when efficiency scores are lower. Table 3 also presents the detailed scores for each DMU in 2011.

Then, the efficiency scores for all years were grouped (pooled) into one vector. Fig. 1
                         presents the pooled Kernel densities for the efficiency scores calculated from the DBSM. It is noteworthy the bimodal aspect of this distribution, probably also related to the aggressive monetary policies implemented by Brazilian government since 2007, mainly through public and national banks.

Then, different types of contextual variables related to bank type were considered as regressors in order to identify the efficiency determinants in the Brazilian banking industry. As demonstrated by Simar and Wilson (2007), the efficient scores obtained in first stage are correlated with the explanatory variables used in the second stage, and this second stage estimates will be subsequently inconsistent and biased. A bootstrap procedure is needed to overcome this problem (Efron & Tishbirani, 1993). Therefore, the Simar and Wilson (2007) approach is adopted in this second stage. Besides, the Banker and Natarajan (2008) robust cluster approach was also taken into account. Specifically, the robust cluster model (Banker & Natarajan, 2008) with endogeneity in M&A using 2SLS was also estimated.

Two models are estimated. The first one with the efficiency scores as the endogenous variable and the second one with the log of the aggregated slacks as the endogenous variable. The efficiency score is a truncated variable between zero and one, so the model estimated was a bootstrapped truncated one allowing for endogeneity in M&A using 2SLS. On the other hand, the endogenous variable of the second model is a continuous variable and was estimated with an OLS regression with bootstrap. These results are respectively presented in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                        .

Results presented in Table 4 provide a synthesis for the Brazilian banking industry, suggesting that both models, the Simar and Wilson (2007) and Banker and Natarajan (2008) present similar results based in the variance indicator. Furthermore, when taken in aggregate, efficiency scores tend to augment significantly, albeit slowly, over the course of time. Besides the trend variable, additional contextual variables provide insights on how efficiency scores are distributed over the different types Brazilian banks, thus implying specific public policies and business opportunities.

This slight increase in efficiency scores over time is overshadowed in the short term by the negative effect of public and national banks, which tend to be significantly more inefficient than its foreign counterparts. On the other hand, M&A processes, besides size, imply higher efficiency levels. Although substantial, the positive effects of M&A and size are not big enough to compensate for the existing inefficiency in public banks, specifically when inspecting the robust cluster model results. M&A, however, seems to be a source of efficiency gains for national banks. Foreign banks should focus on increasing their operations in the country, by increasing their scale (size). It is noteworthy that these conclusions still hold after performing the bootstrapped truncated regression discussed in Section 4.3 to check on the robustness of the results.

Specifically, the conclusions for public and national banks merit attention and may be justified by dissimilar pursued objectives (Tirole, 2001). That is, private banks, which tend to be shareholder-oriented, usually have as a single objective to maximize profit. On the other hand, public banks many times have multiple stakeholders in the boardroom and therefore multiple objectives to pursue, including maximizing profit and social welfare.


                        Table 5 presents the results for a similar analysis, using instead the log of the sum of the carry-over slacks as the dependent variable. Again the Simar and Wilson (2007) and Banker and Natarajan (2008) approaches present similar results. The results indicate that their aggregate input reducing/output increasing potentials are significantly augmenting over the course of time, albeit slowly, thus suggesting an increase in financial distress in the Brazilian banking industry. Besides, these slacks tend to be higher in public and national banks, and lower in big banks, particularly when inspecting the robust cluster model results. As a possible consequence of endogeneity, the positive effects of M&A on slacks are big enough to compensate for the current slacks in public banks. Again, M&A seems to be a source for national and public banks to improve efficiency levels.

Additionally, a closer look was taken, considering only the secondary effects for each one of the forty Brazilian banks over the course of the time. Again, the log of two carry-over slacks (net income and loan loss reserves) taken in aggregate was considered as the dependent variable. This was done to clarify the results presented in Tables 4 and 5 for the industry as a whole: since efficiency levels and slacks are both significantly increasing over the course of time, and this is apparently counterintuitive, it is necessary to identify which banks are closer to the distress zone and which are not.

Readers should recall one of the major propositions of this study: a movement over the course of time towards higher input increasing/output decreasing potentials may imply an eventual financial distress in the future. In this specific analysis, the number of branches was considered to be the control variable, since it comprises neither financial inputs nor financial outputs, but, rather, a relevant physical counterpart of the banking productive process. These results, presented in Table 6
                        , are discussed next.

Carry-over slacks are negatively related to branches, thus indicating that big retail banks tend to present a smaller potential for financial distress in Brazil. It is also noteworthy that the secondary effects of these banks with time also produce negative coefficients (BB, Itau, Bradesco, and CEF). Positive signs for the secondary effects between banks and time – carry over slacks tend to increase over the course of time for 23 financial institutions – are concentrated in small banks owned by state governments and small lender banks. Among these, three were seized in 2012, as previously mentioned: Prosper, Rural, and BVA.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper provides four major contributions to the analysis on bank efficiency. First it focuses on Brazilian banks, which have attracted scarce research so far (Ceretta & Niederauer, 2001; Ghilardi, 2006; Jorge & Wichmann, 2006; Silva, 2001) despite its importance in international economy. Second, it sheds some light upon the discriminatory power of DBSM and its carry-overs in terms of assessing potential financial distress situations. Third, it emulates CAMELS risk assessment framework within the ambit of DEA models, and fourth, it offers additional insights to the body of literature with respect to the contextual variables analyzed. More precisely, as regards collateral contributions of the paper to the body of banking literature, it presents evidence that size is of paramount importance in the Brazil economy. Besides, public banks and foreign banks do not increase Brazilian bank efficiency. Public banks are usually inefficient (Dinc, 2005; Galindo & Micco, 2004). A reason for foreign banks not contributing to efficiency may stem from the fact that Brazilian financial markets have been particularly closed, and foreign banks competition is a new phenomenon in which foreign banks are not yet fully capable to navigate its institutional obstacles, regulation and bureaucracy. Merger and acquisition contributes to Brazil banking efficiency, thereby validating previous research on this issue (Garette & Dussauge, 2000).

The results presented here can be used as a preliminary off-site screening tool by Brazilian regulators, managers, and investors to ascertain the standing of a given financial institution among the banking industry. More specifically, attention by regulators can be further directed at potentially distressed banks as some of them would be candidates for closer monitoring or even intervention by central bank authorities.

More specifically, based in this result lies the policy implication that Brazilian banks should take into account benchmarking exercises that permit the bank to compare with alternative competitors, aiming to control inputs and outputs in the production process. Furthermore, more openness of the banking market will contribute to additional growth, as more funds enable more projects. Merger, may have a positive impact long term since larger banks have economies of scale that decrease costs and therefore should be promoted.

Future research is necessary to assess the role of carry-over slacks in discriminating and predicting financial distress. One possible endeavor is the combination of data mining techniques and a greater number of contextual variables in order to identify the most relevant ones. Future research is also necessary to cope with and test for possible reverse causality within the range of a larger set of contextual variables and efficiency or slacks, trying to identify whether or not this is also present in other contextual variables besides M&A.
