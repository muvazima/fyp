                  We study the operational implications from competition in the provision of healthcare services, in the context of national public healthcare systems in Europe. Specifically, we study the potential impact of two alternative ways through which policy makers have introduced such competition: (i) via the introduction of private hospitals to operate alongside public hospitals and (ii) via the introduction of increased patient choice to grant European patients the freedom to choose the country they receive treatment at. We use a game-theoretic framework with a queueing component to capture the interactions among the patients, the hospitals and the healthcare funders. Specifically, we analyze two different sequential games and obtain closed form expressions for the patients’ waiting time and the funders’ reimbursement cost in equilibrium. We show that the presence of a private provider can be beneficial to the public system: the patients’ waiting time will decrease and the funders’ cost can decrease under certain conditions. Also, we show that the cross-border healthcare policy, which increases patient mobility, can also be beneficial to the public systems: when welfare requirements across countries are sufficiently close, all funders can reduce their costs without increasing the patients’ waiting time. Our analysis implies that in border regions, where the cost of crossing the border is low, “outsourcing” the high-cost country’s elective care services to the low-cost country is a viable strategy from which both countries’ systems can benefit.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Designing a healthcare system which is accessible, provides care of high quality and is financially viable, is a key challenge with which both advanced as well as emerging economies are confronted. In advanced economies, spending on healthcare accounts “for about half of the rise in total spending over the past forty years” (Clements, Coady, & Gupta, 2012). Hospital operations in specific, absorb a significant amount of this spending. Among OECD countries, approximately 33% of health expenditures can be categorized as hospital spending (Maier-Rigaud, 2012).

Despite such high levels of spending, obtaining access to timely care can be challenging due to increasing waiting times, especially in the context of elective care. For example, in the UK, waiting times for elective surgery are considered by the public as the “second most important failing of the health care system” and “mean waiting times for elective surgical procedures are above three months in some countries and maximum waiting times can stretch into years” (Hurst & Siciliani, 2003). More generally, in half of OECD countries, tackling accessibility challenges in elective care is a central policy concern.

However, the presence of waiting times (or waiting lists) for elective care also provides a form of rationing device when patients are covered by public health insurance and capacity is constrained. In that case, waiting times “take over from price rationing as a means of equilibrating demand and supply” (Hurst & Siciliani, 2003). Consequently, in managing waiting times, health systems’ planners need to balance two types of costs. On the one hand, they need to consider the costs that arise from the deterioration in the health condition of patients, who are put on a waiting list and any associated utility losses. On the other hand, they need to consider the high costs associated with expanding capacity and delivering care. This discussion then suggests that some waiting will always exist at systems, where patients are required to pay little or no fees for accessing elective care services (Cullis, Jones, & Propper, 2000).

Therefore, how to design effective policies to tackle waiting times for elective care while controlling the associated costs is not clear. The introduction of competition between healthcare providers is increasingly considered as a means towards the creation of incentives that will induce healthcare delivery systems to offer high quality and efficient care (Cooper, Gibbons, Jones, & McGuire, 2011). In this work, we focus on elective care in countries with predominantly public healthcare systems and develop a unified framework to analyze the impact on waiting times and the overall cost of care, of two popular means of introducing competition: (i) allowing private care providers to enter the market for elective care services alongside the public system and (ii) increasing the choice of providers where patients can receive elective care.

The first possibility, i.e., the presence of a private system alongside the public system, provides to patients a faster but typically costlier way to receive access to care. Patients have to bear the full or part of the cost of receiving treatment in the private sector (Hoel & Sæther, 2003). Nevertheless, the presence of a private sector can be beneficial for two reasons: (i) it provides faster access to care for more severely ill patients who are in need of more urgent care and (ii) it reduces the demand for care and the overall load that the public system faces. In the European Union (EU), recent years have seen an increase in the number of private providers (European Hospital & Healthcare Federation, 2011).

The second possibility introduces competition by giving patients a wider choice of providers. At the national level, this situation is common in countries where provision of care takes place in public-sector facilities whereas funding of care occurs through taxation such as, among others, the United Kingdom or Sweden (Propper, Wilson, & Burgess, 2006). It is hopped that when patients have a wider choice of where to receive elective care they will “move from areas with high waiting times to areas with low waiting times, leading to a fairer distribution” (Hurst & Siciliani, 2003). At an international level, starting in 2013 and partly in order to address access to care issues, the European Union (EU) has decided to grant European citizens with the freedom to choose the member-state, where they receive care while being entitled to reimbursement from their home insurance systems (Commision of the European Communities, 2008b). The term that is typically used to describe such provision of care services is “cross-border healthcare”. While some conflicting evidence exists regarding the likely consequences of introducing patient choice at a national level, the possible effects of cross-border healthcare are virtually unknown. With this work we aim to make a first step towards better understanding them.

We model a country’s public healthcare system according to three basic entities: the health funder (e.g., the NHS in the UK) who reimburses the public provider for treating patients; the public provider (a public hospital or a private, non-profit hospital willing to provide elective care at the rate determined by the health funder); and the patients. In our model, we assume that each patient will select the treatment option that yields the highest utility. The funder of each country is responsible for setting its reimbursement rate and the capacity of its public provider so as to minimize its reimbursement cost. However, the funder’s decisions must satisfy two constraints: (1) the public provider’s participation constraint (i.e., the public provider’s profit must be non-negative); and (2) the public welfare constraint (i.e., the patient surplus provided by the public system must exceed a certain threshold).

While our unit of analysis is the national public healthcare system and we discuss inter-national patient movement in the context of cross-border care, our models are applicable to intra-national settings as well. Specifically, our models would apply to decentralized national healthcare systems which are organized into different “regions”, each of which is responsible for funding the care of the patients that reside within its borders. In that case, cross-border patient movement would imply crossing a region’s borders to receive care at a provider within a different region. Such provision of care would then require a monetary transfer across the health authorities of different regions to cover the costs of the provided care. Examples of such systems include Sweden, Italy and outside the EU, Canada with its provinces.

To capture the interactions among the patients, the providers, and the healthcare funders we use a queueing framework, which we embed in two different sequential games. Each of the games is meant to examine the impact of a treatment option additional to the public system: the first game deals with the private provider and the second deals with the cross-border healthcare policy. We obtain closed form expressions for the patients’ waiting time and the funder’s reimbursement cost in equilibrium for each of these two games.

For the game that deals with the private provider, we show that both private providers and the public system will co-exist. Also, we show that the presence of a private provider can be beneficial to the public system because of the underlying “symbiotic relationship”: the patients’ waiting time at the public provider will decrease, the funder’s cost can decrease under certain conditions, and the private provider can generate profits.

For the game that is intended to examine the impact of the cross-border healthcare policy, we develop a model of two countries, each of which has its own public system. We show that when the welfare requirements across countries are sufficiently close, the cross-border healthcare policy is beneficial to the public systems of both countries: both funders can reduce their costs without increasing the patients’ waiting time. This result is due to the flexible patient movements enabled by the cross-border healthcare policy. These allow the high-cost country to exploit the low-cost structure of the other country. They further allow the low-cost country to benefit from absorbing patients from the high-cost country due to the presence of an “economies of scale” effect. Alternatively, if the cost of crossing the border is not high (an assumption that is satisfied primarily in border regions) and the high-cost country “outsources” its elective-care services to the low-cost country then both countries stand to benefit.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature. In Section 3, we present the base model of a single country in which the public system operates in a monopolistic environment. In Section 4, we extend our base model to the case when there is a private provider competing with the public system. Section 5 deals with the cross-border healthcare policy where we extend our base model to the two-country case in which each patient can choose the country that yields the highest utility. Finally, Section 6 presents some numerical examples and Section 7 concludes the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

From a modeling perspective, our work falls within the operations management literature that studies competition between service systems. Hassin and Haviv (2003) provide an introduction and general survey of this body of literature. Moreover, because the cross-border movement of patients can be interpreted as “outsourcing” a country’s health services to a different country (Glinos, Baeten, & Maarse, 2009), our paper is also relevant to the stream of literature that studies the outsourcing of services under competition. Cachon and Harker (2002) is one of the early papers in this area. The reader is referred to Allon and Federgruen (2005) for a literature review of this relatively new stream of work. From a contextual perspective, our work touches upon issues which have been examined primarily in the health economics literature and specifically in two research streams that correspond, roughly, to the two settings that we consider. The first stream studies how the presence of private providers impacts the operation of a public healthcare system. The second, studies the impact of increased patient choice.

In the first stream, Hoel and Sæther (2003) examine the impact of the presence of private health care provision alongside publicly provided care. They find that the presence of some waiting time in the public system can be beneficial from a social point of view because it induces patients with high waiting costs to seek private care, thus shifting some of the demand from the public to the private sector. Similarly, Olivella (2003) argues that the presence of a private sector weakens a patient welfare-maximizing planner’s incentives to reduce waiting times in the public sector. The reason for this is that the private sector acts as an “escape valve” for excess demand for public care.

In studying the impact of competition from a profit-maximizing private provider on the public healthcare system we find that it reduces the waiting time at the public hospital compared to the monopoly setting, where the public hospital is the only available option. This result admits a similar interpretation as in Hoel and Sæther (2003) or Olivella (2003). The private provider attracts a fraction of the patients and thus, enables the public system to offer a reduced waiting time. Our model however allows us to take the analysis one step further and examine the impact on the public funder’s total reimbursement costs as well. We derive conditions under which these can be lower compared to the monopoly setting.

In the second stream, taking an analytical approach, Siciliani (2005) focuses on elective care and uses a duopolistic setting to show that an increase in the degree of patient choice (defined there as substitutability between hospitals) results in a lower overall supply of treatment and consequently higher waiting times. Xavier (2003) reaches a similar conclusion through the use of a Hoteling-type model, where patient choice is driven by distance from the hospital. More recently, Brekke, Siciliani, and Straume (2008) examine a Salop-type model in which hospitals in different locations compete for utility-maximizing patients, who, in the presence of waiting times, independently select the hospital that yields the highest utility. They find that competition can again lead to longer waiting times in equilibrium.

When compared to the above-described analytical models, our approach is different in the following sense: First, our use of a queuing framework allows us to capture uncertainty in the demand for care and in the treatment times, as well as the associated non-linear waiting-time dynamics. We are not aware of any paper in the health economics literature that captures this type of uncertainty. Furthermore, we adopt a long-term view as in Cachon and Harker (2002) and assume that the hospital’s capacity can be adjusted to accommodate the realized patient inflow. Second, unlike any of the above papers, our key decision-maker is the funder of the public healthcare system who simultaneously decides the rate at which to reimburse the public hospital for the provided elective service as well as the waiting time standard that the public hospital should adhere to. Hence, we consider simultaneous pricing (i.e., reimbursement rate) and capacity (i.e., waiting time) decisions; another novel feature. Patients, who have different valuations for the treatment, select the hospital that provides them with the highest utility. Third, to capture the non-profit nature of public healthcare provision, we impose two key requirements: the public hospital’s profit must be non-negative and the patient surplus that is generated by the public system must exceed a pre-specified threshold level.

Taking an empirical approach to study the impact of patient choice, Dawson, Gravelle, Jacobs, Martin, and Smith (2007) examine data from the London Patient Choice project, under which increased hospital choice was introduced for patients living in the London area with the aim of reducing overall waiting times. Contrary to the analytical results that we described above, they find that increased patient choice can reduce waiting times. Similarly, analyzing data from Norway after the introduction of similar policies, Ringard, Rico, and Hagen (2005) reach a similar conclusion. Propper et al. (2006) provide an overview of the available evidence on the impact of increasing patient choice. Hence, the results from the analytical and empirical literatures on the impact of patient choice in hospital waiting times are not necessarily in accord.

In addition to the above-mentioned novel characteristics, an additional contribution of our work is that it incorporates interactions among the three key stakeholders of a healthcare system in a competitive environment that involves either private providers or another healthcare system (via the option of cross-border healthcare). This enables us to analyze operational and welfare issues in a unified manner. Moreover, Brekke, Levaggi, Siciliani, and Straume (2011) is the only other paper we are aware of that studies the issue of patient mobility. However, their approach differs from ours in the following manner. In their model, the key decision to be made is the level of the quality of care that should be offered to maximize patient welfare under the presence of a budget constraint. In our model, our focus is on the waiting-time and reimbursement-rates that should be effective in the system under the health funder’s jurisdiction. The funder’s objective is to minimize the cost of patient care subject to a patient welfare constraint.

Consider a public healthcare system that offers a single elective treatment (e.g., a hip or knee replacement). This system is comprised of a funder (a health planner), a hospital, and a population of N patients as depicted in Fig. 1
                     . (Given the differences among healthcare systems across countries, our intent is to capture the “essence” but not the detailed operations of any given system). Without loss of generality, we normalize the patient population size from N to 1. The system operates like a monopoly so that the patients can elect to wait for the treatment or not. (In the next section we shall extend our base model to the case when each patient can seek treatment from a private provider). However, there is no out-of-pocket expense for the patients because the treatment cost at the hospital is fully covered by the funder. In our model, the funder sets the reimbursement rate r and the capacity of its hospital 
                        
                           μ
                        
                      to minimize its reimbursement cost subject to two constraints: (1) the hospital’s participation constraint (i.e., the hospital’s profit must be non-negative); and (2) the patients’ welfare constraint (i.e., the patients’ welfare that is provided by the public system must exceed a certain threshold).

Let us note here that our approach is only the first step towards a modeling framework that captures the intricate operational issues that arise from the cross-border movement of patients. Other possibilities exist as well. For example, similar to Brekke et al. (2011), one could also consider an alternative model in which the funder maximizes the patients’ welfare subject to a budget constraint. In fact, it can be shown that the model that seeks to minimize reimbursement cost subject to a patient welfare constraint is equivalent to the model that seeks to maximize patient welfare subject to a budget constraint (i.e., the reimbursement cost cannot exceed a given budget). Hence, our model can be transformed into one where the public funder maximizes patient welfare subject to a budget constraint. Nevertheless, even though both our model and the alternative formulation capture the tradeoff between the patients’ welfare and the funder’s reimbursement cost, our formulation yields tractable analysis and closed form expressions for equilibrium outcomes.

In our model, each patient who receives treatment at the (public) hospital will obtain a utility

                        , the funder would decide on the reimbursement r and the hospital’s capacity

                        , we can apply the simple M/M/1 queueing model to show that the expected waiting time of a patient at the hospital is 
                           
                              w

                         so that 
                           
                              μ
                              =

                        . Essentially, we follow an approach similar to Cachon and Harker (2002) by assuming that the hospital capacity 
                           
                              μ
                           
                         is adjustable (i.e., the capacity can be adjusted to accommodate the patient flow that will be generated from a given disutility level d). Because the queueing model is designed for examining long term behavior of a system, it can be safely assumed that hospital capacity can be adjusted.

When the funder reimburses the hospital for each patient it treats at rate r, the hospital’s expected profit is

                         because of the following reasons. First, consider the case when

                         has to be high enough so as to cover the capacity cost when 
                           
                              τ
                           
                         is very small and ensure the hospital participation constraint (3.2) is satisfied. Now, as

                         is actually decreasing in

                         is small. Second, when

                         is sufficiently large, it is intuitive that the reimbursement

                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                         will increase. We use numerical analysis to explore further the implications of Proposition 1 in Section 6.1.

We now extend our monopoly model to the case when there is a private provider who competes with the (public) hospital. While the funder reimburses the treatment performed at the public hospital, we assume that the patient is liable to pay for the treatment obtained from the private provider. In reality, patients will typically be liable for at least some part, if not the entire cost of care in the private sector. For example, in the United Kingdom, there are conditions under which the NHS would cover the cost for certain treatments obtained from a private provider. However, based on the patients’ experience posted in public media (BBC News, 2010), it appears the conditions are stringent and the process to get such approval is rather lengthy so that most patients tend to pay for their private treatments.

Because the funder is not covering the private treatment cost for the patients, the funder needs to ensure the patients’ surplus provided by the public system continues to exceed 
                        
                           τ
                        
                     . (Without this obligation, the analysis is simple and the result is obvious: it is optimal for the funder to close down the public system so that its reimbursement cost is zero. By doing so, the private provider sets its (monopoly) price that patients pay. However, without having the public system as a “free” option, major complaints from the patients will follow unless the funder covers at least a portion of the private treatment cost.)

To simplify our analysis, we do not model the operational aspects of the private practice. Instead, we assume that each patient can receive private treatment with 0 waiting time, and the private practice can treat each patient at a unit cost 
                        
                           κ
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                     . Note that there is no need to consider the case when 
                        
                           κ
                           >
                           1
                        
                      because no patients will seek private treatment when its price 
                        
                           p
                           ⩾
                           κ
                           >
                           1
                           ⩾
                           V
                        
                     . (The same approach can be used to analyze the case when the private provider needs to determine its capacity to manage its waiting time, even though the analysis is much more involved. In any event, we shall illustrate this approach when we examine the cross-border healthcare policy in the next section.)

To simplify our exposition, we shall assume that the perceived quality of the private treatment and the public treatment is the same. In the event when the perceived quality of the private treatment is different, one can adjust the treatment price so that the “adjusted price” of the private treatment is calibrated properly so that the patients can compare this adjusted price associated with private treatment and the disutility associated with the public treatment. For example, consider the case when the valuation of the private treatment is 
                        
                           δ
                           V
                        
                     , where V is the valuation of the public treatment. Then we can set the “adjusted price” to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 δ
                              
                           
                        
                      so that the “adjusted valuation” of the private treatment is also V. With the same valuation, the patients can compare the adjusted price 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 δ
                              
                           
                        
                      associated with the private treatment and the disutility d associated with the public treatment when choosing a provider. For ease of exposition, we shall consider the case when the quality of the private provider is the same as the public system so that 
                        
                           δ
                           =
                           1
                        
                     .

Within this setting, let us now analyze a sequential game as follows. For any given price p charged by the private provider, we first determine the public system’s best response. Anticipating this best response, we determine the price that the private provider will charge in equilibrium. We envision here a situation where a private provider begins operation alongside an already existing public healthcare system. The reimbursement that the private provider will seek from patients along with the provider’s overall operational performance is likely to impact patient behavior and as a consequence may initiate a reaction from the public funder.

By noting that each patient will obtain a utility 
                           
                              V
                              -
                              d
                           
                         by seeking treatment from the public system and 
                           
                              V
                              -
                              p
                           
                         from the private provider, the disutility d and the private price p dictate the patients’ treatment choice. Moreover, since there is no need to consider the case when 
                           
                              d
                              >
                              p
                           
                         (as the public hospital would then lose all patients to the private provider and the public system would not be able to fulfill its patient welfare obligation), the funder can compete with the private provider by responding in one of the following two ways: (1) Set the disutility 
                           
                              d
                              <
                              p
                           
                         by “under-cutting” the private price p; or (2) set the disutility 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              p
                           
                         by “matching” the private price p.

First, by under-cutting the private price p, all patients would seek treatment at the (public) hospital so that its patient demand is 
                           
                              (

                              β

                         will opt for the public hospital. While we assume 
                           
                              β
                           
                         is given exogenously, it is conceivable that one can estimate it by conducting experiments to examine the patients’ choice when the perceived cost of both systems is the same.

To under-cut the private price p, the funder needs to add the “under-cutting” constraint 
                           
                              d
                              <
                              p
                           
                         to the funder’s problem as defined in (3.3). In this case, it is optimal for the funder to set its disutility

In the presence of a private provider, Corollary 1 reveals that the public system will reduce its disutility (i.e., shorten its waiting time) in equilibrium. Notice that this result is different from the result obtained by Siciliani (2005) due to the existence in our model of the hospital participation and patient welfare constraints and the fact that patients are responsible for covering the cost of the private treatment.

                         via price matching in equilibrium. As the patient demand falls, one would expect the funder will lower its reimbursement rate. However, if the funder lowers its reimbursement rate, the private provider may not be able to do price matching without losing money. These two forces have motivated us to compare the funder’s equilibrium reimbursement cost

                        . To satisfy the welfare constraint, the funder has to reduce its disutility (i.e., shorter waiting time). However, under price matching, the patient demand is lower in equilibrium because the patient demand is split between the public hospital and the private provider. By treating less patients under price matching, the funder’s effective reimbursement cost in the presence of the private provider can be lower especially when the public hospital’s patient-treatment cost k is sufficiently high so that

                        . (We can interpret the second statement in a similar manner.) In Section 6.2 we use the above results to further explore numerically the impact of: (1) the patients’ unit cost of waiting 
                           
                              α
                           
                         and (2) the welfare requirement 
                           
                              τ

Essentially, Corollary 2 reveals that, in the presence of a private provider, the funder’s reimbursement cost can be lower under certain conditions. Specifically, as the private provider serves as an additional channel who competes with the public hospital, the public system can leverage the private provider to provide the service (at the patients’ expense) and to reduce its reimbursement especially when the public hospital’s patient-treatment cost k is high. Because of the price matching mechanism and because some patients may pay for their private treatment in equilibrium, Corollary 2 shows that the existence of the private provider can help the funder to defray its reimbursement cost.

In summary, in the presence of a private provider, we have shown that the patients’ disutility (or the waiting time) is always lower compared to the base case under which treatment at the public provider is the only option. Also, the funder’s reimbursement cost can be lower (due to self-paying patients who seek treatment from private provider) or higher (due to competition).

We now extend our monopoly model of Section 3 to incorporate a cross-border healthcare policy under which each patient can seek treatment from the country that yields a higher utility (i.e., lower disutility). Unlike the private provider case, we consider the case when the funder of the “home” country will fully reimburse the funder of the “host” country when a patient from the home country seeks treatment at the hospital of the host country.

Because the cross-border healthcare policy has not been fully developed in the EU, there are many scenarios one can explore. Among different possible scenarios, we shall focus on one that is consistent with an existing policy that has been adopted among some of the EU countries. For example, under the policy EMSCG P020V2 (c.f. Midlands & East Specialised Commissioning Group, 2012), a patient in the UK can apply for a “planned” treatment in the EU at the expense of the NHS if certain conditions are satisfied. Specifically, if approved, NHS will pay the full cost of treatment even if the cost is higher than in the UK. Similar reciprocate policies exist in other EU countries for their citizens to seek treatments in the UK.

                      to ensure that public hospital i’s participation constraint (3.2) and country i’s patient welfare constraint (3.1) are both satisfied. Unlike the private provider case, the funder is now covering the patients’ treatment cost regardless of the country that performs the treatment. Hence, funder i can use hospital j to fulfill its welfare obligations.

In dealing with cross-country reimbursements, we assume funds are transfers between funders which are made without involving the hospitals or the patients. Specifically, when there are cross-border patient movements, the “host funder” i will charge the “foreign funder” 
                        
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      for the treatment provided by the host hospital in country i. We think this direct fund transfer between funders would reduce the number of financial transactions among different parties, and it may avoid the perceived differential treatments of patients from different countries. Under the full reimbursement scheme, the patients’ out-of-pocket expense will merely be travel-related costs. For ease of exposition, we shall assume this travel expense is negligible even though our model can be extended to incorporate travel expenses. Fig. 2
                      depicts the financial and patient flows between two public systems located in two different countries.

To simplify our exposition, we shall assume that the size of each country’s patient population is equal to 1, and the patients’ valuation of the treatment at each country is

                      announced by funder 2, we determine funder 1’s best response. Anticipating funder 1’s best response, we determine the optimal disutility and reimbursement rate that funder 2 will set in equilibrium. Thus, we capture here a situation where changes in the policies of the public health sector of one country can initiate reform in the public health policies of a neighboring country as a consequence of the increased choice that patients from both countries have. A sequential game is appropriate when one country is leading the effort as the leader and the other country serves as the follower. Also, our sequential game can serve as a building block for analyzing multi-period dynamic games between two healthcare systems especially when the provider’s quality and/or patients’ response may change dynamically over time.

While the second and the third responses resemble those arising from analysis associated with the private provider, the analysis is different because of two key reasons. First, unlike the private provider case, the funder in one country is covering the treatment cost when its patients seek treatment at another country. Hence, we need to account for the fund transfers between the two funders. Second, unlike the private provider case, there are potentially bi-directional patient movements as depicted in Fig. 2 when both hospitals have the same disutility. Let us now consider in detail each of funder 1’s three possible responses.

                           , it is more cost effective for patients from country 1 to seek treatment in country 2 by overshooting. By over-shooting, funder 1 would end up incurring a lower reimbursement cost than under-cutting or matching. Because of the fund transfers between the two funders, and because funder 1 can fulfill its welfare obligation from the service provided by hospital 2, Proposition 4 reveals that matching is never an optimal response to funder 1. For this reason, the second statement is different from Proposition 2 as presented in the private provider case.

                        . This follows directly from Proposition 4, which suggests that dis-utility matching never occurs in equilibrium. Thus, as it is always optimal for one of the two hospitals to treat the entire patient population, the waiting time at that hospital needs to be such that it allows both funders to satisfy their welfare requirements. Let us now explore in the next section why bi-directional flow would not occur in equilibrium and understand the economic implications of the cross-border policy.

We now compare each funder’s equilibrium reimbursement cost under cross-border healthcare (as stated in Proposition 5) and its reimbursement cost under monopoly (as stated in Proposition 1). These comparisons enable us to establish the following result:

                              , the cross-border healthcare policy can enable both funders to reduce their reimbursement costs while keeping the disutilities (i.e., waiting times) the same as in the monopoly case.
                           

This result can be explained as follows. Consider the case when country 1 has a “lower” cost structure so that

                        . Observe this reimbursement rate is “lower” than the rate (3.4) that funder 1 would set in the monopoly case. Hence, funder 2 can reduce its reimbursement cost by taking advantage of this lower reimbursement rate at country 1 by having all patients from country 2 to seek treatment in country 1. At the same time, funder 1 can reduce its reimbursement cost because its hospital is willing to accept a lower reimbursement rate due to “economies of scale” effect.

In short, due to the flexibility in the movement of patients that is enabled by the cross-border healthcare policy, the public funders can maximize the “economies of scale” effect by having the low cost hospital treat all patients from both countries. Hence, in equilibrium it is more cost effective to have one directional patient flow instead of bi-directional patient movements. One hospital will end up treating all patients from both countries. Ultimately, the cross-border healthcare policy can lead to a win–win situation without causing an increase in disutility (i.e., longer waiting time).

This result has a clear policy implication. It suggests that in the long run and under the assumption that the travel (or more generally, the inconvenience) cost of crossing the border is not very high for the patient, it is optimal for the high-cost public health system to “outsource” the provision of the elective treatment to the low-cost public health system (where the term “cost” can be appropriately adjusted to account for quality differences). Within the EU, the assumption of low travel cost is satisfied well at border regions. Approximately 37.5% of Europe’s population lives within close proximity to a national border (c.f., Sanchez-Schmid, 2011), which suggests a non-trivial potential impact for the cross-border healthcare policy. In fact, the discussion surrounding its design has singled out border regions as among the most likely to be affected by such a policy given that in several cases it is faster for an EU citizen to seek care across the border than within her own country. Additionally, examples of such cross-border “collaborations” between different countries already exist. One such example is the pilot project in the densely populated Euregion Meuse–Rhine region which involves Belgian, German and Dutch borders; positive results have already been demonstrated there (c.f., Hermans & den Exter, 1999).

Additionally, this result points towards a direction that has already been highlighted during the course of the EU discussions on the crafting of the cross-border healthcare legislation: The role that cross-border movement of patients can play in: (i) helping national public health systems avoid unnecessary duplication of care provision and (ii) providing a critical mass of patients that can justify capacity investments in healthcare offerings from which both domestic as well as foreign patients can benefit (c.f., Commision of the European Communities, 2008a).

If welfare requirements differ across countries, it remains true that in equilibrium patient movement will still occur in a single direction: from the high-cost to the low-cost country. Moreover, since both funders will now set their disutilities at

                         (cf., our earlier discussion at the end of Section 5.2), the generated welfare for the patients of the low-welfare country shall increase compared to the monopoly setting. However, this may come at an increased cost for the funder of the low-welfare country if the welfare requirements of the two countries are sufficiently different. We explore this observation numerically in Section 6.3.

In this section, we present a set of numerical examples, which highlight the nature of our closed-form results from Sections 3–5.

We begin by using Proposition 1 (specifically Eqs. (3.4) and (3.6)) to graphically explore how changes in the funder’s welfare requirement

                        . In Fig. 3
                        a we present plots of

                         in c. We also note the relatively “flat” nature of the curves over a wide range of 
                           
                              τ
                           
                         values. Nevertheless, observe from Fig. 3b that this does not translate to similarly flat cost curves.

In this section, we rely on our results from Propositions 1 and 3 to compare the public funder’s costs

                         under the monopoly and private-provider settings respectively. We do so while assuming that the private provider can provide care to the patients in a more efficient manner such that 
                           
                              κ

                        , i.e., the unit patient treatment cost is lower for the private provider compared to the public provider. Such an assumption has been confirmed empirically in the literature (e.g., Chang, Cheng, & Das, 2004).

                         exceeds a threshold value, the presence of a private provider increases the public funder’s cost. This observation is consistent with Corollary 2 which suggests that

To interpret this behavior, we again appeal to our results from Corollary 2. Using the numerical values of our experiment along with Corollary 2, it is easy to see that case 2 of the Corollary is true for

                         and case 1 is true otherwise. Then, it is easy to check that the curves of

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

By focusing on the interactions between the primary players of a public healthcare system, we have developed a game-theoretic queueing framework to analyze the potential impact of private providers and cross-border healthcare policy on the public system to find that: (i) the presence of a private provider can reduce the patients’ waiting time and the funder’s cost can decrease under certain conditions and (ii) the cross-border healthcare policy can be beneficial to the public systems of both countries as both funders can reduce their costs without increasing the patients’ waiting time when the welfare requirements of the two countries are sufficiently close.

Given the highly political nature of both private and cross-border healthcare, appropriate implementation mechanisms will need to be devised. For example, the funder may need to share some of the cost for those self-paying patients who seek private treatment, especially when the waiting time of the public system is too long. For example, the NHS in the UK has provisions to refer patients to private providers whose care will be paid by the taxpayer. For cross-border healthcare, mechanisms will be needed to ensure participating countries will not be overwhelmed with an additional inflow of patients and that their citizens do not get the impression that their government is forcing them to seek treatment in a foreign country. This is the key reason why border regions (where travel costs are low and, in many instances, citizens also share cultural/language backgrounds) provide ideal candidates for an initial implementation of such cross-border policies. Hence, this discussion suggests directions for future research. Our model only provides a first step towards understanding what might be the implications of allowing patients to seek care abroad.

There are other issues as well that we do not capture here and are worthy of further investigation. First, even though our model can be extended to incorporate the perceived quality of different providers, we did not analyze this issue explicitly. It would be of interest to address this in conjunction with the waiting time so that the funder needs to make their investment decisions by examining the tradeoff between higher quality and shorter waiting times. Second, we assume that patients have full knowledge of the providers’ characteristics, such as waiting times (or quality). This is an idealized setup since such visibility could only be achieved via currently-lacking advanced information technology infrastructure. Thus, it would be interesting to consider the same issues under a setup where patients have only limited information regarding providers. Third, in our analysis of the impact of private providers we have assumed that the private provider acts as the leader in the sequential game and the public funder follows. Given the difficulty in adjusting hospital capacity (i.e., the public funder’s decision) compared to adjusting prices (i.e., the private provider’s decision), it would also be interesting to adapt our approach and consider an alternative sequential game at which the roles of the two parties are reversed. Finally, an additional issue is to what extent can patient movement lead to consolidation and increased focus of the services that providers offer. Our results hint that cross-border patient movement can potentially enable providers to achieve better capacity utilization and economies of scale by focusing on the services for which they enjoy a cost advantage.
