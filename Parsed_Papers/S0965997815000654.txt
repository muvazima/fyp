                  The aim of this study was to explore the heat transfer behavior between convection and conduction in the thick wall crude oil pipeline with laminar unsteady state flow using integration of developed computational fluid dynamics model and statistical experimental design. The governing equations were employed to investigate the effects of wall thickness, wall thermal conductivity, surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature on transport profile using statistical experimental design and to locate an origin point where wax precipitate in the pipeline (wax appearance distance) by using response surface methodology (RSM). A good agreement between the model and literature experimental data suggests that the proposed numerical scheme is suitable for simulating the transport profile in pipeline and predicting the phenomena for any other conditions. From the statistical analysis, it was found that, surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature were the major effect parameters on the wax appearance distance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Transportation of crude oil by pipelines is the general process in petroleum industry. Generally, pipelines are made of various materials which have different ability to conduct heat. Consequently, the heat affects the transport properties of the crude oil leading to operational efficiency. The proper selection of materials for the pipeline brings the effective production system [1]. Stainless steel has the thermal conductivity of 15.1W/mK while copper has the very high thermal conductivity of 401.0W/mK [2]. This variety of thermal conductivity affects the performance of a heat exchanger between crude oil and surrounding outside the pipe [3]. In this study, the conjugated heat transfer coupling between wall convection and conduction were concerned [4]. The analysis of this problem was carried out to study the effect of parameters which related to thick-wall problem such as wall thickness, pipe thermal conductivity, surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature on the hydrodynamics changing in transport profile inside the pipeline. All these parameters have an important role in designing the pipeline system.

The heat and mass transfers of crude oil through pipelines are very complicated process because there are many factors which affect transport profile [5]. The knowledge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is therefore required for better understanding the flow behavior and for predicting the phenomena inside pipeline. Wang et al. [6] determined an optimized pigging frequency using experimental method and wax deposition model. Zhu et al. [7] investigated the thermal influential factors affecting the crude oil temperature in double pipelines system using the computational fluid dynamics methodology. However, in most of previous studies focusing on convective heat transfer, wall conduction was ignored because of the assumption of extremely thin wall. This may distort crude oil transport profile at the wall boundary condition. Thus, besides the heat convection, the heat conduction through the pipe wall should also be considered.

The aim of this study was to develop the computational fluid dynamics model for investigating the effect of thick-wall pipeline on the transport profile using statistical experimental design. In the literature, the experimental results on integration of computational fluid dynamics simulation and statistical experimental design were limited. This analysis will be helpful for preventing and solving real problems which may emerge during the crude oil transportation such as precipitation of wax.

The fluid flow problem can be solved by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. CFD is a very powerful tool for analyzing the system involving fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer and other special phenomena such as chemical reaction [8,9] by solving the mathematical equations which govern these processes using numerical methods. To develop the CFD model, governing equations which are in partial differential form are transformed to algebraic form using finite volume numerical solution techniques [10]. Crude oil was considered as incompressible fluids. The generalized conservation equation for two-dimensional flow system where the dependent variable is denoted by

The two-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates were employed as an approximation for the cylindrical pipeline system. In Eq. (1), there are the transient and the convective terms in x and y directions on the left hand side and the conductive term in x and y directions and the source term on the right hand side. Eq. (1) will turn into the continuity equation by replacing 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         with 1. In addition, when 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                         is substituted by u, v and T, Eq. (1) will become the conservation of momentum in x and y directions and the conservation of energy, respectively.

The problem was analyzed to investigate the heat exchange among surrounding, pipe wall and crude oil [11]. The schematic drawing of the thick-wall pipe problem is shown in Fig. 1
                        . This crude oil pipeline was chosen from the real crude oil pipeline in the literature information. The flow had Peclet number of 16,300 and Biot number of 0.07–22.00 depending on the condition. Because the Peclet number is high, convection is important to flow in this system. In addition, this study Biot numbers vary from the condition that conduction inside the pipeline is unimportant to important. Heat flows from crude oil to the surrounding through a two-dimensional Cartesian thick-wall pipe with conductive heat coefficient of kp
                         in the wall and convective heat coefficient of hi
                         and ho
                         at the inner and outer surfaces of the wall pipe, respectively. Inner wall convection coefficient is determined from Nusselt number. The Nusselt number in laminar flow of circular tube is 3.66 [2]. The heat resistance (R) through a thick-wall pipe is

The wall thickness is the difference between the radiuses of outer and inner walls (Δx

                        ). The formula was added as an additional source term in the energy conservation equation at the wall boundary condition.

To compute the solution of governing equations for each control volume on the staggered grid arrangement, SIMPLE (Semi Implicit Method Pressure-Linked Equation) algorithm was employed [9]. First order upwind differencing scheme and Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA) were applied to solve the interface problem and to calculate the results of linear algebraic equations, respectively. All of developed equations and CFD procedure were then written as standalone computer program code. The developed CFD program can handle both symmetry and non-symmetry boundary conditions. Parameters used in CFD simulation are listed in Table 1
                        . The correlation between the crude oil viscosity and temperature (T) by Guozhong and Gang [12] was employed in this study which links the fluid flow and heat transfer. The numerical simulations have been done under unsteady state laminar flow conditions (Reynolds number<2000) with single phase liquid flow and used under-relaxation factor to ensure stability of the SIMPLE process [9]. After the grid independency testing, the straight pipe model was composed of a 30,000mesh. The simulation tests were performed until reaching the steady state condition (operation time less than 3600s). The results from developed CFD simulation program were validated with the literature experimental study by Guozhong and Gang [12].

In this study, the factorial experimental design analysis was used to investigate the main effects and interactions of the parameters related to a thick-wall pipe problem. Two levels of the following four varying parameters which were the wall thickness (A), pipe thermal conductivity (B) surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C) and ambient temperature (D) were considered as shown in Table 2
                        . In this study, the parameters and their levels were selected based on the available literature and some experiments of QH crude oil which is a type of crude oil in China [12]. In general, pipe thermal conductivity depends on type of pipe material. We selected carbon steel and stainless steel as the pipe material which have the thermal conductivity of 0.0625 and 0.0151kW/m°C, respectively. For the wall thickness, the range from the real system from Petroleum Company and from the literature information [13] were selected. Two values of surrounding heat transfer coefficient (ho
                        ) were chosen from the range of air speed which correspond to natural or low air velocity (0.005kW/m2
                        °C) and force or high air velocity (0.1kW/m2
                        °C) convection conditions [2]. The lowest and highest values of each factor are coded as −1 and +1 numbers, respectively. The location of wax appearance represented by wax appearance distance was chosen as the response, based on the wax appearance temperature for QH crude oil at 47°C. The wax appearance distance was separated in two positions, near the pipe wall and the pipe center. Design of experiment with three factors, orthogonal array, was designed and the single replicate response data was then obtained as also shown in Table 2.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

As stated above, all 16 simulation cases were carried out based on the 24 factorial experimental design in order to obtain 16 flow patterns of crude oil inside the pipeline. The results showed that those all 16 profiles had quite similar flow patterns. The difference between each profile was the decreasing rate of crude oil temperature. Examples of crude oil temperature and velocity profiles are shown in Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        , respectively.

It can be seen in Fig. 2(a) that crude oil temperature decreased along pipeline length and continuously dropped with the time because there was the heat loss of crude oil to environment [12]. In the same time, temperature of crude oil near the pipe center had the highest value then decreased along the radial direction of the pipe until reaching the pipe wall where the temperature was the same as the surrounding temperature as shown in Fig. 2(b). As for the velocity profile, Fig. 3(a) shows that the crude oil velocity in the pipeline was quite constant along the pipeline length due to the constant cross-section area of the pipeline. Because the viscosity is depended on the temperature, the obtained velocity profile at the wall region then should lower than the obtained velocity profile at the center region. On the other hand, Fig. 3(b) shows dropping of crude oil velocity along the pipe diameter direction due to rapid increase of the crude oil viscosity near the pipe wall caused by the decreasing of crude oil temperature near the pipe wall. These results agreed well with previously reported trends [14].

The steady state temperature profiles in crude oil pipeline obtained from developed CFD simulation code then were compared with the experimental data by Guozhong and Gang [12] as displayed in Fig. 2(b). Using the quite similar operating conditions as used in this study, the obtained results then can be compared. It is found that the obtained profiles were quite similar. The small difference near the pipe wall is because the unknown properties of pipeline in the literature information [12]. Therefore, the model accuracy and correctness was proved. In Fig. 2(b), the result without thick-wall condition is also shown. The profile was different and lower from the one with thick-wall pipeline which confirmed the assumption of this study about the importance of thick-wall condition. The heat transfer resistance inside the wall slightly made the crude oil temperature near the wall for the thick-walled pipeline to be higher than the thin-walled pipeline. In addition, the result trend was compared with the one from commercial software, ANSYS FLUENT, the obtained results from both simulation codes also had a similar trend [15].

The response results from the 24 factorial experimental design analysis with a single replicate were shown in Table 2. The ANOVA statistical analysis of the results obtaining with a confidence level of 95% or p-value equals to 0.05 were summarized in Tables 3 and 4
                        
                         for the wax appearance distance near the pipe wall and the pipe center, respectively. The p-values provide a cut-off beyond which we assert that the findings are statistically significant. From the results in Table 3, it is found that surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C), ambient temperature (D) and their interaction (CD) had significant effect on the response. In addition, it can be seen in Table 4 that surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C) ambient temperature (D) were the effect parameters on the wax appearance distance near the pipe center. These were indicated by the low p-value of 0.05.


                        Fig. 4
                         illustrates the plots of the main and interaction effects for each significant response variable. From both the results, near the wall and center regions, the parameters had the same effects on the responses. A negative effect of surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C) on wax appearance distance was observed. When the surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C) is increased, the wax appearance distance decreases due to the increase of heat transfer rate from crude oil to environment outside the pipe [16]. Meanwhile, the ambient temperature (D) had a positive effect on wax appearance distance, the wax appearance distance increases with increasing of ambient temperature. This is because a higher ambient temperature causes a lower heat transfer rate from crude oil to surrounding and results in slower wax appearance distance [17]. In Fig. 4(b), the negative interaction effects between surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature were also illustrated. In fact, the wall thickness and pipe thermal conductivity had an effect on the response variable but had less significant when comparing to the surrounding heat convection transfer coefficient and ambient temperature using 95% confidence interval. The reason is because the response variable in this study is the wax appearance distance which directly depending on the surrounding heat convection transfer coefficient and ambient temperature. The pipe thermal conductivity and wall thickness may have an effect on the temperature especially at near the pipe wall. Comparing between the responses variables, there was higher temperature drop near the wall than the pipe center, the reason is that the crude oil near the pipe wall receives the influence of heat transfer directly from the conduction through the wall and convection from the surrounding environment outside of the pipeline.

                        where z is the wax appearance distance, C and D are the coded factors of surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature, respectively. As stated in the methodology section, the coded factors represent the dimensionless values of each factor ranging from the lowest (or −1) to highest (or +1) ones as summarized in Table 2. For surrounding heat transfer coefficient, the −1 and +1 coded values show the surrounding heat transfer coefficient of 0.005 and 0.100kW/m2
                        °C, respectively, while for ambient temperature, the −1 and +1 coded values show the ambient temperature of 25 and 35°C, respectively. After substituting the values of code factors, the obtained mathematical models can be used to predict the wax appearance distance near the pipe wall and pipe center [18]. From statistical experimental design theory, the obtained equation can be used for any other systems which have the similar dimensionless conditions. For the other cases, those equations can explain the result trend. About the models, there is an interaction effect near the pipe wall and no interaction effect near the pipe center. In addition, response surface methodology (RSM) which is the mathematical and statistical techniques was used to locate the origin point of the wax appearance distance from the obtained models [18]. As can be seen in Fig. 5
                        , the wax appearance distance will be longer at low surrounding heat transfer coefficient and high ambient temperature. Therefore, crude oil transportation should operate with this condition to avoid or reduce the wax appearance. Surrounding heat transfer coefficient generally depends on fluid properties and velocity while the ambient temperature depends on weather, season and duration time of the day. It can be seen that these parameters mostly depend on the natural environment where the pipeline is located. However, there are some indirect ways to control or manage the effect of these parameters such as coating the pipeline with organic substance to decrease heat transfer rate or adding the thermal insulation apparatus to attenuate the effect of the surrounding temperature [19].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Computational fluid dynamics model was developed to investigate the effect of the parameters related to the thick-wall pipe (wall thickness, pipe thermal conductivity, surrounding heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature) on the transport profile of crude oil inside pipeline. It is found that all the obtained flow patterns from the developed CFD simulation program were quite similar. These results had good agreement with the information in the previous literatures. The profile without thick-wall pipeline was different from the one with thick-wall pipeline which confirmed the importance of thick-wall condition. The influences of various parameters on transport profile were analyzed using statistical experimental design. The result showed that surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C), ambient temperature (D) and their interaction (CD) had significant effect on the wax appearance distance near the pipe wall while the parameters that affected on the wax appearance distance near the pipe center were surrounding heat transfer coefficient (C) and ambient temperature (D). In addition, the obtained mathematical model can be used for optimizing the system problem. To apply this knowledge in real situation, pipeline system should be carefully designed based on the prevention of the occurrence of wax inside the pipeline.
