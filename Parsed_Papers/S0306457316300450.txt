                  In social networks, identifying influential nodes is essential to control the social networks. Identifying influential nodes has been among one of the most intensively studies of analyzing the structure of networks. There are a multitude of evaluation indicators of node importance in social networks, such as degree, betweenness and cumulative nomination and so on. But most of the indicators only reveal one characteristic of the node. In fact, in social networks, node importance is not affected by a single factor, but is affected by a number of factors. Therefore, the paper puts forward a relatively comprehensive and effective method of evaluation node importance in social networks by using the multi-objective decision method. Firstly, we select several different representative indicators given a certain weight. We regard each node as a solution and different indicators of each node as the solution properties. Then through calculating the closeness degree of each node to the ideal solution, we obtain evaluation indicator of node importance in social networks. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally on a few actual social networks.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the era of big data, social networks can be found anywhere. Social networks can be seen as a set of the nodes joined in pairs by edges. In recent years, the analytical approach of the social networks has attracted considerable curiosity from the social and the scientific community. This curiosity can be attributed to a fascinating focus, namely the relationship between social entities, as well as the pattern and meaning of the relationship (Chen & Wang, 2012; Kossinets & Watts, 2006; Van Noorden, 2014; Wasserman, 1994; Watts & Strogatz, 1998). In particular, the degree of importance of each node in social networks is not the same, that is, different nodes have different weights. Therefore, in the actual network, it is valuable to find paramount nodes for controlling the entire network. Consequently, we need to capture and reveal the relationship between the feature of the nodes and network topology so that we understand the impact of a node on system functions, such as reliability, robustness and controllability (Ahlswede, Cai, & Li, 2000; de Camargo, Neto, & Pires, 2012; Hawick & James, 2007).

In social networks, there are a variety of measurement indicators for identifying the most crucial nodes (roles). In general, the measurement indicators (Arulselvan, Commander, & Elefteriadou, 2009; Bhola, Grover, & Sinha, 2010; Borgatti, 2006; Hewett, 2011; Hu, Wang, & Lee, 2010; Xie, Li, & Zhang, 2015) are divided into two categories: from the perspective of local attributes and the perspective of global attributes. For example, degree centrality (Bonacich, 1972) represents that the more the number of neighboring nodes are, the more important the nodes are, which is the simplest index of centrality. Information index (Bonacich, 1987) depends on the amount of information through its propagation path. Besides, Kitsak, Gallos, and Havlin (2010) proposed k-shell decomposition. Closeness centrality (Freeman, 1979) discussed by Rothenberg et al. is a global measure of centrality based on the distance between nodes in a connected network. Closeness centrality can be seen as a measure of how long it will take information to spread from a given node to others in the network. In addition, there are a host of other concepts such as subgraph centrality (Estrada & Rodriguez-Velazquez, 2005), eigenvector centrality Stephenson and Zelen (1989) and cumulative nomination (Poulin, Boily, & Masse, 2000). In those regards, Ren and Lv (2014), Wang and Zhang (2006), and He, Li, Gan, and Zhu (2008) have done excellent summaries. Further, Sun and Luo (2012), Liu, Ren, Guo, and Wang (2013) also summarized the history of the methods of mining important nodes in complex networks and summarized the research results. They are trying to describe and measure the characteristics of a node from a different point of view, and adapt for different networks (Liu, Tang, & Zhou, 2015; London, Németh, & Pluhár, 2015; Ren, Liu, & Shao, 2013; Zhang, Xu, & Li, 2011). That is, they only reflect one perspective of node importance. But in modern society networks, node importance is not only determined by one attribute, but is also determined by a number of attributes. As an example, individuals’ I.Q is determined by education, age, experience, etc. In addition, the proportion of each attribute is not equal. We should give different weights for each attribute. The literature (Yu, Liu, & Li, 2013) combined some indicators to discuss node importance and mainly considered structural characteristics of the network topology. In social networks, node importance should combine with some information concerning the node itself in the actual networks.

Based on this, in this paper from the network topology and the center of one node in social networks, we consider five indicators, including prestige, the amount of information dissemination, the transmitting path of the information, and hence propose a comprehensive evaluation of node importance for social networks.

The rest of the paper is built up as follows. Section 2 introduces the notations and notions related to our problem. Section 3 presents a scheme for efficient identification of node importance in social networks. In Section 4, this developed scheme is applied to identify the most important node(s) in some networks. In Section 5 the concluding remarks are given.

According to the emphasises of different indicators, from more than one perspective (including the connection status between the nodes, the path of the target node to other nodes, and the perspective of simulation of the flow analysis), we choose five indicators: structural holes, flow betweenness centrality, cumulative nomination, information indicator, and subgraph centrality, to evaluate node importance comprehensively. The paper essentially studies a multi-attribute ranking problem. The definitions of these indicators are described in this section.

First of all, a short review of the required basic graph terminology is presented. For the sake of simplicity, we shall limit ourselves to undirected and unweighted networks. In this situation, if a node i is linked to another node j, then node j is necessarily linked to node i. Besides, all the links have the same weight.

Let G be a graph. A graph G consists of a non-empty finite set V(G) of elements called nodes, and a finite set E(G) of ordered pairs of different nodes called edges. We write 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           (
                           V
                           ,
                           E
                           )
                        
                      where V and E are the node set and edge set of G, respectively. The size of G is the number of nodes in G, and is denoted by |G|.

                        Structural holes (Burt, 2009)


                        In networks, when there is no direct connection between two nodes, in the same vein, and there is no redundancy relationship between them, the obstacle between them is a structural hole. Burt (2009) gave the expression of structural holes with network constraints coefficient.

                            means the proportion of node i to spend time (energy) on the node j and its total time (energy). The lower CH(i) is, the greater the degree of structural holes is. That is to say the location of the node i is more important.

In most networks, however, information (or anything else) does not flow only along geodesic paths. News or a rumor or a message does not know the ideal route to take from one place to another more randomly. To work around these issues, in 1991 Freeman et al. raised flow betweenness. Flow betweenness is based on the idea of maximum flow. Imagine each edge in a network as a pipe that can carry a unit flow of some fluid. We can ask what the maximum possible flow then is between a given source node s and target node t through these pipes. In general, the answer is that more than a single unit of flow can be carried between the source and target by making simultaneous use of several different paths through the network. The flow betweenness of a node i is defined as the amount of flow through node i when the maximum flow is transmitted from node s to node t. It is a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network.

In the initial stage, each node is assigned an initial nomination. Assume that more central individuals will be nominated more often. In every subsequent iteration, new nomination of the node includes its previously itself nomination and the other nodes’ nomination connected to the node. After several iterations, the nomination of the node will be closeness to a constant, that is the final nomination of the nodes. Cumulative nomination refers to the reputation of a node itself in the network. Thus cumulative nomination can be used to measure node importance. Firstly, suppose there are n nodes in the network. The calculation process of cumulative nomination is as follows:

                           Information indicator, which can be used to characterise node i within a connected network or within a connected component of a network, is a measure of node importance through the spread of the path information.

On the basis of the number of closed walks starting and ending at the node, the “subgraph centrality” CS(i) for nodes in a network has been proposed. Closed walks are appropriately weighted so that their influence on the centrality decreases as the order of the walk increases. Each closed walk is associated with a connected subgraph, which means that this measure counts the times that a node takes part in the different connected subgraphs of the network, with smaller subgraphs having higher importance. Consequently, the measure of the “subgraph centrality” CS(i) for nodes in a network is given by the expression

The five indicators mentioned above, structural holes and subgraph centrality are considered from the structure of the network; flow betweenness centrality is mainly considered from the perspective of simulation of the flow analysis; information index is focused on the simulation of the flow analysis; cumulative nomination stresses on the hierarchies and social in the networks. From different points of view, these five indicators consider node importance, respectively. In this paper, we give different weights to them, and then integrate them into a comprehensive indicator to measure the node importance. The details will be given in the next section.

Combining the thought and theory of multi-objective decision method, we put forward a relatively comprehensive and effective method of evaluating node importance in social networks. In this method, we regarded each node as a solution, and regard multiple indicators of the node as the solution properties. By calculating the closeness degree between each node and the ideal solution, we obtained evaluation indicators of key nodes in complex networks. Firstly, we give a generic description and contextualization of the proposed method.

The essence of the comprehensive decision analysis method is selecting the best alternative from a series of alternatives with multiple attributes to meet certain goals. The process of the comprehensive decision analysis method involves primarily the following aspects: the normalization decision matrix, the determination of the weight of each attribute and the sorting of the comprehensive scores of the evaluated schemes.

The decision matrix must be normalized because these decision attributes are contradictory, and each attribute dimension and order of magnitude are usually different. In order to avoid such conflicts, it is necessary to make a normalization for the decision matrix. Then, according to certain rules, give a certain weight to each attribute. At last, by using multiple criteria method, we calculate the comprehensive scores of the evaluated schemes and sort the scheme according to their scores.

Suppose that there are n nodes in social networks. The set of decision-making plan can be written as

                        A scheme contains a number of indicators, divided into cost indices (the higher the index, the less the efficiency) and benefit indices (the higher the index, the better the efficiency). Moreover, dimension is different for each indicator. Among the above mentioned five indicators, structural holes belong to cost index, and the remaining four indicators belong to benefit index. In order to compare, we make the following process for the decision matrix.

For cost indices,

                        Firstly, compare every two indicators through three scale method (0, 1, 2), we can get the comparison matrix 
                           B
                        . In the network, CH does not only reflect the global features of the network, but also distinguishes the local differences of nodes extremely well, and thus CH is set to be the most important indicator. The greater the prestige of a node, the greater its influence, so CI is the second important. It is arduous to compare the merits of CF and CN, because the former incarnates the amount of information of the node in the network, while the latter gives expression to the center feature of the node. Hence, this paper makes CF and CN equally important. While compared with other indicators, CS reflects little information regarding the network structure. Accordingly CS is the least important.

By Eq. (13), the closeness degree Zi
                         to the ideal solution is calculated. Then rank the alternatives in accordance with the closeness degree to the ideal solution. The higher Zi
                         are assumed to be more important and should be given higher priority.

                                 Step 5 On the basis of Eq. (13), calculate the closeness degree Zi
                                  to the ideal solution, namely, the comprehensive importance of a node;


                                 Step 6 Rank the alternatives from big to small according to the closeness degree Zi
                                  to the ideal solution. The higher the value of Zi
                                 , the greater the position of the node in the network.

The time complexity of the process mainly depends on the complexity of the five selected indicators which are CH, CF, CN, CI and CS. The time complexities of the five selected indicators are given as O(N), O(N
                        2), O
                           
                              (
                              N
                              +
                              M
                              )
                              ,
                           
                         O(N
                        3) and O(N
                        2), respectively. And the time complexity of the whole sorting scheme is O(Nlog2N). Obviously, the time complexity of the proposed methodology is not high. So it could be applied in large-scale networks.

The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by the following examples.

Take “Kite network” (Wang, Li, & Chen, 2012) as an example (as shown in Fig. 1
                        ), calculate each indicator of all nodes, as indicated in Tab. 2
                        .

In Table 2, the attribute values of all of the indicators worked out. Further, the weighted normalized matrix can be got by using the weight of each indicator and the normalized decision matrix 
                           Y
                        :

From Fig. 1, node 7 is in the position of the largest network information traffic. Node 7 can timely and accurately capture and transfer of information. Node 4 and node 5 are in the same location in the network structure, so they have the same sort. Moreover, node 4 and node 5 are located at the confluence of the center and the secondary node, which play the roles of the bridge. Therefore, node 4 and node 5 rank the second. Compared with node 4 and node 5, node 9 and node 10 do not play the role of a bridge. Therefore, node 9 and node 10 rank behind node 4 (node 5). Although node 3 has low degree, if we delete node 3, the network can be in interruption completely. Thus, node 3 is more important than node 6 (or node 8), and node 2 (or node 1). For node 6 and node 8, they are located in the same location in the network structure. In the same vein, after deleting them, the connectivity of the network would be unchanged, so node 6 and node 8 rank more behind relatively. Intuitively, for node 2 and node 1, they make sense that less information gets transmitted, so they are less important.


                        Table 4
                         shows the comparative results of node importance indicators and their priorities by using a single indicator, such as betweenness, degree, and closeness. The sorted result by using the one single indicator was different from the sorted result by using the proposed method. Because each indicator has a different emphasis. Betweenness is a global characteristic and reflects the influence of a node in the entire network. A node, which has a great betweenness value, is similar to bridge node and may be the junction of two communities. Degree is the local influence of a node in a network. The degree of a node represents the communication capability of a node with other nodes. The closeness centrality of a node can be expressed as the reciprocal of the total length of the shortest paths from the node to all the other nodes in the network. If closeness centrality of a node is large, the node lies to the network center, which indicates that a node occupies an important position in the network.

In Tab. 6
                        , we give the rankings of Top5% nodes by the proposed method and other methods mentioned in the literatures (Zhao, Wang, Zheng, & Guo, 2009; Zhou, Zhang, & Li, 2012) in ARPA. Figs. 3
                        , 4
                         and 5
                         are part of ARPA after removing the Top5% nodes and their connected edges of ARPA. As can be observed from Fig. 3, ARPA is divided into six separate parts. Nevertheless, Figs. 4 and 5 are divided into four and five separate parts, respectively. It is demonstrated that the method of this paper is more accurate.

In order to better verify the proposed method, we evaluate node importances in Zachary karate club network and 40 HIV/AIDS patients relational network. Fig. 6
                         indicates the calculation results by using the method of this paper. We select the Top5% ranked important nodes in Zachary karate club. The larger the nodes , the more important. We can see that the Top5% nodes can overwhelmingly cover the important nodes in Zachary karate club network. These important nodes are some central figures and they are related to the most popular individuals. They play important roles in one aspect of the whole team.

The proposed method is also applied to a network of 40 homosexuals with AIDS. We selected the Top5% ranked important nodes in the HIV/AIDS network Fig. 7
                        . The larger the nodes (blue nodes) are, the more important they are. Their ranking is compatible with the ranking which is generated by the real spreading process substantially. The Top5%, like nodes 5, 8, 11 and 16, have high current values and are more likely to be bridging nodes. The blue spreading nodes are the most “popular” and would cover almost all the network. At the same time, the blue nodes are considered to be more central than other nodes and they can spread the information (or disease) faster. Moreover, being located in the middle of the contact network, individual 22 is now considered to be the most central. It is rather intuitive to establish that individual 26 is more important while individual 5 is rather peripheral. Therefore, the proposed method can rank the nodes spreading ability correctly.

In this paper, we first reviewed five indicators to evaluate node importance in actual complex networks and analyzed their characteristics. The paper selects these indicators, respectively, from the points of local attributes, global attributes of network, information dissemination and network location. A multi-attribute ranking method is proposed to evaluate node importance comprehensively in this paper. On the whole, our proposed method is verified to be feasible and outperforms other methods by comparative experiments in two actual complex networks. According to the proposed method, we can provide decision support for emergency management in actual engineering, which is overwhelmingly important to national stability and development. In addition, the generalization of the results to any undirected relational network is straightforward.
