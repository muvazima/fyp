                  Regulatory interactions among target genes and regulatory factors occur instantaneously or with time-delay. In this paper, we propose a novel approach namely TDSDMI based on time-delayed S-system model (TDSS) model and delayed mutual information (DMI) to infer time-delay gene regulatory network (TDGRN). Firstly DMI is proposed to delete redundant regulator factors for each target gene. Secondly restricted gene expression programming (RGEP) is proposed as a new representation of the TDSS model to identify instantaneous and time-delayed interactions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, TDSDMI is applied to both simulated and real biological datasets. Experimental results reveal that TDSDMI performs better than the recent reconstruction methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the major challenges of system biology is to develop an efficient and accurate framework that could describe the dynamical behaviors of gene regulatory network during recent years [1,2]. Technologies like microarray and high-throughput sequencing could give a large number of gene expression data, which promotes inference of regulatory interactions among genes [3,4].

Gene regulatory network (GRN) is one of the most important biological networks, which has some characteristics, such as strong coupling, random, time-delayed, and strongly nonlinear. In GRN, mRNA of transcription factor must first be translated into protein, and protein regulates the expression of the downstream region of target gene. The process from mRNA to regulation of transcription factor needs a time lag. The actual regulation of transcription factors from the transcription factor to mRNA requires a time delay. Almost all genetic interactions are delayed [5,6]. So time-delayed factor is one of the most important characteristics of gene regulatory network. Many methods have been proposed to identify time-delayed gene regulatory network (TDGRN). Huang et al. proposed GeneReg based on time delay linear regression to construct TDGRN [7]. Li et al. developed a new method that combined relative change ratio and time-delayed dynamic Bayesian network (TDBN) to infer networks [8]. Chueh developed a new approach to reconstruct time delay Boolean networks as a tool for exploring biological pathways [9]. Zoppoli proposed TimeDelay-ARACNE to detect time-delayed dependencies between the expression profiles by assuming as underlying probabilistic model a stationary Markov Random Field [10]. Some preprocess methods were also proposed to determine the optimal time delay in advance. For example, Mundra et al. proposed that an unbiased cross-correlation was used to determine the probability of time delay [11]. ElBakry et al. proposed that pairwise correlations between each pair of genes, for various time delays, were computed and the time delay, at which the correlation was maximum, was the estimated delay between the genes of the pair [12]. Through analysis of these methods, the following problems are not resolved. (1) Due to experimental cost and time, the gene express data has the “large p small n” problem (p is the number of genes and n is the number of experimental sample points). This problem could hinder identification work. (2) The time delay is fixed before the modeling model is constructed.

To achieve a deep understanding of real-world problems in medicine, health care, technology and life sciences, some researchers have proposed reasonable mathematical methods [14]. Mathematical modeling is the art of translating problems from an application area into tractable mathematical formulations, whose theoretical and numerical analysis provides insight, answers, and guidance, useful to understand the original application [13]. One of the most successful mathematical methods is differential equation. The system of differential equations can describe the dynamic properties of a system, which changes with time quite well and predict the future states of the system very conveniently. Chen et al. proposed a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to predict the small-time scale traffic measurements data [15]. Wu et al. proposed a sparse additive ODE model, coupled with ODE estimation methods and adaptive group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator techniques, to model dynamic GRNs that could flexibly deal with nonlinear regulation effects [16]. The data from real-word system inevitably contains noise. So instead of the conventional mathematical modeling approaches which are deterministic, stochastic techniques are becoming increasingly necessary. Chowdhury et al. developed a stochastic nonlinear differential equation (S-system) modeling approach to cope with the inherent noise present in the microarray data [17].

In this paper, we propose a new framework based on time delayed S-system (TDSS) model and delayed mutual information (DMI) called TDSDMI to identify TDGRN. TDSDMI contains two steps. One step is that DMI could be used to delete redundant regulator factors and select the proper regulatory factor set for each target gene. This step could decrease the number of candidate regulation genes and revolve the data dimension problem. The second step is that time-delayed S-system (TDSS) model is proposed to infer TDGRN [18]. An improved gene expression programming (GEP), named restricted GEP (RGEP), is proposed as a new representation of the TDSS model. A hybrid evolutionary method based on a structure-based evolutionary algorithm and hybrid particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the architecture and parameters of TDSS model. In the process of optimization of TDSS model, the time delay could be learned from the gene expression data automatically.

One synthetic data and real biological data are used to test the validity of our proposed model TDSDMI. Experimental results demonstrate that our model could infer gene regulatory network accurately.

The traditional S-system model possesses a rich structure which can capture various dynamics and has a good compromise between accuracy and mathematical flexibility [19,20]. In order to model the delay characteristic of data, time-delayed S-system (TDSS) model was proposed. The form of each time-delayed differential equation i is given as follows [18]:

Ferreira first proposed gene expression programming (GEP) in year 2001 [21]. Due to its linear strings of fixed length like genetic algorithm (GA) and expression as nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes like genetic programming (GP), GEP and modified GEP have been widely applied in many fields [22–24]. In this paper, according to special form of TDSS model, an improved GEP, named restricted GEP (RGEP), is first proposed.

An example of TDSS represented by RGEP is illustrated in Fig. 1
                           . TDSS contains two terms, so the chromosome in RGEP is composed of two genes. Each gene represents one term. A RGEP gene is a string of function and terminal symbols, which is composed of a head and a tail. The head part contains both function and terminal symbols, whereas the tail part contains terminal symbols only. The function (F) and terminal (T) sets are described as follows:

The head could be created through selecting symbols randomly from the function set F and terminal set T. The symbols of tail are selected from terminal set T only. For each problem, user must determine the head length (h) in advanced. The tail length (t) is computed as:

The number of genes in RGEP is set as 2, and the link function between two genes is represented by subtraction (−). Fig. 1(b) describes their arithmetic expression tree (ET). The linking function (−) connects the expression trees of gene1 and gene2 together to make up the expression tree of one chromosome.

In the process of generating the initial population, three kinds of necessary parameters need be created randomly. The first ones are coefficients α

                            corresponding to gene1 and gene2, respectively. In each gene, kinetic orders (g
                           
                              ij

                              ij
                           ) are created randomly for every terminal node. The last parameters are time-delayed values (τ

Three genetic operators are used for reproduction of chromosome of RGEP, namely mutation, recombination and selection. Mutation and recombination could generate new offsprings by changing parent population. Selection could select offsprings from parent population according to the fitness. Detailed operating methods are described in [25].

To find the optimal coefficients and exponents of RGEP, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is proposed. According to Fig. 1, we check all the parameters (

                                 Step 1: Candidate regulatory factor selection. High MI value indicates that there may be a close relationship between the two variables (genes), while low MI value implies their independence. For each target gene, genes with high MI are most likely the true regulators. According to gene express data, DMI between all possible target- regulatory pairs are computed using Eq. (12) (Fig. 3(b)). Predefine a threshold. DMI between two genes is set as zero when DMI is less than threshold (Fig. 3(c)). For each target gene, select the regulatory factors to constitute the candidate regulatory factor set. DMI between target gene and candidate regulatory factor must be not zero (Fig. 3(d)). This step could reduce the noisy regulation.

                      in S-system model contributes to its own degradation, so autoregulation is considered in our experiment. All the experiments are executed on a PC (Intel Pentium Dual 2.60GHz processor and 4GB memory). TDSDMI is implemented by C language programming. To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare our proposed method (TDSDMI) with the popular method Bayesian network (BN) model, traditional S-system model and the method which only uses time-delayed S-system model to identify gene regulatory network without DMI (labeled as TDSS [18,32]).

The first artificial dataset is a four-node network, which has been used to evaluate inference methods of gene regulatory network [28]. The corresponding time-delayed S-system model is described as follows:

Comparing Eq. (15) with Eq. (16), it can be seen that the inferred values are quite close to their true values and all time-delayed values are identified accurately.


                        Table 1
                         shows the performance of different methods with artificial dataset. It can be clearly seen that TDSS and TDSDMI both could identify all true regulatory relationships, but the fitness value of TDSDMI is smaller and TDSDMI spends less time. The comparison of sensitivity (S
                        
                           n
                        ) curves of network using TDSS and TDSDMI is illustrated in Fig. 5
                        . TDSS could identify all regulatory relationships at about 80th generation, while at 25th generation TDSDMI could achieve that S
                        
                           n
                         is 1. From the results, we can see that DMI can promote the algorithm to find the true regulatory relationships.

To test the noise-tolerance of the proposed algorithm, normally distributed noise with zero mean and 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 standard deviations are added to the artificial time series. Performance of TDSS and TDSDMI using noise-time series data is listed in Table 2
                        . From Table 2, we can see that TDSS could not identify all real regulatory relationships when noise beyond 10%. TDSDMI is more robust than TDSS. In TDSDMI, DMI could reduce effect of noise and improve the robustness of the algorithm.

The second artificial dataset is from a thirty-node biochemical genetic network, which is described in Fig. 6
                         
                        [28]. The parameters containing kinetic orders, rate constants and delay parameters in the corresponding TDSS are listed in Table 3
                        .

In this experiment, we use 10 time-series datasets and each dataset contains 21 time points from 0 to 20. The used instruction set is

                        . From Table 4, we can see that TDSDMI has a perfect sensitivity (S
                        
                           n
                        ), identifying all true regulator relationships. TDSDMI also has the highest S
                        
                           p
                        , which means that the inferred network contains less false positive regulations.

To test the validation of our method with a real biological gene regulatory network, we use gene regulatory network of the SOS pathway from E. coil 
                        [30]. It refers to the DNA induced response in the case of damage. When the DNA molecule is damaged, the activity of recA protein is activated, the inhibitor (lexA protein) is decomposed and the expression of other genes is induced. When the external stimuli or signals of DNA injured disappear, the recA protein has a loss of enzyme activity and the inhibitor (lexA protein) plays a role. We select six genes for our experiment: uvrD, lexA, umuD, recA, uvrA, and polB. The time course profiles contain 50 time points evenly spaced by 6min. Fig. 8
                         displays the known regulatory interactions among 6 genes.

                           }
                        . The time-delayed value is selected randomly from [0, τ
                        
                           max
                        ] (τ
                        
                           max
                        =4). The inferred gene regulatory network by TDSDMI is described in Fig. 9
                        . Comparing Fig. 8 with Fig. 9, it can be seen that TDSDMI could identify all true regulations and only infer one false positive regulation (uvrA ⟶lexA). The comparison results of four methods are listed in Table 5
                        . From the results, we can see that TDSDMI and S-system+DPSO have a perfect S
                        
                           n
                        , which means that two methods could identify all true regulations. TDSDMI has the higher S
                        
                           p
                        , which means TDSDMI infers less false positive regulations.


                        Table 5 also shows that TDSDMI takes longer to find good results than the methods like BN and S-system+DE; however, their S
                        
                           n
                         and S
                        
                           p
                         are low compared with TDSDMI. TDSDMI are faster than TDSS and S-system+DPSO.

Due to the time-delayed nature of biological regulatory process, we have introduced a method, called TDSDMI, that improves the accuracy of gene regulatory network reconstruction compared with recent methods and takes into account instantaneous and time-delayed interactions. The following factors may lead to the good performance of our method.

First, DMI is applied to select the regulatory factors to constitute the candidate regulatory factor set for each target gene. This step could reduce the noisy factor of gene expression data, reduce the number of candidate regulator factors and shorten the search time of optimization methods. The experimental results reveal that TDSS with DMI (TDSDMI) could perform better than TDSS in the terms of accuracy and runtime.

Second, the form of restricted gene express programming is very near to the representation of the TDSS model based on linear encoding representation. Thus our method reduces the problem complexity.

In the future, we will apply TDSDMI to the large-scale real gene regulatory network identification and develop the parallel program of TDSDMI.
