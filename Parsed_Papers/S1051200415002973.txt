                  Estimation of the number of harmonics in multidimensional sinusoids is studied in this paper. The ESTimation ERror (ESTER) is a subspace based detection approach that is robust against colored noise. However, the number of signals it can detect is very limited. To improve the identifiability, we propose to combine the multidimensional folding (MDF) techniques with ESTER for multidimensional sinusoidal order selection. Our algorithm development is inspired by the shift invariance properties of the two matrix slices resulting from multidimensional folding and unfolding, which have been exploited to extract the spatial frequencies in the literature. The maximum identifiable number of signals of the MDF-ESTER is of the order of magnitude of product of the lengths of all spatial dimensions with uniform spacing, which is significantly larger than that of the conventional multidimensional ESTER methods. Meanwhile, it inherits the robustness of the ESTER against colored noise, and performs comparably to state-of-the-art schemes when the number of signals is small.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Multidimensional sinusoidal frequency estimation or harmonic retrieval (HR) [1] has numerous applications ranging from multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging [2], channel estimation in wireless communication systems [3–5] to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [6,7]. Parametric approaches to N-dimensional (N-D) frequency estimation, e.g., N-D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques (ESPRIT) and its variants [8–11], N-D multiple signal classification (MUSIC) [12], multidimensional folding (MDF) [13,14], improved MDF [15], N-D rank reduction estimator (RARE) [16] and principal-singular-vector utilization for modal analysis (PUMA) [17,18] provide super-resolution estimation performance. However, they rely on the a priori knowledge of the number of signals, which is often unknown and must be estimated from the noisy multidimensional measurements. As a matter of fact, it is a challenge to accurately determine the number of complex sinusoids from noisy N-D data, because the noise is usually spatially color, thereby calling for development of robust methodologies for sinusoidal order estimation.

In matrix case, it is common to use the eigenvalue spectrum for detecting the number of signals. Classical eigenvalue based order selection rules include the information theoretic criterion based methods [19] such as minimum description length (MDL) [20] and Akaike information criterion (AIC) [21], which are optimal in the fixed dimension-length large sample-size asymptotic regime, and the random matrix theory (RMT) based algorithms [22–25] that are designed for large dimension-length but relatively small sample-size scenarios. All these algorithms rely on the assumption that the noise is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian. For correlated noise environment, they generally suffer a performance degradation.

To handle colored-noise scenarios, a number of subspace based methods that exploit the eigenvectors have been proposed [26–30]. In [26,31], the ESTimation ERror (ESTER) has been proposed for detecting the number of complex sinusoids, namely, uniform harmonics. It utilizes the shift invariance property of the signal subspace spanned by the sinusoids. Later in [27], an improved version of ESTER called subspace based automatic model order selection (SAMOS) is developed by exploiting the singular values of the signal subspace matrix. Although with better performance, the number of identifiable signals of SAMOS is reduced by half compared with ESTER. Compared with the eigenvalue based methods, the subspace based methods are more robust against colored noise.

However, these methods do not have direct multilinear counterparts that correspond to the multidimensional sinusoidal order selection problem at hand. To handle that, in [32,33] the ESTER is extended to N-D case based on the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). By combining the shift invariance equalities of the sinusoidal signal subspace in all dimensions, the N-D ESTER provides an improvement over n-mode ESTER in probability of correct detection (PoD) as well as robustness against colored noise. However, the number of detectable signals is limited to the maximum spatial dimension length minus 2.

To improve the identifiability, we propose to apply the MDF techniques [13,14] combined with the ESTER criterion for multidimensional sinusoidal order selection. The idea of multidimensional folding is to extend an N-D tensor to a 
                        (
                        2
                        N
                        +
                        1
                        )
                     -D tensor and then nest the augmented tensor to a 3-D tensor (the length of the 
                        (
                        2
                        N
                        +
                        1
                        )
                     -th and third dimension are both equal to 2) by dimensionality embedding. The two matrix slices of the resultant 3-D tensor satisfy the shift invariance equation
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        For undamped (constant-modulus) sinusoidal model, instead of constructing an additional dimension of length 2, forward–backward averaging [34] is exploited to construct the shift invariance equation in [14].
                      based on which the spatial frequencies have been extracted [13,14]. In this work, we exploit the same shift invariance properties of the two matrix slices to estimate the sinusoidal order using the ESTER criterion.

The maximum identifiable number of signals of the MDF-ESTER is on the order of magnitude of 
                        
                           ∏
                           n
                        
                        
                           
                              I
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                     , where n indexes the uniform-spacing spatial modes of the observation tensor, and 
                        
                           
                              I
                           
                           
                              n
                           
                        
                      is the corresponding dimension length. This indicates a significant improvement over [32,33]. Meanwhile, it inherits the robustness of the ESTER against colored noise, and its performance is comparable to the existing N-D ESTER schemes [32,33] when the number of signals is small.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the N-D HR data model. In Sections 3 and 4, our proposed algorithms with integration of multidimensional folding and ESTER for N-D sinusoidal order estimation are described. Section 3 is devoted to the single-snapshot case, while Section 4 addresses the multiple-snapshot case. Simulation results are provided in Section 5, and in Section 6, conclusions are drawn.

It is worth noting that our proposed detection algorithm can be also applied in the partly uniform multidimensional HR model, where only part (but at least 1) of the factor matrices

Such a partly uniform multidimensional HR model may appear in array processing which employs a uniform linear or rectangular array at the transmitter while a non-uniform antenna array at the receiver, or an antenna array with uniform spacing along one array axis but non-uniform spacing along the other axis [1]. For the partly uniform multidimensional HR model, the (spatial) dimensions with a non-uniform structure are merged with the temporal dimension via block unfolding [41,42] so that the temporal dimension in (1) accounts for these non-exponential dimensions as well.

                      Equation (25) is called the shift or rotational invariance equation. The shift invariance property of the sinusoidal signal model has been used by ESPRIT [43] to estimate the frequencies.

The ESTER [26,31] selects an appropriate model order based on the rotational invariance property of the signal subspace spanned by the sinusoids. It was derived by minimizing the error bound induced by passing an under-estimated model order to ESPRIT [43]. In this subsection, we will provide a brief derivation of ESTER based on the new shift invariance equation (25) obtained from MDF.

The performance measure is the PoD, i.e.,

                        )
                     . The PoD's of the following schemes are used as the benchmark: the original N-D ESTER proposed in [32] and its two variants proposed in [33]. The MATLAB codes of all order selection algorithms can be downloaded at http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~hcso/publication.html.

For a single-snapshot (

                           =
                           1
                        ) HR model we evaluate the MDF-ESTER proposed in Section 3. Note that for single-snapshot HR model, the N-D ESTER II [33] is not applicable since 
                           T
                           <
                           R

                           The N-D ESTER II relies on the tensor shift invariance equation (defined in (20) of [33]) and that in the absence of noise the tensor signal subspace represented by 
                                 U
                               (defined in (21) of [33]) and the array steering tensor 
                                 A
                               (defined in (7) of [33]) span the same subspace in all n-modes. The tensor signal subspace 
                                 U
                               is estimated by performing truncation in the HOSVD. In case of 
                                 T
                                 <
                                 R
                              , the problem is degenerate in the temporal mode. As a result, the estimated 
                                 U
                               via the HOSVD will be of rank at most T and less than R, and 
                                 U
                               cannot span the same subspace as 
                                 A
                               in the absence of noise.

                         signals, where the correlation coefficients of the colored noise are set as

                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.125
                        . We see that the MDF-ESTER outperforms the original N-D ESTER [32] and N-D ESTER I [33]. The MDF-ESTER with FBA performs the best. In Fig. 6(b), the order selection schemes are evaluated for various noise correlation levels, where the SNR is fixed at 30 dB. Here, the correlation coefficients are equal to each other and vary from 0 to 0.999. Note that the MDF-ESTER keeps almost a constant PoD regardless of the noise correlation levels except for very high noise correlation levels.

In Fig. 7, the number of signals is increased from 4 to 8. The N-D ESTERs totally fail since they can detect at most 5 signals, as shown in Table 1. Similar observations are obtained except for a larger performance gap between the MDF-ESTER without and with FBA.

For a multiple-snapshot (
                           T
                           >
                           1
                        ) HR model we evaluate the MDF-ESTER proposed in Section 4.

In Fig. 8, we have the same scenario as in Figs. 6 and 7, the number of snapshots is increased from 
                           T
                           =
                           1
                         to 
                           T
                           =
                           125
                        . We observe a performance improvement of all algorithms compared to Fig. 6. In addition, Fig. 8(b) indicates a weaker robustness of all algorithms compared to Figs. 6(b) and 7(b). With the increase of the noise correlation level, the PoDs of all algorithms show a slight (but clear) decrease for low-to-intermediate 
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         followed by a sharp drop for high 
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           >
                           0.8
                        .

Moreover, for such a multiple-snapshot scenario with sufficiently large T, the MDF-ESTER can detect much more signals compared to the single-snapshot case. Fig. 9 shows that at 
                           R
                           =
                           32
                         the MDF-ESTER is still able to detect the number of signals with a probability of one for sufficiently high SNRs.  
                         
                         
                        
                     

The maximum numbers of detectable signals of the N-D ESTER methods and our proposed MDF-ESTER for the single-snapshot and multiple-snapshot scenarios are summarized in Table 1.

Multidimensional sinusoidal order selection is required in many applications. The ESTER is a subspace based detection approach that is robust against colored noise. We propose to combine the MDF techniques with the ESTER for multidimensional sinusoidal order selection. Based on the observation that the two matrix slices resulting from multidimensional folding and embedding satisfy the shift invariance equation, the ESTER criterion is employed to estimate the sinusoidal order. Compared to state-of-the-art multidimensional ESTERs, the MDF-ESTER can detect significantly much more signals. Meanwhile, it retains the advantage of the ESTER in terms of robustness against colored noise, and is thus suitable for colored noise environments. As a future work, we will evaluate the proposed algorithms on real-world data sets.
