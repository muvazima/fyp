                  This paper presents a fractional anisotropy asymmetry (FAA) method to detect the asymmetry of white matter (WM) integrity and its correlation with the side of seizure origin for partial onset temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using diffusion tensor image (DTI). In this study, FAA analysis is applied to 30 patients of partial TLE (15 left, 15 right) and 14 matched normal controls. Specifically, after registering all the images with the JHU-DTI-MNI template the average FA value of each FA skeleton section is calculated using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. Then, FAA is calculated to quantify the WM diffusivity asymmetry of the corresponding region-pairs between the left and right hemispheres. Using FAA the regional asymmetry contributing significantly to the group differences of controls and left/right TLE, as well as the left and right TLE, is identified. As a comparison, the ROI-based average FA values for WM and corresponding FAAs are also calculated. TBSS-based analysis reflects the average of local maximal FA values along the white matter skeleton sections, and ROI-based analysis shows the average of WM FA values within each anatomical region. The FAA statistical results indicated that the FA values of anatomical region-pairs are asymmetric in the ipsilateral hemisphere with seizure origin against the contralateral hemisphere. Particularly, FAA values within the temporal lobe (superior, middle, and inferior temporal WM) are significantly different between the left and right TLE patients, consistently found from both analysis methods. The study suggests that FAA values can be potentially used to identify the seizures of origin of TLE and to help understand the relationship between fiber tracts with the side of seizure origin of TLE.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy and is characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures originated from the medial or lateral temporal lobe [1,2]. For many TLE patients, anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL), the complete removal of the anterior portion of the temporal lobe of the brain, provides the possibility of seizure-free or nearly seizure-free treatment and reduces patients’ dependency on anti-epileptic drugs [3,4]. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for identifying the location of seizure foci during the surgical work-up of patients with intractable TLE, with the rapid development of neuroimaging technology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been and is increasingly used routinely to improve the diagnostic certainty, to better determine suitable surgical candidates, and to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone for ATL [5].

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a popular non-invasive MRI modality to investigate the integrity of neural fibers of human brain and has been widely used both in clinic and research to assess the development, degeneration or dysfunction of neural fibers in many neuropathological diseases [6,7]. Recent studies using DTI have revealed bilateral defects in white matter (WM) of TLE patients [5,8], i.e., decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity in the temporal lobe and the extra-temporal lobe tract [8,9]. The results also showed more severe WM defects in the ipsilateral hemisphere with seizure origin as compared to the contralateral hemisphere [10]. These studies suggest that obvious asymmetry of WM deficit exists in TLE patients. However, there is still no effective measurement to quantitatively determine the degree of such WM asymmetry in TLE patients. In the literature, the asymmetry of major WM tracts has been reported in multiple publications [11–13], and it is interesting to identify the difference of asymmetry between normal controls and TLE patients, and between left and right TLE patients. In order to determine the specific anatomical regions, within which the most WM defects occur for TLE, in this paper, we propose an automatic FA asymmetry (FAA) analysis method aiming at quantifying the WM diffusivity asymmetry of each corresponding region-pair between the left and right hemispheres, as well as investigating its relationship with the side of seizure origin of partial TLE patients.

In the literature, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) [14] and tract-based diffusivity statistical analysis [15] are the two popularly used methods in DTI studies to localize WM/brain changes associated with specific pathological conditions. However, due to anatomical variability among individuals, accurate alignment of DTI data and automatic fiber bundle labeling are still challenging for whole brain DTI analysis [15,16]. The tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method overcomes this obstacle by incorporating the strength of both voxel-based and tract-based analysis [17–19]. It first applies a carefully tuned nonlinear registration and then projects the FA values onto an alignment-invariant tract representation, called FA skeleton. The key idea is that even if there exist registration errors the FA skeleton generally found close to the centerline of major WM tracts is stable, so as to the projected FA values. Therefore TBSS improves the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject DTI studies.

In this work, after applying image registration, we use TBSS to calculate the white matter skeleton and the projected FA values along the skeleton of each subject. Then, we superimpose the anatomical regions defined by the JHU-DTI-MNI atlas onto the FA skeleton to define FA skeleton section for each anatomical region. The average FA value of each region is calculated based on the FA skeleton sections for each subject. FA describes how the water diffuses in white matter fibers and is widely used as a marker for tract integrity. Therefore, the average FA value of each region can reflects the WM integrity within each anatomical region. In addition to calculate TBSS-based regional FA values, which reflect the average of local maximal FA values along the skeleton, we also calculate the average WM FA values within in region, referred to as ROI-based FA analysis. The latter reflects average FA values without the local projection onto the skeleton. We put the results of both TBSS-based and ROI-based analyses side-by-side for comparison.

To calculate the FA asymmetry of corresponding regions between the left and right hemispheres, an automatic FAA analysis method is proposed in this paper. FAA of a region-pair reflects the difference of WM integrity between the two hemispheres in a percentage level and tells us whether the FA of the region-pair is symmetric of asymmetric. Because FAA is calculated within each subject, it is not affected by the inter-subject variability and can be potentially used for detecting the WM abnormalities to localize the regions of defects for TLE patients.

In the experiments, TBSS-based and ROI-based FAA analyses are applied to the datasets collected from 30 patients with partial TLE and 14 age-matched normal controls. Then, FAA values of all the white matter regions are calculated followed by statistical analysis by comparing three groups: left TLE vs. control, right TLE vs. control, and right TLE vs. right TLE. The results indicate that left TLE can be consistently distinguished from controls using both analyses, and there exist strong correlation between FAA and the side of seizure origin: FAA values within temporal lobe (including superior, middle, and inferior temporal WM) and PreCuWM are significantly different between the left and right TLE patients using both methods. The results showed that although WM defects appear in both hemispheres for TLE, more severe artifacts are found on the ipsilateral hemisphere of seizure origin in contrast to that of the contralateral hemisphere, particularly in the temporal lobe regions.

Thirty patients with partial TLE (15 left, age: 43.5±18.9 and 15 right, age: 38.9±13.4) and 14 age-matched normal controls were used in the study. EEG was performed to locate the seizure foci for each patient before the MRI scanning, and the side of seizures original (left or right temporal lobe) had been confirmed by joint diagnosis among neurologists, neurosurgeon, and neuropsychologists. For the MRI scans a 3-Telsa GE system was used for DTI data collection, and the parameters were set as follows: TR=8000ms, TE=80ms, b
                        =1000s/mm2, and image matrix size is 256×256×35. The control dataset used for comparison purpose was obtained from the Susumu Mori group at Johns Hopkins, which includes the results of 14 healthy subjects (age: 40.2±6.8). The controls were scanned with the DTI data collection parameters set as: TR=7880ms, TE=80ms, b
                        =700s/mm2, matrix size 256×256×50. More detailed information can be found from the following website: https://www.mristudio.org. There was no significant age difference in our study, neither between the left TLE and the right TLE groups (p
                        =0.45), nor between the control group and the TLE groups (p
                        =0.53 for control vs. left TLE and p
                        =0.74 for control vs. right TLE).

The three major steps for our proposed FAA method are shown in Fig. 1
                        . In the first step, the local fast marching (FM)-based simultaneous deformable registration algorithm [16] is used to register all the DTI data collected from the TLE patients and the normal controls to the JHU-DTI-MNI template space [20]. Then, after warping all the FA maps onto the template space with the resultant deformable fields, TBSS is employed to generate the WM skeleton from the average deformed FA image. In step 2, using TBSS, the FA values along the FA skeleton are calculated for each subject. Then, superimposing the atlas on the FA skeleton, corresponding FA skeleton sections are defined, and the average FA value of each skeleton section is calculated. The FAA value on each corresponding left-right WM section pair is calculated to quantify the WM integrity differences of the anatomical regions between two hemispheres of each subject. Finally, in step 3, statistical analysis is carried out to compare FAA values between control and left TLE, control and right TLE, as well as left and right TLE. The regions with significant differences indicate those significantly contribute to the group differences.

In addition to use the registration [16], one of the key step used in the paper is TBSS. Due to the alignment inaccuracy and anatomical variability among subjects, quantitative comparison of FA values within each fiber bundle or region of interest (ROI) may result in less sensitivities and higher false-positive errors. The TBSS method attempts to solve this problem by combining the strengths of both voxel-based methods and bundle-based methods, which generates relatively stable quantitative measures than other analysis methods. The idea behind TBSS is to extract the FA skeleton from the average FA image after registration. Because such FA skeleton is located along the centerline of each WM bundle, it will be still inside the WM bundle of each subject unless the registration errors are too large. Therefore, according to TBSS, by projecting the FA values along the short perpendicular lines of the skeleton and obtaining the maximal FA value along each line, the FA values defined on the FA skeleton of each subject are less affected by the registration errors. Of course, registration algorithm with high accuracy is still preferred because it helps overlap the FA skeleton robustly on each subject.

In this work, the TBSS is modified to use the high dimension deformable registration algorithm to do the DTI image registration [16]. The procedure for calculating the TBSS features is summarized as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              Apply DTI registration to deform all the subjects onto the JHU-DTI-MNI template space. Calculate the mean FA map from all the warped FA images and apply a thinning procedure to get the skeletonized mean FA image. The skeleton is masked with a preset threshold so that it is constrained on the major fiber bundles and does not cover the regions with low mean FA or high inter-subject FA variability. Except to using the DTI registration [16], this step is the same as the TBSS algorithm [19]. It is worth noting that using simulated DTI images with similar image resolution, we evaluated the accuracy of the registration algorithm, and the average registration error was 3.3mm for ten simulated images.

For each warped FA image, by searching perpendicularly within a small range of each skeleton point, the maximal FA values are projected onto the skeleton so each skeleton voxel is now assigned an FA value. Then, the FA skeleton is overlaid with the JHU-DTI-MNI atlas and is divided into different sections according to the anatomical regions. Finally, the FA feature of each section or each region is defined as the average FA value of the corresponding skeleton section.

Specifically, for subject s, the average FA value of each WM skeleton section l is calculated as:

The FAA values reflect the asymmetry of each pair of anatomical regions. For example, negative FAA value indicates leftward asymmetry or FA value in the left side region is smaller than that on the right side; and positive FAA value indicates rightward asymmetry of defect.

After calculating the average FA value on the WM skeleton within each anatomical region for each subject, as well as the FA asymmetry for each subject, we can perform statistical tests on 
                           
                              A

                         and FAA values and compare the group differences among normal controls, left TLE, and right TLE. The goal is to quantitatively analyze FAA changes associated with the side of seizure origin of patients with TLE.

In addition to the proposed TBSS-based FAA analysis, we also performed the ROI-based method side-by-side. The ROI-based FAA analysis uses the similar steps, but no TBSS is used. Specifically, after image registration, we overlay the atlas on the registered images and calculate the average white matter FA values (>0.25) for each region, and similarly the FAA value of each region-pair is calculated using Eq. (2). Notice that the difference between the two methods is that TBSS-based method reflects the average of locally projected maximal FA values along the skeleton, while ROI-based analysis seeks the overall average of FA values within each region. One would expect that regions consistently pinpointed from both methods may be more robust to reflect the significant changes within the groups under comparison.

@&#RESULTS@&#

To determine whether the WM tract integrity correlates with the side of seizure origin, we registered all the 14 control and 30 TLE data onto the template image. Fig. 2
                      shows some of the registered results. The first two rows give the registered images with ROI label overlap. The last two rows show the sample results of the FA skeletons. We performed ROI-based FA analysis (by calculating the average white matter FA values (>0.25) within each ROI), and TBSS-based FA analysis side-by-side for comparison. For ROI-based analysis, we calculated the FA asymmetry similar to Eq. (2), and the only difference is that now the FA average is based on ROI not on the skeleton section. One-tailed t-tests on the FAA values among three groups, i.e., between controls and left TLE, between control and right TLE, and between left and right TLE, were performed [21].


                     Fig. 3
                      lists all the WM regions and the −log(p) values of FAA by comparing the left or right TLE with the control group. The dotted line shows the threshold for p-value. Fig. 3(a) is the result using TBSS-based FAA analysis, and Fig. 3(b) shows that using ROI-based FAA comparison. The labels are ordered based on the p-values between left TLE and controls. It can be seen that the regions contributing to significant group differences between left TLE and control are the same from the two methods. On the other hand, to distinguish right TLE with controls, the two methods yield different regions. Fig. 4
                      shows the Venn diagraph to summarize these regions for right TLE. The disagreement between the two methods may indicate that compared with left TLE, the right TLE contains relatively little distinctive white matter features with controls. In fact, TBSS-based method calculates the average of local maximal FA values along white matter skeletons, while ROI-based methods computes the average white matter FA values within each ROI, it can be seen that not only the local maximal but also the regional average of FA values consistently contribute to the group differences (e.g., between left TLE and control) if the results for both methods match together. Therefore, left TLE is more distinguishable from controls from the study of our datasets. From Fig. 3, we can also see that temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and uncinate fasciculus play important roles in separating left TLE from the controls.

Next, to study FAA features that distinguish the left and right TLE patients, we performed one-tailed t-test of FAA values between the two groups using both TBSS-based and ROI-based methods, and Fig. 5
                      plots the results. It can be seen that ITWM, STWM, MTWM, and PreCuWM are highlighted in both comparison. These four common regions are shown in Fig. 6
                      by overlaying on the template FA image.

Altogether, there are seven regions involved in the left and right TLE comparison, namely ITWM, MTWM, STWM, IFWM, MFWM, PreCuWM, and IOWM. In order to see the details, we plotted the FAA values of these seven regions for left TLE, right TLE, and controls in Fig. 7
                     . Fig. 7(a) is the result using TBSS-based method, and Fig. 7(b) shows the result using ROI-based analysis. The bars illustrate the average FAA values for each group, and the error bars are the std (standard deviation) values. If the FAA of a region is significantly different from the controls (p
                     <0.05), we put a star on the corresponding bar. The labels with significant left/right TLE differences are underlined.

It can be seen in Fig. 7 that for most labels, FAA values for right TLE are higher than those for left TLE. Therefore, the FA values for left TLE are leftward (relatively small FA on the left), whereas those for right TLE are rightward (relatively small FA on the right). Particularly, for the four regions that have been found in common in both methods, i.e., IFWM, STWM, MTWM, and PreCuWM, it can be seen that all the FAA values for left TLE patients are negative, and all the FAA values for right TLE patients are positive, demonstrating a clear leftward/rightward asymmetry for left/right TLE.

In summary, the group comparison between left and right TLE, as well as between each TLE group and controls using two methods showed that left TLE can be consistently distinctive from the control group, and FAA asymmetry of ITWM, STWM, MTWM, and PreCuWM consistently demonstrate significant difference between the left and right TLE groups. While for right TLE vs. control, the results from the two methods show some sort of disagreement. One may need to further look at the details of absolute FA values in each region, however, the shortcoming of this paper is that the control and disease data were collected from different machines using different protocols and they have different resolutions. This renders FA values calculated different between control and disease. It is the advantage of the proposed FAA method, which only calculates and compares the FA asymmetry values calculated within each subject, and makes it possible to compare different groups with the relative FAA values. In the literature, the results also indicated that FA in both side of the brain of partial TLE decreases tends to be smaller than controls, and the more severe WM defect happens in the ipsilateral hemisphere with the seizure origin. Using FAA comparison, the paper concludes that ITWM, STWM, MTWM, and PreCuWM demonstrate consistently FA asymmetry, and thus can be used as potential imaging marker to further distinguish left and right TLE, and to help pinpoint which temporal lobe region contributes to the difference more. This may indicate possible seizures foci for TLE.

Finally, for statistical power, we calculated the average and std values of FAA of each group for the four regions. Given a significant level of 0.05, the statistical power values for PreCuWM, STWM, ITWM, and MTWM using one-tail t-test are 71.5%, 92.1%, 99.7, and 98.7% for TBSS-based analysis, and 71%, 92.1%, 99.7%, and 98.7% for ROI-based analysis, respectively. We can see that all the temporal lobe regions have reached a statistical power larger than 90%. The results confirm that temporal lobe FA asymmetry plays consistent role in distinguishing left and right TLE patients.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The fundamental pathophysiologic mechanisms of epileptogenesis are still uncovered, but it is clear that there is extensive and bilateral defect in WM integrity in patients with TLE [8–10]. In this paper, an automatic FAA analysis method was proposed to systematically exam the diffusivity changes in DTI images, as well as the correlation between these changes with the side of seizure origin for left and right TLE patients. Because calculated from the left and right hemispheres on the same subjects, the FAA values for different anatomical region pairs are more robust than the inter-subjects anatomical differences, making FAA a promising candidate of neuroimaging biomarkers to distinguish the left and right TLE patients.

FA value is commonly used to measure the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion in neural fibers and is thought to reflect the microstructural environment of WM fibers [22]. Previous experimental studies suggested that persistent seizure activities in patients with epilepsy can produce neuronal damage or WM defect, such as axonal demyelination, replacement of axons with glia cells, etc., which could result in less anisotropic water diffusion within the WM tracts or FA reduction [23]. Therefore, the findings of asymmetric FA values toward the seizures origin temporal lobe for TLE patients added additional evidence for WM defects.

The asymmetry of WM integrity was explored in terms of FAA both in the left and right TLE patients, showing different pattern of WM asymmetry. Specifically, more severe in WM regions on the seizure side, i.e., lower FA values, were found in the affected hemisphere with seizure origin by compared with that in the contralateral hemisphere. In other words, in left TLE patients, there was leftward asymmetry of FA defect; while in right TLE patients, the asymmetry of defect was rightward. This indicates significant correlation between FAA with the sides of seizure origin. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which showed that changes in FA were most pronounced in the ipsilateral temporal white matter or regions close to the epileptogenic zone [8,10].

Overall, from the results, we can see that temporal lobe WM contributes the most to the group differences. Fig. 8
                         shows 3 major fiber bundles, including the uncinate fasciculus (UNC), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) linking the temporal lobe regions with significantly different WMFAA. All these three tracts are highly associated with language skills [24]. For example, the SLF appears to mediate the ability to understand words and sentences, verbalize thoughts, repeat spoken language, and organize the semantic content of verbal memory. ILF is thought to be involved in transmitting information about object and possibly written words, and UNC may be responsible for transmitting information relating to memory, semantic language content. This is in agreement with the symptoms like perseverative speech in TLE [25]. The results indicated important role of neuropsychology in epilepsy study. One of our future works is thus to correlate the WM integrity measures with neuropsychological tests for better understanding the mechanism of epilepsy.

White matter asymmetry in normal controls had been studies using DTI [13], and it was suggested that language ability and handedness were likely to be associated with the asymmetry of GM and WM in normal controls [26]. Meanwhile, recent study using functional MRI and tractography data also observed WM reorganization in the contralateral hemisphere of left TLE patients [27]. These findings suggested that the study and interpretation of WM asymmetry for TLE should be conducted with caution because some asymmetry also occurs in normal controls. For example, what are the effects of the language ability and handedness to the WM asymmetry combined with left or right TLE. In the future, neuropsychological tests and clinical variables, such as language ability, language laterality, behavioral or brain functional scores, handedness, duration of seizure, etc., will also be involved as additional factors to investigate the relationship between WM morphometric change and epilepsy, to constrain the effect of multivariable, and to increase the diagnostic accuracy of seizure lateralization during the pre-surgical evaluation of individuals with TLE [17,28].

In this study, to reduce the effects of heterogeneity of TLE [29], only the left and right TLE patients were involved. TLE patients showed uncommon bilateral seizures were excluded from the study. Therefore, future work on large patient sample sizes is expected to test how current findings can be extended to more types of TLE. Meanwhile, with more patient and control data being collected, a robust FAA-based classifier can be designed for automatic classification of TLEs with different side of origin.

It is also worth noting that only FA was used to study the asymmetry of TLE patients in the current study. This is mainly because that FA is highly sensitive in identifying the WM defect and has been the most popularly used DTI measurement for neurological diseases. Nevertheless, FA was recognized as a most comparable measure across different MR imaging platforms when considering the DTI data of patients’ and controls’ were captured from different clinical centers in this study. Particularly, previous study showed there was no statistically significant difference of FA values derived from different b-values except internal capsule [30,31]. Meanwhile, FAA values are calculated from each subject, making it unlikely be affected by the inter-subject variability, as well as the parameters of different scanners. These characteristics suggest that it is valuable to compare FA values of MRI images from different scanners. In the future, other metrics calculated from DTI, such as eigenvalue of tensor, radial diffusivity (RD), ADC, as well as network connectivity will also be investigated in a similar way to investigate the characteristics of TLE, and it is believed that such analysis can provide complementary information to localize the abnormality of TLE.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents an automatic FAA analysis method to determine the WM integrity changes associated with the sides of seizure origin of patients with TLE using DTI. The results indicate that FAA from the temporal lobe WM regions contribute significantly and consistently to distinguish left and right TLE with high statistical power. The quantitative results can help for pre-surgical evaluation of TLE patients and for better understanding the relationship between fiber tracts with the side of seizure origin of TLE, EEG tests, the syndromes and neural psychological responses.
