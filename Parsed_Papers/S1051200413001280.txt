                  Visual secret sharing (VSS) is a variant form of secret sharing, and is efficient since secret decoding only depends on the human vision system. However, cheating in VSS, first showed by Horng et al., is a significant issue like a limelight. Since then, plenty of studies for cheating activities and cheating prevention visual secret sharing (CPVSS) schemes have been introduced. In this paper, we revisit some well-known cheating activities and CPVSS schemes, and then categorize cheating activities into meaningful cheating, non-meaningful cheating, and meaningful deterministic cheating. Moreover, we analyze the research challenges in CPVSS, and propose a new cheating prevention scheme which is better than the previous schemes in the aspects of some security requirements.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Visual secret sharing (VSS) is inspired from secret sharing [1]. A secret is converted to a secret image (SI), and then SI will be encoded into many shares. Shares, given to participants by the dealer (a trusted party, 
                        D
                     ), are formed into transparencies in VSS. 
                        X
                      is an authorized subset, and the participants in 
                        X
                      can visually reconstruct the secret image by stacking their transparencies together without performing any complicated cryptographic computation. In the k-out-of-n visual secret sharing (for short, 
                        (
                        k
                        ,
                        n
                        )
                     -VSS), there are n participants, while any k participants in 
                        X
                      are able to reconstruct the secret by stacking their transparencies. Overall, a VSS scheme usually consists of three phases: (1) encoding, (2) distributing, (3) decoding. Encoding is performed by the dealer to generate all transparencies, then 
                        D
                      distributes those transparencies to participants. Finally, the participants in 
                        X
                      can decode the secret image by stacking their transparencies.

In particular, a special and important property to differ VSS from secret sharing [2] is that the security of VSS is achieved by loosing the contrast and the resolution of the SI. Indeed, the quality of the reconstructed secret image is inferior to the original secret image, but the secret is still seen by humanʼs vision. With the development of VSS, many applications and related techniques have been proposed, such as visual authentication, visual identification, and image encryption. In addition, many kinds of VSS schemes were proposed to be used in different scenarios or to achieve different requirements [3–10].

In 2006, as well as the cheaters in secret sharing [11,12], Horng et al. showed that cheating is possible in 
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           n
                           )
                        -VSS, where 
                           k
                           <
                           n
                         
                        [13]. The dishonest participants (referred to as cheaters) collude and want to fool victims, which is called “cheating activity” (CA). CA can cause unpredictable damage to the victims; therefore, the victims accept a fake secret image (as known as a cheating image) different from the actual secret image as authentic. They presented two kinds of cheating prevention methods, share authentication and blind authentication:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Share authentication (SA): Using the verifiable messages, decided by the participant or the dealer, authenticates a share transparency from another participant. A fake transparency, generated by the cheaters, must pass the authentication. However, if the fake transparency can pass the authentication, the victim will accept the stacking result.


                                 Blind authentication (BA): Without relying on any verifiable message, the cheaters predict the structure of the transparencies of the other participants is hard, such that the cheaters are difficult to generate a fake transparency.

We analyze cheating activities and propose a novel cheating prevention visual secret sharing scheme and attach the security analysis. This scheme is provably secure against the meaningful deterministic cheating, and it is better than the previous schemes in the expansion of a pixel. It is also a share authentication cheating prevention scheme without added transparencies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminaries: the model of VSS and the definition of cheating. Section 3 briefly analyzes some cheating activities and cheating prevention schemes. Section 4 shows a novel cheating prevention visual secret sharing scheme. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

A VSS scheme is a special variant of a k-out-of-n secret sharing scheme, where the shares given to participants are xeroxed onto transparencies. Taking the secret image, SI, as input, and generating the transparencies, each black and white pixel of SI is handled separately. It appears as a collection of m black and white subpixels in each of the n transparencies. The m subpixels are denoted by a block. One pixel of the secret image corresponds to nm subpixels, and then the nm subpixels are denoted by an

Before to introduce the well-known cheating activities, we show the following definitions of cheating in VSS from the paper of De Prisco and De Santis [14].


                        
                           Definition 2
                           For any pixel, if the probability of that the cheaters can successfully modify a black/white pixel into a white/black pixel in the stacking result is equal to 1, the cheating is the deterministic cheating.

                               expresses that a cheating prevention scheme is insecure against the deterministic cheating, where the cheaters can modify a black/white pixel into a white/black pixel.

This definition makes researchers more easily to analyze the security for CPVSS. Taking the most real attack power into consideration, we must assume

                           k

Horng et al. proposed that cheating is possible in 
                              (

CA-1 and CA-2 are performed by a malicious participant (MP) and a malicious outsider (MO), respectively. MP or MO sets a cheating image and generates FTs such that the stacking result of the victimʼs transparency and FTs reveals the cheating image.

The number of 0s subpixels is different from the number of 1s subpixels, thus it can withstands DD-CA [14]. Due to the above reason, we get the following theorem.

If the block in the stacking result is perfect black in CA-1 and CA-2, then CA-1 and CA-2 are successful. These cheating activities are only used in

In DD-CA, the cheaters do not set a cheating image, so they are blind for the stacking result of all transparencies. We thus can classify cheating activities into two types, meaningful cheating and non-meaningful cheating:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Meaningful cheating: The cheaters set a cheating image, and their goal is to generate FTs then make the victim to accept the reconstructed cheating image. However, the cheaters have to modify a region composed of blocks, which can be observed by humanʼs vision. Horng et al.ʼs CA, CA-1, and CA-2 are meaningful cheating.


                                 Non-meaningful cheating: The cheaters does not set a cheating image, and their goal is to generate FTs then make some pixels in the stacking result to be different color. DD-CA is non-meaningful cheating.

In this paper, we give the following definitions.


                        
                           Definition 4
                           Connected blocks (connected pixels) are many adjacent blocks (pixels) with the same color, such that there are the same numbers of blacks subpixels and white subpixels in these blocks.


                        
                           Definition 5
                           A region is composed of many connected blocks with the same color in the stacking result, which can be observed by humanʼs vision.


                        Fig. 1
                         shows that only modifying 1 black/white pixel into a white/black pixel in SI, it in the stacking result cannot be detected by humanʼs vision. For example, 1 white pixel will be referred to as black when several black pixels are adjacent to the white one. We conclude the deterministic cheating must be meaningful. Thus, we define the meaningful deterministic cheating is 
                           
                              Pr
                           
                           [
                           
                              Black
                           
                           ↔

                           1
                         for a region (connected blocks/pixels). Practically, a cheating prevention visual secret sharing scheme is claimed to be cheating prevention if it achieves the lowest requirement, withstanding the meaningful deterministic cheating.

                        -VSS, Horng et al.ʼs cheating activity is actually possible. There are 
                           n
                           −
                           1
                         cheaters and one victim. The goal of the cheaters is collusive to set a cheating image and generate an FT, then the victim will accept the reconstructed cheating image as the secret by stacking 
                           
                              FT

                        Table 1
                         shows the comparison with Horng et al.ʼs CA, CA-1, CA-2, and DD-CA. Type of VSS denotes that which kind of VSS schemes will suffer from the cheating activity. Type of C.A. denotes the cheating activity is meaningful cheating or non-meaningful cheating. Know the secret, Have share transparencies and Know the encoding algorithm denote that the cheaters have the abilities or not, respectively. For more details, we can refer to a survey [18] which discusses cheating in VSS and some CPVSS schemes.

Lots CPVSS schemes have been proposed, but in the case of (
                           2

                        )-VSS scheme [14], and they declare the scheme does not use the added transparencies to prevent cheating. At present, this scheme is an unique CPVSS scheme without relying on added transparencies. The base matrices of the scheme have dimension

De Prisco and De Santisʼs simple scheme is denoted by DD1, and the better scheme is denoted by DD2 [14]. According to Section 1, we can classify the above schemes into two types: share authentication and blind authentication. Thus, HCT1 and HT are share authentication, and the others are blind authentication. Observing the security of some CPVSS schemes, we have found that the blind authentication schemes are good at protecting a black pixel, and the share authentication schemes are at a white pixel.

In this section, we will present a new cheating prevention

                     -VSS scheme which relies on share authentication without the added transparencies. This scheme is constructed with the properties of share authentication for white pixels and blind authentication for black pixels. Conveniently, we list the notations in Table 2

Complexity), security against the meaningful deterministic cheating (Security), type of cheating prevention (Type of C.P., SA: share authentication, BA: blind authentication), and relying on an added transparency or not (Added transparency). † denotes the scheme must rely the complemental secret image to be secure. For the expansion of a pixel, 
                           2
                           (
                            
                           )
                         denotes that the scheme relies on added transparencies.

From the comparisons, the proposed scheme and DD2 are two cheating prevention schemes without the added transparencies. Generally, the proposed scheme is better than previous schemes in the expansion of a pixel, except HCT1 (HCT1 is insecure). This scheme is provably secure to withstand Horng et al.ʼs cheating activity, while the other cheating activities for 
                           (
                           n

                           )
                        -VSS we do not consider. However, we do not compare our scheme with Tsai et al.ʼs CPVSS scheme [21], because the kernel constructions are different. In the share construction phase, Tsai et al.ʼs scheme [21] depends on Genetic Algorithms, so the proposed scheme is better than it in the aspect of efficiency. For computational analysis, in the share construction phase, our scheme must perform a permutation for the columns of base matrices for each pixel/block, thus the computation cost is 
                           2
                           n

                           1
                         columns. In the secret recovery phase, our scheme has to require 
                           2
                           n

                         OR-operations for each pixel/block, thus the computation cost is

                         where SC is the running time of setting a position and OR is that of OR-operation. Since SC and OR are constant, the total computation cost is

                           2

In practice, the proposed scheme is only used in

                        -VSS, since it is easy to insert the middle color into the stacking result. Due to the paper of Hofmeister et al. [23], 
                           (
                           2
                           ,
                           n
                           )
                        -VSS is the most common application. For more details, we can refer to Table 1 in the paper [23].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The cheating problem is a significant issue in secret sharing. Horng et al. showed cheating is also possible in visual secret sharing. Recently, quite a few studies have been proposed for cheating activities in VSS and cheating prevention schemes. In this paper, we analyze the well-known cheating activities and some CPVSS schemes, and then redefine the meaningful cheating, the non-meaningful cheating and meaningful deterministic cheating. Additionally, we propose a cheating prevention visual secret sharing scheme, and prove that it is secure against the meaningful deterministic cheating. The proposed scheme is better than the previous schemes in the expansion of a pixel. It does not rely on the added transparencies.

This theorem follows from the following Lemmas 1, 2, and 3.

                           For any region, the cheaters cannot be arbitrary to generate a fake transparency to make black/white blocks in the stacking result of the cheaterʼs transparencies be white/black blocks in the stacking result of the victimʼs transparency and the fake transparency.

                           For any region, the cheaters cannot be arbitrary to generate a fake transparency to make middle color/white blocks in the stacking result of the cheaterʼs transparencies be white/middle color blocks in the stacking result of the victimʼs transparency and the fake transparency.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        The cheaters collude to obtain a sub-base matrix for a middle color block. However, they do not know weather the block is middle color in the victimʼs stacking results. We conclude

To maintain a fixed number of verifiable messages, if the cheaters modify middle color blocks into white blocks, it must modify white blocks into middle color blocks.  □


                     
                        Lemma 3
                        
                           For any region, the cheaters cannot be arbitrary to generate a fake transparency to make middle color/black blocks in the stacking result of the cheaterʼs transparencies be black/middle color blocks in the stacking result of the victimʼs transparency and the fake transparency.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        The cheaters collude to obtain a sub-base matrix for a middle color block. However, they do not know weather the block is middle color in the victimʼs stacking results. We conclude

The cheaters collude to obtain a sub-base matrix for a black block; as the intermediate result of Lemma 1, we know

According to Definition 5 and the design of our scheme (the verifiable messages is different sizes in the stacking result), we can extend Theorem 2 to have the following corollary.


                     
                        Corollary 1
                        
                           Our scheme is secure against the meaningful deterministic cheating.
                        

Nevertheless, the security of this scheme is under the encoding of the verifiable messages by different base matrices. By observing the experiment of Fig. 4, if the cheaters hold
