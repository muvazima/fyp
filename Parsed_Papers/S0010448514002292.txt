                  The geometric segmentation of a discrete geometric model obtained by the scanning of real objects is affected by various problems that make the segmentation difficult to perform without uncertainties. Certain factors, such as point location noise (coming from the acquisition process) and the coarse representation of continuous surfaces due to triangular approximations, introduce ambiguity into the recognition process of the geometric shape. To overcome these problems, a new method for geometric point identification and surface segmentation is proposed.
                  The point classification is based on a fuzzy parameterization using three shape indexes: the smoothness indicator, shape index and flatness index. A total of 11 fuzzy domain intervals have been identified and comprise sharp edges, defective zones and 10 different types of regular points. For each point of the discrete surface, the related membership functions are dynamically evaluated to be adapted to consider, point by point, those properties of the geometric model that affects uncertainty in point type attribution.
                  The methodology has been verified in many test cases designed to represent critical conditions for any method in geometric recognition and has been compared with one of the most robust methods described in the related literature.

The process of organizing the nodes of a triangular mesh into groups, which correspond to surface features, is called data segmentation. Segmentation is an important and preliminary stage in many applications involving geometric models described by point clouds or triangular meshes. There are two criteria for surface segmentation  [1]: semantic segmentation and geometric segmentation. Semantic segmentation methods attempt to segment the surface (typically “natural objects”) into meaningful pieces as expected from a human observer. Geometric segmentation methods, in contrast, aim at dividing the mesh into clusters that have similar geometric properties. These methods are mainly used to recognize the nominal geometry of discrete geometric models obtained by reverse engineering. These two criteria give rise to completely different categories of segmentation methods. This paper is concerned with geometric segmentation.

The geometric segmentation of a surface utilizes the identification of the peculiar characteristics of the geometric shape and, subsequently, assigns the identification a linguistic attribute of a portion of the surface: spherical, ruled, toroidal, planar and generic. Geometric segmentation is typically based on point classification (Umbilical, Hyperbolic, Parabolic, Elliptical and Planar), which is performed through the analysis of the differential geometric properties (DGP) that locally characterize the surface shape. The classification of a point on an analytical surface is unambiguous and uniquely defined because it is performed by a deterministic process that is based on a curvature analysis at that point. A precondition necessary to evaluate the DGP is that the point on the surface must be regular. On an analytical surface, a point is regular if the two following conditions are satisfied  [2]:

Very often, discrete surfaces come from the measure of a real object. In these cases, the source of uncertainty is due both to the measurement errors and to the non-ideality of the acquired object geometry, which introduces noise in the tessellated model. Uncertainties in DGP estimation also depend on the acquired point density and on the way the sampling is performed. This is highlighted in cases A, B and C in Fig. 1
                     . The three tessellated models are obtained from an analytical cylindrical surface that has been sampled in three different ways. When estimated on the tessellated surface, the Gaussian curvature

                     , but this value is never found except in case C, where the points of the tessellated model are aligned with the generatrix and the angles at a vertex are less than 
                        π
                        /
                        2
                     . The previous case demonstrates the uncertainty in the attribution of parabolic point types in a tessellated surface when the value of 
                        K
                      is different from 0. A point, for which the Gaussian curvature is not zero, but even if it is not very far from zero, can be parabolic, although it can be elliptic or hyperbolic.

To solve for the uncertainty, in this work, the geometric type attribution is performed in a possibilistic way so that all of the cases compatible with the estimated curvatures are considered, each case having a proper level of possibility. If it is to be selective, the criterion used to state that a point is of a specific type has to be restrictive, but it also needs to be sufficiently broad to consider the intrinsic uncertainties when evaluating the curvatures. In this paper, the possibility of the point type is assigned by a dynamic criterion that, point by point, considers the specific state of the tessellated surface (noise and surface quality sampling). This approach exceeds the limitations of the methods reported in the related literature that use a rigid recognition criterion based on a comparison of the geometric identifier parameter with a unique threshold value assigned for the whole geometric model. To address indecision in assigning a type to a point, which may have different possible attributions, the nature of the other points in the neighborhood zone is investigated and considered. Thus, the point type is identified as a property of a finite compact area by a region-growing algorithm driven by a similarity criterion.

The most appropriate way to implement the methodology proposed here is using the theory of possibility, or fuzzy set theory. For assigning possibilities, the typical parameters used to classify the point type (Mean curvature

Three are the main approaches used in the literature for the geometric segmentationof surfaces  [6,7]: the edge-based, region-based and hybrid methods.

The edge-based approach [8–10] aims to identify the boundary zones between the geometric features shaping the model. This identification is performed by evaluating the discontinuities in the smoothness of the original surfaces, which in turn is performed by analyzing the data retained at the location of the points of the mesh or cloud. Although sharp points can be directly recognizable, this is not true for a smooth transition, and therefore, some geometric features cannot be detected.

The region-based approach aims to directly identify those specific zones characterized by homogeneous geometric properties; the edges are then evaluated as the intersections between the recognized features. The methods based on this approach generally consist in growing a region from a seed triangle.

Gelfand and Guibas  [11] present an algorithm for segmenting meshes into regions that can be well approximated by kinematic surfaces (spheres, planes, cylinders, linear extrusions, surfaces of revolution, and helixes). Their algorithm is based on a slippage signature, which is a set of rigid motions that, when applied to the shape, slide the transformed copy along the original without forming any gaps. The region growth is performed by comparing the slippage signatures of neighbor points to determine if they belong to the same surface.

Jagannathan and Miller  [5] propose a region-based algorithm that uses a specific shape feature indicator to grow the features. The indicator is the curvedness index

                      are the principal curvatures. The geometric features are identified by intervals of the curvedness indicator, which are determined by an adaptive selection. Although a geometric indicator is used, this approach does not discriminate geometric features very well.

Hybrid approaches use both edge-based and region-based methods.

Yan et al.  [12] propose a method for mesh segmentation by fitting a quadric surface, from which each component of the resulting mesh segmentation is represented by a general quadric surface. The authors highlight that a limitation of their work is that the method is noise sensitive and that it can produce unsatisfied segmentation boundaries.

Benko et al.  [13] propose a hybrid approach for the segmentation of engineering objects. In a first step, sharp edges and small blends are identified and discarded using an edge-based approach. The remaining triangles are segmented by a particular hierarchy of tests that split the point cloud into increasingly smaller sub-regions. Tests are performed using different types of indicators.

Vieira and Shimada  [14] put forth a hybrid approach that first performs a grouping of mesh points based on the signs of Mean and Gaussian curvatures. Then, the region growing is accomplished by fitting each seed region with a bicubic Bézier surface and by adding the neighboring data points according to their compatibility with the approximating polynomial. A similar approach is presented by Mizoguchi et al. in  [15]. The authors notice that their method requires the setting of several threshold values that cannot be easily defined by users.

Lavoue et al.  [16] present a hybrid method based on curvature-based region segmentation and boundary rectification. As a preliminary step, they find the sharp edges as those shared by two triangles whose normal vector makes an angle that is larger than a given threshold. At each vertex that does not belong to any sharp edges, the principal curvature and directions are computed. The clustering is performed by a K-Means algorithm, which makes it possible to divide vertices into 
                        K
                      groups.

The K-Means clustering algorithms need to know the number of clusters beforehand. These limitations are overcome by non-parametric clustering algorithms, such as the mean shift algorithm. Yamauchi et al. in  [17] employ the mean shift approach, which is a general-purpose technique to cluster scattered data, applied on face normals. Judging from the results, it seems clear that this method tends to over-segment a model into more pieces than expected or desired. Starting from considerations such as the adjacent meaningful parts being generally bordered by deep concavities and the curvature being a good attribute to recognize these concavities, Yamauchi et al. in  [18] propose a mean shift method employing Gaussian curvature. A similar approach is put forward by Zhang et al. in  [19], wherein the authors develop a mean shift method based on a combination of principal curvatures. To develop a non-parametric clustering algorithm, which is less sensitive to noise, Liu et al.  [20] introduce the cell mean shift. This approach, which clusters the input point cloud based on the Gaussian map, can identify planar, parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic surfaces with operations that are computationally more efficient than those in the traditional mean shift methods.

The surface segmentation method presented in this paper is based on a region-growing approach and also performs, in a unique growing process, the edge identification. This method determines the uncertainty in feature identification by classifying the points based on the theory of possibility and by driving the growing process by a similarity criterion. The method consists of the following main phases:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Association of the possibility of the point type. A total of 11 different point types are identified: Non-regular, Flat, Umbilical Concave, Umbilical Convex, Hyperbolic Concave, Hyperbolic Convex, Hyperbolic Saddle, Parabolic Concave, Parabolic Convex, Elliptical Concave and Elliptical Convex.


                              Surface feature segmentation and edge identification by a region-growing algorithm based on the similarity of point type possibility. At this stage, the points of the tessellated surface are grouped by a similarity criterion.


                              Defuzzification and attribution of point type to the surface features.

For performing the fuzzification of regular point types, two principal adimensional factors have been properly defined, which affect the uncertainty level in point type identification. These factors are characteristic of each point p of the tessellated model and are associated with two different aspects: the sampling density of the original surface and the measurement noise.

The first factor is the curvature approximation factor 
                     
                        
                           (
                           γ
                           )
                        
                     ; it is defined as the maximum value of the tangent of the dihedral angles between adjacent triangles incident at p. 
                        γ
                      is a measure of how well the geometry of a regular curved surface is described by the associated discretized form. A well-sampled surface has very small dihedral angles. The 
                        γ
                      factor is 0 for a flat surface, which is the surface perfectly described by any triangular mesh. For curved surfaces, 
                        γ
                      is different from 0, and its value increases as the surface is more coarsely sampled.

The second factor is the noise factor 
                     
                        
                           
                              σ
                           
                           
                              d
                           
                        
                     , which is a measure of the noise that affects point location. Because the analytical geometry associated with the tessellated model is not known a priori, a reference surface 
                        Γ
                      is considered to evaluate

                     . 
                        Γ
                      is a 
                        
                           
                              C

                      function that approximates the tessellated surface in the neighborhood of the point p. In the present paper, 
                        Γ
                      is a paraboloid with five coefficients. The noise factor

                      is the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the distances between the points in the neighborhood of p and 
                        Γ
                      and 
                        d
                      is the mean dimension of the triangles incident at p. In the following, 
                        d
                      is referred to as the mesh dimension.

In this work, the membership functions used to associate the type of point are empirically defined by performing a set of experiments that have been designed using 
                        γ
                      and

                      as input factors as well as different geometric forms.

The method proposed here requires that differential geometric properties, such as normal and principal curvatures, should be estimated beforehand at each node of the triangular mesh. It is not in the scope of this paper to compare the performances of the many methods presented in the substantial related literature. According to the results reported in  [3], in this paper, the following are performed:
                        
                           -
                           To estimate the normal vector at each point, the medial quadric [21] is used; it proves to be robust with respect to the shape and dimension of the triangles in the 1-ring neighborhood;

                              , has been applied. Although this method does not perform an evaluation of the curvatures, which is valid in absolute terms, it is suited for estimating the nature of the point type, which requires a comparison between principal curvatures. Furthermore, this method is very robust when applied to noisy surfaces.


                        Differential geometric properties, such as the normal, principal curvatures and directions, can be estimated at a point on a tessellated surface that has been recognized to be regular. Non-regular points are, in general, located in the transition between two adjacent regular regions and can be either sharp or smooth. On a continuous surface, the neighborhood of a smooth point can be assimilated to a smooth function, curvatures can be defined, and the shape of the point can be identified. A sharp transition is associated with an edge where only the simple

                         continuity is verified; typically, this transaction defines a ridge or a corner. In a smooth transition, only the first derivative continuity is verified (

The smoothness indicator is a measure of how uncertain the estimation of the differential geometric properties is and therefore also affects the indetermination in the point type identification.

                         The evaluation of the index 
                           f
                         is affected by uncertainties, and consequently, flat points cannot be discriminated based on the deductive application of the rule 
                           f
                           =
                           0
                        . Due to the errors in point location (as in the case of models obtained by reverse engineering), these uncertainties can appear also in discrete flat surfaces, which can be described exactly by triangular planar facets. In this case, the 
                           f
                        value is not identically null, but, nevertheless, in practical applications, and as far as the linguistic attribution of the geometric shape is concerned, the point could be recognized as flat 
                           
                              (

                         existence field is divided into three domain intervals: the first interval is related to those points that can be considered certainly flat; the second interval refers to points that can be flat or non-flat, and the third interval addresses non-flat points (Fig. 5
                        ). Two possibility functions are defined:

                         Indexes on groups of tessellated synthetic planes, with different values for the mesh dimensions

The values of the index 
                           f
                         have been evaluated in the 3 different orders of the ring neighborhood and are quoted in Fig. 6
                        . The index 
                           f
                         is shown to be a linear function of the noise factor

                           f
                         also depend on the order of the used ring neighborhood.

Typically, regular point type association is performed through the analysis of the Gaussian and Mean curvatures, and this is the method that is performed in the related literature [7,14]. In this work, only one parameter is used to discriminate the different shapes of points, which are regular and non-flat. This parameter is the shape index

                         are the Mean and Gaussian curvatures. The 
                           s
                         index is analytically continuous in the range [−1, 1], and the point type sets are in a single sequence as a continuous function of the index. Each set is contiguous with the adjacent area, and uncertainties associated with the attribution of the point type concern only two sets at a time. In this way, the index 
                           s
                         can discriminate 9 of the 11 types of points considered here (Table 1
                        ). The 
                           s
                         parameter cannot be used to perform flat point identification because it is not defined for this type of point. In the point classification, geometric points must be distinguished from the other points. Geometric points are characterized by specific single values of the index 
                           s
                        : UC, PC, HS, PX and UX. In contrast, non-geometric points are identified in a large interval of values of the 
                           s
                         parameter. Each geometric point type is the border between two different non-geometric types of points.

On a continuous surface, geometric points are identified by a single value of the 
                           s
                         index. In tessellated surfaces, the shape index 
                        
                           s
                         is estimated with a lack of absolute certainty. Due to the approximation of a smooth surface by triangles, uncertainties can also appear when the nodes of triangular meshes are located exactly on the smooth analytical geometry. For regular non-flat points, the process of fuzzification involves dividing the input variable 
                           s
                         into 9 domain intervals, each of which is then associated to a different type of point, as shown in Fig. 7
                        .

Each membership function is defined by some coefficients, as described in Fig. 8
                        . For geometric points, the membership functions are triangular, whereas for non-geometric points, they are trapezoidal. Under the hypothesis that the point is certainly regular and non-flat, the membership value

                           s
                        , only four independent coefficients must be determined to define all the membership functions. The values of these coefficients vary point by point as a function of mesh parameters

                        . For the purpose of defining these functions, specific experiments have been designed and conducted for three types of points: umbilical, parabolic and hyperbolic saddle. The experiments consist in the estimation of the s index in specimens of tessellated analytical surfaces (sphere, cylinder and saddle with equal and opposite principal curvatures) characterized by different values of 
                           γ

                           s
                         index and the expected value, for the specific type of point, are quoted on the vertical axis

To determine uncertainties in point attribution, we must consider that only information concerning the point itself is not sufficient and that the detected geometric properties must be confirmed in its adjacent area. Indeed, the geometric properties evaluated at a point can result from a singularity due to specific conditions and/or can be affected by great uncertainties. The approach proposed in this work is similar to the process performed by a human being when he or she tries to solve such types of problems. A human being does not evaluate the DGP; instead, he or she naturally evaluates the nature of the surface in a relatively wide region by filtering the local irregularities and comparing the geometry with knowledge of similar items. This is a relatively robust approach to solve the ambiguities in point type attribution.

The method proposed here aggregates adjacent points that are recognized to be similar in the same piece of surface by a region-growing algorithm. For this purpose, the concept of dissimilarity, or similarity, of the current point to those recognized to pertain to a surface feature is used.

In rare cases, it affects the attribution of the point type; these cases generally occur in correspondence to the smooth transitions. Therefore, the value

                         is used in the following experiment.

The proposed procedure for shape recognition and surface segmentation has been implemented in an original software package coded in Visual C++.

The method has been tested in many different cases. The three most significant cases are reported here and are discussed. The first test case (Fig. 13
                     (a)) refers to an acquired real object where five different types of points and seven geometric features are found. In this object, there are sharp and smooth transitions that identify critical situations for the recognition method. The setting parameters of the method are reported in Fig. 13(b). The method correctly segments the geometric model. In addition, intermediate features that are associated with smooth transitions are recognized. Fig. 13(c) depicts a map of the values of parabolic convex possibility. This index assumes the highest values in three parabolic convex features (PX1,PX2,PX3); for one feature (PX1), the cumulative frequency of the parabolic convex possibility is graphed. Slightly more than 10% of the points in PX1 have a possibility index equal to or lower than 0.5. These results therefore show how the strategy that has been used, and which is based on the concept of similarity, makes a fundamental contribution to obtaining a correct recognition of the geometric feature. Using this strategy, even points that have a high level of uncertainty in the convex parabolic type attribution have been included in PX1. In Fig. 14

The proposed method is compared with the method of Mizoguchi et al.  [15] (henceforth, MDKK method) in the segmentation of the same test case, and the results are shown in Fig. 13. For the method to perform the best segmentation, the parameters of the MDKK method have been obtained after a number of trial-and-error cycles. By analyzing the results, it is possible to observe that the MDKK method is less selective (see Fig. 15
                     ).

To verify the robustness of the method in the presence of high levels of noise, Gaussian noise is added with two levels

                      to the previous test case; it is then submitted to the segmentation method proposed here. The results of the segmentation are depicted in Fig. 16
                     . The extension of non-regular regions increases as the noise level increases. The method continues discriminating the different geometric regions accurately, and only a few irregular areas are found in the transition zones. Due to the very high level of noise introduced, some of the points inside the feature are recognized to be non-regular, but at no time are non-correct shape geometries assigned. This results from the characteristic of the proposed method, which analyzes the surface point by point, considering the membership of each surface to a non-regular point type; therefore, defective areas are classified as non-regular.

A second test case (Fig. 17
                     ), which is characterized by very different values of 
                        γ
                      and

                              d
                           
                        
                     , has been submitted to the method. In addition, in this case, the method produces a correct segmentation of the surfaces.

The last test case refers to a scanned real blade characterized by some particularities (highlighted by arrows in Fig. 18
                     ) that are identified by smooth transitions, which make it difficult to discriminate the adjacent features. Once again, the proposed method correctly recognizes the features. The same test case has been submitted to the MKDD method by assuming the same set of threshold values selected for the first test case. The results are shown in Fig. 18(c), where it is possible to observe that the set of threshold values is not adequate for this case. Therefore, a new, specifically optimized set of threshold parameters has been selected, and the results of the segmentation are shown in Fig. 18(d). It is possible to verify that the MDKK method does not discriminate some geometric features.

This paper has described a new method based on fuzzy set theory to segment geometric features in discrete geometric models. The proposed method is shown to properly address some of the problems that typically affect other geometric feature recognition methods presented in the related literature and in commercial software.

The method is new in many aspects: 
                        
                           -
                           the region growing strategy takes advantage of the simultaneous analysis of the geometrical differential properties and the surface regularity so that edges or surface defectiveness are recognized as a special type of point: a non-regular point;

the method uses new geometrical differential parameters particularly suited to implementing a fuzzy set approach;

the method considered the non-regular nature of a surface described by a tessellated model, where the point type is assigned not based on a classical propositional logic, as in other methods in the literature, but using a fuzzy logic;

the proposed method investigates the discrete model point by point, based on the local quality of the curvature approximation and of the noise level, evaluating the possibilities of each point belonging to the identified geometric categories: sharp edges, defective zones and 10 different types of regular points;

the features are identified by a region-growing algorithm that is driven by a similarity criterion that discriminates geometric features from sharp edges and from surface defectiveness: the point type attribution results from the confirmation of geometric properties in the point neighborhood and is not affected by the singularity of the analyzed point.

The method only falls short in the identification of smooth transition zones; this is the case of the transition zones between adjacent surfaces, whose points pertain to two different point types that are geometric. In these cases, an intermediate type of point is assigned to a strip zone located across the smooth transition. Such is the case in Fig. 13, in which the transition zone between umbilical and parabolic is recognized as a thin zone of an elliptical type of point. This shortcoming is common to all the methods for geometric feature recognition in discrete models and is due to the necessity of investigating a finite extended area to evaluate differential geometric properties. Smooth transitions are non-regular regions that are difficult to identify (for smooth transitions, only 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      continuity is verified). This limitation can be ascribed to the approach used to evaluate regularity.

The computational efficiency of the proposed method is lower than those methods that discriminate the type of points simply based on fixed threshold values of some detected differential properties.

Future work should be to address developing specific procedures to discriminate smooth transitions. Efforts should also be directed to detecting further properties of segmented features that are necessary to classify their geometric shape (a feature having parabolic points can be a cylinder, a cone or any other type of ruled surface) and to evaluating their analytical and dimensional characteristics.
