                  Packaging links the entire supply chain and coordinates all participants in the process to give a flexible and effective response to customer needs in order to maximize satisfaction at optimal cost. This research proposes an optimization model to define the minimum total cost combination of outer packs in various distribution channels with the least opening ratio (the percentage of total orders requiring the opening of an outer pack to exactly meet the demand). A simple routine to define a feasible start point is proposed to reduce the complexity caused by the number of possible combinations. A Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company in an emerging economy (Colombia) is analyzed to test the proposed methodology. The main findings are useful for emerging markets in that they provide significant savings in the whole supply chain and insights into the packaging problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Packaging is a key activity since it links the different stages, actors and areas within an organization as well as along the supply chain. The role of packaging goes beyond the preservation and protection of goods from damage; it does not only facilitate handling and freight transportation, but also identifies the product, differentiating it from competitors’ items and providing useful information to consumers (Klevas, 2005; Yesodha &#38; Amudha, 2012).

One of the most accurate definitions of the activity of packaging was given by Saghir (2004, p. 6): “Packaging is a coordinated system that prepares goods in a safe, efficient and effective way for handling, transportation, distribution, storage, retailing, consumption, as well as recovery, reuse or disposal combined with maximizing consumer value, sales and hence the organization's profit.”

The packaging design has a strategic importance for the efficiency of the supply chain. In this sense, packaging is involved in logistics activities such as receiving, storing, picking, transportation, etc. Since the efficiency of these activities is affected by the packaging shape, size and structure (packaging levels), having inadequate packaging designs can lead to higher costs in the supply chain (Azzi, Battini, Persona, &#38; Sgarbossa, 2012; Chan, Chan, &#38; Choy, 2006; García &#38; Prado, 2006; Hellström, 2007; Hellström &#38; Saghir, 2007; Lee &#38; Lye, 2003; Tápler, Gy, &#38; Csik, 2010).

Organizations that properly manage the packaging across the network realize competitive advantages. In general, a package should meet the different needs of multiple organizations and distribution channels, especially in emerging economies where the strategies to reach target markets are widely diversified. Furthermore, a well-defined package enhances the coordination to respond flexibly, timely and effectively to customer needs, maximizing their satisfaction and service level at optimal cost (Hughes, 1996; Herard &#38; Robson, 1992; Sanders &#38; Green, 1990).

Packaging structure is a system with hierarchical levels (see Fig. 1
                     ), where a set of consumption items called “eaches” are put together inside an inner pack. Then several inner packs are placed into an outer pack, and finally a set of outer packs becomes a palletized cargo.

In essence, designing an outer pack by defining the right number of inner packs can generate the following benefits to the logistics activities (Hellström, 2007; Hellström &#38; Saghir, 2007):

                        
                           •
                           Reduction of handling times

Shorter picking times

The cost of packing materials would be diminished

Decreased inventory carrying cost

The storage layout of warehouses as well as the related utilization of the storage facilities would be improved

The handling of products at delivery points would be facilitated

An extensive literature review provided diverse papers related to what is understood by researchers as the packaging problem. Some of the papers explain the main purposes of a package, its role within the organization and along the supply chain (Herard &#38; Robson, 1992; Hughes, 1996; Sanders &#38; Green, 1990), while others detail the interaction of packaging design across different areas and actors (Azzi et al., 2012; Lockamy, 1995; Saghir, 2004; Tápler et al., 2010; Yan, Robb, &#38; Silver, 2009).

Authors from operational research area have treated the packaging problem by formulating optimization models in order to define the best way to place a given set of rectangular boxes into a larger rectangular box with the smallest possible volume. Various solution methods to this problem have been devised, providing insight into optimal solutions in the real world (Ceselli &#38; Righini, 2008; Fanslau &#38; Bortfeldt, 2010; Ge, 1996; Leung, Wong, &#38; Mok, 2008; Swaminathan &#38; Tayur, 1998; Wong &#38; Guo, 2010).

Some optimization models focus on the bin packing and knapsack problems. The bin packing problem refers to minimizing the number of bins (which have a given volumetric capacity) used to pack a set of objects with multiple sizes (Ceselli &#38; Righini, 2008; Fanslau &#38; Bortfeldt, 2010; Yesodha &#38; Amudha, 2012). The adaptations of the knapsack problem try to determine the number of units of each item to be placed inside a container (with a given capacity), maximizing a utility function or total value of the items included within it.


                     Swaminathan and Tayur (1998) propose a methodology to minimize the cost of keeping boxes and finished goods stock considering the stochastic behavior of demand. Two alternatives to deal with the problem are given: a large scale optimization model and a sub-gradient method to split the original problem into separable linear problems in order to solve the original problem with its variables. The results are analyzed by running different scenarios with variations in demand, storage capacities and costs.


                     Fanslau and Bortfeldt (2010) present a search tree algorithm to allocate a set of outer packs with different sizes within a rectangular container to maximize the total volume usage. The proposed algorithm is divided in two phases: the first phase permits construction of blocks where the outer packs and containers are different, and the second phase solves the problem through a deep search tree called a controlled split algorithm.

The heuristic designed by Brunetta and Grégoire (2005) focuses on the packaging problem in three dimensions in order to maximize the capacity usage of containers with different sizes. The proposed algorithm explores all the space solutions determining the feasible packaging patterns and trying to maximize their usage. Finally, Ceselli and Righini (2008) formulated an optimization model to deal with the bin packing challenge using branch and price algorithm. The resulting sub-problem presents a knapsack problem that is solved with a hybrid of the column generation and the branch and bound algorithms, giving better quality and computational results compared with traditional algorithms.

Despite the latter research work, there are few studies aimed at defining the optimal quantity of inner packs to be placed into an outer pack from a cost minimization perspective in logistics processes. In fact, Wagner (2002) recognizes the package size as a key aspect in the supply chain strategy and its effectiveness in reaching customers with what they need.

Furthermore, those who have addressed this issue have mostly focused on two echelons of the supply chain: customers and distribution centers (Wang, 2010; Wen, Graves, &#38; Ren, 2012; Wilson, 1965; Yan et al., 2009), or have been focused on the efficiency of an activity such as transport (Ge, 1996). These models include the following costs:

                        
                           -
                           Costs of handling and carrying inventory of outer packs at the production plant (Swaminathan &#38; Tayur, 1998; Tápler et al., 2010)

Cost of handling outer packs at distribution centers and retail stores (Swaminathan &#38; Tayur, 1998; Wang, 2010; Wen et al., 2012; Wilson, 1965)

Cost of handling inner packs at distribution centers and retail stores (Wang, 2010)

Cost of opening an outer pack or an inner pack at Distribution Centers and retail stores (Wang, 2010)

Transportation cost (Ge, 1996)

Cost of packing material (Ge, 1996; Wilson, 1965)

However, other relevant costs, such as the cost of carrying inventory of inner packs or outer packs at distribution centers, cost of carrying inventory of packing material at the production plant, cost of packing up the inner packs into the outer packs, the cost of picking activity at the distribution center, the cost of changing the transportation costs structure, among others, have yet to be taken into account.

Emerging markets are clearly different from mature markets. They are local, fragmented, low scale, and mostly served by owner-managed small enterprises (Sheth, 2011). Emerging consumers tend to buy products in smaller sizes, even though the per-unit cost is higher, because they are constrained by smaller incomes and living spaces (D'Andrea, Stenger, &#38; Goebel, 2004). Traditional stores, like mom-and-pop grocery stores, also require buying products in small packages due to limited storage space. To satisfy this heterogeneous demand a variety of offerings is required, including many variations of packaging sizes of the same generic kind of good. Currently, most companies distribute their products in emerging markets using package sizes more focused on the supermarket channel demand. As a consequence, these packages have to be opened continuously to satisfy the smaller demand quantities of traditional stores.

According to what has been explained, there are important gaps in the application of optimization in a holistic way to the problem of determining an optimal package to serve different distribution channels along the supply chains. An integral optimization model does not exist either for developed countries or for emerging countries.

In this sense, this article presents an optimization model to define the best quantity of inner packs to be included into an outer pack that minimizes the total cost associated with the activities of the supply chain in multiple channels, while a set of typical constraints of the emerging markets is fulfilled. A set of computational experiments was developed to test the model and has already been applied to the case of a Colombian Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in its diverse distribution channels.

The article is organized as follows: In Section 2 the problem description is introduced, together with a conceptual framework about the Mixed
Integer
Programming. In Section 3, a brief summary of the methodology ispresented, the optimization model is detailed and an initialization routine to accelerate the search of a feasible start point is described. Then in Section 4, the results of the computational experiments for the optimization model in different scenarios are analyzed together with a sensitivity analysis. Finally the conclusions and future work are summarized in Section 5.

Emerging markets are defined as geographical areas in which the population has an average or low per capita income, but are on a development path to a more stable economy: that is why they are also called developing countries. The main feature of these countries is that the majority of its population is located at the “bottom of the pyramid,” which encompasses all social sectors whose annual income does not exceed 5000
 US
dollars annually. In Colombia this feature represents the 58 percent of the total population (DANE, 2007). Such social characteristics of emerging economies lead to the coexistence of several distribution channels to reach the final consumers, some of them are direct and others are indirect through the use of wholesalers and distributors. In these economies a huge presence exists of what are called nanostores: that is, small shops attended directly by their owner (Blanco &#38; Fransoo, 2013). This distribution channel is also called the traditional channel and represents about 61 percent of the market share in all Latin-America (Nielsen, 2009).

Other distribution channels are also present: the modern channel, meaning supermarkets and retailers; the wholesale channel, representing one of the indirect ways to reach the retail shops and customers; and the institutional channel, including schools, food service, hospitals and other large institutions.

The opening ratio is the proportion of orders requiring the opening of an outer pack in order to precisely meet demand. A high opening ratio of outer packs is a very usual situation at emerging markets, especially in the traditional channel, due to the demand pattern characteristics of nanostores. Most of the time they order inner packs instead of outer packs because their demand is low in quantity but high in frequency (Blanco &#38; Fransoo, 2013). A high opening ratio leads to extra costs, due to the opening of the outer packs, the picking of the inner packs and other costs involved in the process of opening an outer pack, as described in the previous section.

In order to prove the usefulness of the proposed methodology, one SKU (a star good) of a Fast-Moving
Consumer
Goods (FMGC) company in Colombia (selling its products in all the distribution channels described above) was analyzed to determine the best quantity of inner packs to be included inside an outer pack in order to minimize the total cost caused by the high opening ratio of outer packs. The time horizon for the analysis was defined as 53 weeks, because in this time it is possible to consider the seasonal behavior of demand. The demand types are listed according to the quantity of inner packs ordered by the customers of each distribution channel. The historical data from the demand of the chosen SKU disclosed 95 types of demand, corresponding to the 95 ordered quantities between 1 and 5400 inner packs.

The company under study has the logistics network shown in Fig. 2, where the scope of the case study covered the three largest business units, three distribution centers (one of the largest, one of the medium-sized, and one of the smallest ones), and all the distribution channels (traditional, modern, wholesaler and institutional channels). The number of SKUs per business unit and the demand per month in each distribution channel is given as additional information in the figure as an indicator of the size of the analyzed operation.

For the chosen SKU, the company actually uses an outer pack with capacity of 15 inner packs, but the management wants to evaluate just one new combination of outer packs that better fits the channel, or a set of shared outer packs to serve the demand of all the distribution channels at the minimum logistics costs.

The number of five options of outer pack sizes to be tested was defined by the managers, since a higher number of outer packs will cause an unmanageable logistics complexity, and as it will be detailed in the results section, it corresponds to the point at which the total costs reached an asymptotic behavior with the least costs.

There are several commercial software packages, such as Pallet Stacking or Cape Pack, which could optimize the pallet pattern or define the optimal dimensions of the package according to the physical characteristics of the product. Nevertheless, there is no software that could define the optimal quantity of inner packs to be included in an outer pack, and that is precisely the objective of the proposed methodology. Defining the number of eaches to be packed into an inner pack is out of the scope of this work, but it is part of the future work to be developed.

An integer programming problem is a linear programming problem with additional constraints and variables that must take integer and binary values. The classical formulation appears as follows:

                         and R, I, B⊆{1, 2, …, n} are disjoint sets, such that R∪I∪B = {1, 2, …, n}. If R ≠ ∅ and I∪B ≠ ∅, the problem is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), if only R = ∅ the problem is an integer Programming and if R = I = ∅, the problem is integer and binary programming.

The most known methodologies used to solve these problems are: branch and bound, polyhedral theory, valid inequalities theory, Gomory cuts, and so on. The proposed model in this research work is related to the MIP with R = ∅.

The designed methodology for this research work consists of the following activities:

                           
                              a.
                              Process mapping: This activity is oriented to know the physical flow of packages along a traditional supply chain (in the applied research, the processes from the FMCG company were considered) from the supplier, through the process of packing plant, handling at the distribution centers, transportation and the delivery to the distribution channels. This process was carried out to understand the processes in which the size of the package could produce important impacts.

Design the optimization model: An integer programming optimization model was built in order to determine the type of outer packs with the least opening ratio and the best selection of outer packs that minimizes the total cost of those processes affected by the package size meeting customer demand for a selected Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) (see further details of this optimization model in the next section).

Data generation and data gathering: After designing the optimization model, there were two options: creating data for computational experiments or collecting data from a real problem. Both options were developed, as follows: in the first phase a set of parameters were created to validate the model, while during the second phase the data gathered from the FMCG was used to verify the applicability of the model into reality.

Results analysis (see Section titled “results analysis and findings” 4).

Although this paper is focused in the optimization model created to solve the problem, only the results related with the FMGC Company are shown to give an insight to the reader about this research work and one example of the application of the methodology.

This formulation determines the set of outer packs that meets demand with the minimum total logistics cost considering the alternatives of outer packs that minimize the opening ratio. The model looks as follows:


                        
                           Sets

The most representative costs are shown in Table 1
                        . The table includes the range of values in which each cost was evaluated. The lowest limit is the cost per outer pack composed of 4 inner packs (this is the minimum feasible size from a technical approach), while the upper limit is the cost per outer pack composed of 30 inner packs (this is double the actual size of the outer pack of the chosen SKU)

The constraints (1) and (2) meet the demand in terms of outer packs and inner packs (if needed), while the constraints (3) and (4) link the inventory of inner packs in different periods keeping the balance. The constraints (5), (6) and (7) are used to activate the binary variables to use a type of outer pack, as well as to send inner packs when needed. The constraint (8) determines the amount of outer packs to be used. Finally, the constraints from (9) to (14) are related to the type of variables.

This routine is used to find a feasible initial solution in a quicker way to solve combinatorial problems. This process eases the search process in the branch and bound algorithm to find a solution, just fixing in a random way a type of outer packs in the original model. The routine can be described as:

                           
                              I.
                              Solve the original model by randomly fixing the variable to choose the outer packs, according to the number of types of allowed outer packs to serve the demand:

Use the solution of this model (step I) as an initial solution to solve the original model:

                                             }
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

If the problem finds a low optimality gap
                                    1
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                    Magnitude of the difference between the best known solution and the best bound.
                                  in the final solution in a better time, stop the instance. Otherwise, change the outer pack chosen randomly and solve again. Repeat the process until all the possible combinations are evaluated by the routine.

The model proposed in Section 3 minimizes total logistics costs by finding the best combination of outer packs. In order to know how many outer packs might be considered as candidates, it is important to analyze the frequency of their selection. To reach that goal, the proposed model is run 27 times (one per option of outer pack analyzed) considering all the alternatives of outer packs with capacities from 4 to 30 inner packs, since the outer packs manufacturer cannot configure sizes with a capacity lower than 3 inner packs. The results are shown in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3, the outer pack with the highest frequency of selection corresponds to the outer pack of the highest capacity with 30 inner packs capacity. The following alternatives are the outer packs with capacities of 10 and 15 inner packs being used 25 times from the 27 runs, respectively. As can be seen, the frequency of selection continues decreasing, to reach the outer packs with 17 and 23 inner pack capacities having the lowest frequency of selection chosen by the model.

On the other hand, Fig. 4
                        shows the total cost performed when combinations of different outer packs take place. It is easy to see that the point at which the graph reaches an asymptotic behavior is when there is a combination between 5 or 7 outer packs. Thus it can be concluded that combinations with higher than 5 types of outer packs cannot represent significant savings for the SKU under analysis.

The computational complexity is an important issue to be analyzed, comparing the runs with and without the initialization routine in terms of gap and computational time. To perform this analysis, 27 instances (one per kind of outer pack) were run. The stopping criteria were 3600 seconds per run or reaching a gap of less than 0.1 percent. A total of 27 experiments were developed and the computational time, gap and total cost are shown in Table 2
                        .





In general the model with the initialization routine gets better performance 89 percent of the time. Just two instances from the model without routine perform better in time, while the gap performs better without the routine three times. Instances between 2 and 9, as well as 12 and 13 outer packs, did not obtain an integer solution during the maximum time solving the model without initialization routine.

Considering the results of the combinations, a total of six scenarios was proposed to change the quantity of outer packs introduced in the solution:

                           
                              •
                              Scenario 1: Defining the best outer pack (without the possibility of sharing among others) for each distribution channel considering the demand pattern per channel.

Scenario 2: Determining one shared outer pack to be used by all the distribution channels considering the aggregated demand pattern.

Scenario 3–6: These scenarios share two (scenario 3), three (scenario 4), four (scenario 5) and five outer packs (scenario 6) to serve the demand of all the distribution channels.

The proposed scenarios are important because they carry out an in-depth analysis of the capacity and the robustness of the model. The computational experiments were run in a computer with an Intel core i5 processor and RAM memory of 6 gigabytes with the use of software GAMS v24.1 and the solver CPLEX v12.5.


                        Table 3
                        shows a summary of the main cost components and their variations for each described scenario. The first column shows the costs of the current operation, followed by the percentage of cost variation in 1 outer pack per channel scenario, as well as the results for each scenario with 1 to 5 shared options of outer packs to serve all the distribution channels.





The main findings show that the cost of carrying inventory of finished goods, the cost of picking inner packs and the transportation cost have the highest impact on the logistics operations, since they add up to 84 percent of the total cost. As a consequence, in all the scenarios a decrement in the logistics costs was observed. For example, in the case of costs from returns of outer packs, the savings compared to the actual operation reached an average of 48 percent. In general, the total cost decreased by an average of 8 percent for all the scenarios.

The choice of the outer packs with the highest capacity of 30 inner packs in all the shared scenarios shown in Table 3 and in two channels (institutional and wholesaler) of the one option per channel scenario proves the importance of the selection of the outer pack with the highest frequency. The following alternatives were the options of 15 and 4 inner packs, respectively.

In the aspects related with the efficiency of the exact model, an average gap was observed of 0.10 percent, with a gap of 0.25 percent observed in the worst case for the scenario of 1 option per channel and the best value using the five options available, giving a gap of 0.07 percent. It is clearly seen that the quantity of combinations of outer packs related to the scenario determines the gap, because in the case of 1 option per channel the best option for each distribution channel is requested, carrying the need to feed the demand pattern for each channel separately. In the case of the shared outer packs for all the distribution channels, the gap is more flexible if the model has the opportunity to share more outer packs among the distribution channels.

As mentioned above, the acquired results are of good quality, since the gap was very low. However, in order to prove the robustness of the model, a sensitivity analysis was developed.

The computational times are consistent with the results from the gap, so the higher the computational time, the higher the possible combinations of the model. The average computational time spent by the model to reach a defined gap was 2 minutes and 20 seconds, with the minimum gap observed in the current scenario in 22 seconds and the worst time in the three shared options in the distribution channels with 4 minutes and 49 seconds.


                        Table 4
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        represents the total number of opened outer packs according to each type of outer pack chosen in each scenario. In general, compared to the current situation, all the scenarios tested produced savings of about 50 percent in the opening ratio, and the outer pack with a capacity of 14 inner packs is not opened in any scenario.




The procedure consisted of varying some parameters in order to identify useful trends in the outer packs selection, solutions, objective function variation, gap and computational time changes. Relevant parameters such as inventory and transportation costs, as well as the cost to open outer packs, are considered in order to validate the impact on the outer packs configuration for different distribution channels. Those costs are introduced with their share in the total cost function in Table 5.





                        Table 6 shows the results from the total cost and the types of outer packs to meet the demand under the original conditions. The total cost is different in this table, owing to Table 2 having a different seed in the initialization routine.






                        Table 7 shows the solutions when the cost of carrying inventory of one outer pack at the distribution centers is reduced by 90 percent, in order to reach the share of the lowest costs considered by the proposed model. The variation in the carrying inventory cost produces a decrease of roughly 23 percent in the total cost. The configuration of outer packs also presents significant changes because:

                           
                              -
                              The second outer pack option changes from the option with capacity of 15 inner packs to the one with 5 inner packs.

The third option changes from the outer pack with capacity of 4 inner packs to the one with 8 inner packs.

The fourth option changes from the outer pack with capacity of 10 inner packs to the one with 15 inner packs.

The fifth option changes from the outer pack with capacity of 14 inner packs to the one with 20 inner packs.

In general three options changed with the variation in the described cost component. The most important aspect is that the chosen options in the modified model try to compensate for the lower capacity in the first chosen outer pack with the following alternatives.






                        Table 8 shows the solutions when the transportation cost of one outer pack from distribution centers to the distribution channels is reduced by 90 percent, in order to reach the share of the lowest costs considered by the proposed model. The variation on the secondary transportation cost produces a decrease of roughly 9 percent in the total cost. The configuration of outer packs presents the same outer pack options as in the case of variation in the carrying inventory cost of the outer packs. Thus, in conclusion, reducing costs with the highest share generates a significant change in the outer packs configuration.





Finally, Table 9 shows the solutions when the cost of opening one outer pack at the distribution centers is increased by 500 percent, in order to reach the share of the highest costs considered by the proposed model. The variation on the cost to open outer packs produces an increase of roughly 8 percent in the total cost, reflecting the importance of that cost in the model.

The configuration of outer packs presents the same outer pack options as in the two previous cases. The unique difference comes from the swap of the fourth and fifth alternatives, reflecting that this modification prefers to keep lower capacity outer packs.




The main findings of all scenarios are shown below:

                           
                              -
                              The best alternative (the minimum cost) is reached in all the experiments when the highest combination of shared outer packs to serve the distribution channels is proposed.

If more than one option is used to deliver goods in the multiple channels, the total logistics cost does not show a high saving (only 1 percent is obtained).

When a combinatorial problem is faced with the model, the time tends to increment as well as the gap, because of the quantity of possible combinations. However, the gap is not significantly incremented.

The proposed routine provides better results compared to the original model because of better computational times and quality in the acquired solutions. It is possible to conclude that with a more constrained model, the number of alternatives is lower and the procedure can obtain a feasible solution more quickly than obtaining all the possible combinations through a traditional branch and bound algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

Defining the correct quantity of inner packs to be included in an outer pack has an important impact on the efficiency and performance of almost all logistics activities of a supply chain. In summary, packaging size impacts the logistics operation, specifically in the warehousing, transportation, order processing, handling, etc., and it may also impact commercial operation by influencing customer demand and order frequency.

This paper proposed a comprehensive methodology for the definition of the ideal number of inner packs to be contained in an outer pack, in order to meet customer demand while minimizing the total logistics costs associated with the acquisition of the packing material of the delivery of finished products to end customers. The methodology also responds to the typical characteristics of an emerging market, where companies must serve multiple distribution channels, including traditional trade which plays a key role in terms of sales amounts, since it requires delivering products to a huge number of points (small customers, such as nanostores) whose demand is very small (usually in terms of inner packs) but who placed orders with a higher frequency.

The methodology yields favorable results when comparing the total cost of the supply chain using the ideal outer pack size defined by the proposed optimization model against current total cost of the supply chain. The savings realized with the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods company implementation are roughly 8 percent on average, giving better results in some aspects like transportation, storage, opening ratio, etc. The use of an uncomplicated routine of fixing variables enables the solution of 10 instances just using the traditional branch and bound with predefined stopping criteria, giving a gap of less than 1 percent and with computational times less than 3 minutes.

Future work includes the design of a stochastic model using a random demand to determine the optimal quantity of consumption units (eaches) to be packed into an inner pack, based on the decision-making process of consumers and other inputs relating to marketing variables.

Moreover, since the proposed methodology is aimed at defining the outer pack size (in terms of the contained inner packs) that minimizes the costs of the supply chain of a manufacturer, another topic for future work would be include the costs of the logistics activities at the retailer level that could be affected by the outer pack size (i.e. receipt, storage, etc.), so that the analysis would define the best option considering two tiers of the supply chain (manufacturer and retailer).
