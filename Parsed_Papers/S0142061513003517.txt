                  Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is based on law of gravity and the interaction between masses. In GSA, searcher agents are collection of masses and their interactions are based on Newtonian laws of gravity and motion. In this paper, to further improve the optimization performance of GSA, opposition-based learning is employed in opposition-based gravitational search algorithm (OGSA) for population initialization and also for generation jumping. In the present work, OGSA is applied for the solution of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) of power systems. Traditionally, ORPD is defined as the minimization of active power transmission losses by controlling a number of control variables. ORPD is formulated as a non-linear constrained optimization problem with continuous and discrete variables. In this work, OGSA is used to find the settings of control variables such as generator voltages, tap positions of tap changing transformers and amount of reactive compensation to optimize certain objectives. The study is implemented on IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus test power systems with different objectives that reflect minimization of either active power loss or that of total voltage deviation or improvement of voltage stability index. The obtained results are compared to those yielded by the other evolutionary optimization techniques surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including basic GSA. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach and show its effectiveness and robustness for solving ORPD problems of power systems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In power systems, basic objective of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is to identify optimal setting of control variables which minimize the given objective function as either total transmission line loss (PLoss
                     ), or absolute value of total voltage deviation (TVD), or improvement of voltage stability index (VSI) while satisfying the unit and system constraints. This goal is accomplished by proper adjustment of reactive power variables like generator voltage magnitudes, transformer tap settings and switchable VAR sources [1].

Several classical gradient-based optimization algorithms [2–6] have been applied to solve different ORPD problems of power systems. These techniques are, computationally, fast. However, conventional optimization techniques like lambda iteration method, linear programming, interior point method, reduced gradient method and Newton method rely heavily on the convexity assumption of generators’ cost functions and, usually, approximate these curves using quadratic or piecewise quadratic, monotonically increasing cost function [2,3]. These techniques have difficulties in handling problems with the nonconvex or discontinuous landscape and discrete variables. Ref. [7] may be referred for further discussion on these techniques. Hence, it becomes essential to develop optimization techniques that are capable of overcoming these drawbacks.

In the past, computational intelligence-based techniques, such as genetic algorithm (GA) [8], improved GA [9], real parameter GA [10], adaptive GA [11], evolutionary programming (EP) [12], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [13], hybrid PSO [14], bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) [15], differential evolution (DE) [16–18], seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) [19], gravitational search algorithm (GSA) [20] etc have been applied for solving ORPD problem. These techniques have shown effectiveness in overcoming the disadvantages of classical algorithms. Specially, PSO and DE have received increased attention from researchers because of their novelty and searching capability. However, it does not mean that these techniques do not have any limitations. In solving complex multimodal problems, these methods may be easily trapped into local optima. Furthermore, their searching performance depends on the appropriate parameter settings [21]. Premature convergence and local stagnation are frequently observed in many applications [22].

Rashedi et al. proposes gravitational search algorithm (GSA) in [23]. It is a heuristic evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the metaphor of gravitational interactions between masses. GSA is inspired by the theory of Newton that postulates every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Tizhoosh introduced the concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) in [24]. The main idea behind OBL is simultaneous consideration of an estimate and its corresponding opposite estimate (i.e., guess and opposite guess) in order to achieve a better approximation for the current candidate solution. In the recent literature, the concept of opposite numbers has been utilized to speed up the convergence rate of an optimization algorithm such as opposition-based DE [25]. In opposition-based GSA (OGSA) [26], the same idea of opposite number is blended with GSA for population initialization and also for generating new population. Thus, GSA approach is based on the Newtonian physical law of gravity and law of motion while in OGSA the concept of OBL is employed for population initialization and also for generation jumping [27].

In this work, OGSA is applied for the solution of ORPD problem of power systems. Three IEEE standard power systems like IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus power systems are adopted and the ORPD problem of these test power systems are solved with different objectives that reflect minimization of either PLoss
                      or that of TVD or improvement of VSI. Results obtained are compared to other computational intelligence-based meta-heurists surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including basic GSA.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, mathematical problem of ORPD is stated. In Section 3, OGSA is described. In Section 4, implementation of OGSA for ORPD problem is presented. In Section 5, simulation results are presented and discussed. Finally, conclusion of the present work is drawn in Section 6.

                      or that of TVD or improvement of VSI. These three objectives are described in the next three sub-sections followed by constraint handling mechanism for the ORPD problem.

Treating the bus voltage limits as constraints in ORPD often results in all the voltages toward their maximum limits after optimization, which means the power system lacks the required reserves to provide reactive power during contingencies. One of the effective ways to avoid this situation is to choose the minimization of the absolute deviations of all the actual bus voltages from their desired voltages as an objective function. Minimization of TVD of load buses can allow the improvement of voltage profile [1]. In this case, the power system operates more securely and there will be an increase in service quality. This objective function may be formulated as follows

Voltage stability is the ability of a power system to maintain constantly acceptable bus voltage at each bus in the power systems under nominal operating conditions. A system experiences a state of voltage instability when the system is being subjected to a disturbance, or rise in load demand, or change in system configuration. Enhancing voltage stability may be achieved through minimizing the voltage stability indicator L-index values at every bus of the system and consequently the global power system L-index [16]. Voltage stability problem has a close relationship with the reactive power of the system. Voltage stability may be improved by minimizing the voltage stability indicator L-index. In order to enhance the voltage stability and move the system far from the voltage collapse point, improvement of the voltage stability margin is used as an objective for ORPD problem. The VSI objective may, mathematically, be expressed as:

GSA [23] is navigated by properly adjusting gravitational and inertial masses. In Physics, gravitation is the tendency of objects with mass to accelerate towards each other. In Newton’s law of gravity, each particle attracts every other particle with a force known as gravitational force. GSA is one of the newest heuristic algorithms that have been inspired by Newton’s law of gravity and motion.

In GSA, agents are considered as objects and their performances are measured by their masses. All these objects attract each other by the gravity forces and these forces result a global movement of all the objects towards the objects with heavier masses [28]. Hence, masses cooperate using a direct form of communication through gravitational force. The heavier masses (which correspond to good solutions) move more slowly than the lighter ones. This guarantees exploitation step of the algorithm.

To describe the GSA, consider a system with Np
                         masses in which position of the ith mass is defined as in (7)

Total forces applied on an agent from a set of heavier masses should be considered based on the law of gravity as stated in (12) which is followed by calculation of acceleration using the law of motion as presented in (13). Afterwards, next velocity of an agent, (as given in (14)), is calculated as a fraction of its current velocity added to its acceleration. Then, its next position may be calculated by using (15).

Since its inception in 2009, GSA is being hybridized by the researchers’ pool with an aim to have improved optimization performance. Refs. [29–31] may be recalled as just a few towards the attainment of this specific goal. Recently, GSA algorithm has captured much attention and has been, successfully, applied to solve a wide range of practical optimization problems such as edge detection [32,33], filter modeling [34], parameters identification of hydraulic turbine governing system [35], fuzzy controllers for servo systems [36], forecasting future oil demand [37], robust design of multimachine power system stabilizers [38], solution of ORPD [20] and so on.

Evolutionary optimizations methods start with some initial solutions (initial population) and try to improve them toward some optimal solution(s). The process of searching terminates when some predefined criteria are satisfied. We, usually, start with random guesses in the absence of a priori information about the solution. The computation time, among others, is related to the distance of these initial guesses from the optimal solution. We may improve our chance of starting with a closer (fitter) solution by simultaneously checking the opposite solution 
                        [24,25]. By doing this, the fitter one (guess or opposite guess) may be chosen as an initial solution. In fact, according to the theory of probability, for 50% of the time, a guess is further away from the solution than its opposite guess. Therefore, starting with the closer of the two guesses (as judged by its fitness) has the potential to accelerate convergence. The same approach may be applied not only to the initial solutions but also continuously to each solution in the current population.

                            otherwise, we continue with Y. Hence, the point and its opposite point are evaluated simultaneously in order to continue with the fitter one.

Similar to other population-based optimization algorithms, two main steps are distinguishable for GSA. These two are population initialization and producing new generations by adopting the principle of GSA. In the present work, the strategy of OBL [24,25] is incorporated in two steps. The original GSA is chosen as the parent algorithm and opposition-based ideas of [24,25] are embedded in it. Corresponding pseudo code of the proposed OGSA is presented below.

The fitness value of each agent is calculated by using the objective function of the problem. The real-value position of the agent consists of three parts: generator voltages, transformer taps and shunt capacitors/inductors. The real-value position of the agents is changed into a mixed-variable vector which is used to calculate the objective function value of the problem based on Newton–Raphson power flow analysis [39]. The reactive power optimization based on OGSA may be described as follows.

In the present work, OGSA is applied to IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus standard test power systems for the solution of ORPD problems. Description of these studied test systems is depicted in Table 1
                     . The software is written in MATLAB 2008a computing environment and applied on a 2.63GHz Pentium IV personal computer with 3GB RAM. The value of G
                     0 is set to 100 and τ is set to 10 [20]. The value of Jr
                      is selected as 0.3 (Explanation is given in Section 5.4). Number of fitness function evaluations (NFFEs) is set to 1000 for all the test cases. Discussions on simulation results of the present work are presented below. Results of interest are bold faced in the respective tables to indicate the optimization capability of the proposed OGSA algorithm. In this study, 30/100 test runs are performed for all the test cases to solve the ORPD problem and the best results are presented.

IEEE 30-bus power system is taken as test system 1. Generator data, load data, line data, minimum and maximum limits for active power sources, bus voltages, tap settings and reactive power sources for this test system are taken from [20]. This test system has nineteen control variables and these are six generator voltage magnitudes (at the buses 1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 13), four transformers with off-nominal tap ratio (at lines 6–9, 6–10, 4–12 and 28–27) and nine shunt VAR compensation devices (at buses 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 29). The total system demand is 2.834 p.u. at 100 MVA base.

The proposed approach is applied for minimization of PLoss
                            as one of the objective function. The obtained optimal values of control variables, as obtained from the proposed OGSA method, are given in Table 2
                           . The results obtained by the proposed OGSA are compared to those reported in the literature like GSA [20], biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [40], DE [16], comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) [41], PSO [41] and self-adaptive real coded GA (SARGA) [42]. The obtained minimum PLoss
                            from the proposed approach is 4.4984MW. The value of PLoss
                            yielded by OGSA is less by 0.01591MW (i.e. 0.3524%) compared to GSA-based best results of 4.514310MW. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of PLoss
                            (MW) for this test power system is presented in Fig. 1
                           . From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of PLoss
                            (MW) for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one. The computational times of the compared algorithms are also shown in Table 2. It may be seen from this table that the computing time of OGSA is less than other evolutionary meta-heuristics including the basic GSA reported in [20].

The proposed OGSA-based approach is also applied for the minimization of TVD of this test power network. The results yielded by the proposed OGSA-based approach are presented in Table 3
                           . The results obtained by the proposed OGSA are compared to those reported in the literature like GSA [20] and DE [16]. From this table, 5.37% improvement in TVD may be recorded by using the proposed OGSA-based algorithm as compared to GSA counterpart as reported in [20]. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of TVD (p.u.) for this test power system is presented in Fig. 2
                           . From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of TVD (p.u.) for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.

Results obtained by the proposed OGSA algorithm for the improvement of voltage stability index for IEEE 30-bus test power system are also presented in Table 3. The results obtained by the proposed OGSA are compared to those reported in the literature like GSA [20] and DE [16]. From this table, 10.11% improvement in voltage stability index may be recorded by using the proposed OGSA-based algorithm as compared to GSA reported in [20]. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of VSI for this test power system is presented in Fig. 3
                           . From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of voltage stability index for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.

The standard IEEE 57-bus system consists of eighty transmission lines, seven generators (at the buses 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12) and fifteen branches under load tap setting transformer branches is taken as test system 2. There reactive power sources are considered at buses 18, 25 and 53. Line data, bus data, variable limits and the initial values of the control variables are taken from [43,44]. The search space of this case system has twenty five dimensions, including seven generator voltages, fifteen transformer taps and three reactive power sources. The system loads are given as follows: PLoad
                           
                        =12.508 p.u., QLoad
                           
                        =3.364 p.u. The initial total generations and power losses are: PG
                           
                        =12.7926 p.u., QG
                           
                        =3.4545 p.u., PLoss
                           
                        =0.28462 p.u., QLoss
                           
                        =−1.2427 p.u. There are five bus voltages in p.u. outside the limits: V
                        25
                        =0.938, V
                        30
                        =0.920, V
                        31
                        =0.900, V
                        32
                        =0.926, V
                        33
                        =0.924.


                           Table 4
                            depicts the solution result for PLoss
                            minimization objective while the best reactive power dispatch solutions for this objective are tabulated in Table 4. In Table 4, OGSA based results are compared to other optimization technique recently reported in the literature like GSA [20]; nonlinear programming (NLP) [19]; canonical GA (CGA) [19]; adaptive GA (AGA) [19]; PSO with adaptive inertia weight (PSO-w) [19]; PSO with a constriction factor (PSO-cf) [19]; CLPSO [19]; a “real standard” version of PSO, called as SPSO-07 [19]; DEs with local search, instead of their corresponding original versions and denoted as L-DE [19], L-SACP-DE [19], L-SaDE [19]; SOA [19]; BBO [40]; BBO (after relaxing Q-limit of bus 2 and 9) [40]. From Table 4, it may be observed OGSA based results yield optimal value of PLoss
                            for this power network. In [19], base case power loss for this test power network is reported as 0.28462 p.u. The% PSave
                           in Table 5
                            denotes the saving percent of the PLoss
                           . Table 5 demonstrates that a power loss reduction of 17.68% (from 0.28462 p.u. to 0.2343 p.u.) is accomplished by using the proposed OGSA approach, which is the biggest reduction of power loss than that obtained by the other approaches. The total time of taken by the comparative algorithms are summarized in Table 6
                           , which portrays the execution time taken by the proposed OGSA approach for this power network is the least one among the algorithms reported in this table. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of PLoss
                            (MW) for this test power system is presented in Fig. 4
                           . From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of PLoss

To test the proposed technique in solving ORPD problems of larger power systems, a standard IEEE 118-bus test system is considered as test system 3 [43,45,46]. The search space of this case system has seventy seven dimensions, that is, the fifty four generator buses, sixty four load buses, one hundred eighty six transmission lines, nine transformer taps and fourteen reactive power sources. The system line data, bus data, variable limits and the initial values of control variables are given in [43,45]. The maximum and minimum limits of reactive power sources, bus voltage and tap-setting limits are taken from [20]. The system loads are given as follows: PLoad
                           
                        =42.4200 p.u., QLoad
                           
                        =14.3800 p.u. The initial total generations and power losses are as follows: PG
                           
                        =43.7536 p.u., QG
                           
                        =8.8192 p.u., PLoss
                           
                        =1.33357 p.u., QLoss
                           
                        =−7.8511 p.u.

OGSA-based reactive power dispatch schedule for the test system of PLoss
                            minimization objective is presented in Table 9
                            and the results obtained are compared to GSA [20], CLPSO [41] and PSO [41]. This table demonstrates that the OGSA yields optimal PLoss
                            as compared to other algorithms.


                           Table 10

                            only. From this table it is observed that execution time of OGSA is the least one among the reported algorithms. From this table it may also be noted that the standard deviation and median values are quite satisfactory for OGSA. Success rate of OGSA may also be found to be promising one. The results in this table clearly indicate the superiority of OGSA over either GSA or PSO or CLPSO.

The performance of any evolutionary algorithm largely depends on the right selection of its control parameters. The performance of the OGSA also depends on the selection of values of G
                        0, τ and Jr
                        . In the present work, a robustness study is carried out on IEEE 30-bus power system with transmission loss minimization objective. The known minimum solution for this problem from the literature is 4.514310MW [20]. Different sets of parameters are tried to find a result better than this one. The effects of parameters in OGSA are illustrated in Tables 13 and 14
                        
                        , where 100 random trial runs are performed for each parameter set. The value of NFFEs is set as 1000. Among the different set of parameters (like G
                        0 and τ) for OGSA algorithm, Case 4 in Table 13 shows the best performance in terms of the highest number of hits to minimum solution. Thus, the values of G
                        0 and τ are selected as 100 and 10, respectively. Similarly, Table 14 shows the best performance of the algorithm when the value of Jr
                         is selected as 0.3. Thus, these values of the parameters are subsequently selected for all the test cases of the current paper.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, one recently developed meta-heuristic like OGSA has been, successfully, implemented to solve the ORPD problem of power systems and the economical (in the form of minimization of active power loss) as well as technical (in the form of minimization of TVD or improvement of VSI) benefits arisen are presented. The ORPD problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints of the power network. In this study, minimization of active power loss, or that of TVD, or improvement of VSI are, individually, considered. The proposed OGSA is tested on IEEE 30-, 57-, and 118-bus test power systems to demonstrate its effectiveness. From the simulation work, it is observed that the proposed OGSA yields optimal settings of the control variables of the test power system. The simulation results also indicate the robustness and superiority of the proposed approach to solve the ORPD problem of power systems. It is noticed that the concept of opposition-based learning in GSA for population initialization and also for generation jumping enhances its optimization capability in terms of its searching capability and robustness as compared to the basic GSA counterpart. The results obtained from the simulation of the present paper obviously demonstrate that the proposed OGSA yields better-quality solution in comparison to the GSA-based results previously reported in the recent state-of-the-art literature. Thus, the proposed OGSA may be recommended as a very promising algorithm for solving some more other complex engineering optimization problems for the future researchers.
