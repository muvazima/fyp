                  A new display concept for reproduction of high-luminance colors based on a liquid crystal display has been developed using a brighter backlight unit and color mapping algorithms. The new concept is able to display brighter colors close to a peak luminance of a display white than conventional displays so that realistic scene of brighter colors is better reproduced. It may also be one of the future display solutions needed to extend the color gamut in the direction of brighter colors, which is a principal limitation in conventional displays even in high-dynamic range display systems. With the new concept, an xvYCC- (extended-video YCbCr) compatible display can be easily realized.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past decade, the color gamut of the standard display for the high definition television system and computer displays has been defined by Rec.709 (ITU) and sRGB (IEC) [1,2]. Such displays can reproduce only a portion of all colors visible to humans. To extend beyond this limitation on color gamuts, new wide color-gamut standards such as xvYCC, ITU-R-BT.1361, Adobe-RGB, scRGB and ITU-R.BT.2020 for UHDTV have been published [3–5].

Currently, some wide color gamut displays in the form of multi-primary displays or those using highly saturated primary colors, such as LED and laser displays, are available on the market [6–8]. However, recent technology of the wide color gamut displays focuses mainly on increasing the color purity of the primary colors and the number of display primaries [6,7]. With these efforts, the color gamut can be extended in the direction of more saturated primary colors, as shown in Fig. 1
                     .


                     Fig. 1 shows only the maximum range of the color-gamut boundaries. In other words,the projected two-dimensional CIE-xy chromaticity diagram represents the color gamut without luminance information. To analyze the color gamut with respect to luminance more accurately, three-dimensional color spaces with an additional luminance or lightness axis are required.

Even though these display types can extend the wide color gamut in the direction of increasing color purity, there are still limitations on the gamut extension in the region of high-luminance colors. The reason for this limitation is that a conventional display reproduces colors by the additive mixture of primary colors. Thus, the reproduction of the high-luminance colors close to the peak luminance of a display white is principally impossible.


                     Fig. 2
                      illustrates this limitation in three-dimensional YCbCr color space. The display white with luminance Y
                     W
                     =1 is optically composed by the mixture of the three primary colors: Y
                     W
                     =
                     Y
                     R
                     +
                     Y
                     G
                     +
                     Y
                     B
                     =0.3+0.59+0.11. For that reason, the luminance of all primary colors and other mixed colors cannot possibly exceed the luminance of the display peak white.

However, humans can perceive not only a peak display white but also brighter colors, of which the brightness levels are close to a brightness level of a perceived white. This human-perceptible color gamut is called an optimal illuminant color space, as shown in Fig. 3
                     . This was studied in an article [9].

The brightest gamut range of the optimal illuminant color space is indicated as the red-line in Fig. 3; CIE-L
                     ∗
                     =100 (L
                     ∗
                     =100 is equivalent to Y
                     =1). This range includes many colors with the same luminance of the peak display white, such as yellow, green, and cyan. However, the reproducible color range of the conventional display has only one point of the peak display white at the brightness level of CIE-L
                     ∗
                     =100.

Thus, the chromatic colors having the same luminance as the peak display white cannot be reproduced on the conventional display even though these colors are captured by a camera. These colors are named as “high-luminance chromatic colors” hereafter.

This limitation of high-luminance chromatic colors in relation to the peak display white of the conventional display causes degradation image qualities during high-luminance color reproductions. This often occurs during display on a high dynamic range (HDR) imaging system; for example, to capture and to display the colored illumination on a stage during live music performances (see Fig. 4
                     ) or colors of brighter LED-lighting of Christmas trees.

In such cases, the conventional display usually clips bright colors to boundary colors of the display gamut so that corresponding colors may be desaturated or their luminance may be decreased while maintaining their chroma even in more sophisticated mapping algorithms. This limitation reduces the dynamic range of the original scene and results in a dull-image look to observers. This is one of the reasons of why human observers feel that a live scene is much better than a reproduced image on display. To overcome this problem, a significant research area is HDR imaging in the field of extended-encoding schemes such as LogluvTIff, OpenEXR, scRGB, RGBE, and HDRi [11], and some HDR displays [12] that can reproduce much higher peak luminance than conventional displays. However, HDR displays unfortunately use the same additive mixture reproduction concept as conventional displays; they still cannot reproduce the high-luminance colors close to the peak display white.

To summarize, current displays may need to extend their color gamut in the direction of highly saturated colors in order to realize UHDTV standard Rec.2020 and the dynamic range of displays should be increased to enable HDR imaging. On the other hand, this requires reproducing high-luminance colors closer to a luminance of the peak display white to enable all human-perceptible colors.

With respect to an effective usage of the display color gamut, extending the gamut in the direction of the higher-luminance colors may be much more meaningful than extending the color gamut in the direction of the saturated colors, because the occurrence statistic of high luminance colors is usually much higher than the saturated colors outside of the Rec.709 color gamut.

In Section 2, the concept of the proposed display will be explained in detail. In Section 3, an implementation of the proposed display using a conventional LCD will be described in terms of a standard color reproduction and a color reproduction using the sRGB gamut expansion. In the same section, simulation results of test images for standard color reproduction and experimental results of a subjective image quality assessment for the sRGB gamut-expanding method will be presented. Finally, the paper concludes with the results and a discussion of some future research directions.

As previously mentioned, the low-luminance color problem in conventional display systems can easily be solved by using high-luminance primary colors; this is realized, for example, by using a brighter backlight in an LCD with an appropriate color-mapping algorithm. This concept is shown in Fig. 5
                     .

The inner “Gamut1” indicates the color gamut of the conventional display. Here, we replace the backlight with one having approximately twice the brightness (w2/w1=2). Therefore, the color gamut of the new display with brighter backlight will be linearly enlarged to the outer “Gamut2”, thereby the luminance of RGB primary colors are changed from (Y
                     R1, Y
                     G1, Y
                     B1) to the values of (Y
                     R2, Y
                     G2, Y
                     B2), respectively.

As the following step, a mapping of an input video signal (source gamut) to the enlarged display gamut (target gamut) will be required. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, the relative lower luminance of “w1” of the target gamut (Gamut2) can be selected as the matched white point of the source gamut. The point of “w1” is freely selectable within the target gamut according to the desired mapping strategy.

Therefore, the source gamut can be mapped inside the target gamut. If the source gamut is the Rec.709 or sRGB gamut, then the source gamut can be mapped into the target gamut without any change of colors, as is done for the conventional sRGB display.

In contrast, if a video signal is encoded by the wide gamut of the xvYCC, nearly the entire region of the xvYCC source gamut, excepting only some low-luminance colors (marked as “Out of Gamut Colors” in Fig. 6
                     ; marked in green color but outside the target gamut), can be successfully matched into the target gamut, marked in green in Fig. 6. This means that the high-luminance colors (marked as “High-luminance Colors”; marked in green color but outside the upper sRGB gamut in Fig. 6) of xvYCC can be reproduced more than by the conventional display system.

The important thing is that the proposed mapping algorithms use only a part of the whole volume of the target gamut in order to reproduce high-luminance colors close to the white-luminance of the source gamut.

Furthermore, some part of the highly saturated color region, indicated as “Out of Gamut Color” in Fig. 6, can be included by using an increased purity of primary colors compared with the sRGB standard. This means that the slope of the primary-color

                      vectors (R2, G2, and B2 in Fig. 5) will be much smaller.

In contrast to the described standard color reproduction, the sRGB gamut expansion algorithm has been developed.

The block diagram of the whole mapping process is shown in Fig. 7
                     . As a first step, the nonlinear RGBNL signal of the sRGB (or Rec.709) will be converted into the linear RGB

                      signal by applying the inverse gamma function (Γ
                     −1) according to the sRGB-specification.

                     The sRGB expansion can be carried out in the linear YCbCr color space, as indicated the “Gamut Mapping” block in Fig. 7.

To improve a pleasantness of the popular sRGB images, the sRGB gamut can be mapped to the freely definable “target-expanding gamut” as a part of the target gamut of a display with a brighter backlight (see Fig. 8).

The boundary of the “target-expanding gamut”, marked as “B2”, can be constructed with the combination of the boundaries of the “Target Gamut” for the side and lower limit and of the freely definable “target-expanding gamut” for the upper limit.

                     For the gamut mapping from the “source gamut” to the “target-expanding gamut”, we used the simple mapping algorithm using a concept of constant saturation as shown in Fig. 8. Any color inside the sRGB gamut will be linearly increased to the target-expanding gamut along the line of constant saturation. A linearly increasing gain can be determined by comparing the two gamut boundaries (source and target-expanding gamut) for a given constant saturation.

                      on B2 may be distinguished in two types. For the first color types on the boundary of the “target gamut”, at least one channel value of RGB channels must either possess the minimum value of 0 or the maximum value of 1, as mentioned in the case k
                     1. Therefore, for the determination of k
                     2, the same procedure in the RGB domain can be applied as in k1-case.

However, for the second type colors on the upper-limit of B2, which was designed according to the Eq. (3), the computation of k
                     2 is differ from the first type colors. The luminance value of

                      for the second type is same with the YB2,MAX(C) in Eq. (3). Thus, the relationship of the luminance components of

As a mapping result, the luminance of the sRGB chromatic colors will be increased while maintaining their hue so that the image may look more brilliant and colorful than the sRGB original.

In addition, there are some more sophisticated algorithms which can determine clipped colors on the boundary of the sRGB color gamut from sRGB images and map them to estimated higher-luminance colors [13]. However, this is not discussed further because our aim is to develop a new concept of a high-luminance color display beyond the conventional display. We believe that the method of expanding the sRGB gamut toward the higher-luminance color region is important for research in the near future. We seek to show only the additional impact and feasibility of our new display concept by introducing a simple mapping algorithm.

@&#IMPLEMENTATION@&#

In order to verify the proposed concept, a prototype display with a resolution of 1600×900 in 20-in. format with an LED backlight has been developed. Through a modified brighter backlight, a peak white luminance of the display is about 500-nit. However, the proposed algorithm utilizes only 250-nit as the reference white luminance (w in Figs. 6 and 8). In addition, the display has sRGB-compatible color primaries.

The proposed mapping algorithms (standard color reproduction for sRGB and xvYCC, and sRGB expansion) have been implemented and tested for their feasibility using specially prepared images.

At the beginning, test images were prepared using a conventional DSLR camera (Nikon D700) with a low exposure in manual mode. We used manual mode because brighter colors are usually clipped in a conventional camera system in automatic exposure mode; the relative high-brightness of colors were captured without any signal clipping (see the images in Fig. 9
                        (a) and (b) upper left: “sRGB low exposure input”). Owing to low exposure, the images are usually darker than images captured using conventional shooting with proper exposure.

As shown in the images in Fig. 9(a), the small-size Macbeth color checker in front of the 46-in. DTV with 450-nit peak white has been captured relatively dark. However, the large size of the Macbeth color pattern on the DTV screen has been captured in normal brightness with a correct exposure level. The exposure level of the camera was adjusted against the white color patch of the Macbeth color checker on the DTV.

If the exposure level is trimmed for the front Macbeth color checker, the brightness of the image will be correspondingly increased. To emulate this, the captured images are linearly scaled up to the luminance level of the images so that the white (the white patch of the front Macbeth color checker) of the luminance-scaled image is increased to the reference white (w) of the display. Thus, we could achieve images with brighter colors that exceeded the sRGB color gamut without signal clipping. These types of images are not able to be captured and displayed on a conventional sRGB camera and sRGB display system because of the bright colors that are outside of the sRGB color gamut.

These non-clipped images were prepared for two camera image types according to the sRGB and xvYCC encodings, as an internal camera process [3,10].

A first sRGB encoding process in a usual camera is a method of simple RGB clipping if the signal exceeds the normalized signal range of (0,1). This means that the bright colors outside of the sRGB gamut are replaced with boundary colors of the sRGB gamut. The result of the RGB clipping is shown in the right-upper of Fig. 9(a); the bright colors are desaturated and their luminance levels are decreased.

However, a second xvYCC encoding process can include more bright colors in the non-clipped luminance-scaled images than the sRGB encoding process. Such a type of xvYCC camera system is already available on the market [8,10]. It means that most bright colors can be correctly mapped into the new display gamut with reduced color distortion.

The left-lower image in Fig. 9(a) is one of the possible xvYCC-encoded images on the proposed display and the image slightly differs from the original (left-upper) because of an applied gamut mapping algorithm. The typical result image of the xvYCC encoding (left-lower) is not the same as the original (left-upper). The reason for this is another issue of HDR to low-dynamic-range image conversion and is beyond the scope of this paper.

The xvYCC-encoded images are reproduced on the proposed display (lower left), and the same images are displayed on the conventional sRGB display (right-lower). The new display can reproduce more bright colors with minimal change of hue and lower desaturation of colors than the conventional methods of “sRGB camera/sRGB display” and “xvYCC camera/sRGB display.” Consequently, the proposed display preserves more image details than the conventional display.

Another natural image example, Fig. 9(b), shows the same effect: the bright-illumination colors are better reproduced while maintaining a proper exposure level of the face colors of the child in the foreground.

Beyond the proposed standard color reproduction, we also developed an sRGB-expanding algorithm in terms of image enhancement according to the previously described algorithm in Fig. 8. It is a common feature of a color enhancement today to make a pleasant color reproduction in consumer electronics such as DTV and DSLR cameras.

A typical mapping effect is shown in Fig. 10
                        . The luminance of the original sRGB colors will be increased by the mapping algorithm so that the enhanced image looks more brilliant. Here, in order to visualize the effect of the new display to be shown on a conventional sRGB display, the RGB signals of the images in Fig. 10 are linearly scaled down to half brightness.

To verify the reliability of the algorithm, a subjective image quality assessment method, SDSCE (simultaneous double stimulus for continuous evaluation) according to ITU-R.BT.500, was carried out [14]. For the experiment, 15 observers (six females and nine males, aged 21–35years) took part and nine typical images were used for the test (Fig. 11
                        ) [15]. Each test image was prepared as a pair of images: one is the reproduction of the conventional display and the other is the resulting image which was created by applying the sRGB-expanding algorithm.

Observers were asked their opinion in terms of pleasantness by comparing each pair of images. The opinion was graded on a five-point scale (5: much better, 4: better 3: same, 2: worse, 1: much worse).


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the test results in a statistical box–whisker plot for the nine test images. The overall mean-opinion score result is 3.64, and the standard deviation is about 0.54. This means that people prefer the enhanced images of the new display concept to the images of the conventional display. Generally, the pleasantness increases as the size of the colored object in the images increases and the color saturation of objects becomes larger (images 1, 2, and 7). Contrary to this, typical natural images of small objects have less impact on observer preference.

To conclude, the sRGB gamut expansion algorithm can elevate the luminance of image contents without changing the chromaticity coordinate (CIE-xy). Perceived color saturation for humans increases with increasing physical luminance of image contents.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We developed a new display concept with high-luminance primary colors and additional algorithms. The new display is able to reproduce brighter colors close to a peak luminance of a display white than conventional displays so that life-like scenes of high-luminance objects (for which image details are therefore better preserved) are better displayed.

The proposed concept may be a future display solution for extending the color gamut in the direction of brighter colors, which is the principal limitation in conventional displays until now. Also, an exact xvYCC-compatible display can be realized using the proposed concept.

Together with an HDR display, the proposed method may be a good solution for realizing a realistic life-like image display in the future.

The disadvantages of the new display concept are energy inefficiency and a higher signal bit depth because of the partial usage of the whole display gamut. However, in the future, enhanced power-saving green technology or a spatially varying pixel-wise overdriving method of the organic light-emitting diode display may ease the introduction of the new display concept to the market.
