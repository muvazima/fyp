                  The estimation of query model is an important task in language modeling (LM) approaches to information retrieval (IR). The ideal estimation is expected to be not only effective in terms of high mean retrieval performance over all queries, but also stable in terms of low variance of retrieval performance across different queries. In practice, however, improving effectiveness can sacrifice stability, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose to study this tradeoff from a new perspective, i.e., the bias–variance tradeoff, which is a fundamental theory in statistics. We formulate the notion of bias–variance regarding retrieval performance and estimation quality of query models. We then investigate several estimated query models, by analyzing when and why the bias–variance tradeoff will occur, and how the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. A series of experiments on four TREC collections have been conducted to systematically evaluate our bias–variance analysis. Our approach and results will potentially form an analysis framework and a novel evaluation strategy for query language modeling.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Estimating query language model is an important task in language modeling (LM) approaches, since the query language model represents the underlying information need and has a significant impact on retrieval performance. Ideally, the estimation should be not only effective in terms of high mean performance over all queries, but also stable in terms of low variance of performance across different individual queries. In practice, however, improving effectiveness can sacrifice stability, and vice versa.

For example, suppose that there are two queries q
                     1 and q
                     2, and for each query we use the average precision (AP) to measure the retrieval performance of a query model estimation method. Assume that we have two estimation methods A and B, where A and B can correspond to the original query model and an expanded query model, respectively. In Table 1
                     , the mean average precision (MAP) over all queries for methods A and B are 0.2 and 0.34, respectively, meaning A is less effective than B. On the other hand, we compute the variance of AP across all concerned queries (denoted as VAP). Specifically, for A, VAP is 0.01, and VAP for B is 0.0676. It turns out the VAP
                        B
                      is greater than VAP
                        A
                     . The smaller VAP generally reflects the better retrieval stability. Thus, A is more stable than B. This shows a retrieval effectiveness-stability tradeoff between methods A and B.

In this paper, we propose to study the tradeoff between retrieval effectiveness and stability from a new perspective, i.e., bias–variance tradeoff. The bias–variance tradeoff is fundamental in the estimation theory and has been extensively studied in density estimation (Zucchini, Berzel, & Nenadic, 2005), linear regression (Geman, Bienenstock, & Doursat, 1992), classification (Valentini, Dietterich, & Cristianini, 2004), and other areas (Bishop, 2006). In general, the bias represents the gap between the expectation (i.e., mean) of estimated values and the true target value, while the variance represents the variability over all estimated values.

This motivates us to formulate the performance bias and variance, which are related to the retrieval effectiveness and stability, respectively. Specifically, assumes that we have a performance target (in practice, an upper bound performance). The performance bias represents the gap between the actual mean performance and the mean performance target. For the example in Table 1, assumes that the target AP (i.e., the upper-bound AP) can be 0.7 and 0.2 for queries q
                     1 and q
                     2, respectively. Then, for A, the bias is 0.45−0.2=0.25, where 0.45 is the target MAP and 0.2 is the MAP of A. Similarly, the bias for method B is 0.11 (see Table 1). On the other hand, the performance variance (denoted as Var in Table 1) is the variance of the retrieval performance across different queries, i.e., VAP. In Table 1, there is a bias–variance tradeoff between A and B, and the smaller performance bias and variance generally reflect the better retrieval effectiveness and stability, respectively. Therefore, we can investigate the problem of improving the retrieval effectiveness and stability from the perspective of reducing performance bias and variance, respectively.
                        1
                        We will also define additional performance bias–variance in Section 3.2.2.
                     
                     
                        1
                     
                  

In addition to the performance bias–variance, we also formulate the estimation bias–variance to measure the estimation quality of an estimated query model with respect to the true query model. Assume that the true information need can be represented by a set of truly relevant documents. Then, the true query model can be generated from truly relevant documents. Such a true query model is expected to give the upper-bound retrieval performance. The estimation error of an estimated model can be measured by the KL-divergence between the estimated model and the true model. The estimation bias is the expected estimation error over all queries, while the estimation variance is the variance of the estimation error across different individual queries. The sum of bias and variance (see Section 3.3) can yield the total estimation error which directly indicates the total estimation quality. The estimation bias–variance is important, in that it gives finer-grained insights on the estimated query model itself (i.e., its estimation quality).

Our bias–variance analysis is based on general principles of bias–variance tradeoff and four query modeling factors (i.e., query model complexity, query model combination, document weight smoothness, non-relevant document removal). We investigate a series of estimated query models corresponding to the above factors, and analyze when and why the bias–variance tradeoff will occur and how the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. Based on the analysis, a set of hypotheses is formed. We then carry out extensive experiments based on TREC datasets to systematically evaluate the hypotheses based on the bias–variance analysis. Experimental results on performance bias–variance can generally verify the hypotheses. This shows that the retrieval effectiveness and stability can be studied via the performance bias–variance formulation and the general principles of bias–variance analysis. The experimental results on estimation bias–variance can verify the hypotheses on the occurrence of bias–variance tradeoff, but do not fully support hypotheses regarding the simultaneously reduction of the bias and variance. It is an interesting result though, since we find that the corresponding estimated query model may over-fit the relevant feedback documents, but may not fit the relevant documents that do not appear in the feedback document set. It can demonstrate that the improved retrieval performance cannot always guarantee the improvement of the estimation quality.

The proposed bias–variance analysis is expected to form an analysis framework and potentially a novel evaluation strategy for the query language modeling. First, for a query modeling approach (or in general other IR models), we can analyze its modeling factors (e.g., model complexity or model combination) and propose hypotheses on the bias–variance tradeoff or even predict the bias–variance trends of the retrieval performance or estimation error/quality. Second, with respect to the evaluation strategy, the estimation bias–variance formulation can provide novel metrics (e.g., estimation bias, estimation variance, and the sum of them) to evaluate the estimation quality of an estimated model. In addition, the summed quantity of performance bias and variance (see Eq. (6) in Section 3.2.1), can naturally be a unified retrieval robustness metric combining retrieval effectiveness and stability.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a literature review on the query language model estimation. Then, in Section 3, we formulate the performance bias–variance as well as the estimation bias–variance. Section 4 presents and analyzes various estimated query models in relation to the bias–variance tradeoff. In Section 5, we move onto the evaluation of the hypotheses of the bias–variance analysis for the concerned query language models. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude our paper by summarizing the main contributions and highlighting the potential impact and future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Over decades, various probabilistic IR models have been developed (Maron & Kuhns, 1960; Lafferty & Zhai, 2003; Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009; Zhai, 2007) to estimate document relevance with respect to an information need (often represented as a query). One way is from the document-generation point of view, leading to the classical probabilistic model (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009), while another way is from the query-generation perspective, leading to the language modeling approach (Lafferty & Zhai, 2003). Lafferty and Zhai (2003) considered the above two directions into a unified generative relevance model. Indeed, there are other kinds of probabilistic retrieval models (Fuhr, 2001; Rijsbergen, 1997; Zhai, 2007). Our focus in this paper is on the language modeling (LM) approach.

The LM approaches (Ponte & Croft, 1998; Zhai & Lafferty, 2001) are derived by estimating how probable it is for a document to generate a query (Spärck Jones, Robertson, Hiemstra, & Zaragoza, 2003). There is no explicit relevance in the formulation in early LM approaches, where the query representation is the original query language model estimated by the maximum-likelihood method. Later on, the relevance model (RM) (Lavrenko & Croft, 2001) was developed by assuming that the query and its relevant documents are random samples from an underlying relevance model R. In practice, RM estimates an expanded query language model, which is generated from pseudo-relevant documents, rather than truly relevant documents. It is natural to assume that the truly relevant query language model (true query model for short in the rest of the paper) can be generated from the truly relevant documents given a query.

Despite its effectiveness in general, the expanded query model is often less stable in the sense that its performance is not stable across different individual queries (Collins-Thompson, 2009a). The expanded query model may perform less effectively than the original query model for some queries (Amati, Carpineto, Romano, & Bordoni, 2004). Recently, many methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of query expansion. Tao and Zhai (2006) proposed a method to integrate the original query with feedback documents in a probabilistic mixture model and then regularize the parameter estimation. Li (2008) considered the original query as a short document, and investigated rank-related priors and term selection in RM. Lv and Zhai (2009) proposed to adaptively combine the original query and the feedback information. Collins-Thompson and Callan (2007) investigated the uncertainty of feedback-based query models and proposed to resample different feedback document models using Bootstrap sampling. In (Collins-Thompson, 2009b; Dillon & Collins-Thompson, 2010), the risk and reward tradeoff and optimization for query expansion were discussed. Lv, Zhai, and Chen (2011) proposed a FeedbackBoost method to improve the robustness of the expanded query model.

In our opinion, retrieval robustness can be considered as a combined criteria of retrieval effectiveness and retrieval stability. However, to our knowledge, existing work did not provide a formulation to decompose retrieval robustness into retrieval effectiveness and retrieval stability. In addition, the tradeoff between retrieval effectiveness and stability has not been studied via the bias–variance tradeoff. Moreover, existing work on query language modeling paid more attention to the retrieval performance than to the estimation quality with respect to the true query model.

The variance of retrieval performance across different queries has been investigated in the literature (Banks, Over, & Zhang, 1999). The variation of the query difficulty/hardness across different topics was studied in the query expansion task (Amati et al., 2004). More recently, Robertson and Kanoulas (2012) have investigated the per-topic variance. Such variance comes from different per-topic AP values measured from different simulated document collections. They simulate a number of document collections from one existing collection. Robertson and Kanoulas (2012) did not adopt the bias–variance tradeoff to investigate the retrieval effectiveness and stability across topics/queries.

The proposed bias–variance analysis is different from the existing mean–variance analysis in document ranking (Wang, 2009; Wang & Zhu, 2009; Zhu, Wang, Cox, & Taylor, 2009). In mean–variance analysis, the variance is associated to the relevance score, while the bias and variance in our paper are associated to the retrieval performance and estimation quality. Moreover, in mean–variance analysis, the relationships between mean and variance have not been explored, while in our paper, the relationship between mean and variance is studied by looking at the tradeoff between the bias and variance.

Our work is also related to but different from the recent research on the exploration–exploitation tradeoff in interactive relevance feedback (Karimzadehgan & Zhai, 2010, 2012) and in online learning to rank (Hofmann, Whiteson, & de Rijke, 2012). We formulate the bias and variance (see the next section) and analyze the tradeoff between them in query language modeling (see Section 4.2), while in (Karimzadehgan & Zhai, 2012), the bias and variance are not defined or formulated. Nevertheless, the exploration–exploitation tradeoff occurs in our experiments (see Section 5.4.4), in the sense that the estimated model may over-fit the relevant feedback documents, but may not fit the other relevant documents which do not appear in the feedback document set.

The bias–variance analysis is a fundamental theory and has been extensively studied in parameter estimation (Duda, Hart, & Stork, 2001; Lebanon, 2010), density estimation (Zucchini et al., 2005), linear regression (Geman et al., 1992), classification (Lipka & Stein, 2011; Valentini et al., 2004), and other areas (Bishop, 2006). We first briefly explain the classical bias–variance decomposition for the squared loss of the estimation.

                         for the unknown true target y, where 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    y
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                           
                         is determined by the sample X. For different sample X, the value of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    y
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                           
                         varies. Thus,

                         can be considered as a random variable. The expected squared error loss of the estimation can be decomposed to bias and variance:

The above formulation is a general description of the bias and variance. It can be applied to specific areas with specific explanations. For instance, in parameter estimation, the task is to estimate a parameter (e.g., mean or variance) of the underlying distribution of a given data sample.
                           2
                           In this paper, we consider the sample as a terminology of statistics and refer to each sample as a collection of data or information. In some other literature, a sample may be considered as a single data point.
                        
                        
                           2
                         On different samples (or sampling distributions), the estimated values can be different. In regression or classification, the task is to estimate the response value (in regression) or the class labels (in classification) for any test data point, given a training sample (or called training set). On different training samples, the estimated values could be different (Bishop, 2006; Geman et al., 1992) and the estimated value can be considered as a random variable.

Generally speaking, given the limited size for each sample, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance (Geman et al., 1992). For example, a simple estimation method involving less configurations (e.g., less parameters or assumptions) often has higher bias but lower variance, compared with a more complex method (Geman et al., 1992). This means that the expected estimation error of the simple method is often larger than that of the complex one, but the estimated values of the simple method over different samples are more stable than those of the complex one. To reduce the bias and variance simultaneously, one often needs more data (e.g., larger sample size or more training data) (Bishop, 2006; Brain, 1999; Perlich, Provost, & Simonoff, 2003), or well designed methods (e.g., combination method, also called as ensemble method) (Ghahramani, Ghahramani, & Chul Kim, 2003; Valentini et al., 2004). In the context of query language modeling, we will analyze the above factors that can affect the bias and variance in Section 4.2.

We now define the bias–variance analysis in IR. According to previous introduction, the bias considers the expected estimation value over all samples, while the variance represents the variability of the estimated values across different samples. In IR, for evaluating a retrieval model or a query model, we are concerned about its mean retrieval performance over all queries, and also the variability of retrieval performance across different queries. We can consider each query and its corresponding data (e.g., query terms, retrieved documents, or relevance judgements if available) as a sample to test the retrieval performance. Therefore, we can let the actual retrieval performance be a random variable, which can be different for different queries.

Recall that we consider the actual performance (denoted

                            represents the variance of average precision of all concerned queries. We can denote the variance of average precision as VAP. The smaller VAP indicates the better stability of the retrieval performance.

                              VAP is the variance of AP, and AP is the performance metric this paper is focused on. Indeed, the bias–variance analysis results are dependent on the choice of effectiveness metric. If one changes the metric AP to its other forms, e.g., logAP, it may lead to different observations and analysis results on the retrieval stability. We will explore this issue in the future work.

Variance of AP (VAP) in fact computes the second central moment of AP, by considering the value of AP on different queries as a random variable. This is helpful to integrate VAP and MAP, the latter being the first moment of AP, into the bias–variance framework.

Now, we can add the bias and variance together, yielding

                            in Eq. (6) takes into account both performance bias and variance, which are related to retrieval effectiveness and stability, respectively, across all queries.

In our opinion, retrieval robustness is a combined criteria of retrieval effectiveness and stability. Both effectiveness and stability are important in evaluating the robustness of an IR system. Considering only one criteria (effectiveness or stability) is insufficient. Thus, the summed quantity in Eq. (6), which takes into account both retrieval effectiveness and stability, can be considered as a metric for the retrieval robustness. The bias–variance decomposition of

                            in Eq. (6) can naturally formulate the effectiveness-stability decomposition of retrieval robustness.

We do not argue that the overall quantity in Eq. (6) can cover every aspect of retrieval robustness in IR. However, it provides a decomposition perspective, which can help us understand and analyze the retrieval robustness. In addition, the bias–variance decomposition can help us analyze the tradeoff between the retrieval effectiveness and stability and then give us some clues on how to improve retrieval robustness.

In the above bias–variance formulation, the random variable is the actual performance

                            which is different for different queries. Now, we are going to formulate an additional bias–variance based on the difference between the actual performance

Next, we will present an example to discuss the relationships between performance bias–variance and additional performance bias and variance.

Let us look at the example in Table 3
                           , from which we can observe the results of different bias–variance defined on different variables. The methods A and B correspond to the original and expanded query models, respectively. In Table 3, for all three variables, the biases of the method A are larger than those of the method B, indicating that the expanded query model B is more effective than original model A, regardless of which variable is used.

                            can reveal that the original query model A is more stable than the expanded query model B. However, the variance based on

Now, we are going to formulate the estimation bias–variance, in order to directly investigate the estimation error (or quality) of an estimated query model with respect to the true query model. The estimation error or quality can be based on the divergence between the estimated query model

                         and the true query model θ

In Section 4.1, we give a brief introduction to some background knowledge of the general language modeling (LM) and query language modeling approaches. In Section 4.2, we first formulate the true query model, then present a systematic bias–variance analysis of various estimated query models which reflect different key factors that can affect the model estimation.

The query-likelihood (QL) approach (Ponte & Croft, 1998; Zhai & Lafferty, 2001) is a standard LM approach and uses the original query representation. It can be formulated as:

                        In practice, the documents in D are pseudo-relevant feedback documents, i.e., top-ranked documents retrieved by the QL model (as the first-round retrieval method). After the query expansion, the document ranking is based on the second-round retrieval using the expanded query model.

For any estimated query model, the document retrieval can be based on the negative KL-Divergence (Lafferty & Zhai, 2001) between the estimated query language model

Assuming that the true information need can be reflected or represented by the truly relevant documents, the true query language model should be generated from the truly relevant documents (see also the motivation behind the true query model in the literature review) as follows:

                              R
                            in Eq. (25) are uniform since they have the same relevance judgements (i.e., 1) given binary judgement values. We think this is a reasonable way of deriving the true query model for the purpose this paper.

We first describe various factors that have an influence on the query model estimation. First, the choice to use original query model or expanded query model would result in different kinds of estimated query models. Second, we consider different combinations (with different combination coefficients) of the original and expanded query models. Third, the change of document weight (in Eq. (23)) in RM can lead to different estimation for the query language model. At last, it is important whether or not we have part of true relevance information, e.g., relevance judgements, in building the expanded query models in Eq. (22).

The aforementioned factors actually correspond to the factors that can affect the bias and variance. In Section 3.1, we have mentioned three factors. They are model complexity, model design, and training data size. Regarding query model estimation, the difference between original model and expanded model is related to the model complexity. The expanded query model is often more complex in the sense that: (1) it adopts additional assumptions (Lavrenko & Croft, 2001), e.g., it assumes that the top-ranked documents are relevant and (2) it often involves more parameters, e.g., the number of expanded query terms or the number of feedback documents. The combination strategy and document weight issue are related to the model design. The use of true relevance information can be somewhat considered as use of training data. We emphasize that we do not incorporate any machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression or classification) in our current study.

We now briefly mention different estimated query models for which we will analyze. These models
                              6
                              Since our focus is the bias–variance analysis, we may only adopt some basic methods or simple versions of concerned models. This can help us reduce the number of parameters in the retrieval models and it is more feasible to adjust no more than one parameter at a time (if possible) to observe the trends of the changing bias and variance.

                            in RM (see Eq. (22)) represents a feedback-based expanded query model.

The expanded query model can usually outperform the original one in terms of the retrieval effectiveness over all queries. As a result, the performance bias of the expanded query model will be smaller than that of the original one. However, for some individual queries, the inclusion of non-relevant documents in pseudo-relevance feedback set can hurt the performance. Intuitively, a poor initial ranking (by original query) would include many non-relevant feedback documents that are mis-ranked highly. Therefore, for those queries with poor initial performance, query expansion is more likely to hurt the performance, than those queries with better initial performance. A possible consequence after query expansion is that a poor initial performance would become even worse, while a better initial performance would become even better. This can result in the performance variance of the expanded query model being bigger than that of the original one.

For the estimation bias–variance, recall that it is directly related to the divergence/similarity between the estimated query model and the true query model.

                           . In addition, due to the aforementioned scale difference, the KL-divergence-based estimation variance of the original query model can also be bigger than that of the expanded model. To sum up, in KL-divergence-based estimation bias–variance, the expanded query model often has smaller bias, and can also have smaller variance, compared with the original query model.

The trend of estimation bias–variance can be different when we use other divergence metrics, e.g., JS-divergence (JSD). JSD’s range is [0,1], which can be thought of as a normalized range of [0,+∞]. The range [0,1] is also the same as the range of retrieval performance (e.g., Average Precision (AP) or Precision). Therefore, it is more likely that the bias–variance tradeoff can occur in the estimation bias–variance using JS-divergence.

The combination between original and expanded query models was widely studied in the literature (Abdul-Jaleel et al., 2004; Li, 2008; Lv & Zhai, 2009; Tao & Zhai, 2006). Basically, the combination can be formulated as

                           . The combined query model in Eq. (26) is often referred to as RM3 (Abdul-Jaleel et al., 2004).

In Section 3.1, we mentioned that the combination method may reduce the bias and variance simultaneously. Therefore, it is expected that the combined query model

                            could reduce bias and variance simultaneously, if a proper combination coefficient λ is used. Here, we will investigate how the combined query model can reduce the bias and/or variance, for different kinds of bias–variance formulation.

For performance bias–variance, as discussed previously, one reason why the expanded query model has larger variance is that, for some queries, the performance can be hurt after query expansion when non-relevant terms are brought into query models. One solution can be combining it with the original query model, which can boost the weights of original query terms while reducing the influence of non-relevant terms in the expanded query model. This can actually prevent the query drifting from the underlying information need (Zighelnic & Kurland, 2008). If the downside performance can be prevented, this could reduce the variance of the expanded query model. On the other hand, the bias can also be reduced if the retrieval performance on average can be improved, given appropriate combination parameters. To sum up, the combined query model with a proper combination coefficient is expected to reduce both bias and variance, which balances the advantages and disadvantages of the original and expanded query models.

With regard to the estimation bias–variance, when λ is approaching 1, the combined query model is getting close to the original query model and will suffer from the sparsity problem as in the original query model. This can lead to not only the increasing bias but also the increasing variance (along with the increasing λ), as we discussed in Section 4.2.3.

Recall that in the true query model (see Eq. (25)), the document weights are kept uniform, leading to the most smooth document weight distribution. We think that it is worthwhile to investigate the bias–variance of the expanded query model with smoothed document weights.

To facilitate the investigation, we adopt a simple document weight smoothing method (Zhang, Song, Wang, Zhao, & Hou, 2011), which can be formulated as:

                            is the original document weight, and s(s
                           >0) is a parameter that controls the smooth degree of document weights. When s
                           =1, the document weights are unchanged. The larger the s is, the greater degree of the smoothing would be. For example, assuming the original weights are 0.6250 and 0.3750 for d
                           1 and d
                           2, and the parameter s is 3, then the smoothed document weights are 0.5425 and 0.4575, meaning the document weight distribution becomes more smooth.

Using the smoothed document weights, the estimated query model can be formulated as:

The above smoothing method can improve the document weight smoothness among relevant documents in the pseudo-relevant feedback (PRF) document set. The improved smoothness can also broaden the topic coverage of the expanded query, in order to prevent too many weights on the topics represented in topmost documents which might be non-relevant. It has been shown that properly smoothing the document weights (with moderate smoothing parameters) can improve the effectiveness (measured by MAP) of feedback-based query expansion (Zhang, Song, Zhao, & Hou, 2010, Zhang et al., 2011). On the other hand, for some individual queries, smoothing may affect the discriminativity between the relevant documents and non-relevant document in the PRF document set. For instance, if too much smoothing is imposed and the weights of every PRF documents are the same, no documents will have discriminative weights, even for the relevant ones. To sum up, smoothing the weights of feedback documents (with moderate smoothing parameters) can improve the retrieval effectiveness, but may hurt the performance for some individual queries, leading to the drop of retrieval stability. This then results in a performance bias–variance tradeoff.

The document weight smoothing can play a bigger role in reducing the estimation bias/variance, than in reducing the performance bias/variance. This is because the estimation bias/variance directly computes the estimation error of the estimated query model with respect to the true query model. In the true query model used in our analysis (see Eq. (25)), the weights of relevant documents are the same (i.e., very smooth). The smoothing method can improve the smoothness among relevant documents (in the feedback documents), which makes the estimated query model closer to the true one.

One of the reasons for the stability problem of query expansion is that the expanded query model is often generated from a mixture of relevant and non-relevant documents. As a result, the expanded query term distribution is actually a mixture distribution of relevant terms and non-relevant ones. It is argued, that the retrieval performance can be improved if one can remove the non-relevant distribution from the mixture distribution (Zhang, Hou, & Song, 2009). In accordance with the assumption in Zhang et al. (2009), we assume that part of non-relevance information is known. Specifically, we assume that a certain ratio (denoted as parameter r
                           
                              n
                           ) of non-relevant documents is known. We then derive an expanded query model based on RM with part of known non-relevant documents (denoted as D

                            is the original document weight computed by the normalized QL score (see Eq. (23)). Note that the non-relevant documents are selected in a top-down manner from the initial ranking of feedback documents, since the top non-relevant documents with bigger document weights have more influence on the query expansion.

As the parameter r
                           
                              n
                            increases, more non-relevant documents can be removed from the PRF document set, meaning the PRF documents are purer to be truly relevant. It also means that we have more relevance judgements as r
                           
                              n
                            increases. It is expected that as the parameter r
                           
                              n
                            increases, bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously, in terms of both performance bias–variance and estimation bias–variance.

Now, let us consider the idea of combining the use of both relevance information (Section 4.2.6) and document weight smoothing (Section 4.2.5). We then come up with the estimated query model as follows.

                              n

In this section, we are going to evaluate each estimated query model described in the previous section. We first summarize a number of hypotheses, drawing on the analysis in Section 4.2.


                        h1: For the original query model and the expanded model by RM, the performance bias–variance tradeoff will occur. The estimation bias–variance tradeoff may not occur when using KL-divergence.


                        h2: For the combined query model, the performance bias–variance tradeoff will occur. A proper combination coefficient can reduce the performance bias and variance simultaneously. The KL-divergence-based estimation bias–variance tradeoff may not occur.


                        h3: For the smoothed query model, the performance bias–variance tradeoff will occur. Compared with the performance bias and variance, the estimation bias–variance tradeoff is less likely to occur.


                        h4: For the expanded query model with available true relevance information (e.g., explicit relevance feedback
                           7
                           In this study, we are using the relevance judgements in the test collection to simulate the explicit relevance feedback of users.
                        
                        
                           7
                        ), the performance bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. The estimation bias and variance can be also reduced simultaneously.


                        h5: For the expanded query model with available true relevance information and document weight smoothing, there is a trend of performance bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. The estimation bias and variance can be also reduced simultaneously.

The factors which can affect bias and variance include not only various query model factors described in Section 4.2.2, but also the evaluation factors, e.g., different test query sets and test document collections. We will explain different observations on different evaluation factors in the experiments.

The evaluation involves four standard TREC collections, including WSJ (87–92, 173,252 documents), AP (88–89, 164,597 documents) in TREC Disk 1 & 2, ROBUST 2004 (528,155 documents) in TREC Disk 4 & 5, and WT10G (1,692,096 documents). These data sets involve a variety of texts, e.g., newswire articles and Web/blog data. Both WSJ and AP data sets are tested on queries 151–200, while the ROBUST 2004 and WT10G collections are tested on queries 601–700 and 501–550, respectively. The title field of the queries is used. Lemur 4.7 (Ogilvie & Callan, 2002) is used for indexing and retrieval. All collections are stemmed using the Porter stemmer and stop words are removed in the indexing process.

The first-round retrieval is carried out by a baseline language modeling (LM) approach, i.e., the query-likelihood (QL) model (Ponte & Croft, 1998; Zhai & Lafferty, 2001) as described in Eq. (21), which uses the original query model. The smoothing method for the document language model is the Dirichlet prior (Zhai & Lafferty, 2001) with fixed value μ
                        =700.

After the first-round retrieval, the top n ranked documents are selected as the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) documents for the query expansion task. We report the results with respect to n
                        =30. Nevertheless, we have similar observations on other n (e.g., 50, 70). The Relevance Model (RM) in Eq. (22), is used as the basic method for query expansion. The number of expanded terms is fixed as 100. For any query model (including the original one), 1000 documents are retrieved by the negative KL-divergence measure.

Average precision (AP) is used as the performance metric for each query q
                        
                           i
                        , and the mean average precision (MAP) is used to measure the retrieval effectiveness over a set of queries. Then, in Eq. (3), 
                           
                              E

                         represents MAP, and the larger MAP corresponds to the smaller performance bias

Another robustness metric, i.e., <Init in (Zighelnic & Kurland, 2008), which tests the percentage of queries for which the retrieval performance is worse than that of the initial ranking (i.e. QL), is also adopted for comparison. Init is dependent on the performance of original query model and thus is not applicable to the initial ranking (Zighelnic & Kurland, 2008). On the other hand, the summed metric

The estimation bias–variance directly tests the estimation quality of each query model with respect to the true query model. The evaluation metrics are the estimation bias and variance proposed in Section 3.3. Specifically, they are KL-divergence based

As we can see from Table 4
                           , on four collections, the expanded query models computed by RM are more effective than the original ones used in the query likelihood (QL) model. This can be observed from the experimental results, that RM significantly outperforms QL in MAP on every collection.

On the other hand, <Init shows that for at least 30% queries (or even 46% on WT10G), the MAP decreases after the query expansion. In addition, the variance of average precision (denoted as VAP) over different queries increases on each collection, meaning that query expansion hurts the retrieval stability. Therefore, we can verify that there is a tradeoff between the retrieval effectiveness and stability.

This tradeoff corresponds to the performance bias–variance tradeoff, which can be observed in Fig. 1
                           , where λ
                           =0 corresponds to the expanded query model by RM and λ
                           =1 to the original model in the combined query model (see Eq. (26)). This tradeoff supports our hypothesis h1 in Section 5.1.

Now, we look at the results of bias
                           2
                           +
                           var plotted in the first row of Fig. 1. As mentioned in Section 5.3, bias
                           2
                           +
                           var is robustness metric which considers both retrieval effectiveness and stability. It shows that the original query model is more robust than the expanded query model on WSJ8792, AP8889 and ROBUST2004. On WT10G, the original query model is slightly less robust than the expanded query model.

The robustness reflected by bias
                           2
                           +
                           var is different from the robustness reflected by another robustness metric <Init, which shows the percentage of queries for which the performance is worse than the initial ranking by original query model. Therefore, in any case, the <Init for the original query model will always be 0. This means that the original query model will always be the most robust query model, no matter how bad its MAP is. Therefore, the metric <Init, which is dependent on the initial ranking, is not applicable to the original query model.

Let us look at the results (shown in the second row of Fig. 1) concerning the additional bias–variance based on

                           ), in which the system variance of the (regularized) performance target has vanished. It shows that on all the four collections, the expanded query model (λ
                           =0) has smaller bias but larger variance, than the original query model (λ
                           =1). The above results show a clear tradeoff of the (additional) performance bias and variance based on

                            is mainly because of the sparsity of the original query model and the range of KL-divergence in [0,+∞] as we discussed in Section 4.2.3.

Here, we evaluate the combined query model,
                              8
                              This is often referred to as RM3 (Abdul-Jaleel et al., 2004).
                           
                           
                              8
                            which is the combination (see Eq. (26)) of the original query model (when λ
                           =1) and the expanded query model by RM (when λ
                           =0). The experimental results are shown in Fig. 1, where the parameter λ is the combination coefficient with respect to the original query model and λ is chosen from the interval [0,1].

In Fig. 1, as λ increases from 0 to 1 with increment 0.1, in most cases, the bias–variance tradeoff happens, evidenced by the fact that the bias and variance change in opposite trends in most cases. Only for a small λ (e.g., 0.1), both the bias and variance can be reduced. The above observation is consistent with our hypothesis h2 in Section 5.1.

The original query model only contains original query terms. Then, original query terms in the original query model have much bigger weights than those in the expanded query model. Therefore, a small λ (e.g., 0.1) can adjust the weights of original query terms in the expanded model, while preventing the expanded model from being dominated by original query terms. Evaluation results regarding the robustness metric bias

                           +
                           var in Fig. 1 also suggest that the combined query model with a small λ (e.g., 0.1) can be the most robust one among the models with different λ values.

Now, let us look at the results about the additional bias–variance based on

                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            in the second row of Fig. 1. The results shows similar trends with the bias–variance results based on AP, and support the hypothesis h2.

                            in Fig. 3, which shows a clear tradeoff on AP8889, ROBUST2004 and WT10G. This indicates that the bias–variance tradeoff is dependent on the scales of the corresponding metrics (see the discussions in Section 4.2.3).

Now, we evaluate the expanded query model by RM with smoothed document weights (described in Section 4.2.5). Recall that the bigger the smoothing parameter s is, the more smooth the document weights would be. For RM, we can consider its smoothing parameter s as 1, meaning the document weights remain unchanged. Therefore, RM corresponds the smoothed model when s
                           =1 in Fig. 4
                           .

Let us look at the performance bias–variance shown in Fig. 4, where parameter s is chosen from the range of [1,4] with the increment 0.3. Along with the increasing smoothing parameter s, the performance bias drops on WSJ8792 (s
                           <1.9), AP8889, ROBUST2004, and increases on WT10G. On the other hand, the performance variance increases on WSJ8792, AP8889 (s
                           >1.6) and ROBUST2004, and drops on WT10G. To sum up, we can observe a clear bias–variance tradeoff on each collection. The above evidence supports our hypothesis h3.

We now explain why the observations on WSJ8792, AP8889 and ROBUST2004 are different from those on WT10G. Smoothing can help improve the smoothness of relevant feedback documents in generating the estimated query model. Intuitively, a better initial ranking can have more relevant feedback documents, in which case the smoothing can be more helpful. The initial ranking performance averaged over all queries on WSJ8792, AP8889 and ROBUST2004 is better than that on WT10G (see MAP of QL in Table 4). Therefore, on the first three collections, it is more likely that smoothing can improve MAP and reduce performance bias.

Even if the mean performance on WSJ8792, AP8889 and ROBUST2004 is improved, the performance of some individual queries (with relatively poor initial ranking) can be hurt or cannot be improved. This can cause the instability of retrieval performance across queries and increase the performance variance on the three collections. We observe that higher variance of initial ranking performance over queries is more likely to cause the increasing performance variance (based on AP) of the expanded model in Fig. 4. The variances of the original query model (see VAP of QL in Table 4) on WSJ8792, AP8889 and ROBUST2004 are all higher than that on the WT10G.

Now, let us look at the results (shown in Fig. 4) related to the additional bias–variance based on 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             ρ
                                          
                                          
                                             ˆ
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . It shows that on ROBUST2004 and WT10G, the bias–variance tradeoff obviously occurs. On WSJ8792, compared with the RM-based expanded model (when s
                           =1), the smoothed query model (when s
                           <1.9) has a smaller bias but bigger variance, which also shows a tradeoff.

We now report the estimation bias–variance results plotted in Fig. 5
                           , where s
                           =1 corresponds to expanded query model by RM with its original document weights. Recall that the bigger the smoothing parameter s is, the more smoothing would be imposed on the document weights.

We observe that document weight smoothing can help reduce the estimation bias. Regarding the variance, Fig. 5 shows that as s increases, the variance almost remains unchanged. The above results support the hypothesis h3. As we explained in Section 4.2.5, document weight smoothing can play an important role in the reduction of estimation bias and variance.

In this subsection, we carry out experiments for the expanded query model by RM with part of non-relevant data available. According to Section 4.2.6. a certain percentage (denoted as r
                           
                              n
                           ) of non-relevant documents are assumed to be available and we simply remove those non-relevant documents (see Eq. (29)) in generating the query model. Thus, the expanded query model (by RM only) corresponds to the model when r
                           
                              n
                           
                           =0 in Fig. 6
                           , meaning that no non-relevant data is available.

Let us see the performance bias–variance plotted in the first row of Fig. 6, where parameter r
                           
                              n
                            is in the interval [0,1] with increment 0.1. It clearly shows that on WSJ8792, AP8889, ROBUST2004, performance bias and variance (based on AP) can be reduced simultaneously. The above evidences support our analysis in Section 4.2.6 and the hypothesis h4.

The trend of performance variance on WT10G is different from those on the first three collections. The initial ranking on the WT10G is poor (see MAP of QL in Table 4) and then for many queries there are a large number of non-relevant feedback documents in the feedback document set. For those queries, after removing some non-relevant ones, most remaining documents could be still non-relevant and the room for performance improvement is very small. Meanwhile, there may exist some other queries for which the performance improvement can be bigger. As a result, the performance variance will be increased.

For the robustness metric bias
                           2
                           +
                           var in Fig. 6, it also has a dropping trend on each collection, meaning that removing more non-relevant documents have a good combined effect of effectiveness and stability on each collection.

Let us also look at the results (shown in the second row of Fig. 6) regarding the additional bias–variance based on 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             ρ
                                          
                                          
                                             ˆ
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . It shows that on all the four collections, the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously, which supports the hypothesis h4.

Now, we evaluate the estimation bias and variance of the expanded query model by RM with non-relevant documents available. The results are plotted in Fig. 7
                           . It is expected, that by increasing r
                           
                              n
                            (i.e., removing more non-relevant documents in RM), the estimation quality of the estimated query model can be improved. Note that the expanded query model by RM corresponds to the r
                           
                              n
                           
                           =0, meaning that no non-relevant data is used. In Fig. 7, 
                              
                                 Bias
                                 (
                                 
                                    
                                       η
                                    
                                    
                                       ^
                                    
                                 
                                 )
                              
                            first drops and then increases, and 
                              
                                 Var
                                 (
                                 
                                    
                                       η
                                    
                                    
                                       ^
                                    
                                 
                                 )
                              
                            has a increasing trend, along with the increasing r
                           
                              n
                           . This result does not support the hypothesis h4, which states that the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously.

Note that the true query model used for estimation bias–variance evaluation is derived from all the truly relevant documents (see Section 4.2.1), except for the results in Fig. 8
                           . In Fig. 8, we use truly relevant feedback documents as the D
                           
                              R
                            in Eq. (25) to generate the true query model, which shows that the estimation bias and variance can be often reduced simultaneously.

The above results show that as r
                           
                              n
                            increases, the estimated query model will gradually get closer to the true query model based on relevant feedback documents, but may get far away from the true query model based on all relevant documents. In other words, the estimated query model can over-fit the relevant feedback documents, but may not fit the other relevant documents which do not occur in the feedback document set.

Now, we evaluate the query model described in Eq. (30) in Section 4.2.7. This query model integrates the use of removing all the non-relevant documents and smoothing document weights.


                           Fig. 9
                            shows performance bias–variance results. From the first row of Fig. 9, we observe that when s starts to increase, the performance variance (based on AP) can increase a little bit on WSJ8792, ROBUST2004 and WT10G. This is because when s starts to increase, for some queries, the performance improvements are slow, while for other queries, the improvements can be relatively rapid, leading to the slightly increased VAP. However, as we can see from Fig. 9, there is a clear drop of performance variance when s
                           >1.6 on WSJ8792, s
                           >2.2 on ROBUST2004 and s
                           >1.3 on WT10G. With respect to the performance bias, it has a clear decreasing trend on all collections. Therefore, the performance bias and variance (based on AP) can be simultaneously reduced, which supports the hypothesis h5. Fig. 9 also shows that as s increases, bias
                           2
                           +
                           var keeps dropping.

Let us observe the results of additional performance bias–variance based on

                                             ˆ
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            in the second row of Fig. 9. As s increases, there is an obvious trend that bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously on each test collection. This observation can support the hypothesis h5.

The experimental results in Fig. 10
                            show that as the smoothing parameter s increases, the estimation bias

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we propose a novel bias–variance analysis framework to study the tradeoff between the retrieval effectiveness and stability of query language modeling approaches in the pseudo relevance feedback context. Specifically, we propose a performance bias–variance formulation. This enables us to better analyze and understand the retrieval performance using the bias–variance analysis, which is a fundamental theory in machine learning and statistical estimation. We also go beyond the retrieval performance by directly measuring how closely an estimated query model can approach the true query model derived from the truly relevant documents. This leads to the estimation bias–variance formulation, which is based on the divergence between the estimated query model and the true query model.

Based on four query modeling factors, i.e., query model complexity, query model combination, document weight smoothness and non-relevant documents removal, we analyze a number of representative query model estimation methods and present five hypotheses based on our analysis. In order to test the hypotheses, we then construct a systematic evaluation on four TREC datasets. Experimental results of the performance bias–variance (based on AP and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          ρ
                                       
                                       
                                          ˆ

                        ) generally support the hypotheses. This shows that the tradeoff between retrieval effectiveness and stability can be studied through the perspective of bias–variance tradeoff. In the experiments, we have explained when the bias–variance tradeoff can occur, and when the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. For example, in Section 4.2.4 and Section 5.4.2, we have explained why the performance bias–variance tradeoff will occur, and why a proper combination coefficient (e.g., λ
                        =0.1) can reduce the performance bias and variance simultaneously.

The experimental results of the estimation bias–variance support the hypotheses h1−
                        h3, but do not support the hypotheses h4−
                        h5. The hypotheses h1−
                        h3 are about whether or not the bias–variance tradeoff will occur, and h4−
                        h5 are about when the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. The results in Section 5.4.4 show that the non-relevant documents removal cannot reduce the estimation bias and variance simultaneously. As we explained, for some queries, this strategy may over-fit the relevant feedback documents, but may not fit the other documents that do not appear in the feedback document set, thus can move away from the true query model defined in Eq. (25). After we have removed all non-relevant documents in the feedback document set, we then use the document weight smoothing to improve the estimation quality. The corresponding results in Section 5.4.5 show that the estimation bias can be reduced, while the estimation variance almost remains unchanged. The total estimation error (summed over the estimation bias and variance) can be reduced by the document weight smoothing method.

The above observations show that improving retrieval performance do not guarantee the improvement of the estimation quality. For example, in Section 5.4.4, in addition to the different trends between the performance bias/variance and estimation bias/variance, the trends of the overall retrieval performance (reflected by the sum of the performance bias and variance) are different from the trends of the overall estimation quality (reflected by the sum of the estimation and variance). This could lead to a future research direction to analyze the estimation quality of the query language modeling, rather than the retrieval performance only.

This research may potentially lead to a novel evaluation strategy. Specifically, the estimation bias–variance formulation can provide novel metrics (e.g., estimation bias and estimation variance) to evaluate the estimation quality with respect to the true query model. In addition, the summed quantity of performance bias and performance variance (see Eq. (6)) can be a kind of robustness metric. We carried out a preliminary exploration on the bias–variance decomposition of the overall retrieval performance (taking into account both retrieval effectiveness and stability) based on Average Precision (AP) (Zhang, Song, Wang, & Hou, 2013). One may introduce different weights for bias and variance respectively, in the summation of them, to reflect how the retrieval robustness should be decomposed differently in different scenarios. Moreover, we will investigate other performance metrics (e.g., logAP) in the performance bias–variance analysis.

Based on the proposed bias–variance analysis and evaluation methodology, we can study other query language model estimation methods (e.g., models in (Collins-Thompson, 2009b; Dillon & Collins-Thompson, 2010; Lv et al., 2011)). The proposed bias–variance analysis could also be applied to study the bias–variance of other IR models in terms of their retrieval effectiveness and stability. For instance, we may be able to study the model complexity of other IR models (e.g., ranking functions). The combination of two query models can be extended to the combination/ensemble of multiple (tens or hundreds) rankers in the web search scenario. In machine learning, ensemble learners can reduce both bias and variance simultaneously. In principle, the ensemble learners correspond to the combined rankers. As another example, the document weight smoothness can be related to the diversity of topic coverage of feedback documents. Further, we may explore non-relevant documents removal in the implicit feedback or interactive feedback scenario.

Moreover, we can explicitly formulate the bias–variance for the social and personalized search where the tradeoff between the mean effectiveness over a collective user population and the variance across individual users needs to be balanced and properly modeled. We expect that the bias–variance analysis proposed in this paper can potentially serve as a start point for the above interesting research directions.
