                  Background
                  Recently there have been several clinical MR perfusion studies in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who may suffer from myocardial ischemia due to coronary microvascular dysfunction. In these studies, data analysis relied on a manual procedure of tracing epicardial and endocardial borders. The goal of this work is to develop and validate a robust semi-automated analysis method for myocardial perfusion quantification in clinical HCM data.
               
               
                  Method
                  Dynamic multi-slice stress perfusion MRI data were acquired from 18 HCM patients. The proposed semi-automated method required user input of two landmark selections: LV center point and RV insertion point. Automated segmentations of the endocardial and epicardial borders were performed in three short-axis slices using distance regularized level set evolution on RV, LV, and myocardial enhancement frames.
               
               
                  Results
                  The proposed automated epicardial border detection method resulted in average radial distance errors of 7.5%, 9.5%, and 11.6% in basal, mid, and apical slices, respectively, when compared to manual tracing of the borders as a reference. In linear regression analysis, the highest correlation of myocardial upslope measurements was observed between the manual method and the proposed method in the anterolateral section (r=0.964), and the lowest correlation was observed in the inferoseptal section (r=0.866).
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The proposed semi-automated method for myocardial MR perfusion quantification is feasible in HCM patients who typically show (1) irregular myocardial shape and (2) low image contrast between the myocardium and its surrounding regions due to coronary microvascular disease.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

First pass myocardial perfusion MRI is a powerful, non-invasive technique that is capable of identifying ischemic regions in the myocardium using an extracellular contrast agent [1]. The imaging typically involves pharmacologic adenosine stress which induces vasodilation of the coronary arteries for increased blood flow in the myocardium. Patients with epicardial coronary artery stenosis or microvascular disease are subject to inducible ischemia during adenosine stress. Dynamic T1-weighted gradient echo imaging sequence can visualize ischemic regions in the myocardium after injection of a bolus of T1-shortening gadolinium-based contrast agent.

Visual assessment of hypoenhanced myocardium in stress perfusion MR images is a simple and subjective method for the diagnosis of perfusion defect. Quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion may be preferable for the objective assessment of perfusion deficit and for longitudinal studies of myocardial tissue perfusion changes with therapeutic interventions. As first pass myocardial perfusion data consist of multi-slice dynamic image frames, quantitative analysis using manual procedures is laborious and time-consuming.

Several image segmentation techniques have been proposed for the goal of efficient quantification of myocardial perfusion [2–8]. Weng et al. proposed a semi-automated technique in which myocardial segmentation was based on morphological region growing of a ring around the LV blood pool [5]. The method involved manual procedures of selecting four representative image frames (i.e., baseline image, RV enhancement image, LV enhancement image, and myocardial enhancement image). The selection of the frames may not be trivial, involving a navigation of approximately 20 frames during the first pass of the contrast agent. Tarroni et al. proposed a semi-automated technique which was based on a modified active contour model that considered noise statistics of the myocardium and blood pool [2]. The technique involved user selections of the LV point and RV insertion point. The best frame for segmentation was automatically selected in the frame in which the intensity inside the LV cavity reaches 95% of its maximum [2]. Model-based methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of myocardial segmentation but are not entirely automated in the sense that they require manual procedures in the training steps for parameter estimation [3,8].

The level set framework [9] has been widely used for medical image segmentation. It introduces a topological level set function as parameters in the energy minimization problem. The minimization process of the energy functional is iterative. It promotes the attraction of the evolving contour (i.e., zero level set) to the desired edges. A primary advantage of level set methods is their flexibility in splitting and merging the zero level contours. Initialization of the zero level set needs to be adequately chosen, and re-initialization is often necessary for improving the stability and accuracy of boundary detection. Level set methods have been demonstrated for semi-automated or automated segmentation in a variety of medical imaging research fields [10–12].

In this work we apply a level set method to clinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. HCM is a genetic heart disease, is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults, and is also a cause of heart failure [13]. Clinical cases of HCM show a variety of myocardial thickening patterns (e.g., asymmetrical shape of the myocardium, septal hypertrophy, and apical hypertrophy) as shown in 
                     Fig. 1 and manifest blunt response of myocardial contrast uptake. Myocardial perfusion quantification has been performed on HCM patients in the literature [14–17]. The reasons for selecting HCM patients are twofold. First, to our knowledge, no studies investigating methods for automated segmentation of myocardial perfusion in HCM have been reported in the literature. Second, HCM perfusion data have more pixels in the myocardial wall than normal volunteers׳ perfusion data. The wider spacing between the endocardium and epicardium in HCM may facilitate the demonstration of our novel segmentation method. In our study, perfusion MRI data have an in-plane spatial resolution of 2.5–3.0mm, which is relatively lower than the in-plane spatial resolution (1.3–1.7mm) of cine MRI data, and the normal myocardium typically has the thickness of 2–4 pixels in diastole.

In this study we demonstrate a semi-automated analysis method for quantifying myocardial upslope during first pass in stress perfusion MRI in HCM. The method involves a minimal level of user interaction (i.e., selections of RV insertion point and LV center point). For automated segmentation we utilize the distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE) method [18] in multiple image frames of interest for robust detection of the myocardium. Finally, we provide a regional analysis of myocardial upslope, which is a standard semi-quantitative measure in myocardial perfusion. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method in 18 HCM patients.

MRI experiments were performed on a 1.5T scanner (Siemens Avanto, Erlangen, Germany). A body coil was used for radiofrequency (RF) transmission, and a 32-channel phased-array receiver coil was used for RF signal reception. The cardiac MR protocol included (1) cine imaging, (2) stress perfusion imaging, and (3) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. For stress perfusion imaging, adenosine was injected at 0.14mgkg−1
                        ming−1 for 3min before perfusion imaging and the adenosine infusion continued during perfusion imaging [19]. A single bolus of Gd-DTPA was injected into the subject׳s antecubital vein. The subject was scanned immediately after the injection of a dose of 0.1mmol/kg gadobutrol (Gadovist; Bayer Heatlthcare, Berlin, Germany) at an injection rate of 4ml/s, followed by a 40ml saline flush. The MRI operator instructed the subject to hold his or her breath immediately when the right ventricle (RV) started to become bright. The stress perfusion scan was electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated and lasted for 80 heart beats.

Clinical MR examinations were approved by our institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to MR examinations. The diagnosis of HCM was based on Doppler echocardiography according to the criteria of diastolic wall thickness >1.5cm. We considered 18 HCM patients (16 male and 2 female) for image analysis. All subjects underwent stress perfusion MRI in our institution during the period of 2014–2015. Subjects׳ ages ranged from 38 years to 71 years (mean age=54.8 years). Male subjects׳ ages ranged from 38 years to 71 years (mean age=53.7 years). Female subjects׳ ages were 60 years and 67 years (mean age=63.5 years).

Fast gradient echo sequence with saturation preparation was used for myocardial perfusion imaging. Imaging sequence parameters were as follows: imaging flip angle=15°, in-plane resolution=2.5mm×3.0mm, slice thickness=8mm, acquisition matrix size=160×104, number of image frames=80, time interval between saturation preparation and the time point where the central k-space line is acquired=100ms, phase encoding order=linear, echo time=1.25ms, field-of-view=400mm×315mm, and slice-to-slice acquisition time interval=170ms. Parallel imaging [20] with an acceleration factor of 2 was used to reduce the acquisition window. Four short-axis slices (sequentially from the most basal slice to the most apical slice of the myocardium with a slice interval of 14.4–17.6mm) were acquired in every R–R interval, and three short-axis slices except for the most apical slice were considered for image analysis.

Image analysis was performed in a MATLAB programming environment (version 2014b, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) on a 64-bit Microsoft Windows 8.1 operating system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz and 16GB RAM. Acquired perfusion images were pre-processed: motion correction was performed to align the short axis heart images across frames [21], and intensity correction was performed to correct for image intensity inhomogeneity caused by the coil sensitivity variation. Although we acquired four short axis slices, we excluded the most apical slice due to its small size of the myocardium and considered the analysis of the remaining three short axis slices which were referred to as basal (or slice 1), mid (or slice 2), and apical (or slice 3) slices in this study. 
                     Fig. 2 shows a flowchart of our analysis method.

An RV peak enhancement frame was selected automatically as described in

After the identification of the fat region followed by the substitution of zero values, we could identify the location of maximum intensity in the RV. The location of maximum intensity served as a seed point (see Fig. 3d) for region growing in the RV blood pool. An RV peak enhancement frame was determined by finding a maximum frame index in the RV time intensity curve (see Fig. 3e).

Manual procedures involved the selection of two points, each corresponding to the LV center point and RV insertion point. An image denoising algorithm was performed using anisotropic diffusion [22], and then a seeded region growing algorithm [23] was performed to increase the number of voxels in LV. The average image intensity of the LV voxels increased the signal to noise ratio in the LV time–intensity curve, from which a frame index of the LV maximum intensity was obtained. A frame index of myocardial enhancement was determined to be 8 frames later than the LV peak enhancement frame. The line connecting the RV insertion point and the LV center point was drawn, and then 6 equally angular sectors were determined for segmental analysis of myocardial perfusion (see 
                        Fig. 4). We divided the myocardium into 6 segments for segmental analysis because this number has been commonly adopted for the basal or mid-short axis slice in the cardiac imaging community [24].

An accurate placement of seed points in the myocardium is important when using a level set based algorithm for myocardial segmentation. An automated placement of seed points in the myocardium consisted of the following steps. First, the LV blood pool was segmented using a seeded region growing with the LV center as a seed point. The region growing segmentation resulted in the segmented voxels having a value of 1 and the un-segmented voxels having a value of 0. The segmented voxels were expanded using a morphological operation of image dilation (see 
                        Fig. 5b) such that the boundary of the expanded mask lay in the myocardium. The outermost voxels in the segmented mask were selected with an angle spacing of roughly 360°/(the number of seeds) to distribute the seed points uniformly in the myocardium. We noted that when seed points are distributed uniformly in the myocardium, the pixel distance between adjacent seed points increases as the distance from the LV center to the seed point increases. To maintain the pixel distance regardless of the distance from the LV center, we chose the number of seed points to be proportional to the periphery length of the myocardium

Image segmentation was performed using the distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE) method proposed by Li et al. [18]. Previous level set methods often apply re-initialization of the zero level set in an ad-hoc way and evolve the zero level set to the object boundaries. DRLSE introduces a distance regularization term in the energy functional to maintain the desired shape of level set function. The distance regularization term is minimized when the gradient magnitude of the level set function is 1 at the zero level set, and the external energy term is minimized when the zero level set is located at the object boundaries. This is advantageous compared to other previous level set methods because the distance regularization term maintains a desirable property of signed distance function in the level set function as the level set evolves, and there is no need for re-initialization of the zero level set.

Endocardial border detection was performed on an LV peak enhancement frame using DRLSE [18]. The initial seed points in the myocardium underwent region growing and resulted in initial contours for the DRLSE algorithm. Iteration numbers and parameter values for the DRLSE algorithm were determined empirically. In the LV peak enhancement frame, the LV blood pool appears bright, and the myocardium appears dark. The DRLSE segmentation resulted in a ring shape covering the myocardium (see Fig. 5d). The endocardial border was reliably detected due to high contrast between the LV blood pool and myocardium. On the resulting ring shaped binary image, we performed seeded region growing where the seed point was located at the LV center point. The region growing produced a binary mask, the edge of which was a final endocardial border (see Fig. 5g). This approach can exclude the papillary muscle in final myocardial segmentation.

The RV enhancement frame and myocardial enhancement frame were both considered for the epicardial border detection. We applied the DRLSE to these two frames of interest individually and then obtained a segmentation result (see Fig. 5h) after taking the intersection of segmented voxels. With the LV center point as an origin, angular sectors with an angle spacing of 9° were defined. A voxel of maximum radial distance from the origin within each sector was found, and then the vertices with maximum radial distance in all of the sectors were connected such that an epicardial boundary of polygonal shape was obtained. Similarly, an endocardial border was constructed from the segmented mask of the LV blood pool (see Fig. 5g). The final segmented myocardium was obtained as the subtraction of a set of voxels within the endocardial polygon from a set of voxels within the epicardial polygon.

In four HCM patients with severe hypertrophied myocardium, the LV blood pool was not observed in slice 2 or slice 3 due to wall thickening of hypertrophied myocardium during data acquisition in systole. The RV blood pool was not observed in slice 2 or slice 3. The proposed algorithm was further refined in order to handle these special cases and properly identify myocardial segments (see Fig. 2). An absence of the RV blood pool was detected when the average intensity after region growing with an automatically chosen seed point was smaller than 60 % of the average intensity of the RV region of interest (ROI) in slice 1. An absence of the LV blood pool was detected when the LV center point has an intensity of less than 60 % of the average intensity of the LV ROI in slice 1. In case of the absence of the LV blood pool, a circle with a radius of 20 pixels centered at the LV center point was drawn automatically, and it served as the endocardial boundary. The epicardial boundary was detected using the DRLSE on a myocardial enhancement image frame.

To assess the performance of the proposed segmentation method, one trained expert with 11 years of experience in MR image analysis conducted manual tracings of epicardial and endocardial borders twice. The epicardial (or endocardial) discordance of boundaries (DB) between the manual and automated segmentation methods was estimated as the mean of absolute differences of point-by-point radial distances from the LV center point, normalized by the mean of radial distances in the manual segmentation [25], as described in Eq (4)

From the locations of the LV center point and RV insertion point, the myocardium in each slice was automatically divided into 6 equally angular segments (see 
                        Figs. 4 and 6a) similar to the standardized myocardial 16-segment model [24]. For each time frame, the signal intensity of the LV cavity ROI was obtained after averaging image pixel values in the LV cavity ROI. Similarly, for each time frame, the signal intensity of a myocardial segment was obtained after averaging image pixel values in the myocardial segment. Time intensity curves were obtained for the LV cavity and the 6 myocardial segments in each slice. A temporal median filter with a filter length of 6 was applied to the myocardial time intensity curve to reduce noise fluctuation in the curve while preserving the slope of the curve. As shown in Fig. 6b, the upslope was calculated as follows. First, the LV slope was computed during the first pass of contrast uptake in the LV time intensity curve. Second, the myocardial slope was computed during the first pass of contrast uptake in the myocardial time intensity curve. Finally, the upslope was calculated by taking the ratio of the myocardial slope to the LV slope. The proposed automated method was compared with the manual method using Student׳s t test analysis and linear regression analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients and estimates of the slope and y-intercept were computed. P-values<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                     
                     Table 1 compares the performance of the proposed method and two previous methods in the literature (i.e., Weng et al.׳s morphological region growing method [5] and Tarroni et al.׳s active contour method [2]) in myocardial segmentation. Mean epicardial DB, mean endocardial DB, and mean DSC values were computed from the three slices of all patients except for the severe HCM cases who showed no LV or RV blood pools in mid or apical slices. The proposed DRLSE segmentation method showed the lowest DB error in detection of the epicardial border, while the morphological region growing method showed the lowest DB error in detection of the endocardial border. Mean DSC values in decreasing order were 0.853 in the proposed method, 0.787 in the active contour method, and 0.740 in the morphological region growing method. 
                     Fig. 7 shows an example of segmentation results for the three automated methods. Fig. 7a indicates that the morphological region growing method lacks in accuracy in epicardial border detection since it maintains the myocardial thickness in the asymmetrically shaped myocardium (i.e., the anterolateral region is relatively thicker than the septal region). Fig. 7b and c shows comparable border detection results, except for the underestimation of the epicardial boundary in the anterolateral region in Fig. 7b.


                     
                     Fig. 8 shows representative examples of epicardial boundaries when using the proposed segmentation and manual segmentation. The epicardial boundaries are clearly superimposed in the septal and lateral regions of interest. Note the overestimation of the boundaries in low contrast regions such as the inferior and anterior segments (for example, slice 2 of HCM 11). The underestimation of the epicardial boundary detection in slice 3 of HCM 18 may be attributed to poor image quality due to the slice location close to the apex.


                     
                     Fig. 9 shows representative examples of endocardial boundaries using the proposed segmentation and manual segmentation. Significant overlaps of the two boundaries are observed in slice 1 of all three subjects. High accuracy of border detection in slice 1 may be attributed to the fact that in slice 1 the images show the depiction of smooth endocardial boundary as well as the appearance of no papillary muscles in the LV blood pool. Slices 2 and 3 show smaller areas of the LV blood pool than slice 1.

The epicardial and endocardial boundary detection errors were each estimated using the radial distance error metric described in Eq (4). 
                     Table 2 contains mean (±S.D.) values of radial distance errors of the epicardial and endocardial boundaries in 18 HCM patients. The errors in both epicardial and endocardial boundaries were smaller in slice 1 (i.e., basal slice) than slice 2 or slice 3. As shown in Table 2, mean (±S.D.) values of the Dice similarity coefficient in 18 HCM patients were 0.854 (±0.045), 0.888 (±0.035), and 0.863 (±0.040) for slices 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the 1st trial, and were 0.855 (±0.040), 0.873 (±0.043), and 0.853 (± 0.032) for slices 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the 2nd trial. The lowest Dice similarity coefficient was 0.729 in slice 1 in HCM subject 1. The highest Dice similarity coefficient was 0.936 in slice 2 in HCM subject 18.


                     
                     Fig. 10 displays linear regression analysis results for six myocardial segments. For each segment, the plot shows 54 samples (i.e., 3 slices/patient×18HCM patients) in (x, y) coordinates and the regression line. The manual and proposed methods produced comparable upslope results. Mean (±S.D.) upslope values obtained from the manual vs. proposed method in the 1st trial were 0.181 (±0.044) vs. 0.179 (±0.044), P=0.777 in the anterior segment, 0.198 (±0.051) vs. 0.199 (±0.050), P=0.924 in the anteroseptal segment, 0.170 (±0.048) vs. 0.171 (±0.046), P=0.901 in the inferoseptal segment, 0.152 (±0.034) vs. 0.142 (±0.038), P=0.177 in the inferior segment, 0.146 (±0.038) vs. 0.146 (±0.036), P=0.984 in the inferolateral segment, and 0.159 (±0.038) vs. 0.158 (±0.040), P=0.913 in the anterolateral segment. The difference between upslope measurements obtained from the two methods was not statistically significant in any myocardial segment. 
                     Table 3 shows results of linear regression analysis of the upslope measurements. The highest correlation was observed between the manual method and the proposed method in the anterolateral segment (average r=0.964), and the lowest correlation was observed in the inferoseptal segment (average r=0.866).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We have proposed a new semi-automated analysis approach for regionally quantifying myocardial upslope from dynamic contrast enhanced myocardial stress perfusion MRI data and have demonstrated its feasibility in clinical HCM data. The primary feature of the method is automated segmentation and robust analysis of the regional myocardial upslope after a minimal level of user input with two landmark selections: RV insertion point and LV center point. A method for automated detection of RV insertion point and LV point was demonstrated in previous work [7]. However, it was challenging in our study to make automated selections of RV insertion point and LV center point accurate and robust in HCM patients with severe hypertrophied myocardium. In this work we demonstrated the performance by comparing myocardial upslope measurements during the first pass. Alternatively, one can demonstrate comparisons of results on absolute quantification such as myocardial blood flow (MBF). It is important to note that the focus in this work was to compare the manual and proposed methods rather than to assess perfusion abnormalities by MBF.

The DRLSE algorithm showed good performance in detecting the myocardial boundaries. When the DRLSE segmentation method was compared with Weng et al.׳s region growing method, it was obviously more accurate in detecting the epicardial border in cases where the myocardial thickness was asymmetric. It was noted that some cases of low contrast edges, for example, the inferior segment of the myocardium, are prone to overestimation of the epicardial boundary due to (1) low contrast between the inferior myocardium and its surrounding tissue (e.g., liver) and (2) DRLSE׳s tendency of fast contour evolution in low contrast regions. Adjustment of regularization parameters was necessary, and the parameter selection was empirically made based on the myocardial signal intensity. The final epicardial boundary sometimes appeared irregular, and this was discordant with the known property of smoothness in the epicardial boundary. The boundary regularization technique introduced in [2] resulted in a smooth depiction of the epicardial boundary, and an addition of the boundary regularization routine in DRLSE will be considered for implementation as future work.

In our work, myocardial perfusion images are registered frame-by-frame prior to the segmentation. For the detection of the epicardial boundary, our method takes the intersection of segmented voxels from an RV enhancement frame and a myocardial enhancement frame. Hence, the segmentation relies on the performance of the image registration. If the registration was not successful in aligning the myocardium between an RV enhancement frame and a myocardial enhancement frame, for example, due to the patient׳s severe breathing motion, it would result in errors in the boundary detection.

Slices 2 and 3 showed larger radial distance percentage errors than slice 1 regarding the endocardial border detection. The larger errors in slices 2 and 3 are potentially due to the smaller size of the LV blood pool than slice 1 and jagged appearance of the endocardial wall compared to the smooth endocardial wall of slice 1. Because of the smaller size of the LV cavity in slices 2 and 3 than slice 1, the larger errors in the detected endocardial border in slices 2 and 3 did not significantly contribute to reductions in the Dice similarity coefficient measurements. Despite the smaller errors in slice 1, mean DSC of slice 1 was comparable to those of slices 2 and 3 (see Table 2).

We have tested the automated segmentation method on HCM patients whose LV myocardium is thicker than that of normal volunteers. It is important to note that the errors in boundary detection would have less effect on perfusion quantification errors when the LV myocardium is relatively thicker. It is worth investigating the effect of boundary detection errors on perfusion quantification errors and comparing it between the normal myocardium and thickened myocardium. This investigation remains as future work.

A drawback of the proposed DRLSE segmentation method is its slow processing time. It took approximately 1min per slice on average, and most of the time was spent during the DRLSE algorithm run. The processing time was roughly proportional to the iteration number used in the DRLSE algorithm. Investigations of a trade-off between segmentation accuracy and reduction of the iteration number would be necessary.

The perfusion MR acquisition protocol used in this work acquired each slice in a different cardiac phase. For example, slice 1 was acquired during diastole, and slice 2 was acquired during systole. Recent literature reports that myocardial blood flow varies depending on whether it is diastole or systole [27]. Future work will apply an accelerated 3D encoded perfusion MRI to achieve perfusion quantification of the entire LV myocardium in a single cardiac phase (e.g., end-systole, mid-diastole) [27]. It would be straightforward to apply the proposed semi-automated analysis method to dynamic 3D perfusion datasets which would have 8–12 short-axis slices.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have demonstrated the feasibility of a semi-automated analysis method for MR perfusion quantification in HCM patients. The proposed method requires user input of selections of RV insertion point and LV center point, and then it automatically segments the myocardium using DRLSE while handling the case of the absence of LV blood pool due to wall thickening of the hypertrophied myocardium. Regional quantification of myocardial upslope using the proposed method is in good agreement with the manual method.
