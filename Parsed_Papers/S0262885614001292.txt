                  This paper presents an unsupervised deep learning framework that derives spatio-temporal features for human–robot interaction. The respective models extract high-level features from low-level ones through a hierarchical network, viz. the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), providing at the same time a solution to the curse of dimensionality in shallow techniques. The presented work incorporates the tensor-based framework within the operation of the nodes and, thus, enhances the feature derivation procedure. This is due to the fact that tensors allow the preservation of the initial data format and their respective correlation and, moreover, attain more compact representations. The computational nodes form spatial and temporal groups by exploiting the multilinear algebra and subsequently express the samples according to those groups in terms of proximity. This generic framework may be applied in a diverse of visual data, while it has been examined on sequences of color and depth images, exhibiting remarkable performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A prerequisite of the human–robot interaction is the ability of the robot to comprehend the respective inputs given by humans. Similarly to humans, the most intensive sensory input of a robot is the visual one. The latter suggests that the robots should collaborate with humans they ought to be endowed with subsystems suitable for action, gesture or even emotion recognition. An interest point for such desired recognition tasks is the fact that the corresponding data encapsulate both spatial and temporal information. The temporal dimension of those problems may be administered in an appropriate manner and, consequently, the utilization of mainstream algorithms that are suitable for object recognition is considered to be improper for the aforementioned tasks.

A well-known approach to deal with video sequences is to utilize motion descriptors [1–5], however the formation of Bag-of-Words models does not preserve the temporal coherence. A solution to the latter disadvantage can be provided by deep learning architectures, where the acquisition of spatio-temporal contingencies and, thus, the derivation of respective features are considered to be an indispensable goal. Deep learning is an emerging area in the field of machine learning and its stepping stone are contemporary neuroscience discoveries concerning the representation of information and the feature derivation. More precisely, the findings in Ref. [6] suggest that the neocortex in mammals does not process the sensory input data in a shallow manner, but they traverse through a composite multi-layered structure of computational units which, through repetition, learn to express the signals according to the consistencies they display. Additionally, the works in Ref. [7,8] provide affirmation for the existence of a mutual cortical architecture, not only between different modalities such as visual, auditory and somatosensory, but also among other species. The deep learning models have already been applied in a diversity of recognition tasks namely object recognition [9–12], human tracking [13], segmentation [14], brain–computer interaction (BCI) [15] and in action recognition [16–18] exhibiting remarkable performance.

Tensor or multilinear algebra can provide a complete mathematical framework for analyzing the multifactor formation of image and video sets. Moreover, it administers methodologies for decomposing such sets and, thus, unfolding the factors or modes. Similarly to matrices which are considered to be linear operators over a vector space, tensors constitute multilinear operators over a set of vector spaces. Consequently, linear analysis is a special case of tensor analysis which offers a generalized mathematical framework appropriate to confront a plethora of machine learning problems. However, the vectorization of a tensor neglects the proximity information, i.e. when a video sample is processed, a patch of pixels is separated from its neighbor ones and, therefore, lacks spatio-temporal coherence. Additionally, the vectorization procedure, besides the fact that stacks the rows or columns of the original tensorial samples in an inconsistent manner, also leads to the formation of high dimensionality vectors. Thus, combining the high dimensional data representation with the small number of data samples conducts to small size problems, able to be competently handled by tensors [19]. Tensor based frameworks maintain most of the authentic constraints of the data and, thus, they are in position to improve the characterization or classification of them. Especially in the case where the number of training samples is restricted, the constraints aid the derivation of a reasonable solution in such problems. The second and the third order tensors suffice to describe image and video samples, respectively.

The motivation of the proposed model relies on three main facts, as follows. Firstly, tensor based approaches avoid over-training, especially in small size problems [20]. The over-training occurs in most deep architectures and further measures should be considered, which attempt to confine such phenomena [21]. Secondly, multilinear algebra reduces the computational complexity and the requirements in terms of memory [22,23]. Such considerations are frequently encountered in deep learning models thus, cost expensive solutions, namely the developing of computing clusters with thousands of machines are performed [24]. Last, with the aim to reduce the number of parameters that have to be estimated, multilinear units are more efficient than vectorized non-linear ones.

This paper presents an unsupervised deep learning methodology inspired by the HTM notion [25,26], i.e. a network of computational nodes, placed in a tree shaped hierarchy and divided into distinguished levels. Each of these nodes incorporates notions from tensor algebra to infer spatio-temporal features. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to graft tensor based approaches in such architectures. The insight behind this approach is the avoidance of high dimensionality feature vectors appearing in previous HTM architectures [25,11,26,12], thus, resulting to more efficient method in terms of data representation and classification accuracy. The experimental evaluation procedure justifies this insight in terms of classification accuracy. The proposed methodology is an unsupervised multi-level architecture capable of extracting spatio-temporal features from video samples. Every node – similarly to the HTM notion [25,26] – incorporates two distinct procedures: the spatial and the temporal one, while the procedures themselves attain the training and the testing (inference) mode. Thereupon, when the spatial procedure is in training mode, the node treats every frame patch as a second-order tensor and attempts to learn and quantize the input space. This quantization is accomplished by deriving representatives (i.e. quantization centers) through a competitive learning scheme. Then, the node switches to testing mode and expresses each frame patch in terms of similarity utilizing the corresponding representatives. Afterwards, the node initiates the temporal procedure in training mode and for each respective frame patch it forms a matrix that contains the temporal changes among the frame patches of the same video sample. Those matrices are utilized to assemble temporal clusters through a tensorized extension of a vector based clustering technique. Last, the node alternates to testing mode, in which every frame patch acquires – through a membership function – the degree of closeness with respect to the derived temporal clusters. Regarding the proposed deep learning model, each level is successively trained and a level starts its training only after the nodes of the previous level have completed the respective operation. In addition, the upper level uses the concatenated outputs from its corresponding children nodes as input and treats those concatenations as a dictionary. The proposed technique exceeds in terms of classification accuracy not only previous HTM-based models but also other state-of-the-art methodologies (see Section 4 for details).

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the most significant work over the deep learning field and methodologies that exploit multilinear algebra is presented; Section 3 describes the architecture of the proposed deep learning model, including the operation of a single node; the experimental validation of the presented methodology occurs in Section 4 and, last, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

This section is further separated to individually present significant methodologies that utilize either deep learning or multilinear algebra.

The field of deep learning was established by the pioneer work in Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) [27] and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [28]. DBN comprises a generative probabilistic architecture of stacked layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). Each RBM contains one visible and one hidden layer. In contrast to the traditional Neural Networks, which can only estimate the probability P(label|sample), the aforementioned generative model is capable of estimating both P(sample|label) and P(label|sample). An exhaustive connection exists between the nodes of the visible and the hidden layer. All the RBMs are Bernoulli–Bernoulli type; since the hidden layer from the first RBM derives a nominal output; however the first one could be a Gaussian–Bernoulli in the case where the input data are continuous. Once the primary RBM has been trained, its hidden layer becomes the visible one to the next RBM, and so on. Nevertheless, the Gaussian–Bernoulli and the Bernoulli–Bernoulli are not the only types of units: the work in Ref. [29] introduces the exponential type while the one in Ref. [30] proposes alternative actions.

Similarly, a CNN is a multi-layer hierarchy of filters and pooling mechanisms that show up alternately and derive progressively composite features. In other words, a CNN consists of sequentially placed pairs of convolutional and sub-sampling layers, in a repeating fashion. A 2D convolution is accomplished among the feature maps acquired from the prior sub-sampling layer. The result is added to a bias term and the latter sum is fed into a hyperbolic tangent function. The sub-sampling layer reduces the resolution from the corresponding feature maps derived by the previous convolutional layer in the hierarchy. This is achieved by applying a pooling mechanism over the local neighborhoods, thus improving this way the tolerance over noisy inputs. The respective outputs are forwarded into a conventional Neural Network in the final layer.

An interesting deep learning algorithm suitable for object recognition is the biologically inspired HMAX [31], consisting of four layers, namely S
                        1,
                        C
                        1,
                        S
                        2 and C
                        2. S
                        1 receives a 2D image as an input and passes it through a multidimensional array of Gabor filters in a variety of orientations and scales. The units in the next layer (C
                        1) perform a maximum pooling operation over the local neighborhood of the previous level maps, causing a more tolerant system regarding various 2D transformations and – while in training phase – a collection of prototypes is produced by the C
                        1 units. In the S
                        2 layer, the corresponding units derive their maps by comparing the C
                        1 maps to the extracted prototypes. Last, C
                        2 extracts the final feature vector by applying a global maximum operator over the maps from all units in S
                        2.

Other deep learning models that deal with 2D data were introduced in Ref. [32–34]. The work in Ref. [32] proposes an unsupervised framework capable of deriving hierarchical image representations that can either be used for denoising or object recognition tasks. A generative deep learning model is presented in Ref. [33] by merging a DBN with the Gated Markov Random Field, leading to a good generative model of high-resolution images. Two approaches to improve the capabilities of the DBNs in the cases of occlusion or random noise are presented in Ref. [34]. The first one considers the utilization of sparse connections in the first layer that enhances the resistance to noise while in training and the second one uses a method for image denoising.

The previously mentioned methods apply to static 2D data, yet efficient extensions exist which enable the treatment of spatio-temporal relations. The work in Ref. [16] presents a convolutional Gated RBM methodology suitable for handling spatio-temporal coherences. The latter uses vectorial data, ignoring the spatial consistency of the frames, yet shares weights in all image regions. Moreover, it exploits 2D feature maps, which operate as patch model between corresponding sequential frame regions. Since the proposed methodology admits top-down operation in addition to the feed-forward one, this technique adopts a probabilistic max pooling operation which was introduced in Ref. [35]. The temporal component is also treated in Refs. [36,37]. The work in Ref. [36] handles gaze data and provides a probabilistic model for joint classification, tracking and planning. The one in Ref. [37] proposes a deep learning model combined with an alteration of the Independent Subspace Analysis, suitable for video data.

The aforementioned CNN algorithm [28] is expanded in Ref. [17] to extract features in video data. This technique derives several information channels that correspond to successive frames. The respective convolution and sub-sampling procedures are separately performed in each channel. Moreover, the respective model is enhanced with additional auxiliary outputs, derived from a large amount of frames. In the same manner, the HMAX methodology [31] is modified in Ref. [18] in order to deal with video data. The expansion in Ref. [18] includes the substitution of the S
                        1 units by motion-direction sensitive ones and space-time filters.

Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) [25,26] is another category of deep learning methods. It aims to derive high-level spatio-temporal features utilizing identical nodes in a tree-shaped hierarchy. The nodes at the lowest level acquire input from sensory patches, while nodes at a higher level receive input corresponding to a wider sensory region. A node in an HTM operates in two discrete modes, namely the training and the inference one. During training, the nodes in the first level seek the most characteristic input patterns and ascribe indices to them. The temporal succession among them is imprinted in a transition matrix, which ultimately is clustered via a graph partitioning methodology. When the training phase of the first level is completed it switches to inference mode. The derived outputs of the respective nodes are input to the subsequent level input. Additionally, the higher level nodes provide feedback to the lower ones, which combine that information with their outputs. The Bayesian belief propagation undertakes the classification procedure after the training of the network.

Recently, the benefits of the tensorial frameworks have drawn the attention of the research community. The work in Ref. [19] introduces a framework for supervised tensor learning. The latter extends vector-based methodologies to operate with tensorial data. This framework is considered to be an extension of the convex optimization learning for tensors and relies on an alternating projection procedure. By combining this framework, the authors obtain several tensor-based expansions of learning algorithms, such as support tensor machines, tensor minimax probability machine, tensor fisher discriminant analysis and multiple distance metrics learning.

There are several works that exploited tensors to deal with image samples. The authors in Ref. [38] introduce an N-mode orthogonal iteration algorithm that relies on the well-known N-mode SVD tensor decomposition. This algorithm is capable of reducing the dimensionality of every mode matrix selectively, thus facilitating the learning of lower-dimensionality multilinear models. This work was evaluated on image faces for dimensionality reduction and image compression. Yan et al. [39] proposed the multilinear discriminant analysis methodology for subspace learning focused on face recognition. In this algorithm, a novel discriminant criterion is introduced that results multiple interrelated lower dimensional discriminative subspaces. Those subspaces are learned by an iterative procedure named k-mode optimization which unfolds the tensor along different tensor directions. The work in Ref. [23] presents the Tensor Subspace Analysis (TSA) method for image representation that operates using second order tensors. This work is fundamentally based on Locality Preserving Projections (LPPs) and, thus, attempts to preserve a graph structure. Moreover, TSA aims at maximizing the global variance of the derived manifold. The respective subspace is derived by alternately solving two separated generalized eigenvector problems. Zafeiriou [40] introduced a series of unsupervised and supervised Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) algorithms which are capable of operating directly to the tensor representation of the images. Firstly, the NMF algorithm was extended by applying arbitrary valence Kruskal tensors. Then, a general NTF framework using generalized Bregman distances was presented. Moreover, the author proposed a series of discriminant NTF methods by incorporating discriminant constraints inside various NTF decompositions, including a framework for DNTF with generalized Bregman distances. He et al. [41] proposed a new method named TensorImages for image clustering which derives multilinear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator and then applies traditional clustering algorithms like k-means.

Regarding the action recognition problem, the work in Ref. [42] solves the two-class classification problem within the tensor-based framework, by introducing the Support Tucker Machines (STMs). In this work, the weight parameters are treated as a tensor, computed with respect to the Tucker tensor decomposition as the multiplication of a core tensor with a set of matrices, one along every mode. Additionally, the work is further expanded to take advantage of the total or the within-class covariance matrix which allows invariance to affine transformations in the feature space. A subsequent work [20] introduces the higher rank Relative Margin Support Tensor Machines (RM-STMs) which bounds from above the distance of the data samples from the separating tensorplane, while maximizing the margin from it. Another methodology that deals with video data and more precisely with video surveillance using gait appearance is proposed in Ref. [43]. This work initially applies a collection of Gabor based functions while the high dimensionality of the samples is reduced using a novel general tensor discriminant analysis framework which guarantees convergence. Last, Guo et al. [22] presented a tensor based model for regression. In more detail, this methodology enables the simultaneous projections of an input tensor to more than one direction along each mode, while two different empirical risk functions are examined.

This section describes the proposed deep learning algorithm. It is divided into two subsections, the first one providing the architecture of the entire methodology and the second one the single node's functionality.

The architecture concerns the topology of the nodes regarding the proposed network and is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . The presented deep learning scheme follows a tree shaped structure of computational nodes, similar to HTMs and it obeys a feed-forward architecture. Our proposal consists of five levels, where Level-0 is the data samples, i.e. the nodes in Level-1 directly receive input from this level. The nodes in the same level are adjoint as well as their inputs. Level-1 is composed of sixty four computational nodes (8×8 grid) and the respective inputs are adjoint frame patches from all samples. Level-2 consists of sixteen nodes (4×4 grid), each one obtaining input from the respective quartet of Level-1 and so on. The top level (Level-4) comprises only one node, which receives input from all nodes in Level-3 (2×2 grid). Since the co-level nodes are adjoint, they are capable of operating in parallel. In order for a higher level to initiate its functionality, all nodes from the lower one must have completed their tasks. The nodes acquire a percentage of spatial information which is proportional to their corresponding level. Consequently, the nodes that belong to bottom levels conceive local ephemeral events while the root node understands the global long-term ones. This is due to the fact that the top-level node implicitly receives abstract input from the entire frame. The output of a node is a vector of length equal to the number of the temporal clusters, as explained in Subsection 3.2. The size of the frame patches to each of the Level-1 nodes depends on the size of the initial data, while the remaining nodes receive a matrix of size 4×max{N
                        
                           c1,
                        N
                        
                           c2,
                        N
                        
                           c3,
                        N
                        
                           c4} for each frame. The N
                        
                           c1,…,
                        N
                        
                           c4 variables represent the number of the temporal clusters from the nodes that provide input to the respective upper level one. The model initiates in training phase when the respective set of samples (training set) is provided. Once its training has been completed, it goes over to testing (inference) phase. HTM-based architectures in contrast to convolutional-like networks do not use overlapping patches, however the outputs of the nodes corresponding to disjoint patches are concatenated in the subsequent level. Last, all quartets of nodes contribute equally to the respective node of the next level, i.e. it is the architecture that does not follow a weight sharing policy.

This subsection presents the operation of a node regarding the proposed deep learning architecture. A node's operation may be divided into two procedures the spatial and the temporal one while each of these may be further separated in training and inference (testing) mode. The functionality of all the nodes is identical throughout the entire network.

The interpretation of a node's operation follows the one of the HTM while the respective works [25,26] provide a thorough explanation of how such a node is structured. In terms of completeness, the corresponding functionality is briefly explained. The node is distinguished in two procedures, namely the spatial and the temporal, which operate in the aforementioned order. The first procedure is responsible for quantizing the spatial information of the samples and describes each of them according to the derived representatives. The temporal procedure operates on the output of the spatial one in order to derive clusters with time coherence. Once they are formed, each sample is expressed according to its degree of similarity with every cluster.

In more detail, both procedures (spatial and temporal) function on two different modes, the training and the testing one. That is, when the proposed model is trained, so does the nodes. Given a set of training samples a node produces representatives until the input space is sufficiently described (see Subsection 3.2.1). Then, the spatial procedure infers the aforementioned samples and expresses them in terms of proximity with respect to all the representatives (see Subsection 3.2.2). Those become the input to the temporal procedure and due to the fact that the node is trained, the temporal clusters are formed (see Subsection 3.2.3). Once the temporal clusters are created, the temporal procedure is in place to infer about the samples through a membership function (see Subsection 3.2.4). The training of the proposed deep learning model is concluded when all nodes from all levels are trained, as described in Subsection 3.1. The testing mode is a subset of the training one, i.e. only the inferences of the spatial and the temporal procedures transpire (see Subsections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4, respectively). The latter may intuitively be explained as follows: when the model is trained, it forms the spatial representatives and the temporal clusters using the training samples. After their creation, the testing samples are simply expressed in terms of spatial and temporal proximity accordingly.

The node commences its functionality with the spatial operation in training mode. At this point the aim is the derivation of representatives

                            is the number of video samples. The quantization of the input space is achieved using a competitive learning model in which all representatives are updated according to their distance from the current sample and the update rule is expressed in terms of a cost function. The L
                           1-norm minimization [44,45] is utilized in order to provide weight factors for the update rule. Initially, the Vec(⋅) operator is applied on each frame sample individually, i.e.

                           CompCriterion() and UpdateW() are the respective routines to present randomly a sample from the entire dataset, concatenate the representatives w

It is worth noting that the purpose of this procedure is to derive quantization centers (i.e. representatives) that accurately describe the entire input space and not to cluster the samples into the spatial domain, thus, no clustering assignment rule exists. Moreover, the number of representatives is not explicitly defined (such as in Neural Gas), since it would be mandatory for all the nodes in the architecture, rather results from the criterion in Eq. (6). An illustrative example of this procedural part is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).

                            reveal the temporal changes between the quantized representation of the respective frame and the rest of the corresponding video sequence (i.e. video sample). The purpose of the temporal training mode is the formation of the temporal clusters. The clustering procedure is accomplished via a tensorized extension of the Multiple Sphere Support Vector Clustering (MS-SVC) [47], named Multiple Sphere Support Tensor Clustering (MS-STC). The MS-SVC technique was built upon a method suitable for domain description (outlier detection) presented in Ref. [48]. The derived contours in Ref. [48] were interpreted as cluster boundaries initially in Ref. [49,50] and by appending a clustering assignment scheme the Support Vector Clustering (SVC) was formed. Thereafter, several other cluster assignment schemes were presented in the literature [51–53]. However, the work in Ref. [47] exposed the cluster derivation procedure under a different prism. The resulting methodology in Ref. [47] defines that every sphere characterizes a cluster and – via a membership function – allows the establishment of cluster representatives.

The presented tensorized extension operates on the data space, not on a kernelized one. The work in Ref. [47] uses a vectorized form for the data representation which in conjunction with the usage of linear models is not sufficient to competently solve the majority of such problems thus, not linear means are exploited. As a result, the authors in Ref. [47] suggest that if a problem in the vector space is non-linear then the respective kernelized form should be exploited, implying that the corresponding kernel parameters need to be adjusted. The proposed work derives and utilizes a tensorized extension of the aforementioned methodology allowing the efficient operation in the original tensor space. The encapsulation of multilinear algebra is the corresponding scheme that alleviated the need to operate in a kernel space. Moreover, the fact that in the proposed deep learning approach each node operates on smaller patches facilitates the preservation of information about the structure of the samples. Moreover, the criteria utilized in the proposed addendum demands fewer parameters in comparison with the original method. The essential parameters in the presented technique are introduced in the temporal procedure. Those are the relaxation parameter C

                           . Subsequently, the winning cluster K is placed under a validity test which relies on the computation of a vigilance degree g
                           
                              K

                           ) is less than the user defined threshold ϵ2 then the current sample D
                           
                              i
                            is assigned to cluster K, the minimum enclosing sphere optimization problem is recomputed and the method explores the subsequent temporal sample D
                           
                              i

                           ) value is greater than ϵ2, then the respective cluster is disabled, i.e. 
                              
                                 d

                              ∞
                            and the third step is repeated only if there are still enabled (i.e. not disabled) clusters. In the case where all the clusters are disabled then the algorithm forms a new one and, thus, the fourth step is concluded. The pseudocode of the temporal clustering scheme is given in Algorithm (2), where AppendCluster() and SolveSTC() are routines that categorize the current sample to an already existing cluster and solve the optimization problem for the winning cluster while deriving the new parameter values, respectively. An illustrative example of this procedural part is illustrated in Fig. 2(c).

After the derivation of the clusters the node begins the inference mode of the temporal procedure. For each D

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

This section presents a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning scheme. The performance of the presented model is compared in terms of classification accuracy with other state-of-the-art methodologies. The comparison was accomplished on three publicly available datasets, for action recognition, viz. the Gesture3D [54], the KTH action [55] and the UCF Sports [56].

The proposed deep learning scheme was combined with both the linear SVM classifier and non-linear K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Moreover, both the aforementioned classifiers require only one parameter to be adjusted. The corresponding parameters were set to C
                     
                        SVM
                     
                     =100 and K
                     
                        nn
                     
                     =3, where C
                     
                        SVM
                      is the SVM's relaxation parameter and K
                     
                        nn
                      the number of neighbors. The parameter values were determined through exhaustive search and remained static through the entire experimental procedure, in order to estimate the impact of the parameters on the accuracy. The searching for the relaxation parameter C
                     
                        SVM
                      was in the range [10−1000] with a step equal to 10. Concerning the K-NN classifier, the range for parameter K
                     
                        nn
                      was in [1−10]. Regarding the proposed architecture, the parameter ϵ1 was fixed to 0.05 for the entire experimental procedure, while ϵ2 and C
                     
                        STC
                      vary. It is worth reminding that ϵ1 is the threshold value for the convergence criterion of Algorithm (1), ϵ2 defines the necessary closeness of a sample to a cluster in order to be characterized as a match and C
                     
                        STC
                      designates the relaxation parameter used in the STC optimization routine.

The Gesture3D is a hand gesture dataset of depth sequences captured by a Kinect sensor. The dataset comprises a collection of 12 gestures defined by the American Sign Language (ASL). The gestures were performed repeatedly by 10 individuals (two or three times each) In order for the proposed methodology to be comparable with the derived results in Ref. [57], we down-sampled the resolution to 120×120pixels and conformed to the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The Level-1 nodes of the proposed deep learning scheme receive as input frame patches of size 15×15. Fig. 3
                         depicts the mean accuracy of the presented algorithm for various parameter values and their respective variance. In Fig. 3 it can be observed that the parameter ϵ2 affects significantly the accuracy since the latter is responsible for the formation of new temporal clusters within the computational nodes, while C
                        
                           STC
                         acts on the derived shape of the respective optimization procedure. It is also observed that the C
                        
                           STC
                         parameter – within reasonable interval values – has minor impact on the accuracy.


                        Table 1
                         summarizes the classification accuracy of state-of-the-art methodologies as reported in Ref. [57], while the efficacy of the presented architecture is also appended. The presented work outperforms the other methodologies using both classifiers while the best performance was acquired using the linear SVM. The usage of the SVM classifier improved the accuracy by 2.35% in comparison with the K-NN classifier and compared to the rest of the quoted methods the improvement varies from 31.94% to 6.21%. The confusion matrices of classification results for ϵ2
                        =0.65 and C
                        
                           STC
                        
                        =175 are demonstrated in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        , while the system classified correctly the majority of the classes.

The KTH action dataset was collected by Schuldt et al. [55] and comprises almost 600 samples (video sequences). The dataset consists of six different actions, namely boxing, walking, running, jogging, clapping and waving. These aforementioned actions are performed by 25 individuals several times while the spatial resolution of the samples is 160×120pixels and their frame rate is 25fps.

The experimental setup is based upon the one proposed in [55], i.e. 16 randomly selected subjects were appointed as a training set out of the 25 and the remaining ones were used for testing. Moreover, each situation was examined separately. Those random splits were repeated five times and the presented results are the mean classification accuracy of those splits. Concerning the proposed approach, the size of the frame patches for the Level-1 nodes was 20×15pixels and the performance is depicted in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Fig. 6(a) shows the performance of the presented architecture using the K-NN classifier and the varying parameter is the ϵ2 one. Similarly to the derived results in the Gesture3D dataset the ϵ2 parameter has a particular effect on the accuracy. When the latter parameter acquires a small value the proposed methodology derives many clusters which contain a small number of D
                        
                           i
                         samples. In the same fashion Fig. 6(b) illustrates the performance of the proposed method when the SVM is used for classification and the parameter C
                        
                           STC
                         varies. While this parameter also alters the accuracy yet the corresponding impact is smaller than the one occurred due to the ϵ2 one. Table 2
                         summarizes the performance of the proposed deep learning scheme for each situation separately as well as the average one. Additionally, the table quotes the results of other methodologies on the KTH dataset as reported in the work of Le et al. [37]. In this dataset the difference in terms of accuracy between the K-NN and the SVM classifier is 5.36%. Most of the methods outperform the presented work when the K-NN is utilized, while the usage of the SVM derives the best accuracy (by 1.02%) from the one yielded by the compared methods. Fig. 7
                         shows the confusion matrix of the proposed technique. It is apparent that a large confusion exists between the “boxing” and “hand clapping” actions as well as between the “hand waving” and “hand clapping”.

The UCF Sports dataset is a challenging one concerning the field of action recognition. This dataset comprises about 200 video samples of various sport videos featured on broadcast television channels, namely BBC and ESPN. It is considered to be a vast collection of actions captured under a great variety of scenes and viewpoints. Moreover, the samples present scale, occlusion, cluttered background and motion discontinuity. The spatial resolution of samples is 720×480pixels and the frame rate is 10fps. The included actions in the dataset are: diving, golf swinging, kicking, lifting, horseback riding, running, skating, swinging and walking.

Regarding the proposed method, the Level-1 nodes acquire video patches of spatial resolution 90×60pixels. The performance on this dataset is illustrated in Fig. 8
                        . Fig. 8(a), (b) and (c), (d) depict the accuracy using the K-NN and the SVM classifier, respectively. The impact of the C
                        
                           STC
                         parameter on the classification is smaller than the one of ϵ2, while in the corresponding dataset the latter parameter seems to have stronger effect than in the previously examined datasets. Fig. 9
                         illustrates the confusion matrix for a certain set of parameter values and it appears that the proposed technique confuses several classes with the swinging one. Other confusions also exist, yet they are minor in comparison with the latter one. Table 3
                         summarizes the accuracy of the proposed system and the one yielded by other state-of-the-art methods as presented in [37]. The difference in accuracy between the two classifiers is 3.93%. The presented work in combination with the SVM classifier outperforms the benchmark algorithms and the difference varies between [13.99%and4.79%].

Regarding the erroneously classified samples in the UCF Sports dataset the proposed work misclassified several samples with the swinging class. The reason behind this is found to be the formation of the temporal clusters, due to the fact that the ones formed by other classes were sufficient to describe also this one. As described in Section 3, the number of the temporal clusters depends on the strictness that is imposed from ϵ2 and C
                        
                           STC
                         parameters. The higher the value of ϵ2 and the lower the one of relaxation parameter C
                        
                           STC
                        , the more detailed description the clusters provide with respect to the samples. The introduced model managed to correctly classify those samples by alternating the aforementioned values. More specifically, by setting ϵ2
                        =0.73 and C
                        
                           STC
                        
                        =110 the temporal clusters in every node grow in numbers, enhancing the system's discrimination capacities. This alternation yet led to over-train, decreasing the overall accuracy. This example is an evidence of the notion that by properly regulating the parameters of the proposed method the model attains a consistent basis of the input space, resulting to meaningful spatio-temporal features.

Regarding the computational performance, a typical run of the proposed deep learning model during the training mode has a range duration of 66–132s per video sample (UCF Sport dataset, 60–120frames/sample), where most of the run-time is allocated by the spatial procedure in training mode in order to calculate the representatives (about 38–73s). As the information traverses to upper levels of the deep model hierarchy, the duration of the training procedure is reduced. The latter can be explained by the fact that the nodes in the first level receive as input the initial data, while the remaining ones acquire compact representations of the samples from the corresponding nodes of the exact below level. Once the introduced model is trained, the testing phase has constant seconds/frames ratio.

It is worth mentioning that the results from the benchmark techniques were acquired from the work in Ref. [59]. Since the respective implementations of these methods were publically available, they were utilized for the following experimental procedure, considering the default parameter values. The comparison occurred on UCF Sports dataset and performed in a machine with 3.4GHz processor and 32GB RAM. The results are provided in Table 4
                         and considering that the samples have different number of frames, the respective reduction in order to acquire the seconds/frame ratios is applied. Although the presented methodology attains significantly greater time duration for the training phase, at the same time the testing phase is the most efficient one for the reasons described in previous sections.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents an unsupervised deep learning framework capable of deriving spatio-temporal features. This generic framework may be applied in a variety of recognition problems, while the respective experimental validation shows the efficacy of the proposed methodology in action recognition tasks. The presented technique exploits the multilinear algebra, attaining the coherence between the successive frames. Each computational node forms second order representatives according to a deviation based criterion, while their adjustment is similar to the back-propagation algorithm. Afterwards, it follows the computation of the Frobenius norm among the frame patches and the derived representatives, while each frame of the same video sample is expressed in terms of differences from the remaining ones. The temporal matrices are in accordance with the frames utilized for the formation of clusters using the MS-STC technique. Our results were compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies, yielding remarkable performance which, in most cases, was superior. This bio-inspired deep learning approach is intended to be embodied in robotic sub-systems that deal with sensorial input – besides the visual one – thus, enhancing the separability among different states or classes. Further steps include the formation of a feed-forward architecture with multiple branches, i.e. the combination of multiple networks. Each separate branch will handle one source of information (visual, audio, haptic data etc.) while the merging will lead to a multi-modal integration framework. Additionally, it is intended to encapsulate within the spatial procedure a sparse subset selection scheme in order to improve the description of the input space as well as to reduce the training time. Such a choice is also expected to further improve the overall accuracy of the model.

The MS-SVC methodology in Ref. [47] is an iterative clustering procedure based on the optimization of the minimum enclosing sphere and inspired by adaptive cluster cell growing techniques. An important component of this algorithm is the solution of the quadratic problem that computes the minimum enclosing sphere of the respective data. The aforementioned is accountable for the formation of the cluster boundaries utilizing the support vectors and was initially proposed for novelty detection (domain description) [48]. A domain description technique attempts to describe the underlying data of a given class and the respective probability distribution. The MS-SVC method decides whether a presented sample should be assigned in an already existing cluster or forms a new one. The cluster assignment considers geometrical attributes such as the distance of a sample from the center of a sphere, from its radius and so on. Appendix A.1 presents the optimization procedure of the minimum enclosing sphere for second order tensors, though the latter may be accordingly expanded for higher order ones. Furthermore, Appendix A.2 provides the respective tensorized metrics and relations used for the cluster assignment scheme. Please note that in this Appendix the samples are marked as x
