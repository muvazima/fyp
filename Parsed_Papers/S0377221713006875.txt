                  Modeling the evolution of networks is central to our understanding of large communication systems, and more general, modern economic and social systems. The research on social and economic networks is truly interdisciplinary and the number of proposed models is huge. In this survey we discuss a small selection of modeling approaches, covering classical random graph models, and game-theoretic models to analyze the evolution of social networks. Based on these two basic modeling paradigms, we introduce co-evolutionary models of networks and play as a potential synthesis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The importance of network structure in social and economic systems is by now very well understood. In sociology and applied statistics the study of social ties among actors is a classical field, known as social network analysis (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). More recently a large scientific community, including game theorists, economists, as well as computer scientists and physicists, recognized the importance of network structure. In particular, the dynamic evolution of networks became an important question of research. Of course all these subjects put different emphasis on what is considered to be a “good” model of network formation. Traditionally, economists are used to interpreting observed network structure as equilibrium outcomes. Naturally, game theory is the predominant tool used in this literature. Computer scientists, on the other hand, prefer to think of network formation in terms of dynamic algorithms. Finally, physicists tend to think of networks as an outgrowth of complex system analysis, where the main interest is to understand and characterize the statistical regularities of large stochastic networks. Given this interdisciplinary character of the subject, the number of publications is enormous, and it is impossible to provide a concise survey covering the plethora of models developed in each of the above mentioned disciplines. For this reason, we have decided to focus in this survey on two, in our opinion, particular promising approaches to model the evolution of social and economic networks. We concentrate on dynamic models of network formation, using elements from random graph theory and game theory. These two approaches matured over the years, and some recent efforts have been made to combine them. This article summarizes a small body of these two streams of literature; it is our aim to convince the reader that random graph dynamics and (evolutionary) game theory have many elements in common, and we hope that this survey provides some ideas for future research on this young and interdisciplinary topic. However, before jumping into the details, let us give a short overview of topics which this survey covers, a pointer to the further relevant literature, and an acknowledgment of the literature which we shamefully exclude.

Section 2 starts with a short discussion of random graph models. These models are the basis for the statistical analysis of networks and have had a large impact on theoretical models of network evolution. Random graph models have a long tradition in social network analysis, and are the foundation of the recent literature on network evolution in computer science, mathematics and physics. Following the terminology of Chung et al. (2006), we focus on “off-line” models. Hence, we consider network formation models in which the number of nodes (the size of the population) is a given parameter.
                        1
                        “On-line” models are models in which the population is growing over time. This important class of models contains the very popular preferential attachment models (Barabási & Albert, 1999), which we are not touching in this survey. Excellent (technical) summaries of these models can be found in Newman (2003b) and, more rigorously, in Chung et al. (2006) and Durrett (2007).
                     
                     
                        1
                      The most general random graph model introduced in this survey belongs to the family of inhomogeneous random graph models (Bollobás, Janson, & Riordan, 2007). This class of random graphs is rather rich. It contains well-known stochastic block-models (Karrer & Newman, 2011), variants of the important exponential random graph (Snijders, Pattison, Robins, & Handcock, 2006), and the classical Bernoulli random graph model as special cases. Since these models are very well documented in the literature, we are satisfied with a short summary of their main properties. The main purpose of this section is to introduce concepts, and to familiarize the reader with our notation. Nevertheless, we consider random graph models as the building block to synthesize random graph models with dynamic game theoretic ideas, and therefore we think it is useful to introduce them already at the beginning.

Section 3 presents an alternative approach of modeling networks, mainly developed by economic theorists. It uses game theoretical concepts to interpret network structures as equilibrium phenomena of strategically acting players who create and destroy links according to their own incentives. Our discussion is centered around two particularly important concepts: The semi-cooperative solution concept of pairwise-stability (Jackson & Wolinsky, 1996), and various modifications of Nash equilibrium. These concepts are static equilibrium notions, and the natural question which comes to one’s mind is whether there are natural dynamic models supporting predictions based on such equilibrium concepts. This question leads us to consider an evolutionary approach to network formation. These models are used as an introduction to a particular interesting class of dynamic network formation models, called co-evolutionary processes of networks and play in Staudigl (2010). Section 4 is devoted to illustrate these types of models, which is our modest attempt to synthesize the strategic approach of network formation with a random graph approach. Section 5 summarizes the main points contained in this article and discusses some ideas for potential future research.

Given the enormous number of network formation models, it was necessary to be selective in writing this survey. Hence, there are many important network models which we were not able to cover. Some notable omissions are the following; we restrict the discussion to network models where the size of the graph is fixed (“off-line” models). Networks with variable number of nodes (“on-line” models) are of course important, but they require different mathematical tools to be analyzed successfully. In particular, we believe that a different game theoretic approach would be needed to study such models.
                           2
                           For instance, a basic strategic decision in a network model with variable number of players is when and whether a single player should enter or leave the network. See Dutta, Ghosal, and Ray (2005) for a model in this direction. In evolutionary game theory, the standard model assumes a constant population size. However, it seems to be likely that allowing for population growth introduces for new phenomena absent from the stationary world. See Sandholm and Pauzner (1998) for an interesting study in this direction. A recent model of economic network formation in a non-stationary environment is Jackson and Rogers (2007).
                        
                        
                           2
                         Readers interested in the mechanics of growing networks should consult the book by Dorogovtsev and Mendes (2003), and the survey article by Albert and Barabási (2002). Another class of networks which we will not consider are weighted graphs. These models are very important for applications, and the physics community provides many interesting approaches to model such networks (see e.g. Barthélemy, Barrat, Pastor-Satorras, & Vespignani (2005) and Kumpula, Onnela, Saramäki, Kaski, & Kertész (2007), and the references therein). There are also some game–theoretic models on the formation of weighted networks, see e.g. Bloch and Dutta (2009). These are just preliminary studies, and we have the feeling that much more work on these kinds of networks will be needed before they should be included in a survey. Finally, we would like to point out that our main focus will be on evolutionary models of undirected networks. This does not mean that we think directed networks are less important. In fact, many real-world networks, such as traffic networks or the world-wide-web, are more naturally interpreted as directed graphs. However most of the game-theoretic concepts emphasize bilateral externalities, and thus admit a cleaner interpretation when links are undirected. Nevertheless, we provide some discussion of directed networks. In particular, the random graph models of Section 2 can be used to model the evolution of directed, as well as undirected networks, after straightforward modifications.

Most of the models which found no space in this article have been surveyed elsewhere. We just provide some cross references to the literature, and urge the reader to consult the references therein. Recent textbooks containing in-depth discussions on dynamic network formation are Chung et al. (2006) and Durrett (2007). These books focus on the mathematical aspects, and only mention rudimentary applications. With a slight bias towards economics applications, we recommend the beautiful books by Goyal (2007), Vega-Redondo (2007), Jackson (2008), and Easley and Kleinberg (2010). Additionally to textbook treatments, the reader may want to consult one of the numerous survey articles available. We just mention Jackson (2003), Newman (2003b), Jackson (2005), Van den Nouweland (2005), Goyal (2005), Goldenberg, Zheng, Fienberg, and Airoldi (2009). At the heart of our discussion is the evolution of networks, and we use the language of stochastic processes and/or game theory to formalize our ideas. Additionally we try to highlight the potential connections between these two seemingly separate modeling strategies. We hope that this integrated perspective on the evolution of networks makes this survey a good contribution to the literature and will inspire some people to work on this fascinating topic.

A statistical analysis of networks is usually based on elements of random graph theory. Random graph models are very flexible mathematical representations of interdependency relations. Indeed, the motivation for such classical models as the Markov graph model of Frank and Strauss (1986) was to develop a tractable representation of complicated interdependencies in empirical data. Random graph models in general provide a flexible framework to construct statistical ensembles of networks (i.e. probability spaces), which are parsimonious enough to get pointed predictions, and rich enough to be able to reproduce as many stylized facts the researcher is aiming to model. In this section our discussion is centered around a rather general class of a random graph process, which will be used as one pillar in our development of co-evolutionary processes of networks and play, starting in Section 4.

In this survey we use the terms “networks” and “graphs” interchangeably. A graph is a pair G
                        =([N],
                        E), where [N]≔{1,2,…,
                        N} is the set of vertices (or nodes), and E
                        ≡
                        E(G)⊂[N]×[N] is the set of edges (or links). This notation applies to directed as well as undirected networks. If G is a directed graph, then (i,
                        j)∈
                        E means that there is a directed edge from i to j. If G is undirected, then (i,
                        j)∈
                        E(G) if and only if (j,
                        i)∈
                        E(G). In such a symmetric setting it will be convenient to use the shortened notation ij for the link connecting node j and i. We denote the collection of graphs on N vertices by 
                           
                              G
                              [
                              N
                              ]
                           
                        . Elements of this set can either be directed or undirected networks, depending on the context.

A random graph is a probability space

                              ,

                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    G
                                    [

                         assigns to each graph a weight, which should reflect the likelihood that a certain graph G is drawn from the set 
                           
                              G
                              [

                        , when performing a statistical experiment with distribution P. Thus, the underlying reference measure P it is chosen by the modeler. A historically very important random graph model is the Erdös–Rényi graph (or Bernoulli graph).
                           3
                           
                              Erdös and Rényi (1959, 1960) introduced the slightly different model in which the number of vertices and edges are given parameters. The Bernoulli graph model is due to Gilbert (1959).
                        
                        
                           3
                         The Bernoulli random graph is built on the assumption that edges are formed independently with constant probability p
                        ∈[0,1]. Thus, let 
                           
                              G
                              [

                         be the set of undirected graphs constructable on N vertices. Then the random graph model

The advantage of the Bernoulli graph model is its simplicity. In fact, the complete random graph is described by two parameters: the population size (N), and the edge-success probability (p). This model is the benchmark of random graph theory and is by now very well understood. A detailed analysis can be found in Bollobás (2008). It comes with little surprise that such a simple model is rarely a good description of a real-world network. In particular, the lack of correlation across links is a well-known deficit of the Bernoulli graph. However, it still constitutes an important benchmark (Newman et al., 2003a). Compared to random graphs, real world networks are often observed to have similarly small average path length (an effect coined small worlds phenomenon, or six degrees of separation),

                           A classical reference is the famous letter experiment of Milgram (1967). Other studies include Dodds, Muhamad, and Watts (2003) and Goyal, Van Der Leij, and Moraga-González (2006).

                         and often exhibit a power law degree distribution (more nodes with very high and very low degree compared to Bernoulli graphs, Newman, 2003b). For a more detailed discussion we refer the reader to Vega-Redondo (2007) and Jackson (2008).

A different example for a commonly used random graph measure is the exponential random graph (ERG). This class of random graph models builds on the Markov graph models of Frank and Strauss (1986), and is also known as p
                        ∗-models (Robins, Pattison, Kalish, & Lusher, 2007). This class of models is very rich, and its main strength are its tractability and ability to reproduce networks with arbitrary degree distributions, and clustering. Let us give a simple example for an exponential random graph model. For more information we refer to the excellent paper by Snijders et al. (2006), where a state-of-the-art survey can be found.

                           Despite its huge importance, the ERG model has technical problems. See Chatterjee and Diaconis (2011).

A classical approach in social network theory is to view the evolution of a network as a stochastic process (see Wasserman (1980) for an early contribution). Snijders (2001) constructs a dynamic ERG which can be analytically solved, and numerically simulated via MCMC-methods. In the following we will describe a fairly general dynamic network formation model in terms of continuous-time Markov jump processes.

In a dynamic model of network formation we would like to capture two things: First, the network should be volatile; i.e. links are deleted and formed over time. Second, the likelihood that a link is formed or destroyed, should depend on the attributes of the vertices in the graph. The following network formation algorithm captures both of these requirements. We are given some probability space 
                           
                              (

                              ,
                              F
                              ,
                              P
                              )

                                 (G) define the intensities of link destruction between vertex i and j. The function V is called the volatility mechanism of the process.

In some models of network formation the rate of link destruction ξ has been interpreted as environmental volatility (Ehrhardt, Marsili, & Vega-Redondo, 2006; Marsili, Vega-Redondo, & Slanina, 2004). This is also the motivation behind our definition of a volatility mechanism. In principle the intensities of link creation and destruction can be asymmetric, i.e. we do not require in the construction that w
                        
                           ij
                        (G)=
                        w
                        
                           ji
                        (G), or v
                        
                           ij
                        (G)≡
                        v
                        
                           ji
                        (G), respectively. Hence, in principle the network formation process can be used to model the formation of directed as well as undirected networks. This simple model of an evolving network, will be the building block of our construction of a co-evolutionary model of networks and play in Section 4.

In general, networks are complex objects and therefore difficult to analyze. However, it is often the case that vertices in a network can be classified to belong to certain groups. Indeed, a prevalent fact in social networks is the phenomenon of homophily, meaning that vertices of similar characteristics are more likely to be connected with each other. Therefore, Fienberg, Meyer, and Wasserman (1985) introduced blockmodels, where nodes are categorized to belong to certain subgroups. Each subgroup may have its own law of network formation. Recently, this type of networks has also been used in economic theory (Golub, 2012), where it has been called a multi-type random network.

                           . This grouping, of course, reduces the complexity of the random graph model tremendously. Compared to the inhomogeneous random graph, the multi-type random graph is completely specified by the partitioning of the vertices, and the group-specific edge-success probabilities.

Our proposed strategy to model dynamic network formation is rather parsimonious. The stochastic process is entirely specified by the attachment and the volatility mechanism. Particularly interesting examples are the inhomogeneous random graph model, containing the multi-type random network. All these models rely on a special choice of the intensities of link creation and link destruction. These rates can in principle be fitted from data. Thus, the statistical models are useful to describe how networks form and evolve from an observer’s point of view. They are not able to explain why networks form and evolve, without adding a complementary theory of network formation. Thus, to complete the study of network formation, we have to go to the micro level and understand the forces that drive the nodes to connect to each other. Economic and game theoretic reasoning provides the natural language for this task, and Section 3 summarizes this field to some extend. Using these game theoretic concepts, Section 4 presents some models which combine elements from random graph theory and game theory.

In social and economic network a link is often interpreted as a form of revealed preference: Two players are connected with each other, because it is in their self-interest to have the link. With other words, individuals are connected with each other because a payoff or utility is derived from these connections. Frequently the linking decisions of a single individual affects the utilities of other members of the society. To understand networked systems in situations with interdependent preferences, game theory has been developed. Using game theoretic reasoning, networks are interpreted as equilibrium outcomes implemented by rational players. This modeling approach is potentially useful as it allows us to rationalize predicted or observed network structure in terms of socioeconomic behavior. A purely statistical approach to network formation cannot provide us with such a “micro-foundation” of observed networks. Moreover, the game theoretic approach allows the researcher to understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of the network. As a simple example, consider a situation where a statistician observes a networked system with a center-sponsored star architecture, such as the one depicted in Fig. 1
                     (i).
                        11
                        In this figure, the star is presented as an undirected network. When considering directed networks, there are several stars: we will call a star network a center-sponsored star if all links are directed from the center to the periphery players. Likewise, in a periphery sponsored star, links are directed from the peripheral players to the center.
                     
                     
                        11
                     
                  

Having collected these data, a game theoretic model can now (potentially) be used to postulate preferences (i.e. utility functions), rationalizing this observed interaction structure.

A utility-based approach to network formation is rather straightforward. For each player, there is a utility function

Research in sociology has emphasized the role of centrality in social networks.

                            Centrality measures are based on an assessment of the graph distance between two nodes. The following examples uses a version of this distance measure, called decay centrality, to construct a model of strategic network formation. Consider a given graph G
                           =(V,
                           E). Let d
                           
                              ij
                           (G) denote the geodesic distance between vertex i and j, i.e. the length of the shortest path connecting i and j. If node i cannot be connected to j, then set d
                           
                              ij
                           (G)=∞. A measure of closeness should then be decreasing in distances. Thus, let δ
                           ∈(0,1) be a given parameter. The decay centrality between vertex i and j is then defined as

                           Bonacich (1987) introduced a parametric family of centrality measures in order to formulate the intuitive idea that the centrality of a single node in a network should depend on the centrality of its direct neighbors. This self-referential definition of centrality leads to an eigenvector-based measure, which can be derived from basic utility-maximization ideas, as shown by Ballester, Calvó-Armengol, and Zenou (2006). Let A be the adjacency matrix of a given network. The powers of this matrix give us information of the connectivity structure of the network.

The above example made the interesting point that equilibrium structure of non-cooperative games can be closely linked to the underlying interaction structure of the agents. Another example where this structure is clearly visible is the model due to Goyal and Joshi (2003). In this model the nodes in the graph are firms which produce a homogeneous product and compete in quantities on a single market. Additionally firms can agree to form bilateral R&D collaborations which lower their marginal cost of producing the output. Let us assume that marginal costs of production are given by ψ

Thus, a network is pairwise stable, if (i) no player has an incentive to delete one of her links and (ii) there does not exists a pair of players who want to form a mutually beneficial link. Pairwise stability can be reformulated in terms of a simple test performed on the set of all possible links. Define

                        the set of links that can be deleted from G. Then G is a pairwise stable network if and only if ADD (G)=DEL (G)=∅.

One potential limitation of Pairwise stability is that it only considers single link changes in each updating step. A natural refinement is thus to consider the formation of mutually beneficial links as well as the deletion of more than one link in one period. Such an extended stability concepts has been used in the literature as well, running under the name of Pairwise Nash Stability.

                           Pairwise Nash stability was first discussed in Jackson and Wolinsky (1996). It has been used (without formal definition) in Goyal and Joshi (2003), Belleflamme and Bloch (2004) and has been defined in, e.g. Gilles (2005), Bloch and Jackson (2006), and Calvó-Armengol and Ilkiliç (2009).

Thus, a network that is pairwise Nash stable is also robust against the deletion of a set of links by any player, while pairwise stability only considers one link at a time.

Beyond these commonly used stability notions, several refinements have been introduced in the literature. Some concepts, which we do not discuss in this survey, are the following:
                           
                              •
                              strong and weak stability (Dutta & Mutuswami, 1997),

bilateral stability (Goyal & Vega-Redondo, 2007),

pairwise stability with transfers (Bloch & Jackson, 2007),

strict pairwise stability (Chakrabarti & Gilles, 2007),

unilateral stability (Buskens & van de Rijt, 2008)

cognitive stability (Gallo, 2012), and

(strict) Nash stability (supported by (strict) Nash equilibrium in a link formation game due to Myerson (1991)).

The concept of pairwise stability is one of the most important equilibrium concepts used in modern network theory. In this section we address the question of existence of PS-networks using two different techniques. The first technique uses the potential function method (Monderer & Shapley, 1996; Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, & Vazirani, 2007). The second technique emphasizes the incentive structure directly. We start with the important concept of an improving path.
                           Definition 3.2
                           An improving path from network G to network G′ is a sequence of networks (G
                              1,…,
                              G

                              K, it holds that either

                                       ∈DEL (G
                                       
                                          k
                                       ), or


                                       G
                                       
                                          k+1
                                       =
                                       G
                                       
                                          k
                                       
                                       ⊕
                                       ij and ij
                                       ∈ADD (G

                                       ).

Hence, in an improving path each graph G
                        
                           k+1 is obtained by either deleting a single link, contained in DEL (G
                        
                           k
                        ), from the predecessor G
                        
                           k
                        , or adding a single link, contained in ADD (G
                        
                           k
                        ), to the predecessor G
                        
                           k
                        . The algorithm is running as long as there exists a player who wants to delete a link, or there exists a pair of players who want to form a link connecting them. It is clear that if this algorithm converges, then the limit network must be pairwise stable. Therefore, the set of improving paths emanating from a PS network is empty. Based on this concept, Jackson and Watts (2001) define a cycle C as an improving path (G
                        1,…,
                        G
                        
                           K
                        ) such that G
                        1
                        =
                        G
                        
                           K
                        . They call a cycle C closed, if for all networks G
                        ∈
                        C there does not exists an improving path leading out of it. Jackson and Watts (2001) show that for any profile of utility functions u, there exists at least one pairwise stable network or a closed cycle of networks. The idea to prove existence of a PS network is now to exclude the existence of cycles. A well-known sufficient condition ruling out cyclic behavior in non-cooperative games is the existence of a potential function (Monderer & Shapley, 1996). In a similar way, Jackson and Watts (2001) rule out the existence of improving cycles by imposing the existence of a function w which could be called a “potential function” as well.

                                    ]
                                 
                              
                              , then there exist no cycles. If u exhibits no indifference then there exist no cycles only if such a function exists.
                           

The “no-indifference”-condition ensures that for two networks G, G′, separated by one link, the two players affected by that link have a strict preference ordering between the two networks. The function w acts as an ordinal potential function.
                           18
                           Existence of such a function is implied by the existence of an ordinal network potential. See also Chakrabarti and Gilles (2007) and Tardos et al. (2007).
                        
                        
                           18
                         Ordinal potentials must respect the incentive structure of the underlying utility functions, and thus not every game will have an ordinal potential. As an example, the connections model of Section 3.1.1 has an ordinal potential only for certain parameter values (see Jackson & Watts, 2001).

As already indicated, the existence of an ordinal potential function is stronger than necessary to show existence of pairwise stable networks. Moreover, it is not easy to check whether a utility function delivers such a function.
                           19
                           For recent efforts to characterize the class of potential games see Sandholm (2010b) and Candogan, Menache, Ozdaglar, and Parrilo (2011).

                         Externality conditions on marginal utilities are, however, easy to check. Hellmann (2013) uses such externality conditions directly to prove an existence result of PS-networks. Say a profile of utility function exhibits ordinal convexity in own links if

                           For the various definitions of convexity of a network utility function the reader is referred to Goyal and Joshi (2006), Bloch and Jackson (2007), Calvó-Armengol and Ilkiliç (2009), Hellmann (2013). It is shown in Hellmann (2013) that all these definitions are equivalent. The weaker ordinal version is defined in Hellmann (2013).

In an environment in which players’ utility functions exhibit ordinal convexity in own links and the ordinal strategic complements property, Hellmann (2013) reports the following result.
                           Proposition 3.4

                              =

                              ) satisfies ordinal convexity in own links and the ordinal strategic complements property, then:
                              
                                 
                                    (1) There does not exist a closed improving cycle.
                                    

(2) There exists a PNS (and hence also a PS) network.
                                    

Compared to Proposition 3.3 cyclic behavior is not ruled out completely by assuming ordinal convexity and the ordinal strategic complements property. Only the existence of closed cycles is excluded.
                           Example 3.5
                           An example, where the conditions of Proposition 3.4 are satisfied, is given by u
                              
                                 BC
                               defined in Section 3.1.2, which may also include linking costs. Applying Proposition 3.4, there exists a PNS network. Moreover, because all players have the same utility function, one can easily conclude that if the empty network is not PNS then the complete network is uniquely PNS and if the complete network is not PNS then the empty network is uniquely PNS.

When imposing negative externalities (i.e. ordinal concavity and ordinal strategic substitutes), existence of a PS network cannot be guaranteed, but several uniqueness conditions are satisfied. Hellmann (2013) shows that no pairwise stable network can contain or can be contained in another pairwise stable network. Furthermore conditions for existence of a globally unique stable network are given (for details see Hellmann, 2013).

To derive structural properties of stable networks beyond existence and uniqueness, more assumptions have to be imposed on the players’ utility functions. A particular nice environment is described by the connections model (Jackson & Wolinsky, 1996). Let us focus on the special case, known as the symmetric connections model

                           Although the issue of efficient networks and the tension between stable and efficient networks displays a recurrent theme in the literature, it is beyond the scope of this survey to review the results on efficiency. The reader may be referred e.g. to Jackson (2005); Buechel and Hellmann (2012) and textbooks by Goyal (2007) and Jackson (2008).

                              δ the empty network is among the stable networks and no stable network can contain a player with only one link.
                           

The star network, as visualized in Fig. 1(i), is the network where one player (the center) has links to all other players (the periphery) and those players do not have any other links. Beside the star network, many more networks can be pairwise stable.

For the general utility function (5), Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) do not report any stability results. Johnson and Gilles (2000) study a version of the connections models, allowing for heterogeneity in costs, but homogeneity in benefits. In their setting players are ordered by name from 1,…,
                        N such that the cost of a link between i to j is linearly increasing in the number of players l
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ≔∣{k
                        ∈[N]:i
                        <
                        k
                        ⩽
                        j}∣. Thus, in Eq. (5) 
                        c
                        
                           ij
                         is replaced by l
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ·
                        c. For high costs c similar features of PS networks as in Proposition 3.7 can be observed. If instead costs are low (c
                        <
                        δ
                        −
                        δ
                        2), then there always exist k
                        −networks where players form links to all players j
                        ∈[N] such that l
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ⩽
                        k and no other links are formed. Thus, in these k
                        −networks links remain local implying that clustering is quite high, similar to the Small-World architectures displayed in Fig. 1(iii) (Watts, 1999; Watts & Strogatz, 1998).

A different way of introducing cost heterogeneity is the island model by Jackson and Rogers (2005). There it is assumed that the player set [N] is partitioned into islands of equal size J such that cost of linking is small c
                        
                           ij
                        
                        =
                        c if i and j are from the same island, but are high c
                        <
                        C
                        =
                        c
                        
                           ij
                         if i and j belong to different islands. Moreover, benefits are only obtained for small distances, i.e. w
                        
                           ij
                        
                        =1 if d
                        
                           ij
                        (G)⩽
                        D and w
                        
                           ij
                        
                        =0 else. The interesting case occurs when c
                        <
                        δ
                        −
                        δ
                        2 and C
                        <
                        δ
                        +(J
                        −1)δ
                        2. Then, in any PS network the islands are (internally) completely connected and there is a path between any two islands. Moreover, stable networks have low diameter (bounded above by D
                        +1) and high clustering coefficients. Thus, this model matches some key statistics empirically observed in real word networks.

                        b such that w
                        1

                        w

                        w
                        3. Thus all players prefer the connection to a type-a player over the connection to a type-b player. While the trivial networks (complete respectively empty) are stable for very low respectively high costs, stable networks for medium cost levels have the core periphery architecture where all a
                        −players (the core) are completely connected (if (δ
                        −
                        δ
                        2)w
                        1
                        >
                        c) and the b
                        −players (the periphery) have connections to the core. Whether b-players connect to each other or how many links to a
                        −players they have, depends on the exact cost structure. Hence, stable networks in Persitz (2010) have low diameter and high clustering coefficients and therefore share some statistical features of stable networks in Jackson and Rogers (2005).

In an incomplete information setting similar to McBride (2006) (see Section 3.5), Gallo (2012) also shows that stable networks exhibit low diameter (smaller than 5) and high clustering coefficient.
                           22
                           
                              Gallo (2012) refines the concepts of pairwise stability to cognitive stability to account for the incomplete information setting.
                        
                        
                           22
                         In fact, Gallo (2012) studies a slightly more general utility function than eq. (5), called distance-based utility function. This class of utility functions were first introduced in Bloch and Jackson (2007) and also studied in Möhlmeier, Rusinowska, and Tanimura (2013). Thus, by generalizing the utility function from relatively simple settings, like the homogeneous connections model, to more sophisticated models, stability predictions may reflect more realistic characteristics like low diameter and high clustering.

Most of the concepts introduced so far were formulated for undirected networks. There are many applications where directed networks seem to be more appropriate. Examples of directed networks include citation networks, hyperlinks connecting web-pages, flow of knowledge, or more general any communication network. When network formation can be done without mutual consent, it is natural to speak about one-sided link formation. In a very influential paper, Bala and Goyal (2000) introduce a game theoretic model of one-sided network formation. They distinguish between two basic cases:

Since in one-sided network formation consent to link is not required, the concept of Nash equilibrium is more appealing than in the undirected case. Formally, a Nash network is a network G such that no single player has an incentive to create, respectively delete, a subset of his links, given the links announced by all other players. Given this definition, some of the findings of Bala and Goyal (2000) are summarized by the following proposition.

                              Nash networks are either minimally connected or empty in both the one-way flow model 
                              
                                 (13)
                               
                              and the two-way flow model 
                              
                                 (14)
                              
                              . Among those, only the empty network and the wheel network are strict Nash networks for the one-way flow model, and only the empty network and the center sponsored star are strict Nash networks for the two-way flow model.
                                 24
                                 The notion of a minimal connected network depends on whether the network is directed or undirected. A center–sponsored star and a wheel network are depicted in Fig. 1 and (ii). See Bala and Goyal (2000) for precise definitions.

The Bala and Goyal (2000) model has been extended along various directions. In the framework of the one-way flow model (13), Galeotti (2006) allows for heterogeneous benefits and for heterogeneous cost of connecting. Galeotti, Goyal, and Kamphorst (2006) allow for heterogeneity in the two-way flow model (14). Both papers show that the basic equilibrium architectures obtained in Bala and Goyal (2000) are quite robust. Even with heterogeneous benefits and cost, Nash networks are either minimal or empty, and also strict Nash networks share the same basic architectures as the homogeneous case, but can consist of more than one non-singleton component such that the different components consists of the basic equilibrium structures.
                           25
                           In Galeotti et al. (2006), this holds when costs are player specific. However, when costs are allowed to be heterogeneous with respect to links (called partner specific costs), then different structures may emerge as strict Nash equilibria.
                        
                        
                           25
                         Introducing incomplete information, so that players can only observe those parts of the network within some distance x, McBride (2006) shows that for low enough values of x cycles may occur (i.e. equilibrium networks are not necessarily minimal anymore) and Nash networks may be disconnected in the two-way flow model.

The fact that Nash networks are always minimal in the complete information setting is driven by the assumption that players benefit from all accessible players equally, no matter how long each path is. Bala and Goyal (2000) therefore introduce decay for both the one-way flow and two-way flow model in a similar fashion as the connections model (see Eq. (12)). For the latter case they define

                           The periphery sponsored star is such that there exists a player i
                              ∈[N] (the center) such that E(G)={(j,

                              i}, i.e. all links are directed from the peripheral players to the center. In an extended star there is also a central player who does not support any links. All peripheral players maintain a single link and from every peripheral player there is a directed path to the center.
                        
                        
                           26
                         Another extension is due to Feri and Meléndez-Jiménez (2013) where co-evolution of networks and play (also cf. Section 4.2) in the setup of the two-way flow model with decay (15) is studied. In this paper, the decay is link specific and endogenous since it depends on the actions taken by the (involved) players in a coordination game.

In the context of the connections model (cf. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.4), a natural adjustment dynamics is described by the improving paths (Definition 3.2). Watts (2001) investigates the long-run properties of such a dynamic explicitly. For intermediate costs such that the star network is pairwise stable in the static model (i.e. ensuring that the star is always an absorbing state of the dynamic process), the likelihood that the process starting from the empty network converges to the star goes to 0 as the number of players N grows. The reason is that the myopic best-response dynamics is path dependent. Once two distinct pairs of players form a link (which is beneficial when starting from the empty network), the improving path will never lead to the star network.

To avoid path dependency Jackson and Watts (2002a) introduce perturbations in the decisions of players in the spirit of evolutionary game theory (Kandori, Mailath, & Rob, 1993; Young, 1993). These perturbations are interpreted as mistakes the players may make when evaluating the profitability of link. Formally the timing of the process is as follows:
                           
                              1.

                        (G)>0 are called stochastically stable. These are the networks observed most of the time, when the noise limit goes to 0. Naturally, only networks contained in recurrent classes of the Markov process with zero noise are candidates for stochastic stability. Hence, the concept of stochastic stability is an evolutionary selection mechanism among the stable networks (and closed cycles).


                        Jackson and Watts (2002a) show that stochastically stable networks can be detected by “counting mistakes” involved in the transition from one recurrent class to another.
                           27
                           The arguments used in Jackson and Watts (2002a) are based on the classical Freidlin and Wentzell (1998) tree constructions to understand the long-run behavior of dynamical systems subject to random perturbations. These methods have found numerous application in game theory. See Young (1998), Sandholm (2010a), and Staudigl (2012).
                        
                        
                           27
                         However, the construction of these trees for every recurrence class, and the calculation of minimal number of mistakes can be quite complex. Therefore, Tercieux and Vannetelbosch (2006) present conditions for pairwise stable networks (or sets of networks) to be stochastically stable that are easy to check, called p-pairwise stability. A network G is said to be p-pairwise stable, if altering a fraction p of the N(N
                        −1) possible links in network G implies that any improving path starting from the altered network leads back to G (in particular pairwise stable networks are at least 0-pairwise stable). It is shown that 1/2-pairwise stable networks (if existing) are uniquely stochastically stable.


                        Dawid and Hellmann (2012) study the evolution of R&D collaborations in the model setting of Goyal and Joshi (2003) (see Section 3.1.3). It has been shown by Goyal and Joshi (2003) that any PNS network is of “dominant group architecture”; i.e. there is one completely connected group and all other players are isolated (the same is true for PS networks, see Dawid & Hellmann, 2012). The sizes of the dominant group are sensitive to the cost of link formation, but there is no unique prediction with respect to the networks which will be observed. When introducing the evolutionary process above it can be shown that the size of the dominant group in stochastically stable networks is generically unique and monotonically decreasing in cost of link formation. In the context of the evolution of R&D collaborations, these unique predictions give way to interesting comparative static analysis with respect to welfare, industry profits, and consumer surplus.

In the context of directed networks Bala and Goyal (2000) present a myopic best response process in discrete time for the one-way flow model (13) and two-way flow model (14). They assume that at any time step 
                           
                              t
                              ∈
                              N
                           
                         each player i
                        ∈[N] chooses a myopic best response to last periods’ network with probability 0<
                        p
                        
                           i
                        
                        <1 while with probability 1−
                        p
                        
                           i
                         exhibits inertia.
                           28
                           Note that compared to the best-response dynamics with two-sided link formation in Watts (2001) and Jackson and Watts (2002a), the revision process is now formulated on the individual player level, rather than on the set of edges.
                        
                        
                           28
                         For both models the myopic best response process always converges to the set of strict Nash networks (see Proposition 3.8).


                        Feri (2007) adds random perturbations to this dynamics and restricts himself to the two-way flow model with decay (see (15)). Feri (2007) obtains an almost complete characterization of the stochastically stable networks. Trivially, for low respectively large costs, only the complete respectively empty network are stochastically stable. For intermediate costs, and large networks, all stars where each link is supported by only one player are among the stochastically stable networks while if costs are slightly higher, no other network is stochastically stable. These results stand in contrast to Watts (2001), who shows that for the connections model in bilateral network formation the likelihood of emergence of the star decreases in the number of players N for the pure best response dynamics.

Having discussed models of pure network formation, we now extend our model to allow the players to control (at least partially) two dimensions of the model. These two dimensions consist of the links a player supports in a graph, and an action she may choose, which generates a certain payoff according to an underlying game in normal form. Already the basic examples of Section 3.1 can be used to motivate an analysis of such co-evolutionary processes. For instance, in the local complementarity game of Section 3.1.2, the effort choice of a player depends on its position in the networks. As new links are added or deleted, this will have an effect on the effort invested by a player, and vice versa. We now discuss a mathematical model in which such joint dynamics can be analyzed.

                           . In this general definition the interaction structure of the players is hidden in the utility function. In order to make this dependency structure more explicit, it is useful to separate these effects and define a preference relation directly on the product set of action profiles and interaction structures (i.e. networks). To do so, let us redefine the strategic interaction as a game with local interaction structure (Morris, 1997), which is a game in normal form, but the preference relation is directly defined over a product set

                           . Such models have a quite long tradition (early contributions are Blume, 1993; Ellison, 1993).

Starting from a given local interaction game, we now construct an explicit dynamic model, which includes a dynamic model of network formation as well as a dynamic model of action revision. The models we will discuss are based on the following hypothesis:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 Agents are myopic in their linking and action decision (cf. Section 4.1).

The dynamic process is stationary.

Hypothesis (i) is a huge simplification and essentially boils down to the hypothesis that players base their decision’s today only on the current information they have. They do not attempt to forecast the impact of their behavior on the future evolution of the state and its consequence on their own payoff. Such an assumption is standard practice in evolutionary game theory (Weibull, 1995). Together with hypothesis (ii), it allows us to model a co-evolutionary process as a time-homogeneous Markov processes living on the product set

                            is the set of action profiles. Hence, a co-evolutionary model with noise is a family of continuous-time Markov jump processes

To give a characterization of the class of networks generated by co-evolutionary processes, we would like to rely on our knowledge about general random graph models. In particular we would like to use the general characterization Theorem 2.1. For a given profile s

The set of assumptions is not minimal in order to be able to apply Theorem 2.1 to characterize the conditional random graph measure. Item (ii) is more restrictive than actually needed. The only requirement we need is that the generator of the conditional random graph process satisfies the necessary irreducibility assumptions in order to guarantee the existence of a unique invariant measure. However, item (iii) is necessary.

Item (iii) of Assumption 4.1 is arguably the most restrictive one. It requires that the intensities of link creation and destruction are functions only of the given action profile. One can imagine examples where this assumption makes sense, but it is clear that many examples will not fit this description. Nevertheless we can give the following characterization of the conditional random graph measure, which is obtained from a straightforward application of Theorem 2.1.

Let us now present some simple examples of co-evolutionary processes of networks and play. The first example is a version of a model due to Jackson and Watts (2002b). The second example is a version of Staudigl (2011, 2013).


                           Jackson and Watts (2002b) combine the network formation model of Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) (see Section 3.2) with the dynamic network formation model due to Watts (2001), (see Section 4.1).

                                 Jackson and Watts (2002b) describe a dynamic evolving in discrete periods. The continuous-time version of their model given here differs in no substantial details, because the stochastic law of motion is the one of a Markov jump process. The discrete time models can be seen as embedded jump chains of the continuous-time model. See, e.g. Stroock (2005) for a general reference, and Staudigl (2010) for an explicit construction.

This choice function says that a player abandons his currently used action with relatively high probability 1−
                                    ∊, if there exists a strictly better action. Otherwise he sticks to his action and switches only with the relatively small probability ∊.

                                       This choice function uses a tie-breaking rule. Namely, if both actions are optimal for player i at x, then the choice function says that i continuous playing his current action.

Clearly this model is a version of a co-evolutionary process. The attachment and volatility mechanism depends however in a non-trivial way on the current network and the action chosen by the players, so that we cannot apply Proposition 4.2 to this model. However, this model can still be quite well understood in the extreme case where ∊
                           →0. Taking this limit, Jackson and Watts (2002b) show that the complete network will be observed most of the time (i.e. it is a stochastically stable state), and the players coordinate on a single strongly symmetric action profile. The interesting open question is which of the two symmetric equilibria will be played. Jackson and Watts (2002b) provide an exhaustive characterization of the long-run equilibria in this model.

                              In the proposition we require the number of players to be sufficiently large. This ensures that certain special cases are ruled out. See Jackson and Watts (2002b) for a complete statement of the Proposition.

Related to the Jackson and Watts (2002b) model is the coordination game scenario investigated by Goyal and Vega-Redondo (2005). Their paper is based on the two-way flow model of Bala and Goyal (2000), but adds the additional layer of complexity by allowing agents to derive utility from a coordination game as in Jackson and Watts (2002b). In the spirit of the two-way flow model, the unit of a one-step transition is not the edge, but the single individual. Specifically, Goyal and Vega-Redondo (2005) envision a dynamic co-evolutionary process in which at each time step a single individual receives a revision opportunity (independent of the other players) in which she can simultaneously change her action played in the coordination and the set of links she would like to support in the network realized in the next period. Once a network is realized, the agents play the coordination game π with all their neighbors.

                                 all players play 1 and the network is complete for N sufficiently large.
                              

Contrasted with the Jackson and Watts (2002b) model we see that one-sided link formation leads to sharper predictions as the noise in the players decision function is small and the society is sufficiently large.

In this example we consider a family of games in which the utility function u
                           
                              i
                            consists of two components. The first component is a common payoff term, interpreted as the externality a single players’ actions exert on the other players. The second component is an idiosyncratic payoff. As such it depends only on the player’s own choice. We assume that all players have the same action set, denoted by S. Making a slight change in notation, we write S
                           
                              N
                            for the set of action profiles. A typical element of this set is an N-tuple

As shown in Staudigl (2013) this model can be completely analyzed using elementary arguments. The (strong) assumptions making the model tractable are the strong symmetry of the reward function π and the particular specification of the volatility and attachment mechanism. Working with these assumptions, the long-run properties of the stochastic dynamics can be completely understood.

In this survey we have tried to give a short overview on a particular class of models designed for the modeling of the dynamic evolution of networks. Random graph models are combined with game theory to formalize the co-evolution of networks and play. This modeling approach reflects the interdisciplinary character of research on dynamic networks (both theoretical and applied). The models touched in this survey can and should be considered as only preliminary steps towards a more general theory. In the following lines we give some suggestions for future research and their challenges.

As mentioned in Section 1, we have avoided any discussion of weighted networks in this survey. The simple reason for this is that we feel that there is not a satisfactory theory out there in the moment. Much more efforts should be devoted to this very important class of networks, which are so prevalent in applications.

In many practical situations a system controller would like to ensure that a certain network structure will be achieved via decentralized decision making of the players. In such a model a controller collects a map of the vertices’ preferences before evolution starts, and given these data, a tax/subsidy scheme is designed so that a certain network architecture will be the outcome (at least with high probability).
                           35
                           For motivation, reconsider the local complementarity model of Section 3.1.2. Assuming Nash equilibrium play in the game where players choose efforts, we can now use this derived preference relation over graphs (7) to investigate the equilibrium payoffs as functions of the interaction structure. This leads naturally to questions of mechanism design and network optimization, both of which are very important questions in economics and operations research.
                        
                        
                           35
                         It is an interesting question how such a model extends to a dynamic evolutionary setting. We envision a Bayesian interaction model as in Section 4.3.2 as a reasonable modeling approach for this endeavor. Related to this question, we think that it is important to invest more effort to understand the connection between structural features of the players’ utility functions and the structure of stable networks (see Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5), but there is room for improvement. General characterizations of stable networks are so far missing (e.g. necessary conditions for existence and uniqueness or general conditions for emergence of particular networks). An important contribution to foster our understanding of “incentive-driven” network formation models is to start with a class of network games (potential games would be a reasonable starting point) and investigate the question how equilibrium network topologies change when basic properties of the utility function change. This is not only an important theoretical question, but may also be important for statistical identification.
