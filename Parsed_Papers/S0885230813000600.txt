                  Since Sag et al. (2002) highlighted a key problem that had been underappreciated in the past in natural language processing (NLP), namely idiosyncratic multiword expressions (MWEs) such as idioms, quasi-idioms, clichés, quasi-clichés, institutionalized phrases, proverbs and old sayings, and how to deal with them, many attempts have been made to extract these expressions from corpora and construct a lexicon of them. However, no extensive, reliable solution has yet been realized. This paper presents an overview of a comprehensive lexicon of Japanese multiword expressions (Japanese MWE Lexicon: JMWEL), which has been compiled in order to realize linguistically precise and wide-coverage natural Japanese processing systems. The JMWEL is characterized by significant notational, syntactic, and semantic diversity as well as a detailed description of the syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities of MWEs. The lexicon contains about 111,000 header entries written in kana (phonetic characters) and their almost 820,000 variants written in kana and kanji (ideographic characters). The paper demonstrates the JMWEL's validity, supported mainly by comparing the lexicon with a large-scale Japanese N-gram frequency dataset, namely the LDC2009T08 generated by Google Inc. (Kudo and Kazawa, 2009). The present work is an attempt to provide a tentative answer for Japanese, from outside statistical empiricism, to the question posed by Church (2011): “How many multiword expressions do people know?”
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The fact that linguistically idiosyncratic multiword expressions occur in authentic sentences with unexpectedly high frequency causes serious problems in linguistically comprehensive and precise natural language processing (NLP) based on compositionality. Since Sag et al. (2002), NLP researchers have become aware that proper treatment of such idiosyncratic multiword expressions (MWEs) is one of the most central and intriguing problems in the field.

In principle, the nature of the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: one is idiomaticity, i.e., non-compositionality of meaning; the other is the strong probabilistic affinity between component words. Many attempts have been made to extract these expressions from corpora capturing these properties, mainly using automatic methods that exploit statistical means. However, to our knowledge, no reliable, extensive solution has yet been made available, presumably because of the data-sparseness problem in the corpus-based approach and the difficulty of extracting correctly without human insight. Recognizing the crucial importance of such expressions, one of the authors of the current paper began in the late 1960s to construct for general use a Japanese computational lexicon with comprehensive inclusion of idioms, idiom-like expressions, and probabilistically idiosyncratic expressions. In this paper, we begin with an overview of this lexicon named JMWEL (Japanese MWE Lexicon). The lexicon contains about 111,000 head entries, written in the form of hira-gana (phonetic character) strings, and their almost 820,000 notational variants, i.e., the mixed strings of kana (phonetic characters) and kanji (ideographic characters) which are common in Japanese written texts.

As with simplex words, MWEs are generally categorized into function MWEs and content MWEs. Japanese has various types of function MWEs that play important roles similar to the syntacto-semantic roles of case-marking particles or auxiliary verbs. However, most previous MWE studies in NLP have been limited to particular subcategories of content MWEs, such as phrasal verbs, phrasal adverbs, compound verbs, compound nouns, light verb constructions (LVCs) and verb-object idioms. The present paper is partly based on our earlier work (Shudo et al., 2011), focusing on content MWEs, but has been substantially expanded to include function MWEs. Thus, the JMWEL is the combination of two sublexicons: the JMWEL/F containing function MWEs and the JMWEL/C comprising content MWEs. The combined JMWEL is thus a remarkably comprehensive resource awaited for decades in the field of NLP.

The most important features of the JMWEL are:
                        
                           1.
                           A large notational, syntactic, and semantic diversity of contained expressions.

A detailed description of the syntactic function, and syntactic structure of each entry expression.

An indication of the syntactic flexibility of entry expressions (i.e., the possibility of additional, internal modification of constituent words).

An all-in-one architecture with uniform encoding schemas for each MWE.

In Section 2, we outline the main features of the present study, first presenting a brief summary of significant previous work on this topic. In Section 3, we propose and describe the criteria for selecting MWEs and introduce a number of classes of multiword expressions. In Section 4, we illustrate some important statistical properties of the JMWEL mainly by comparing the lexicon with a large-scale Japanese N-gram frequency dataset, the LDC2009T08, generated by Google Inc. (Kudo and Kazawa, 2009). In Section 5, we outline the format and content of the JMWEL/F, discussing the information on notational variants, syntactic functions, syntactic structures, and semantic labels. In Section 6, we outline the format and content of the JMWEL/C, discussing the information on notational variants, syntactic functions, morphosyntactic structures, contextual conditions, inflectional variants of state-describing expressions, and the syntactic flexibility of MWEs. The paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 7.

                     Gross (1986) analyzed French compound adverbs and compound verbs. According to his estimate, the lexical stock of such words in French would be respectively 3.3 and 1.7 times greater than that of single-word adverbs and single-word verbs. Jackendoff (1997) notes that an English speaker's lexicon would contain as many MWEs as single-words. Sag et al. (2002) pointed out that 41% of the entries of WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum, 1999) are multiword. Uchiyama and Ishizaki (2003) reported that 44% of Japanese verbs are VV-type compounds. These and other similar observations underscore the great need for a well-designed, extensive MWE lexicon for practical natural language processing.

In the past, attempts have been made to produce an MWE lexicon. Examples include the following: Gross (1986) reported on a dictionary of French verbal MWEs with description of 22 syntactic structures; Kuiper et al. (2003) constructed a database of 13,000 English idioms tagged with syntactic structures; Baptista et al. (2004) reported on a dictionary of 3500 Portuguese verbal MWEs with ten syntactic structures; Fellbaum et al. (2006) discussed corpus-based studies used in the development of German verb phrase idiom resources; Laporte and Voyatzi (2008) reported on a dictionary of 6800 French adverbial MWEs annotated with 15 syntactic structures; and Wang and Yu (2010) reported on a Chinese idiom database, containing 38,000 idioms (derived from 11,000 basic idioms), and its applications. Our JMWEL approach differs from these studies in that it covers a comprehensive range of MWEs types, namely idioms, quasi-idioms, clichés, quasi-clichés, proverbs, old sayings, and onomatopoeic word combinations, each of which has quite diverse syntactic structures.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Compositional compounds, named entities, acronyms, and blends are beyond the scope of the JMWEL.
                      In contrast, the types of MWEs that most of the other studies dealt with are syntactically restricted as in, for example, verb-object idioms, verb-particle constructions (VPCs), verbal MWEs, support-verb constructions (SVCs), and so forth.


                     Villavicencio et al. (2004) proposed a general encoding schema for a MWE lexicon consisting of three component databases, one of which is an ordinary word lexicon, and is suitable for paraphrasing the semantically decomposable idioms by word-for-word replacement with equivalent ordinary expressions retaining the meaning. In contrast to the distributed organization of their MWE lexicon, the JMWEL is an all-in-one lexicon that provides direct access to the various morphosyntactic and semantic information for each MWE. Copestake et al. (2002) also proposed an encoding schema that aims for linguistic preciseness and reusability, exemplified with English compound nouns, verb-particle constructions, and idioms. Calzolari et al. (2002) proposed uniform standards for describing entries of multilingual MWE lexicons using complex nominals and support verb constructions as examples. However, it remains uncertain whether the frameworks of the studies listed here are sufficiently general for all types of MWEs as Laporte and Voyatzi (2008) pointed out.

Many attempts have been made to extract MWEs automatically using statistical corpus-based methods. For example, Pantel and Lin (2001) sought to extract Chinese compounds using mutual information and the log-likelihood measure. Fazly and Stevenson (2006) attempted to extract English verb-object type idioms by recognizing their structural fixedness in terms of mutual information and relative entropy. Bannard (2007) tried to extract syntactically fixed English verb-noun combinations using pointwise mutual information, and so on. In spite of these and many similar efforts including (Pecina, 2008) which suggested the potential of combining existing statistical association measures, it remains difficult to adequately extract MWEs from corpora using statistical approaches. This is because not only we still have no best association measure or combination of association measures that works well for all types of MWEs but also the corpus-wide distribution can be far from exhaustive regarding types of MWEs.

Paradoxically, to compile an MWE lexicon we need a reliable standard MWE lexicon for evaluating the automatic extraction by recall rate. Conventional idiom dictionaries published for human readers have occasionally been used for the evaluation of automatic extraction methods in some past studies. However, no conventional Japanese dictionary of idioms would suffice for an MWE lexicon for general NLP purposes because such dictionaries lack entries related to the diverse MWE objects we frequently encounter in common textual materials, such as quasi-idioms, quasi-clichés, metaphoric fixed or partly fixed expressions. Further, such dictionaries provide no systematic information on the notational variants, syntactic functions, or syntactic structures of the entry expressions. The JMWEL is intended to circumvent these problems. Recently, Church (2011) posed the question: “How many multiword expressions do people know?” Here, from outside statistical empiricism, we attempt to answer the question: “How many multiword expressions does an educated Japanese speaker know?”

There have been very few studies on function MWEs in other languages than Japanese. Exceptions include: Bouma and Villada (2002), who tried to extract Dutch collocational prepositional phrases (e.g., ten koste van “at the expense of”) by corpus-based statistical methods; and Trawiński (2003), who discussed the general treatment of complex prepositions (e.g., “in connection with”) in English and a number of other Western languages within the HPSG framework. Unlike these studies, the JMWEL/F contains all kinds of Japanese function MWEs, i.e., relation-marking MWEs and post-predicate MWEs, rather than just complex postpositions, which correspond to complex prepositions or prepositional phrases in Western languages.

A few earlier lexicological studies on NLP of Japanese MWEs have been reported:


                     Shudo (1980) proposed a lexicon of 2500 function MWEs, a prototype of the JMWEL/F, and a grammatical framework based on the lexicon for machine analysis of natural Japanese sentences. Sato (2007) compiled a comparative list of 3600 basic Japanese idioms from five existing idiom dictionaries published for human readers. His list provides an overview of Japanese idioms but contains no morphological, syntactic, or semantic information for NLP. In contrast, the JMWEL contains 4400 idioms covering every idiom listed by Sato (2007), plus information on their notational variants, syntactic functions, mophosyntactic structures, and flexibilities. Matsuyoshi et al. (2006) reported on a dictionary of function MWEs generated in nine stages hierarchically from 341 root nodes to 16,801 leaf nodes. Leaf nodes correspond to their head entries lemmatizing every inflected, notational, and colloquialized variant.

                           masu.
                      In contrast, the JMWEL/F, which contains about 3400 function MWE candidates but abbreviates most of the inflected and colloquialized MWEs derivable from their canonical forms by rules, seems to correspond to their sixth stage of generation which produces about 1800 MWEs. They estimated the recall rate of their function MWEs generated at the seventh stage to be 84%, taking the prototype of the JMWEL/F reported by Shudo (1980) as the gold-standard lexicon.

The foci of other studies on Japanese MWEs are rather diverse. Examples include the following: Koyama et al. (1998) achieved a seven-point increase in the precision rate of kana-to-kanji conversion for a commercial Japanese word processor by applying a prototype of the JMWEL with 65,000 MWEs; Baldwin and Bond (2002) discussed the general treatment of Japanese MWEs in the framework of (Sag et al., 2002); Shudo et al. (2004) noted the importance of non-propositional meanings such as the generalized modality denoted by Japanese post-predicate MWEs; Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009) reported on a Japanese idiom corpus and the results of an idiom identification experiment conducted using the corpus. Their corpus targeted 146 ambiguous idiom types, and consists of 102,856 sentences, each of which includes an idiom token and is annotated with a literal/idiomatic label, an idiom ID, and a lemma; Izumi et al. (2010) devised a method to paraphrase strings of Japanese auxiliary verbal MWEs into simpler expressions retaining the original meanings; and a portion of the JMWEL has been used recently by Fothergill and Baldwin (2012) to disambiguate the literal/idiomatic meanings of MWE tokens, utilizing the idiom corpus developed by Hashimoto and Kawahara (2009).

Deliberate human judgment is indispensable for the correct, extensive extraction of MWEs. Therefore, using a variety of publications, such as newspaper articles, journals, magazines, novels, and dictionaries, we have manually extracted multiword expressions that have definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative functions and are linguistically idiosyncratic. In principle, the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: first, semantic non-compositionality (i.e., idiomaticity); second, the strong probabilistic affinity between component words. Here we have treated these two aspects differently.

In our approach, we use the non-substitutability criterion to define a word string as an MWE, the logic being that an MWE is usually fixed in its form and the substitution of one of its constituent words would yield a meaningless expression or an expression with a meaning that is completely different from that of the original.

                           3
                           The notion of non-substitutability was introduced by Manning and Schütze (1999) as an important characteristic of collocations. It was used by Pearce (2001) for collocation extraction utilizing WordNet as a source of synonymic information.
                         That is, a word string w1w2…w
                           i
                        …w
                           n
                         is an MWE if it has a definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative function of its own, and if w1w2…w
                           i
                        ’…w
                           n
                         is either meaningless or has a meaning completely different from that of w1w2…w
                           i
                        …w
                           n
                         for some i, where w
                           i
                        ’ is any synonym or synonymous phrase of w
                           i
                        . For example, 
                           
                        (w1)-

                        aka-no-tanin (lit. “red stranger”) is selected because it has a definite nominal meaning of “complete stranger” and neither 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        (w1′)-
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        sinku-no-tanin nor

                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        reddo-no-tanin means “complete stranger.” Table 1
                         shows a number of non-compositional MWEs.
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           These classes are not necessarily disjoint.
                         The evaluation of the semantic relevance of MWEs was carried out entirely by human judges. It is simply too difficult to judge semantic relevance automatically and correctly using any technology currently available. In several recent works on the automatic detection of compositionality and metaphoricity of MWEs e.g., (McCarthy et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003; Shutova et al., 2012; Schulte im Walde et al., 2013), the precision of the semantic judgments was manually ensured.

An MWE must form a linguistic unit of its own. We therefore adopt this and the following transition probability criterion to define what an MWE is. That is, a word string w1w2…w
                           i
                        …w
                           n
                         is an MWE if it has a definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative function of its own, and if its forward or backward transition probability 
                           p
                        
                        f(w
                           i+1 | w1…w
                           i
                        ) or 
                           p
                        
                        b(w
                           i
                         | w
                           i+1…w
                           n
                        ), respectively, is judged to be in the relatively high range for some i. With this definition, for example, 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        te-wo-komaneku “fold arms” is selected as an MWE because it is a complete verb phrase and 
                           p
                        
                        b(
                           
                         | 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        ) is judged empirically to be very high. No general probabilistic threshold value can be fixed a priori because the value is highly expression-dependent. Although a probabilistic judgment was performed for each expression in turn, on the basis of the developer's mental lexicon, especially its probabilistic aspect, the resulting dataset is on the whole consistent with this criterion, as shown in Section 4.1. Table 2
                         lists some MWEs of this type.
                           5
                        
                        
                           5
                           These classes are not necessarily disjoint.
                         With entries like these, the JMWEL would enable a parser in NLP to effectively disambiguate the syntactically acceptable structures of the sentence by prioritizing the high-transition-probability word combination as a phrase.

Thus, presupposing a kind of predictive, word-affinity-driven parsing in our mind, we designed the JMWEL as a collection of not only non-compositional phrases but also high-transition-probability word combinations.

Of the MWEs in the JMWEL, approximately 42% and 92% were judged to fulfill the criteria shown in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Thus, 34% were judged to fulfill both criteria. For example, while the expression 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        abura-wo-uru (lit. “sell…oil”) “slack off” fulfills criterion 3.1 but not criterion 3.2, 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        gussuri-nemuru “sleep soundly” fulfills criterion 3.2 but not 3.1. 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        kata-no-ni-wo-orosu (lit. “lower load from the shoulder”) “take a big load off one's mind” fulfills both criteria.

In the JMWEL, the number of morphemes in an MWE, i.e., the length of the MWE, ranges from two to eighteen. The length distribution of MWE types in the JMWEL is shown in Fig. 1
                        . Approximately 90% of MWEs fall within the range of bigram to pentagram. The morphemes we counted as segments here are: ordinary simplex words (including particles); prefixes (e.g., the polite prefix 
                           
                         
                        o in 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        o-miyage “souvenir”); prefixing constituents (e.g., 
                           
                         
                        han “anti-” in 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        han-genpatu “anti-nuclear-power”); suffixes (e.g., the nominalizing suffix 
                           
                         
                        sa “-ness” in 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        omosiro-sa “interestingness”); and suffixing constituents (e.g., the counter suffix for animal 
                           
                         
                        hiki in 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        ni-hiki-no-buta “two pigs”). Inflectional endings are not counted as segments in the JMWEL.

Without a rule system of semantic composition, it is difficult in principle to evaluate the validity of the JMWEL concerning idiomaticity. However, we can confirm that all approximately 4000 standard Japanese idioms from more than five Japanese dictionaries published for human readers
                        6
                     
                     
                        6
                        They are Kindaichi and Kindaichi (2005), Kindaichi (2005), Kindaichi (2006), Miyaji (1982), Onoe (1993), and Yonekawa and Ohtani (2005). The numbers of idioms they include are 2590, 336, 873, 1546, 3610, and 1566, respectively.
                      are included in the JMWEL as a proper subset.

Furthermore, the JMWEL contains more than 40,000 quasi-idioms, with detailed information on their syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities, as explained in Sections 5 and 6.

We examined the statistical properties of the JMWEL using the Japanese Web N-gram, version 1: LDC2009T08, which is a word N-gram (1≤
                        N
                        ≤7) frequency dataset generated from 2×1010 sentences in a Japanese Web corpus, supplied by Google Inc. (Kudo and Kazawa, 2009). We will refer to this (or the Web corpus examined) subsequently as GND. We will refer to trigram w1w2w3 as an NpV-trigram only when w1 and w3 are restricted to a noun and a verb (ending form), respectively, and w2 is one of the following particles: accusative 
                           
                         
                        wo, subjective 
                           
                         
                        ga, or dative 
                           
                         
                        ni.
                           7
                        
                        
                           7
                           The NpV-trigrams represent the typical forms of shortest Japanese sentences, corresponding roughly to subject-verb, verb-object/direct, and verb-object/indirect constructions in English.
                         We write the number of occurrences of an expression x, counted in the GND, as C(x).

First, in order to see how w3 had been selected for each w1w2 in the NpV-trigram w1w2w3 of the JMWEL, we let J and G be a set of substring Np's (types) of NpV-trigrams in the JMWEL and a set of substring Np's (types) of NpV-trigrams which occur in the Web corpus, respectively. And we let R
                           
                              i
                            be a set of substring Np's (types) of NpV-trigrams whose top-rank-verbs are i-th most frequent among all verbs following them in the Web corpus, where the top-rank-verb is defined for each Np as the verb which is most frequent in the corpus among verbs constituting NpV-trigrams in the JMWEL.

                              8
                              Thus, R
                                 
                                    i
                                 ∩R
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                                 =ϕ(null set), where i

                                 j.
                            For example, the Np-bigram

                           2, because C(

                           ) is largest among C(

                            We used the Japanese word dictionary IPADIC (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003) for the POS annotation to GND data. We thus obtained the following data: |J|=14,075, |G|=110,822, |J∩G|=10,548, |R
                           1|=4983, |R
                           2|=1495, |R
                           3|=786, |R
                           4|=433, and so on, where |X| and J∩G denote the cardinality of a set X and the intersection of J and G, respectively. From these, we realize for example that 47.2%=(|R
                           
                              1
                           |/|J∩G|)×100 of Np's (types) in NpV-trigrams in the JMWEL are followed by verbs that occur most frequently in the Web corpus. An example of such a bigram is

                           akushon-wo in the trigram 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           
                           akushon-wo-okosu (lit. “raise action”) “take action” in the JMWEL. Similarly, 14.0%= (|R
                           2|/|J∩G|)×100 are followed by the second-most frequent verbs, 7.5% are followed by the third-most frequent verbs, and so on. Fig. 2(a) shows the results. From this, we can assume that the higher probability 
                              p
                           
                           f(w3 | w1w2) a trigram w1w2w3 has, the more likely w3 is chosen for each w1w2 in the JMWEL. This is consistent with what we wrote in Section 3.2. Fig. 2(b) is the accumulative equivalent of Fig. 2(a).

Further, extrapolating Fig. 2(b) suggests that 10% of the bigrams Np's (types) in NpV-trigrams in the JMWEL are followed by verbs which do not follow the bigram in the Web corpus. This implies that the size, i.e., 2×1010 sentences, of the Web corpus used by the GND is not sufficiently large to allow MWE extraction,
                              10
                           
                           
                              10
                              This connotes the remarkably long-tailed distribution of MWEs in corpora. This is also connoted, for example, by (Breen and Baldwin, 2009) which attempted to extract Japanese compound verbs (JCVs) from the GND and found that only 78.4% (4779) of correct JCVs (6094), which had been selected in advance, could be matched in the corpus.
                            in so far as all expressions contained in the JMWEL are genuinely MWEs. Examples of trigrams in the JMWEL missing in the Web corpus are

Second, in order to see what w1w2 had been selected to constitute the NpV-trigram entry w1w2w3 of the JMWEL, we calculated the normalized entropy Hf(w3 | w1w2) for each w1w2∈G defined below, where the probability

                           f(w3 | w1w2) is estimated by C(w1w2w3)/C(w1w2).

After arranging 110,822 bigrams in G in ascending order of Hf(w3 | w1w2), we divided them into 20 intervals A
                           1, A
                           2,…,
                           A
                           20, each with an equal number of bigrams (5542). We then examined how many bigrams in J∩G were included in each interval. Fig. 3(a) and (b) plot the resulting constituent ratio of the bigrams in J∩G and the mean value of Hf(w3 | w1w2)’s in each interval, respectively. We found, for instance, that 1262 out of 5542 bigrams are in J∩G for the first interval, i.e., the constituent ratio is 22.8%=(1262/5542)×100. Similarly, we obtain 22.5%=(1248/5542)×100 for the second interval, 20.5%=(1136/5542)×100 for the third, and so on. Fig. 3 shows the result. From this, we realize the macroscopic tendency that the larger the entropy Hf(w3 | w1w2), or equivalently the perplexity of the succeeding verb w3, a bigram w1w2 has, the less likely it is that it is adopted as a prefix of a trigram in the JMWEL.

Taking the results in Figs. 2 and 3 together, we can presume that not only frequently but also exclusively occurring verbs would be the preferred choice for NpV-trigrams in the JMWEL. Although these investigations were carried out on the forward conditional probabilities for NpV-trigrams only, the results imply a general characteristic of the JMWEL, namely that probabilistically and exclusively affined word combinations are preferred in the JMWEL, since the same criteria for selection were applied to all kinds of multiword expressions. This characteristic would be highly appropriate for the predictive parsing mentioned in Section 3.2.

We found that while the number of NpV-trigram types occurring in the GND and the number of NpV-trigram types shared by the GND and the JMWEL were 3,336,358 and 39,549, respectively. The token size of NpV-trigrams in the GND and the token size of NpV-trigrams shared by the GND and the JMWEL were 2,510,582,977 and 352,350,049, respectively. Thus, the sublexicon of the JMWEL that occupies only 1.19%=(39,549/3,336,358)×100 of NpV-trigram types occurring in the Web corpus covers 14.0%=(352,350,049/2,510,582,977)×100 of NpV-trigram tokens occurring in the Web corpus.

In addition to the above investigations using N-gram frequency data, we manually examined 2500 randomly selected sentences in Nikkei daily newspaper articles published in 2009 to determine how many MWE tokens of the JMWEL occurred. We found that the average rates of occurrence of function MWE tokens and content MWE tokens per sentence were 0.586 and 0.735, respectively.

                           The front page of the Nikkei newspaper mainly runs editorials and articles on business, politics, and economic affairs, plus a short essay; the last page usually covers cultures, arts, literature, etc.
                         
                        Tables 3 and 4
                        
                         show the statistics. The content MWEs counted in Table 4 include inflected, particle-exchanged, particle-inserted, or passivized variants of MWE candidates and those that were absent from, and subsequently added to, the JMWEL/C (102,000-entry version) at the time of examination. Taking the original forms of these variants, we estimated the type level recall rate of the JMWEL/C for the content MWEs at the time of examination to be around 80.6%. Similarly, the type level recall rate of the JMWEL/F for function MWEs was estimated to be around 87.1%. About 3.4% of the content MWE tokens were found to be gapped, i.e., with internal modifiers, in the newspaper articles.

As in the case of simplex words, MWEs are generally divided into function MWEs and content MWEs (Fries, 1948). Japanese function MWEs are roughly subcategorized into relation-marking MWEs and post-predicate MWEs. Relation-marking MWEs express the semantic dependency relations between noun phrases and predicate phrases in Japanese sentences in the same way as case-marking or connective particles. They correspond roughly to English complex prepositions such as “with respect to,” “in order to,” and “in terms of,”. In contrast, post-predicate MWEs express modality, tense, aspect, voice, the speaker's attitude, etc., and occur immediately after predicate phrases just as Japanese auxiliaries or sentence-ending particles. They correspond roughly to English “be able to,” “might have,” “have to,” “could you,” etc. These two categories are further subcategorized as shown in Tables 5 and 6
                     
                     . The JMWEL/F contains all these function MWEs, but not variants obtainable by particle-exchanging, particle-insertion, or colloquialization by using the politeness auxiliary

In this section, we outline the format and contents of the JMWEL/F. A record in the JMWEL/F is composed of seven fields: header entry (Field-H), notational variants (Field-N), syntactic category (Field-Cat), dependent (Field-Dep), governor (Field-Gov), syntactic structure (Field-St), and semantic label (Field-Sem), as shown in Figs. 4–7
                     
                     
                     
                     .

The header entry of each MWE is stated in Field-H in the form of a non-segmented hira-gana (phonetic character) string such as 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        ni-yot-te (lit. “approaching” and “depending”) “by” shown in Fig. 4.

                           The purpose of Field-H is to enable the JMWEL to be used for speech processing tasks in NLP.
                        
                     

Japanese has three notational options: hira-gana, kata-kana, and kanji. Hira-gana and kata-kana are phonological syllabaries. Kanji are idiographic characters. As we have many kanji characters that are both homophonic and synonymous, sentences can contain kanji replaceable by others, retaining the same meaning. In addition, the inflectional suffix of some verbs can be absent in some contexts. The JMWEL has flexible conventions to cope with these characteristics. It uses brackets to indicate an optional character or word (or a series of interchangeable characters or words marked by a slash “/”) in the Field-N description. The dash “-” is used as a word boundary indicator. Hence, an entry

The syntactic category code of a function MWE, shown in Tables 5 and 6, is prescribed in Field-Cat. These codes correspond to root node labels in the syntactic tree representation of an MWE. In Fig. 4, for example, the code CP indicates that 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        ni-yot-te is a complex postposition.

Field-Dep is filled with the syntactic category code of a phrase that depends on the MWE concerned. In Fig. 4, the indication NP in Field-Dep requires the complex postposition 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        ni-yot-te to occur immediately after a noun phrase. Similarly, in Fig. 5, the complex connective-particle

                        -
                           
                         
                        sae-sure-ba is required immediately after an adverbial form of a verb phrase VP22.
                           14
                        
                        
                           14
                           In the structural description, a two-digit suffix after the POS (or a phrase) symbol denotes a particular inflectional form.
                        
                     

Field-Gov is filled with the syntactic category code of a phrase to be modified by the MWE concerned. In Fig. 4, the description VP in Field-Gov stipulates that the complex postposition 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         forms an adverbial phrase that depends on a verb phrase. Thus, Field-Cat, Field-Dep, and Field-Gov in Fig. 4 together indicate that 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         is a complex postposition that occurs after a noun phrase to form a complex postpositional phrase that depends on a verb phrase VP. No governor is designated in Fig. 6 because the complex auxiliary 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        ta-koto-ga-aru is an MWE whose final verb 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        aru “exist” is in the basic (ending) form. Similarly, no governor is indicated, as in Fig. 7, in the case of complex sentence-ending particles because its final constituent is usually a single-word sentence-ending particle that cannot depend on any element.

The dependency structure of an MWE is given in Field-St by a phrase marker bracketing the dependent/governor (i.e., modifier/head) pairs, using POS symbols for content words and lower-case Latin characters phonetically for function words.
                              15
                           
                           
                              15
                              The intra-sentential dependency relation in Japanese is unilateral, i.e., the left modifier depends on the right head.
                            In Fig. 4, the complex postposition CP

                           ni-yot-te is given a description [[[$ ni]V23′]te] in Field-St, which denotes the structure illustrated in Fig. 8
                           , where 
                              
                            
                           ni, 
                              
                            
                           te, and V23′ are postposition (case-marking particle), connective particle, and POS symbol for the adverbially and euphonically conjugated form of a verb, respectively. In Fig. 8,

                           netu “heat” to form a complex postpositional phrase 
                              
                           -

                           netu-ni-yot-te “by heat.” This complex postpositional phrase depends on a verb phrase 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           tokeru “melt down” in Fig. 8, yielding the verb phrase 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           netu-ni-yot-te-tokeru “melt down by heat.” No function MWE constitutes a complete phrase itself in the sense of phrase-structure grammar because it lacks the main dependent. In Fig. 4, the symbol “$” in the description [[[$ ni]V23′]te] represents a missing dependent of the postposition (case-marking particle) 
                              
                            
                           ni. The designation of NP in Field-Dep of Fig. 4 means that the missing dependent should be a noun phrase such as 
                              
                            
                           netu “heat” in Fig. 8. Similarly, designations VP23 in Field-Dep and [[[[$ ta]N]ga]*V30] in Field-St of Fig. 6 together mean that the complex auxiliary verb CAux 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -

                           ta-koto-ga-aru should be subsequent to an adverbial form of a verb V23 and that the resulting structure would be [[[[V23 
                           ta] N]ga]*V30], as shown in Fig. 10.


                           Fig. 9

                           ka are an adverbial particle and a sentence-ending particle, respectively. The MWE is used with main verb phrase

In Fig. 6, a description [[[[$ta]N]ga]*V30] is given in Field-St for the complex auxiliary CAux 
                              
                           -

An asterisk “*” in the description means that the subsequent verb V30 can be modified internally by some additional phrases. Thus, when used with the main verb 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           taberu “eat,” the description allows a derivative expression such as

                           tabe-ta-koto-ga-sando-aru (lit. “an event that…ate…exists three times”) “have eaten…thrice,” shown in Fig. 10, where the additional internal modifier is the adverb 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           sando “thrice.”

Thus, the words-with-spaces treatment is inadequate for some function MWEs because of their flexibility to take additional internal modifiers. The internal modifiability of MWEs will be discussed further in Section 6.4.4.

The content of Field-Sem is currently initialized to semantic labels, exemplified in Tables 7 and 8
                        
                        , which were obtained by classifying the relation-marking MWEs and post-predicate MWEs in terms of their meanings. These – which are concerned with the semantic relationship between concepts, tense, aspect, modality, or pragmatic information expressed in the sentence – would constitute a framework for semantic processing in various NLP tasks. Further details about these were reported by for example Shudo et al. (1980, 2004) and Shudo (1980).

In this section, we outline the format and content of the JMWEL/C. Content MWE entries in the JMWEL/C are categorized as in Tables 9 and 10
                     
                     . Each record in the JMWEL/C is composed of seven fields: header entry (Field-H), notational variants (Field-N), category (Field-Cat), syntactic structure (Field-St), forward contextual condition (Field-Cf), backward contextual condition (Field-Cb), and paradigm of state-describing MWEs (Field-V), as shown in Fig. 11
                     .

The dictionary entry (header) of each content MWE is stated in Field-H in the form of a non-segmented hira-gana (phonetic character) string, such as

As explained in Section 5.2, we use brackets to indicate an optional word (or a series of interchangeable words marked by a slash “/”) in the Field-N description. Hence, the description (

                         and

                        /
                           
                        ), four in (

                        /
                           
                        ), and three in (
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        /
                           
                        /
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        ). The total number of content MWEs fully expanded with this information is estimated to be around 820,000.

As in the case of function MWEs, Field-F is filled with a syntactic or communicative category code, shown in Tables 9 and 10, which corresponds to a root node label in the syntactic tree representation of an MWE.

The dependency structure of a content MWE is given in Field-St in the same manner as for function MWEs. For example, the idiom 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           makka-na-uso (lit. “crimson lie”) “downright lie” is given a marker [[K00 
                           na] N]. This description represents the structure shown in Fig. 12
                           , where K00 and N are POS symbols denoting an adjective-verb stem and a noun, respectively.

The JMWEL contains approximately 49,000 complex verbals (CVs), making this the largest functional class. For these verbal entries, more than 90 basic patterns are used as structural descriptors in Field-St. This fact can convey the broadness of the structural spectrum of Japanese verbal MWEs. Some examples are shown in Table 11
                           .

Approximately 2500 MWEs in the JMWEL/C contain internal coordinate structures. This information is described in Field-St by bracketing with “<” and “>” or “《” and “》,” and the coordinated parts by “(” and “).” The coordinative phrase specification usually requires that the conjuncts must be parallel with respect to the syntactic function of the constituents appearing in the bracketed description. For example, the expression 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           ato-ha-no-to-nare-yama-to-nare (lit. “the rest might become either a field or a mountain”) “what will be, will be,” has an internal coordinate structure. Thus, its Field-St is [[N ha]<([[N to] V60])([[N to] V60])>]. This description represents the structure shown in Fig. 13
                           , where V60 denotes an imperative form of the verb.

The rigid coordination, which is sometimes non-distributive, is marked by “《” and “》.” For example, 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           un-dei-no-sa (lit. “difference between cloud and mud”) “big difference” is given the description [[《(N)(N)》no]N] in Field-St; that is, it cannot be paraphrased by distributing to 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            AND 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            “difference of cloud” AND “difference of mud.” Fig. 14
                            shows the structure.

A special kind of linguistic idiosyncrasy we encounter in not only colloquial but also common textual materials such as newspaper articles, novels, essays, etc. is syntactic ill-formedness of content MWEs. Thus, some content MWEs in the JMWEL/C do not make a complete phrase in the sense of context-free grammar but still form a syntactic unit on their own. For example, the word string 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           to-ha-it-temo (lit. “even if (one) say…”) is often used as a discourse-relation marker, meaning “nevertheless,” in spite of the fact that it lacks a constituent immediately preceding the case-marking particle 
                              
                           
                           to. Fig. 15
                            illustrates the structure of this example, where its category and structural description are CDRM and [[[[$ to]ha]V23′]temo], respectively.

                              We classify complex discourse-relation markers (CDRMs) as content MWEs rather than function MWEs because of their syntactic independence.
                            The symbol “$” in the structural description denotes a virtual constituent to complete the phrase structure.

                           yurikago-kara-hakaba-made “from the cradle to the grave” is an adjunct of two postpositional phrases but is often used as a state-describing complex noun, as in 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -

                           yurikago-kara-hakaba-made-no-hoshou (lit. “security of from cradle to grave”) “security from the cradle to the grave.” Thus, its Field-Cat and Field-St have a functional code CNom and a description [[N kara][[N made] $]], respectively. This structure is shown in Fig. 16
                           . There are two types of ill-formedness: one is open-ended on the left and the other open-ended on the right. The examples in Figs. 15 and 16 are open-ended on the left and right of the expression, respectively. The total number of structural basic types of content MWEs specified in Field-St is greater than 6000. This fact demonstrates that Japanese MWEs present a wide structural variety.

Many content MWEs are not fixed-length word strings, rather they allow additional phrasal modifiers internally. Japanese MWEs have an almost unlimited level of flexibility regarding internal modifiability. As briefly noted in Section 5.6.2, this aspect is captured in our system by prefixing a modifiable element of the structural description stated in Field-St of the respective MWE entry with an asterisk “*.” An adverbial MWE 
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                           -
                              
                            
                           ue-ni-nobe-ta-you-ni “as I explained above” is one such MWE. It thus has a description [[[*[[N ni] *V23] ta] N] ni] in Field-St, meaning that the third element V23 is a verb that can be modified internally by adverbial phrases. Since the asterisk designates optional phrasal modification, our system allows a derivative expression like

                           -

                           riyuu-wo-ue-ni-kuwasiku-nobe-ta-you-ni “for the reason I explained in detail above,” which contains two additional internal adverbial modifiers: a postpositional phrase

                           . Similarly, the description [[*Nwo]*V30] given in Field-St of Fig. 11 allows a derivative expression such as 
                              
                            
                           
                              
                            
                           
                              
                           -

                              Thus, the type of internal modifier is currently restricted syntactically by the syntactic category of the word to be modified. Finer restrictions would lead to the semantic characterization of the modifier, being connected with the literal/idiomatic disambiguation problem. For example, the description [Nwo]*V30 in Field-St given to the idiom 
                                    
                                 -

                                 -

                                  is not acceptable for the idiomatic reading. Such a semantic restriction on the internal modifier must be left to future work in connection with the literal/idiomatic disambiguation problem of the MWE candidates.
                           
                        

We introduce a convention that the head of a phrase that immediately follows an asterisk can take modifiers only at the position of the asterisk. Thus, while the head of P2 might be modified by additional expressions immediately preceding P1 or expressions immediately preceding P2 in the case of *[P1*P2], which is the pattern in Fig. 17, i.e., *[[Nni]*V23], it is not allowed to take additional modifiers which immediately precede P2 in the case of *[P1P2], where P1 and P2 are phrase descriptions.

In the structural descriptions of an MWE, the absence of the asterisk between adjacent constituents indicates their strongest bondage. That is, its idiosyncratic reading allows no modifier intervening these constituents. This could be utilized for disambiguating literal/idiomatic meanings of the MWE candidate as Fothergill and Baldwin (2012) attempted.

Approximately 32,000 MWEs in the JMWEL are rigid, namely have no asterisk in Field-St, meaning that our examination showed internal modification was not permitted.

Approximately 6700 content MWEs need to be classified differently because they require particular forward contexts, i.e., they require co-occurrence of a particular syntactic phrase in the context that immediately precedes them. For example, the NpV-type Japanese light verb constructions (LVCs), whose N is a noun denoting part of the body, e.g., 
                           
                         
                        kao “face,” 
                           
                         
                        asi “leg,” etc.; p is an accusative case-marking particle 
                           
                         
                        wo; and V is a light verb 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        suru “do,” cannot occur independently without an immediately preceding modifier of N in the sentence. Thus, 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        kao-wo-suru (lit. “do face”) given in Fig. 11 requires an immediately preceding adnominal modifier, e.g., the adjective 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        kanasii “sad,” yielding 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                         
                        kanasii-kao-wo-suru (lit. “do sad face”) “make a sad face,” shown in Fig. 18. This adnominal modifier co-occurrence requirement is stipulated in Field-Cf by a code <adnom. modifier>, if necessary. There are about 30 of these forward contextual requirements.

Similarly, there are about 70 backward contextual requirements, which are stated in Field-Cb. For example, a complex adverb 
                           
                        -
                           
                        -
                           
                        
                        ke-hodo-mo (lit. “by a hair's breadth”) “(not) at all” requires a governing phrase in the right-hand position that includes the negation auxiliary 
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        
                        nai “not.” This is stipulated by a code <negation> in Field-Cb.

Approximately 300 content MWEs require particular backward contexts.

Besides adjectives and adverbs, Japanese grammar has a special part of speech for words that describe the state of things, actions, movements, or events; this is termed an “adjective-verb” and its adnominal, adverbial, and predicative ending particle is basically “
                           
                         
                        na,” “
                           
                         
                        ni,” and “
                           
                         
                        da,” respectively. Many MWEs have functions similar to the adjective-verb but have a much greater variety of inflectional patterns. Field-V gives the individual inflectional pattern in the form α-β-γ, where α, β, and γ denote a set of adnominal, adverbial, and predicative ending particles, respectively. For example, a complex adjective-verb 
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        
                           
                        -
                           
                         
                        ware-kanse-zu (lit. “I don’t care”) “no concern of mine” is given the description, {no, toiu, toitta}-{de}-φ(null set) in Field-V, yielding 
                           
                        -

                        (de) as an adverbial form. The number of patterns exceeds 300. To the best of our knowledge, no detailed paradigm for these state-describing MWEs has been published in the Japanese linguistics literature prior to the present work.

In this paper, we introduced a Japanese MWE Lexicon (JMWEL) which was manually and meticulously produced, namely it is a compilation of our research on Japanese MWEs over a period of forty years. The philosophy underlying the JMWEL is that the volume and meticulousness of the lexical resource crucially affects the outcome of linguistically precise, large-scale NLP. In view of this, the JMWEL was designed to encompass the wide range of linguistic objects related to Japanese MWEs, by placing importance on the recall rate in the selection of the candidate expressions and the great detail of information given in the lexicon.

The very heterogeneous nature of MWE phenomena necessitates an enormous amount of time to make decisions on the encoding schemas for the lexicon. In fact, the authors spent a long period of trial and error before deciding on the encoding schema for the information contained in the JMWEL, paying considerable attention to the compactness, richness, and uniformity of the description. The encoding schema introduced in the present paper could prove informative for MWE lexicology.

The authors suppose that about 90% of MWE types in commonplace publications such as newspapers, journals, novels, etc. have been captured in the JMWEL and that the final extent of the lexicon might be around 125,000 MWEs, given the gradual fall in the rate of new entries over time. Interestingly, this final figure seems to be of a similar order to Jackendoff's (1997) estimate for English. Thus, the present work might be close to an answer for Japanese to the question raised by Church (2011).

The framework we employed in the JMWEL to describe the dependency structure of the expressions incorporates gaps indicated by asterisks, as explained in Sections 5.6.2 and 6.4.4. This could allow the lexicon to include expressions that are as flexible as regular (non-idiosyncratic) phrases. In this sense, the JMWEL might be understood as a core subset of the general phrase lexicon in which an unconstrained increase of phrases is well controlled by the selection criteria discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. From another perspective, the JMWEL could be regarded as a slotted tree bank for idiosyncratic expressions, annotated with detailed notational, syntactic information. Correlative studies on the JMWEL and Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi and Rambow, 2003) would be intriguing but must be left to future research.

Our analysis of newspaper text suggests that the JMWEL has high coverage. This and the fact that the JMWEL includes all the standard idioms contained in the dictionaries published for human readers as well as more than 40,000 quasi-idioms suggest that the JMWEL could become a fundamental lexical resource for a new era of Japanese language processing.

Possible fields of application of the JMWEL are manifold, including, for example:
                        
                           •
                           Phrase-based machine translation (RBMT, EBMT, or PBSMT).

Phrase-based speech recognition.

Phrase-based kana-to-kanji conversion.

A search engine for a Japanese corpus.

A paraphrasing system.

A Japanese dialog system.

A Japanese language teaching system.

Another aspect of the JMWEL is that it would provide linguists with lexicological data. For example, the use of Japanese onomatopoeic adverbs, which are mostly bound probabilistically to specific verbs or adjectives, is extensively cataloged in the JMWEL. Further, the paradigmatic studies on the adjective-verbal expressions presented in Section 6.7 would also be informative for Japanese linguistics.

Some sublexicons of the JMWEL have already been released. The remainder will be released after final revisions.

In future versions, we would like if possible to add further information to each MWE on morphological variants, passivization, relativization, decomposability, paraphrasing, and semantic disambiguation.
