                  Demand-based pricing is often used to moderate demand fluctuations so as to level resource utilization and increase profitability. However, such pricing policies may not be effective when customers’ purchase decisions are influenced by social interactions. This paper investigates the demand dynamics, under a demand-based pricing policy, of a frequently purchased service when social interactions are at work. Customers are heterogeneous and adaptively forward-looking. Existing customers’ re-purchase decisions are based on adaptively formed price expectations and reservation prices. Potential customers are attracted through social interactions with existing customers. The demand process is characterized by a two-dimensional dynamical system. It is shown that the equilibrium demand can be unstable. For a given reservation price distribution, we first analyze the stability of the equilibrium demand under various scenarios of social interactions and customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior, and then characterize their dynamics using the bifurcation plots, Lyapunov exponents and return maps. The results indicate that the demand process can be stable, periodic or chaotic. The study shows that the intended effect of a demand-based pricing policy may be offset by customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior under the influence of social interactions. In fact, the interplay of these factors may even lead to chaotic demand dynamics. The result highlights the complex dynamics produced by a simple demand-price mechanism under social interactions. For a demand-based pricing strategy to be effective, companies must take social interactions into account.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The demand for services in industry sectors like energy, telecommunication, transportation, restaurants, theme parks, hotels, etc., often fluctuates following some peak-and-off-peak patterns. During peak periods, demand cannot be always met due to capacity constraints; while capacity may become excessive in off-peak periods. Indeed, demand fluctuations pose real challenges to service operations management. A typical strategy in practice to level the uneven demand is to adopt a peak/off-peak pricing policy or a so-called demand-based pricing policy. The trick is to shift some demand from peak periods to off-peak periods so as to level capacity utilization and increase profitability. Such pricing strategy was adopted, e.g., in electricity supply (Chen, Wu, & Fu, 2012), restaurant operations (Kimes & Wirtz, 2002), and transportation management (Hensher & Puckett, 2007), etc.

From the perspective of capacity allocation and resource management, the effectiveness of such demand-based pricing policies can be critical to a firm’s competitiveness. From the perspective of customer service, such policies, if executed appropriately, can enhance a service provider’s reputation. However, in the age of social media (e.g., social networking sites, on-line virtual communities, and instant messengers, etc.), such policies must be tested or evaluated in the context of social interactions. Pioneered by Becker (1974), social interactions are defined as “particular forms of externalities, in which the actions of a reference group act on an individual’s preferences” (Scheinkman, 2004). Customers’ purchase decisions and future consumption intentions do not only depend on the service prices, but also on factors such as price expectations, reservation prices, and the influences from others through social interactions.

                        For instance, surveys reveal that 81percent US respondents indicated posts from their friends directly influenced their purchase decisions; see Forbes, 7 May 2012, “Are Brands Wielding More Influence In Social Media Than We Thought?”, available at http://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/05/07/are-brands-wielding-more-influence-in-social-media-than-we-thought/.
                     
                  

For frequently purchased services, customers’ purchase decisions may be always made due to forward-looking propensities. Specifically, before making purchase decisions, customers have price expectations and reservation prices. Customers’ forward-looking behavior has been widely studied and empirically tested, for example, documented in Nevo, Turner, and Williams (2015), subscribers are forward-looking in consuming the residential broadband service, which is charged by the usage-based pricing policy. Social interactions with others may influence customers’ price expectations and reservation prices thus purchase decisions. This is especially true for new customers who have had no prior experiences for reference. Such customer behavioral factors taking effect during social interactions can potentially induce variability and unpredictability to the demand process, to the extent of chaos, leading to a complex dynamical service system. When a demand-based pricing policy is implemented in such situations, the goal of leveling demand may not be achieved as intended.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of social interactions on the effectiveness of demand-based pricing policies in service operations. We focus on the stability and chaotic behavior of the demand process in a service system. Customers are assumed to be heterogeneous and adaptively forward-looking in terms of their reservation prices when making purchase decisions. We divide customers into two separate groups, namely existing customers who have purchase experiences from the service system that influence their price expectations and reservation prices, and potential customers who are attracted to the service company due to social interactions with existing customers. We model the demand process by a two-dimensional dynamical system. Applying chaos theories to a complex dynamical system, we analyze the impact of these behavioral factors on the demand dynamics. We first solve the equilibrium of the system and then characterize its stability through the Jacobian matrix valued at the equilibrium point. Based on a specific reservation price distribution function, we analyze the dynamics of the demand process under various scenarios of social interactions and customers’ forward-looking behavior. Bifurcation plots, Lyapunov exponents, and return maps are used to characterize the dynamic patterns of the system. It is demonstrated that the demand process can be stable, periodic or even chaotic due to social interactions, and their interplay with customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior. When the system becomes chaotic, the effectiveness of a demand-based pricing policy in moderating demand fluctuations may be compromised. The result highlights the need to appropriately consider the context in which an operational policy is implemented.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the literature review. Section 3 presents the demand dynamical model with heterogeneous and adaptively forward-looking customers in the context of social interactions. In Section 4, we analyze the dynamic behavior of the demand process by simulating various scenarios of social interactions, followed by discussions and managerial implications. Section 5 concludes the paper with future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Two streams of literature are closely related to the current study. The first stream is about the demand and price interactions in a service system, the dynamic characteristics of the demand and price processes, and corresponding equilibrium dynamics in the supply-demand framework. The second stream is on the influence of social interactions in customers’ purchase decisions, which has been widely studied, e.g., in Bearden and Etzel (1982) and Becker (1991). A particular type of social interactions is the word-of-mouth communication among customers, which is “the primary factor behind 20–50 percent of all purchase decisions” (Jacques, Jonathan, & Ole Jorgen, 2010).

Demand-based pricing policies have been widely adopted in revenue management, e.g., in the airline (McGill & van Ryzin, 1999) and hospitality industries (Kimes & Wirtz, 2002), even though such pricing policies may have unintended effects on perceived fairness (Beldona & Kwansa, 2008; Beldona & Namasivayam, 2006). Srinivasan, Pauwels, and Nijs (2008) develop a conceptual framework to examine the circumstances under which retailers choose demand-based pricing versus past-price dependence for different brands and categories. It is demonstrated that firms are more likely to choose demand-based pricing if customer-driven and firm-driven costs of adjusting pricing patterns are low or the benefits from price adjustment are high. Hensher and Puckett (2007) investigate the role of demand-based pricing as a travel demand management instrument to reduce congestion to improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, the effectiveness of demand-based pricing has not been discussed in the context where social interactions are significantly influential.

Several studies have shown that customers’ purchase behavior has a direct impact on the demand or price process of frequently purchased products or services. The demand or price process may exhibit complicated dynamics, such as stability, periodicity or chaos, even if the operational policy is fixed and deterministic. Rump and Stidham (1998) demonstrate that the price and the arrival rate processes of a frequently purchased service, due to customers’ adaptive expectations in price, can exhibit chaotic phenomenon when the system is operated with a deterministic policy. Haxholdt, Larsen, and van Ackere (2003) show that a simple deterministic queueing system can exhibit various complicated behavior, including sustained oscillations, mode locking, quasi-periodic behavior, or even chaos.

In a general supply-demand framework, typically in a cobweb model, several studies demonstrate that due to various behaviors of decision makers, such as their adaptive expectations on the price or the quantity, the price and demand processes may appear chaos if the supply and demand curves are nonlinear (Hommes, 1994). In the so called adaptively rational equilibrium dynamics, Brock and Hommes (1997) find that, in a cobweb type supply-demand model, the irregular equilibrium price path may converge to a strange attractor and result in the state of chaos. This is due to suppliers’ heterogeneous beliefs about the demand, where their beliefs are updated using the discrete choice model (Manski & McFadden, 1981). In the extended model with forward-looking suppliers, Brock, Dindo, and Hommes (2006) show that the amplitude of price fluctuations may be dampened, but local instability of the steady state remains. Specifically, if suppliers are perfectly forward-looking, the price path converges to a stable period-2 cycle; whereas if suppliers are also bounded rational in their estimate of expected profits, small amplitude chaotic price fluctuations may arise.

In a simulation study, van Ackere, Haxholdt, and Larsen (2013) investigate the impact of customers’ reactions on the capacity adjustment in a service system, where customers’ join decisions are based on their waiting time expectations while the manager gradually adjusts the capacity based on his demand expectation. The result indicates that the demand and capacity could be mismatched due to various behavioral factors in decision making. The above mentioned studies mainly focus on the price and demand dynamics resulting from decisions made by suppliers who are adaptive, rational or forward-looking.

Learning from sociologists, psychologists and economists, it is shown that decisions made by individuals are often socially influenced by their observations, perceptions, or anticipations of decisions made by others (Lopez-Pintado & Watts, 2008). For example, social interactions do affect investment in education, political opinion formation, consumption choice, diffusion of innovations, etc. (Brock & Durlauf, 2001; Hartmann et al., 2008; Lopez-Pintado & Watts, 2008; Manski, 2000).

As a pioneer in this field, Becker (1991) provides interesting insights, using an economic model, into why social interactions contribute to a stark contrast of the popularity of some restaurants versus the unpopularity of nearby competitors. Brock and Durlauf (2001) investigate the rational expectations’ equilibria in the discrete choice model where an individual’s utility depends on one’s own choice and others’. By examining the impact of social interactions on the stock market participation, Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2004) show that social interactions contribute to the household investment intention. To understand the optimal entry timing in a new market, Joshi, Reibstein, and Zhang (2009) conclude that a firm’s strong presence in an existing market has a positive influence (the leverage effect) on product adoption in the new market, but the reciprocal social influence on the existing market is negative (the backlash effect). Social interactions can even influence employees’ choices of health plans in an organization (Sorensen, 2006).

Customers’ adoption behavior of new products may be socially influenced too through the way of marketing and interpersonal communications (Manchanda, Xie, & Youn, 2008). Other examples of applications whereby the impact of social interactions is observed, among others, include the diffusion of electronic medical records in U.S. hospitals based on a social contagion perspective (Angst, Agarwal, Sambamurthy, & Kelly, 2010), the optimal strategy of providing online product information and reviews (Chen & Xie, 2008), and social network users’ application download patterns (Onnela & Reed-Tsochas, 2010).


                        Nakayama and Nakamura (2004) conduct an interesting study on the impact of social interactions on the system dynamics in terms of the adoption rate of a fashion. Two types of effects due to social interactions are highlighted, namely, the bandwagon effect (the positive correlation between one’s adoption decision and others’) and the snob effect (customers feel weary or bored when the fashion is overly popular). Using a Logit model and simulation, they show that, under certain parameters, the dynamics of the adoption rate can be periodic or chaotic due to social interactions. In an increasingly networked economy and society, would the results be very different if the customers are adaptively forward-looking in price expectations? Would the system dynamics be more complex in the presence of social interactions? These questions are yet to be answered.

Motivated by the widespread influence of social media and the gap in the existing studies, we investigate the effectiveness of demand-based pricing policies under social interactions. While the model in Nakayama and Nakamura (2004) is one-dimensional and customers’ forward-looking behavior is not considered, the demand dynamics investigated in our paper are modeled by a two-dimensional system, where both social interactions and customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior as well as their interplay contribute to the complex demand dynamics.

Consider a firm (e.g., a restaurant) that provides some frequently purchased service to customers. Suppose the quality of the service is generally kept consistent, while the price of the service is the major deciding factor in customers’ purchase decisions. Due to the characteristics of the service, the demand during the peak and off-peak periods is uneven. The service provider adopts a demand-based pricing policy to manage the demand. Specifically, the higher the demand is, the higher the price. For ease of reference, the notations of the key parameters and functions as well as their domains are listed in Table 1
                        .

To facilitate the model formulation, the key assumptions are explained as below:

                           
                              •
                              
                                 In each period, customers belong to two separate groups, either the existing customers or the potential customers. Existing customers have purchased the service in the previous period, while potential customers have not. For existing customers, re-purchase decisions are directly influenced by their past experiences of the service; while for potential customers, due to the lack of transaction experiences for reference, their purchase decisions are mainly influenced through social interactions with existing customers.


                                 Customers are heterogeneous and adaptively forward-looking in purchase decision-making. Forward-looking customers derive their purchase decisions based on price expectations (how much the service will cost) and reservation prices (the highest price they are willing to pay). Customers are heterogeneous in price expectations or reservation prices. Customers’ adaptiveness, due to the reference effect in forming price expectations or reservation prices is characterized by the Prospect Theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).


                                 Through social interactions, potential and existing customers share identical reservation prices and price expectations. Existing customers who will return to purchase the service will attract potential customers to purchase the service, denoted as the positive social interaction effect; while those who will not return may discourage potential customers to purchase the service, denoted as the negative social interaction effect. Thus, the social interactions characterized in this paper are similar to the word-of-mouth communication.

                           Like the stock market, charging prices based on real-time demand information has been adopted in practice, such as the pricing of energy consumptions in Faria and Vale (2011). Real-time pricing policies are also adopted in other service sectors, for example, the beer price at the Big Board (which can be accessed through http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-big-board-washington), a bar located in Washington, is adjusted time to time and displayed in a big screen based on the orders from customers. The pricing mechanisms implemented on most bidding web sites are also based on the real-time demand information (measured by the number of bids). Note that, μt
                               can also be explained as the predicted demand in each period, i.e., our model can be applied in the situation where the price is charged based on the predicted demand.
                         The price-demand relationship is also applicable to the situation where the firm first gathers the timely demand information and then determines the price, e.g., through pre-order systems.

                           For example, restaurants usually offer different prices for meals based on reservation time slots (see New York Times, 4 September 2012, “When It Comes to Reservations, Time is Money”, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/dining/restaurant-prices-can-vary-by-reservation-time.html?smid=pl-&_r=0).
                        
                     

We model customers’ heterogeneity and their adaptively forward-looking behavior as follows. At the beginning of each period t, an existing customer i has price expectation

Intuitively, a higher experienced price will lead to a smaller proportion of existing customers to re-purchase the service, since customers may purchase substitutable services to satisfy their needs. Therefore, we assume

Based on the above assumption, we have the following result in terms of the equilibrium demand under δ ∈ (0, 1) in the two-dimensional system (the proof is in Appendix A):

Having loyal customers guarantees a unique equilibrium point in the demand-price dynamics. The stronger the social interaction strength is, the higher the equilibrium point; similarly, the more loyal customers, the higher the equilibrium point. Managerially intuitive, it is important to strengthen a firm’s reputation through social interactions, and broaden the base of loyal customers.

The stability of the equilibrium points plays an important role in the demand dynamics, which drives the dynamical system to exhibit various phenomena. Therefore, we focus on the stability of the equilibrium point in the following section. Intuitively, if there are no social interactions or loyal customers, i.e., 
                           
                              υ

                         the demand in the dynamical system will decrease gradually and converge to (0, 0), since no potential customers enter the market. The firm will exit the market eventually unless all customers frequently purchase the service in each period, i.e.,

                         (for example, there is only one service provider as a monopolist located in an area, where customers have no alternative choices). For the two-dimensional system, the stability of the equilibrium point can be determined by the Jacobian matrix (referred to simply as Jacobian thereafter), which is defined at any point

As shown above, the characteristics of the eigenvalues at the equilibrium point determine the complex dynamical behavior in its various forms. Since the adaptive parameter δ and the social interaction strength 
                           υ
                         are critical factors that determine the two eigenvalues, the demand process may exhibit complex behaviors, including the existence of saddle points. The exact analysis of the stability of the equilibrium point depends on the property of the reservation price distribution function in the dynamical system; however, it is useful to discuss the possible impact of δ and 
                           υ
                         on the stability of the equilibrium point.

In summary, for any δ ∈ [0, 1], the dynamical system may always be unstable if the effect of social interactions 
                           υ
                         is strong, and always stable if the effect of social interactions 
                           υ
                         is weak. In other words, if more (fewer) potential customers are attracted by returned customers, the equilibrium demand may always be unstable (stable). Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the demand process may not be impacted by how customers form price expectations when the effect of social interactions is strong or weak, but may be impacted when the effect of social interactions is moderate.

Since the impact of 
                        υ
                      and δ also depends on customers’ reservation price distribution, the exact analysis of the dynamical behavior of the demand process based on specific distribution functions is needed to better understand the complex behavior of the demand dynamics. A simulation approach is adopted to investigate the effectiveness of the demand-based pricing policy under a wide range of scenarios. The following reservation price distribution is used to analyze the stability of the two-dimensional dynamical system:

Based on the submodular property (Topkis, 1998), we have the following result in terms of the optimal price that the firm can charge in order to induce the maximum demand given customers’ price expectations (the proof is in Appendix A):

                        Proposition 1 suggests that in order to induce a large demand, the optimal price should decrease in customers’ price expectation. Specifically, if customers’ price expectation is low (high), then the optimal price should be larger (smaller) than the expected price. If customer’s expected price increases, then the proportion of returned customers decreases and the demand in the next period also decreases.

For any τ ∈ [0, 1], social interactions are inactive; while τ < 0 implies active social interactions among customers. The Jacobian is reduced as below

                            is always unstable. The dynamics of the one-dimensional map can be analyzed through multiple measures (Devaney, 1989), including the bifurcation plot, which graphically shows the dynamic behavior of the system after the transient stage, and the Lyapunov exponent, which measures the sensitivity of the system on initial conditions.

For a given 
                              
                                 υ

                            an initial demand μ
                           0 is randomly selected in the range [1, 2]; the simulation is run for 1000 time units; the first 500 data points in the transient stage are discarded while the remaining 500 data points are plotted and the Lyapunov exponent is calculated; then the value of 
                              υ
                            is increased by 0.001 and the above procedure is repeated. The bifurcation plot in terms of the equilibrium demand and the corresponding Lyapunov exponent calculated using the method in Eckmann and Ruelle (1985) are shown in Figs. 1
                            and 2
                            respectively.

From Fig. 1, we can see various dynamic behaviors of the model, such as the stable region with a stable node, the bifurcation region with periodic points, the period-3 region and the chaotic region. The existence of the period-3 region indicates the system appears chaos in Li-Yorke sense (Li & Yorke, 1975). The critical value of 
                              υ
                            for the existence of the period-3 region can be analyzed similarly as in Yuan and Hwarng (2012). If 
                              υ
                            increases beyond 10, the system is mostly chaotic. If 
                              υ
                            is beyond 22, the demand process seems to converge to 0 from the bifurcation plot. This is due to the precision of the computer simulation and the exponential function in the model. The corresponding Lyapunov exponent in Fig. 2 also indicates the behavior of the dynamical system in various states, where a positive Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos; while a negative value indicates the system is stable and if the Lyapunov exponent is zero, the system is periodic.

The above result indicates, if customers’ price expectations are determined by the price from their mostly recent purchase experience, i.e.,

                            the impact of social interactions on the demand dynamics can be dramatic, especially when social interactions become more active and intense. When the strength of social interactions increases, the dynamics of the demand process may change from stable to periodic, or even chaotic. In another word, the demand-based pricing policy may be effective in moderating demand fluctuations if social interactions are inactive; while its effectiveness may be weakened if social interactions become increasingly prominent.

Similarly, from Fig. 3, various dynamic behaviors of the model, such as the stable regions, periodic points after bifurcations, period-3 regions and chaotic region can be observed. The corresponding Lyapunov exponent in Fig. 4 also characterizes the complex dynamic behavior of the demand process in various states quantitatively.

                            is small, the demand-based pricing policy will be effective in moderating demand fluctuations under both situations. However, if 
                              υ
                            becomes larger, the demand-based pricing policy may be effective if customers’ price expectations are not influenced by past experienced prices, while ineffective if their price expectations are influenced by the recent experienced price. However, if 
                              υ
                            becomes even larger, the demand-based pricing policy will become ineffective in moderating demand fluctuations under both situations.

The above two special cases show that social interactions significantly impact the demand dynamics under the demand-based pricing policy. If the social interaction strength is small, adopting a demand-based pricing policy may achieve the purpose of moderating demand fluctuations, since the demand eventually converges to a stable point. However, when the social interaction strength becomes large, the demand may become periodically oscillating and eventually chaotic. The managerial implication is that even if customers are not adaptive in price expectations, the effectiveness of the demand-based pricing policy may be weakened due to the influence of social interactions.

In this section, we investigate the demand dynamics under δ ∈ (0, 1), where customers’ price expectations are adaptively updated in each period. Since the equilibrium demand μ

                            is determined by the magnitude of the smaller eigenvalue.

                            may become a saddle point if the social interaction strength becomes large. The existence of the saddle point in a nonlinear dynamical system may suggest there exist more complex dynamic patterns of the demand process, e.g., chaos.

To better grasp the impact of social interactions and their interplay with customers’ forward-looking behavior on the demand dynamics, in Fig. 5, we first plot several typical demand patterns under various scenarios of 
                                 υ
                               and δ to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the demand process.

As discussed before, the social interaction strength

                               captures the magnitude of demand amplification, and it can be interpreted as the size of new customers attracted by returned customers, i.e.,

                               to be more accurate. As shown in Fig. 5(a), when the social interaction strength is relatively small, such as

                               the demand path eventually converges to a stable node, and the demand-based pricing policy achieves its purpose to level demand; while when the social interaction strength becomes large, such as

                               the demand paths converge to a periodic cycle with period 2 in Fig. 5(b) and period 4 in Fig. 5(c), and eventually fluctuate among various points without any clear patterns, i.e., chaos in Fig. 5(d). In other words, the demand-based pricing policy fails to achieve its intended purpose of moderating demand fluctuations when a returned customer can attract more potential customers. Customers’ price expectations, captured by the parameter δ, may also impact the stability of the demand process.

Since there are two critical parameters δ and

                               we first draw the bifurcation plot and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponent with respect to one parameter by keeping the other fixed. As the model is a two-dimensional system, there are two Lyapunov exponents of which the larger one is plotted. As shown in Fig. 6

                              . By Proposition 4, it is clear that

                               is in the range where for some δ ∈ (0, 1),

                               may be a stable node or a saddle point. The critical value of δ can be calculated approximately as

Thus, if δ ∈ (δc
                              , 1) then

                               is a stable node; while under δ ∈ (0, δc
                              ),

                               is a saddle point. At the critical value, a flip bifurcation occurs with two stable period-2 equilibrium points. For some ranges of δ, the demand process becomes chaotic. The corresponding Lyapunov exponent in Fig. 7 further confirms the presence of chaos in the random-like region as seen in Fig. 6.

                              . The system becomes chaotic as 
                                 υ
                               increases when δ is small, e.g., δ < 0.5.

The first return map as plotted in Fig. 12
                               shows some typical patterns of the demand process. The strange attractor seen in Fig. 12(d) further confirms the chaos observed in Fig. 8.

The occurrence of the chaotic behavior turns out to be closely related to the existence of a homoclinic orbit. It can be shown that there indeed exists a homoclinic point in the two-dimensional dynamical system using the same methods in Brock and Hommes (1997) and Yokoo (2000).

From the above results, we conclude that the complex demand dynamics indicate that social interactions and customers’ forward-looking behavior as well as their interplay may weaken the effectiveness of the demand-based pricing policy. The complex demand dynamics are also confirmed by the previous numerical example in Fig. 5. Under a fixed social interaction strength 
                                 
                                    υ
                                    ,
                                 
                               the demand-based pricing policy may be effective if customers become less sensitive to experienced prices in their price expectations, i.e., δ becomes large; while for a fixed δ, the demand-based pricing policy may weaken its intended role in managing demand fluctuations if social interactions are active, i.e., 
                                 υ
                               becomes large.

In the previous sections, we assume there are no loyal customers in the system, i.e., 
                           
                              
                                 μ
                                 l
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . From Section 3.2, we know that the presence of loyal customers may also impact the demand dynamics under social interactions. It has been shown that there exists a unique equilibrium point (μ
                        ⋆, μ
                        ⋆), which increases in μl
                         > 0 or 
                           
                              υ
                              ,
                           
                         such that μ
                        ⋆ > μl
                        .

We first qualitatively analyze the dynamic behavior of the model with respect to an extensive base of loyal customers, i.e., a relatively large μl
                        , and a limited base of loyal customers, i.e., a relatively small μl
                        . When μl
                         decreases and approaches zero, we can show that the dynamic behavior is similar to the result when 
                           
                              
                                 μ
                                 l
                              
                              =
                              0
                              ,
                           
                         since the dominant factors are 
                           υ
                         and δ in the model. The demand dynamics for a large μl
                         can be analyzed qualitatively as follows. Since the equilibrium point μ
                        ⋆ is also large and approaching μl
                         from the above, the Jacobian at (μ
                        ⋆, μ
                        ⋆) is approximately as

                         Therefore, the moduli of the two eigenvalues are both less than 1 for δ ∈ (0, 1). Besides, for a small δ, the determinant is negative, i.e.,

                        ⋆, μ
                        ⋆) is a stable node. Therefore, for a large μl
                        , we conclude that the presence of loyal customers may suppress the chaotic behavior in the demand dynamics.

The stability of (μ
                        ⋆, μ
                        ⋆) can be determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian. However, with three parameters in the model it is too complicated to analyze its dynamic nature analytically. Simulation is adopted to investigate the impact of loyal customers on the demand dynamics. Fig. 13

Recall that the dynamical system exhibits chaos under the parameters

                        . As seen in Fig. 13, system dynamics evolve from chaos to periodic cycles and eventually a stable state as μl
                         increases. As μl
                         increases further, the system will be stable for 
                           
                              υ

                         for any δ ∈ [0, 1].

It can be concluded that if the firm maintains a sizeable base of loyal customers the demand-based pricing policy will be more effective in moderating demand fluctuations, even though social interactions are active. Thus, managers may need to focus on enhancing customers’ loyalty, and expanding the base of loyal customers to improve operational efficiency.

As shown in the preceding analysis, the key observation is that: the demand dynamics can be significantly influenced by social interactions, customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior, and their interplay. More specifically,

                           
                              •
                              Demand processes can be stable when social interactions are inactive, or become periodic or chaotic when social interactions are active among potential customers and existing customers.

Demand processes are more stable if customers are less sensitive to experienced prices, or may become periodic or even chaotic if customers’ price expectations are more likely to be influenced by recently experienced prices.

Demand realizations can be easily trapped into the periodic or chaotic region if social interactions are active and customers are more readily to update price expectations.

The presence of loyal customers “stablizes” demand dynamics to a certain extent, even if social interactions are at work.

The influences of social interactions, customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior and their interplay may lead to unintended consequences of demand-based pricing policies, where unpredictable demand patterns, e.g., chaos, could appear. The existence of chaotic demand dynamics could be understood by how the demand-based pricing policy works. Due to social interactions, potential customers will be attracted by the returned customers to purchase the service. The realized demand will be jointly determined by new customers and returned customers. Active social interactions will bring more demand, followed by a higher price under the demand-based pricing mechanism. Customers’ price expectations will rise, then the number of returned customers will decrease. Counter-intuitively, due to social interactions, demand may not be lessened although the re-purchase proportion becomes lower. Consequently, the demand-based pricing policy fails to achieve its intended purpose in moderating demand fluctuations.

Therefore, under social interactions, demand-based pricing mechanisms may not be effective to achieve leveled demand processes with adaptively forward-looking customers. The existence of demand chaos may explain why the demand realizations are still uneven, even if demand-based pricing policies or similar practices are implemented. The presence of loyal customers plays two roles in demand dynamics. Loyal customers are not sensitive to price changes, and their demand is more stable. Their influence on the demand of new customers through social interactions is also predictable. These two effects of loyal customers lead to a more stable demand process. More loyal customers also help maintain a higher equilibrium demand under social interactions.

Social interactions and customers’ behavior factors may compromise the intended purpose of demand-based pricing policies. For service providers, to achieve a stable, predictable demand process and a balanced operation, it is necessary to exploit customers’ purchase behaviors and the role of social interactions. In practice, the magnitudes of 
                           υ
                         and δ can be estimated empirically using real demand data, field study, surveys or even laboratory experiments. Companies may resort to innovative tools and methods to tap into social networks to cultivate and manage customer relations. Particularly, under social interactions, sticking to a fixed and constant price may be more effective than the demand-based pricing policy in moderating demand fluctuations. A constant and fixed price may help customers form consistent price expectations and reservation prices, leading to a more predictable demand process.

Managers should also focus on how to influence customers’ purchase decisions through proactive operational strategies. Providing timely and transparent information, such as the congestion condition of a service system, to customers may be more effective in reducing demand variability and leveling resource utilization than a demand-based pricing policy. Real-time information not only prevents customers from joining an already congested service system, but also helps service providers improve demand forecast and capacity planning to achieve stable operations, and enhance customers’ satisfaction and loyalty. Since more loyal customers contribute to a more stable demand process and a higher equilibrium demand, maintaining a sizeable base of loyal customers will improve the effectiveness of the demand-based pricing policy to ensure stable demand dynamics – a competitive advantage. To sum up, under social interactions, demand-based pricing policies or similar approaches may not be an appropriate operational strategy to effectively manage supply and demand in service operations. Instead, service providers need to resort to other operational strategies to properly manage demand and supply.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Demand-based pricing policies have been widely adopted in service industries to moderate demand, level resource utilization while increase profitability. However, the effectiveness of such policies is not well understood in today’s highly connected economy where social interactions are at work. Customers’ purchase decisions are often subject to price expectations and reservation prices. This happens because customers are often adaptively forward-looking in terms of value proposition. Social interactions, customers’ forward-looking behavior, and the interplay of these factors may offset the intended purpose of demand-based pricing policies, and even lead to undesirable and complex situations such as demand chaos.

Based on a stylized two-dimensional dynamical system, we investigate the effectiveness of a demand-based pricing policy on moderating demand fluctuations under various conditions of heterogeneous customers’ expectations and social interactions. We demonstrate that due to the influence of social interactions and customers’ forward-looking behavior, the demand process can exhibit stable, periodic or chaotic phenomena. Counter-intuitively, the result shows that a demand-based pricing policy may not be necessarily effective in moderating demand fluctuations. Due to the impact of behavioral factors, e.g., social interactions, customers’ adaptive expectations and forward-looking disposition, the intended purpose of demand-based pricing policies is compromised. A useful observation from this outcome is that any operational policy must be examined in the appropriate context, e.g., under the influence of social interactions in this case. Therefore, it is necessary to exploit customers’ purchase behaviors and the role of social interactions.

Our contribution lies in the ability to capture the demand-price relationship using a two-dimensional dynamical model to shed light on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the demand-based pricing policy. This is achieved by incorporating both social interactions and customers’ adaptively forward-looking behavior as well as the interplay of these factors. While existing studies, e.g., Nakayama and Nakamura (2004), focus on either social interactions or customers’ behavioral factors, but neglect the impact of these two forces and their interplay on demand dynamics. The current study is, however, limited to the price being the dominating factor in customers’ purchase decisions. In different contexts, service quality or waiting time can be dominant in consumers’ purchase decision making. Besides a simple fixed pricing policy, though reasonable and observable in practice, it would be interesting to explore the optimal pricing policy in the context of social interactions with adaptively forward-looking heterogeneous customers. In the similar context, a potentially interesting and challenging question is the pricing issue for firms in competition. Further investigations are needed.

                           Since the larger eigenvalue is always bounded in [0, 1], we only need to focus on the smaller eigenvalue, which is always negative. The critical value of the smaller eigenvalue is

In the first case, a flip bifurcationwith two period-2 equilibrium points occurs at the critical value δc
                              . Based on the Jacobian, it can be shown that the two period-2 equilibrium points are both stable.□
