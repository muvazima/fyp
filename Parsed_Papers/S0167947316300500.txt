                  We propose Bayesian shrinkage methods for coefficient estimation for high-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models using scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for independently sampled additive noises. We also suggest an efficient selection procedure for the shrinkage parameter as a computationally feasible alternative to the traditional MCMC sampling methods for high-dimensional data. A shrinkage parameter is selected at the minimum point of a newly proposed score function which is asymptotically equivalent to the mean squared error of the model coefficients. The selected shrinkage parameter is presented in a closed form as a function of sample size, level of noise, and non-normality in data, and it can be efficiently estimated by using a suggested variation of cross validation. Consistency of both of the cross validation estimator and proposed shrinkage estimator is proved. The competitiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated based on comprehensive experimental results using simulated data and high-dimensional plant gene expression data in the context of coefficient estimation and structural inference for VAR models. The proposed methods are applicable to high-dimensional stationary time series with or without near unit roots.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are very useful for analyzing the interrelationship among a set of time series variables, whose application includes forecasting economic time series (Sims, 1980, 1982; Doan et al., 1984; Bańbura et al., 2010), and structural inference in areas such as biology (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007) and neuroscience (Harrison et al., 2003). However, since the number of parameters in a VAR model grows quadratically with the dimensionality of the model, estimating a high-dimensional VAR model faces significant challenges such as overfitting with given sample points, while high-dimensional models have recently received a lot of attention (Fan and Li, 2006) due to improvement in data collection technologies.

In high-dimensional cases, the penalized least squares (PLS) methods such as the ridge and LASSO regressions have often been used as alternatives to the ordinary least squares (OLS) method (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970; Tibshirani, 1996) among various estimation methods of the VAR coefficients. More recently, the shrinkage method for large-scale covariance matrix estimation developed by Schäfer and Strimmer (2005) has been applied to VARs and it outperformed the ridge and LASSO regressions for high-dimensional data with relatively small sample sizes (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007). We will call this shrinkage approach as the nonparametric shrinkage (NS) method because it does not assume any specific parametric distribution for data. While being successful, NS is prone to overshrink estimates of the VAR coefficients for large sample sizes (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007). The shrinkage parameter controlling the shrinkage rate of the NS estimates is selected under the assumption of independence between data points (Schäfer and Strimmer, 2005), which is not appropriate for time series data.

In this paper, we propose an alternative shrinkage method for VAR models in a Bayesian framework. It is known that the NS estimates can be interpreted as posterior mode estimates when the VAR coefficients have independent normal priors under the assumption of multivariate normal distributions for additive noises (Litterman, 1986). In general, estimates based on posterior distributions of the model coefficients approach the true value of the coefficients as more and more data accumulate if the sampling model is correct (Gelman et al., 1995). This phenomenon is expected to help circumvent the overshrinkage in the NS method.

In order to address a wide class of real data analysis tasks, we develop a Bayesian framework under the assumption of scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions. Scale mixtures of univariate normal distributions have been used for modeling outliers and analysis of robustness of Bayesian models (Andrews and Mallows, 1974; West, 1984). Special cases of scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions include the multivariate Student 
                        t
                     -distribution (Ni and Sun, 2005) and multivariate Laplace distribution (Eltoft et al., 2006). We propose iterative procedures for inferences based on posterior distributions using conjugate priors and non-conjugate priors, respectively. The Ridge and NS estimates also arise as special cases of the posterior mode estimates.

Moreover, for the selection of the shrinkage parameter, which is a hyperparameter in Bayesian VAR shrinkage, we propose a computationally feasible alternative to traditional methods such as the maximization of marginal likelihoods (Chib, 1995; Litterman, 1986; Lopes et al., 1999; Koop and Korobilis, 2009) and Bayesian MCMC sampling methods (Ni and Sun, 2005), for high-dimensional VAR models. For this purpose, we propose a score function of the shrinkage parameter as an improved marginal likelihood, taking account of the difference between the marginal posterior distribution and its limiting distribution in the context of information theory (Akaike, 1978). We show that the expected value of the proposed score function is asymptotically equivalent to the mean squared error of the posterior mode estimates, and we select the minimum point of an upper bound on the expected value as the shrinkage parameter. The selected shrinkage parameter is presented in a closed form which provides a clear interpretation about the effects of the sample size, level of noise in data, and level of non-normality of the noise distribution to the shrinkage level. Next, as a computationally feasible methodology for obtaining the selected shrinkage parameter, a variation of multifold cross validation (CV) is suggested in a way that alleviates the bias in the multifold CV method (Hastie et al., 2001).

We also show the consistency of the proposed shrinkage estimator as well as the multifold cross validation estimator under the assumption of VAR processes with additive noises sampled from scale mixtures of multivariate normals. It is known that the multifold cross validation is not consistent in linear regression where the goal is to select the best model among candidates unless the size of validation sets increases dominatingly fast (Shao, 1993). However, it is noted that in nonparametric regressions where the goal is to estimate mean functions or smoothing parameters, the multifold cross validation including leave-one-out cross validation possesses consistency (Yang, 2007). In this paper, we consider VARs with stochastic predictor variables unlike standard linear regressions. The proof technique is closely related to Wong (1983) developed for kernel nonparametric regression. As a result, the assumptions made for proving the consistency suggest that the size of validation sets in multifold cross validation does not need to increase as fast as in Shao (1993).

We conducted an extensive simulation experiment for evaluation and comparison of various standard VAR estimation methods under various data-generating conditions, e.g., low- and high-dimensions of the model, VAR models with near unit roots, mild and strong correlations between noise variables, and multivariate 
                        t
                     -distributions. The experimental results based on the simulated data and 800-dimensional plant gene expression data demonstrate that the suggested shrinkage methods produce favorable results compared with the other methods.

This paper is organized in six sections as follows. In Section  2, we develop a Bayesian framework for VAR models with scale mixtures of multivariate normal distributions and with conjugate and non-conjugate prior distributions. The posterior mode estimates are computed iteratively by a weighted least squares method. In Section  3, we propose a score function of the shrinkage parameter, and a closed form for the selected shrinkage parameter is presented. A computational methodology for obtaining the shrinkage parameter value is described, which is called parameterized cross validation. In Section  4, consistency of the parameterized cross validation and multifold cross validation is stated explicitly. In Section  5, we present extensive experimental results based on simulated data and high-dimensional plant gene expression data to demonstrate the competitiveness of the suggested methods. Discussions are given in Section  6 with some concluding remarks.

To sum up, the interpretation of the selected “asymptotically optimal” value of 
                           λ
                         gives a more refined insight into the role of the shrinkage parameter in addition to that given in Schäfer and Strimmer (2005).

Although the selected value

                         therein is yet a function of unknowns. We will outline a computational methodology for finding the value

                         based on data.

Conventional cross validation (CV) methods, including the 
                           K
                        -fold CV method, have been used in regression and time series analysis (Seber and Lee, 2003; Tsay, 2005) among others. However, the CV methods evaluate performances of the estimators which are computed only on a part of the data called the training set, and it leads to a biased evaluation result (Hastie et al., 2001). As a remedy for this bias, we will use a variation of the 
                           K
                        -fold CV, which we will call the parameterized CV (PCV), motivated by Koo et al. (2008).

                           T

The suggested PCV method is expected to alleviate the bias of the 
                           K
                        -fold CV method (Hastie et al., 2001). Moreover, by using the mean squared prediction error given in (22), we can estimate other hyperparameters such as the degree of freedom 
                           ν
                         of multivariate 
                           t
                        -distributions. Therefore, the PCV is an alternative to the maximization of marginal likelihood for selecting 
                           λ
                         and also MCMC methods for selecting 
                           ν
                        .

In this section, we briefly introduce a shrinkage estimation technique considered in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007), and develop a modified version in which cross correlations between variables are incorporated in the estimation.

Assuming that each component

                         of the time series are weakly stationary, i.e., the mean and the variance are time-invariant, we divide it by its sample standard deviation as preprocessing. Then, shrinkage estimators of 
                           
                              Ψ
                           
                         become scale-invariant (Litterman, 1986). We consider estimating the variances

In general, the convergence of the sample cross covariance matrices can be proven by assuming that the time series is a stationary VAR process (Fuller, 1996). From Assumptions (A2) and (A4), we can show that the matrix

                      is strictly positive definite. Assumption (A5) requires that the size of validation data in 
                        K
                     -fold CV increases and the sample covariance matrix is nonsingular.

Note that the number 
                        K
                      in 
                        K
                     -fold CV is not assumed to be fixed. But Assumption (A3)(b) implies that the training set size

                      must increase in order for the sample covariance matrices to converge. Moreover, Assumption (A5) requires the size of validation sets 
                        
                           |

                      to increase. The size of validation sets does not have to increase dominatingly fast as in Shao (1993), but it cannot be as small as one, i.e., as in the case of leave-one-out cross validation (Hastie et al., 2001).

We examined several methods known in literature and the proposed methods for estimation of coefficients of VAR models: 
                        
                           (a)
                           OLS: The ordinary least squares method.

Ridge: The ridge regression using the generalized cross validation (GCV) (Golub et al., 1979).

NS: The nonparametric shrinkage method (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007).

Bayes-1SR, Bayes-2SR: Two different Bayesian estimators which are shown to outperform other Bayesian estimators in the simulation studies of Ni and Sun (2005). They are obtained under the noninformative priors which are called the shrinkage prior for VAR coefficients and a reference prior for the noise covariance matrix. The Bayes-1SR and Bayes-2SR are the minimizers of posterior expectation of the quadratic loss and the LINEX loss (Zellner, 1986), respectively. See Ni and Sun (2005) for more details.

We did not include LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) since it was already shown to perform poorly in comparison with the Ridge and NS methods in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007). We did not include the simulation results of Bayes-2SR because it showed almost the same results as Bayes-1SR.

We created VAR models (1) under some conditions for the model parameters as follows.

                         is the true model coefficient matrix. One may consider a larger number of replications than 50 for a simulation experiment, but we would most likely have similar results as we have here. As a matter of fact, we used 100 data sets for some of the models and we found little difference in the results between 50 and 100 replications.

                           Fig. 1(b) illustrates that in the case of high dimensional data with

                              >

                              λ
                            values near zero. This is because the GCV score function is formed by the multiplication of sum of squared residuals (Golub et al., 1979). Moreover, we can see that the BS-Opt method yielded the smallest MSE values together with relatively large 
                              λ
                            values. This observation implies that the selected

                           (20) is suitable for high-dimensional VAR estimation, although it is computed by unknown true parameters.

                           . In Fig. 3(b), we can see that the MSE values of the NS, BS-CV, and BS-NV methods were much larger than the other methods, and there were no notable differences in the 
                              λ
                            values between the different methods. Since all the NS, BS-CV, and BS-NV methods re-scale the estimated coefficient matrix by using the estimated variances as in Section  3.4, we can conclude that the re-scaling is not desirable for near unit root processes.

On the contrary, in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the Bayes-1SR, BS-C, BS-N, KCV-N, and BS-Opt methods yielded relatively small MSE values, because they produced Bayesian shrinkage estimates under appropriate model assumptions.

                           . In Fig. 4(b), the NS method produced large MSE values in the case of high-dimensional VAR processes with

                            values obtained by the NS method were underestimated, and it produced undershrunk VAR coefficients. On the other hand, in Fig. 4, the MSE values of the other methods were not much different from the cases when there were no correlations (i.e.,

                           . In the figure, we can see that the undershrinkage by the NS method became more apparent than when

                           . Moreover, in Fig. 5(a) when

                           , the OLS, Ridge, NS, BS-C, and BS-CV methods produced relatively large MSE values as 
                              T
                            increases, which implies that those methods could not properly incorporate information on strong correlations into VAR coefficient estimation. On the contrary, the other methods produced estimates closer to true VAR coefficients as 
                              T
                            increased, and among them the Bayes-1SR and BS-Opt showed slightly better accuracy than the other methods.

On the other hand, in Fig. 5(b) when

                           . On the other hand, the Bayes-1SR, BS-C, BS-CV, KCV-N, and BS-Opt methods produced relatively small MSE values. We can conclude that these methods not only fully incorporate the distribution assumption into the model, but also demonstrate robustness with respect to 
                              d
                            and

                           .

In Fig. 10, we can see that the proposed BS methods yielded relatively small MSE values compared with the other methods. The Bayes-1SR method produced relatively high accuracies for

                              0.9
                           . However, the rates of accuracy improvement of the proposed BS methods were shown to be as fast as the Bayes-1SR, and they cost much less computational time than the Bayes-1SR. For instance, it takes about 0.23 s by the BS-C method for estimating for 
                              VAR

                              =

                              VAR
                              
                                 (
                                 1
                                 ,

                                 )
                              
                            model, it takes about 1.16 s by the BS-C method and 86.82 s by the Bayes-1SR method.

Overall, we can say that the BS methods perform better or at least as good as the other methods.

A VAR model is a causal model whose model structure is determined by its nonzero coefficients (Granger, 1969). For detecting nonzero coefficients, in case of data sets with large 
                           d
                         and small 
                           T
                        , it is favorable to run statistical tests using partial correlations instead of 
                           F
                         tests based on the OLS estimates (Schäfer and Strimmer, 2005). In multivariate normal linear regression models,

In this subsection, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BS methods in the context of structure learning of high-dimensional VAR models. We compared the Ridge, NS, and BS-C methods because these methods can estimate VAR coefficients without further complicated iteration steps, so they can be more conveniently applied to structure learning. Moreover, the computational cost of the Bayes-1SR method for high-dimensional data is too large, as mentioned in Section  5.1, compared with the other methods.

In Fig. 11
                        (a), we can see that the Ridge and NS yielded large 
                           
                              MSE
                           
                         values, which is analogous to the results in Fig. 6(b). Determination of the nonzero partial correlations depends on the absolute values of the 
                           
                              
                                 d

                           =
                           160
                           
                           000
                         estimated partial correlations, which are obtained by each of the Ridge, NS, and BS-C methods for each of the 50 data sets. Based on the estimated partial correlations, we obtained the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves averaged over the 50 data sets, as in Fig. 11(b). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) are presented as summary statistics in Fig. 11(c). It is apparent in the figures that the BS-C method performs far better than the Ridge and NS methods.

The real data we used for the experiment is the Arabidopsis thaliana data that is available in the package GeneNet in R programming language (Schäfer et al., 2014). The data were originally obtained from microarray analysis of diurnal changes in the starch transcriptome in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (Craigon et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004). The original data of 22,814 probes, 11 time points, and two biological replicates were preprocessed and a subset of 800 genes were selected (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007).

We estimated the VAR coefficients and the corresponding partial correlations by using both of the BS-CV and NS methods under the fixed 
                           p
                           =

As a result, the BS-CV method recommended a

                           VAR

                         model with 7381 nonzero coefficients (ENR  =  10.4) (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007). We depicted the subgraph with 150 edges of the VAR network obtained by the BS-CV method in Fig. 13
                        . While producing a sparser network, the BS-CV method detected such genes as the 21st, the 182nd, the 256th, and the 677th genes, whose descriptions are given in Table 1
                         in Appendix D for those who are interested, as new members of the densely connected web of nodes in addition to the web formerly found by the NS method (See Figure 2 in  Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007).

We proposed shrinkage estimation methods for high-dimensional VAR models with small data under a Bayesian framework. We assumed a multivariate generalization of scale mixture of normal distributions for the noise variables of the model. As for the model coefficients, we assumed multivariate normal priors with the shrinkage parameter as a hyperparameter. We considered both conjugate and non-conjugate priors and compared estimation results through the MSE. A main feature of the proposed estimation method is that we devised, under the conjugate prior, a formula for selection of an asymptotically optimal value 
                        
                           
                              λ
                           
                           
                              ∗
                           
                        
                      of the shrinkage parameter. The use of this asymptotically optimal value was shown to reduce the computation time dramatically in comparison with a Bayesian estimation which employs the MCMC sampling method with as good or better performance in VAR modeling with only a few exceptions. The Bayesian estimation with the MCMC performed better when the noise followed a multivariate 
                        t
                     -distribution with very high correlations (0.9) between the noise variables.

It is worthwhile to note that, even though the asymptotically optimal value 
                        
                           
                              λ

                     . In the simulation study, we considered

                           (

                     , and the order 
                        p
                        =
                        3
                        ,
                        5
                      were considered when 
                        d
                        =
                        5
                      only to alleviate the computation time. As for the covariance structure for the noise variables, we assigned 1 to the diagonal entries and one of 0, 0.5, and 0.9 to all the off-diagonal entries, to investigate effects of the covariance structure upon the performance of the estimation methods. In addition to this, we also considered scale mixture to the covariance structure into multivariate 
                        t
                     -distributions. As for the model complexity, we considered two types of model, auto-regressive and auto-and-cross-regressive. The former type is of 
                        p
                        d
                      non-zero coefficients and they are 
                        2
                        p
                        d
                      for the latter type. We considered one of 0.6 and 0.95 for all the auto-regressive coefficients to investigate the ‘near unit root’ effect upon the estimation methods. To avoid the computational overload, we considered models with their complexity levels up to 
                        2
                        p
                        d
                     . As a compensation, we could cover a wide variety of VAR models in the context of structural complexity, coefficient magnitude, and noise structure.

A general picture of the performance comparison of the estimation methods is two fold. One is that the popular methods including the OLS, Ridge, and NS methods compared worse than the other methods including the proposed Bayesian shrinkage (BS) methods. And the other is that the proposed BS methods performed at least as well as the computationally heavy Bayesian estimation method (Bayes-1SR) using the MCMC except when the noise variables are highly correlated (their correlation coefficients were 0.9 in the experiment) with heavy tails of distribution. The cost reduction by the BS methods in computing time is remarkable. It was 1.2 s versus 86.8 s for a VAR(1, 50) model between the proposed BS and the Bayes-1SR methods. The reduction rate will become far more remarkable as the order 
                        p
                      and the dimension 
                        d
                      increase in 
                        VAR

The estimators are found in the Bayes-1SR method so that the posterior mean of the squared-error loss is minimized, while they are found, in the proposed BS methods, based on the selected value of the shrinkage parameter at which the mean of the joint probability of the data and the coefficients is maximized approximately. So the optimal value may not guarantee the minimum of the posterior mean of the squared-error loss as would be expected in the Bayes-1SR. Considering this difference in the estimation process, we could say that the proposed BS methods are a meaningful improvement in the context of estimation quality and computation cost. We did not consider a prior for the shrinkage parameter in the BS method. But the estimation results are the same whether a prior is imposed on the shrinkage parameter or not provided that the posterior mode of the shrinkage parameter is used in the proposed BS method (see Appendix E for its proof). The posterior mode however is computationally too costly to get for high-dimensional VAR models. Fortunately we can attain a good approximation to the posterior mode by using the formula for

                      as is demonstrated in the simulation experiments in Section  5. Furthermore, we found that the shrinkage estimator of the VAR coefficients by the NS method is a particular form of the shrinkage estimator by our BS method.

In the boxplots of the estimates of the shrinkage parameters, the estimates are spread over a wide range for the BS methods. This seems to be due to noise fluctuation in the data which is revealed during the cross-validation process. We partitioned the data into 
                        K
                        =
                        5
                      subsets for the experiment to save the computing time. The range of the estimates would narrow down for a larger 
                        K
                     .
