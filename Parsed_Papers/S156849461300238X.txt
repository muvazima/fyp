               Abstract
               
                  Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is increasingly applied to healthcare and medical research and applications. However, knowledge representation of pairwise reciprocal matrix is still dubious. This research discusses the related drawbacks, and recommends pairwise opposite matrix as the ideal alternative. Pairwise opposite matrix is the key foundation of Primitive Cognitive Network Process (P-CNP), which revises the AHP approach with practical changes. A medical decision treatment evaluation using AHP is revised by P-CNP with a step-by-step tutorial. Comparisons with AHP have been discussed. The proposed method could be a promising decision tool to replace AHP to share information among patients or/and doctors, and to evaluate therapies, medical treatments, health care technologies, medical resources, and healthcare policies.
