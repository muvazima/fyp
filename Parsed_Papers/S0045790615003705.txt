                  The present study integrates information system engineering and management methodologies to solve a real-life case problem. We develop an agricultural product recommendation service on a mobile platform, and then to understand users’ acceptance to confirm that it can be used to solve the problem. For consumers, making the decision to purchase is complex and can be full of contradictions and conflicts. This raises the need to design a product recommendation service that uses multiple criteria to assist consumers. This study employs a modified Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method determine a ranking order which will assist consumers in deciding which agricultural product to buy. Two major findings are proposed. First, we identified five criteria that assist consumers making buying decisions regarding agricultural products. Second, we find that when the system is established on a mobile platform, perceived ease of use does not play a critical role in user acceptance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the era of electronic commerce (EC), disintermediation and the direct selling business model are increasing in popularity. The agricultural product market is no exception. Without brokers serving as middlemen, farmers reap better profits and consumers get higher quality products. Advances in information and communication technology have promoted the development of mobile devices. The recent popularity of these devices has caused smartphones to become one of the major platforms for modern information systems (IS) and EC. The smartphone has become a popular tool with which to purchase products. Therefore, mobile commerce has become the main stream of EC development.

In the context of the direct selling business model, the question of how to assist customers who are looking for suitable products is becoming a critical issue for both academics and practitioners. However, decision-making is a complex behavior, full of contradictions and conflicts. Complex problems rarely have ideal solutions. For example, producers of agricultural products are located in different geographical areas. Agricultural products also vary according to the season, so farmers’ promotional programs must reflect this variation. Cost and benefits are major considerations for consumers, but most consumers are not well versed in agriculturally related knowledge. The variety of factors which consumers take into consideration requires a comprehensive evaluation method based on multiple criteria which must be identified by the consumer.

These issues are commonly encountered in general practice; the case used in the present study is a good example. However, previous studies have paid little attention to traditional agriculture, and few studies have provided applicable solutions for problems related to selecting agricultural products. Thus, we find a gap between academia and practice in this area. Motivated by the issues above, and in accordance with the requirements of the real live case, this study aims to develop an agricultural product recommendation service on a mobile platform, and to understand users’ experiences and acceptance of this system in order to confirm that it can be used to solve the problems encountered in the real life case. This study integrates the system engineering and information management perspectives to solve a practical problem in the agriculture field. Our study contributes new insights regarding information and communication technology (ICT) applications for agriculture, from a technical and management perspective, and our findings add to those of existing research on this industry.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related studies on multi-criteria decision analysis and user acceptance of information systems. Section describes the details about the real life case. Section 4 introduces an optimal selection approach for special offers of agricultural products. Section 5 describes the implementation and verification of our system on a mobile device. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions.

This review of the related literature covers multi-criteria decision analysis and user acceptance of information systems.

The high levels of uncertainty and complexity inherent in complicated multi-dimensional problems typically necessitate the participation of experts in the decision making processes required to solve such problems [1,2]. The purpose of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) or multi-attribute decision making (MADM) is to support decision makers facing such problems. Several approaches have been proposed for analyzing multi-criteria decisions: Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR), Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL),Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Aruldoss et al. [3] did a survey of multi-criteria decision making methods and their applications, reviewing nine MCDM methods and describing the advantages and disadvantages of each. The study showed that MCDM is a powerful decision-making technique.

MCDM applications are used in e-commerce and mobile commerce, among others. Büyüközkan [4] defined possible e-marketplace evaluation criteria and formulated a new multi-criteria evaluation model. The suggested evaluation model deepened our understanding of the generic success factors of an e-marketplace. Chiu et al. [5] proposed a new hybrid multiple attribute decision making model which combined the DEMATEL, DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP), and VIKOR methods to resolve e-stores’ customer satisfaction issues caused by interdependence and feedback problems among dimensions and criteria. To diagnose e-commerce activity, Denguir-Rekik et al. [6] proposed a ‘‘Feedback Based Diagnosis System” (FBDS): a multi-criteria decision making support system designed to help marketers analyze cyber consumers’ feedback and/or evaluations gathered via classic recommendation systems. Manouselis et al. [7] identified a set of dimensions that distinguish, describe and categorize multi-criteria recommendation systems, based on existing taxonomies and categorizations. These studies provided a comprehensive overview of how current multi-criteria recommendation systems support the decisions of online users. Some utility-elicitation methods have been developed on the basis of multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) to fully represent a decision maker’s preferences. Huang [8] compared different utility-based recommendation methods (including holistic and decomposed methods) with a traditional content-based method in terms of recommendation accuracy, time expense, and user perceptions. Işıklar and Büyüközkan [9] examined the current mobile phone market in general to determine how to achieve the most accurate decision when purchasing a phone. Two MCDM methods, AHP and TOPSIS, were used in the evaluation procedure, and the authors used a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Jan et al. [10] proposed an MDCM methodology to improve the technology selection process, since MDCM allows for multiple actors to express their personal preferences in the selection process of mobile information systems.

ELECTRE is a family of multi-criteria decision analysis methods. ELECTRE methods include two main steps [1]. The first step constructs the ranking relationships for a comprehensive comparison of each pair of actions. The second step elaborates on the recommendations based on the results obtained by an exploitation procedure in the first step. Afshari et al. [11] applied ELECTRE methods to seven criteria for selecting the best personnel. Chi et al. [12] proposed a selection approach which modified ELECTRE methods in order to optimize the composition of web services. Ke and Wu [13] used ELECTRE methods to select a reasonable solution during problem solving. Ke and Chen [14] employed ELECTRE methods for selecting a reasonable solution for optimal message negotiation. Liu et al. [15] also used ELECTRE methods in multi-attribute decision-making under conditions of risk, using interval probability.

Though the prototype system in this study is presented in the style of a computer game, it is not only a game; it is also an information system designed to solve a particular set of decision making problems. In order to understand users’ perceptions and their experience of this system from an information management perspective, we adopted variables related to user acceptance of computer games (Section 2.2.1) and of information systems (Section 2.2.2). We employed variables related specifically to hedonic benefits to represent variables for user acceptance of computer games. Variables from the technology acceptance model (TAM) served as our variables for user acceptance of information systems. In the following sections, we review relevant work in the gaming and information system research streams.

Previous studies have shown that enjoyment and flow are two major variables related to hedonic benefits. Enjoyment is defined as users’ pleasure when playing the game [16]. Liu and Li [17] proposed that, when playing a mobile game, users’ perceived enjoyment affects their perception of system’s usefulness. Teo and Noyes [18] found that enjoyment affects perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in an information system. Hsu and Lu [19] focused on the online gaming community and found that perceived enjoyment significantly affects users’ attitude and intention.

Proposed by Csikszentmihalyi [20], flow theory indicates that when people focus on one thing, they devote whole-hearted effort to it. In other words, as users become immersed in the process, their physical abilities or skills are fully utilized. In the gaming or e-learning fields, flow is an important factor affecting user behavior. Sanchez-Franco [21] found that when learners participate in Web learning, their flow experience affects their perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the online learning system. Cheng [22] focused on IT-based medical education and found that nurses’ flow experience significantly affects their perceptions of the system’s usefulness and ease of use. In the gaming field, Hsu and Lu [23], Lee and Tsai [24] also made similar findings: users’ flow experience affects their intention toward digital games.

In accordance with Davis’s [25] TAM model, previous studies have confirmed that perceived usefulness (PU) affects users’ attitude and intention toward digital games [17,23,24,26]. Additionally, perceived ease of use (PEOU) also affects users’ attitudes [17,23,24,26,27], and attitude determines users’ intention toward the digital game [17,24,28]. Finally, users’ intentions affect their final behavior [25]. After the TAM was proposed, Venkatesh et al. [29] proposed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and UTAUT 2 which proposed six critical factors that affect users’ behavioral intention toward information systems: expected performance, expected effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit [30].

Present study is a real live case in Taiwan, an island with rich agricultural products available throughout the seasons. The town of Lishan is located in the mountainous central spine of the island, approximately 2000m above sea level. The high elevation and relative inaccessibility by car has restricted the development of tourism and agriculture in this area. The promotion of agricultural products has been hampered, in particular. Farmers face three major problems in promoting their goods. First, visitors are unaware of the features of the agricultural products. Second, consumers do not understand which fruits are available during various seasons. Finally, consumers do not know where to buy the fruits they want. In order to promote Lishan’s local agricultural industry, farmers would like to have a recommendation app which can help tourists locate and buy suitable, good quality local agricultural products. Farmers would also like to be able to advertise their products on this app. These needs provided the motivation for this project.

The project proceeded as follows. First, we conducted interviews with key people (including farmers and tourists in Lishan), made field observations about the study case, and proposed a scheme for the research context. Based on the results of interviews and observations, we identified the following five major criteria and their weights: (1) location with GPS positioning (location) (2) price discount (price) (3) user familiarity with mobile devices (operational maturity) (4) knowledge ability regarding agricultural products (knowledge maturity), and (5) knowledge strategy (strategy maturity).

We then laid out the steps of the proposed approach in the form of a use case. The modified ELECTRE served as the core of our MCDM-based scheme, allowing us to discover the candidates’ ranking order based on multiple criteria. The user refers to the ranking order when selecting a reasonable solution from the candidates.

Based on this scheme, a prototype mobile recommendation system called “Peach in Taiwan” was developed. We also proposed an integrated user behavior framework from the entertainment and user acceptance views to help us understand the users’ experience of the proposed system and to make advanced improvements in order to solve practical problems.

This section presents a selection approach for special offers of agricultural products in terms of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), including special offer formalization of the agricultural product, a relational utility model, and selection order discovery via an MCDM method (i.e., ELECTRE). We modify the ELECTRE method [13,14] because the threshold of the original ELECTRE is not suitable for this work.

The formalization of the special offers for agricultural products is the essential task of the selection approach. This paper refers to a utility-based reputation model [13,14] to formalize special offer evaluation items in order to reinforce the relational utility computing.

                         represents the expectations of mobile user m on issue i concerning the special offer o of provider p. In an e-commerce activity, the quality of the special offer might be an issue of potential interest. A smart mobile service platform can be used for the development of a relational utility model which reflects the satisfaction which mobile users gain from choosing a special offer.

                        R on issue i from special offer o of provider b. Utility values are normalized and scaled to [0, 1]. Based on various issues of interest, selecting the reasonable special offer from a large number of special offers requires multi-criteria decision analysis.

For the second task, this work uses a modified ELECTRE method [12–14] to discover the selection order for candidate special offers. If there are m candidate special offers which involve n evaluation items, the matrix Q of expected utility values can be shown as (1). We use 8 steps to discover the optimal selection order of mobile devices using the modified ELECTRE method.

Step 2: Two different rows i and j are arbitrarily selected and compared in the weighted normalization decision matrix V to ensure the correctness of the concordance and discordance sets. If value v of row i is higher than the value v of row j, the component k can be classified as the concordance set Cij
                                 , or the discordance set Dij
                                 . The concordance set Cij

From Step 1 to Step 8, we get the relationships among the evaluation items of the candidate special offers and get the optimal selection order for all candidate special offers. The mobile user can follow the selection order to select a reasonable special offer for e-commerce purposes.

This section illustrates the prototype system implementation which enforces the optimal selection approach. A use case illustrates the steps of the proposed optimal selection approach (modified ELECTRE).

The system first gathers the values of evaluated items of special offers: location, price, operational maturity, knowledge maturity, and strategy maturity. Location denotes the distance between the mobile user and a specific store providing the special offer. The mobile device’s GPS provides a location value. Price denotes the special price at which a mobile user can buy a particular agricultural product. The store’s special offer includes a price value. The evaluated items location and price are designed based on the e-commerce aspect. Operational maturity denotes the degree of maturity with which the mobile user uses a mobile device, i.e., the current level of skill and experience the user has with mobile devices in general. A formula (10) provides an operational maturity value Om. T indicates the total number of objects. S indicates the entropy of the objects produced. P(M) indicates the probability of a successful motion operation performed by the mobile phone user in order to “catch” the objects in the touch panel of the mobile device.

Section 4.1 describes a use case to introduce a modified ELECTRE method analyzing the special offers for agricultural products. A utility model formalizes the evaluated items in the special offer to perform the calculation of an expected utility matrix which presents the evaluated items as the criteria to be evaluated. From Step 1 to Step 8, the approach discovers the ranking order of candidate special offers to support the selection of a reasonable special offer for e-commerce activity.

Based on the above scheme, we developed a mobile recommendation system called “Peach in Taiwan.” Android SDK, JAVA SE, and Eclipse IDE for JAVA were employed to develop and execute the system on the Android platform. Thus, users who have smartphones with the Android platform can play this game easily anywhere, anytime. The main purpose of this game is to support users as they decide which agricultural products to consume, using peaches as an example. The game scenario presents a person who needs to overcome different challenges to get rewards (see Fig. 1
                        ). Each challenge reflects different criteria in our method. The materials used in the game context were collected from the farmers in the case study in order to reflect the true environment.

The first challenge in the game is to “catch your peach.” The game automatically produces various fruits (e.g., peaches, apples and pears) which fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. The system integrates the body motion (motion sensing) function in such a way that players must shake their smartphone to catch falling peaches within a limited time (30 s). In our approach, this activity is part of the operational maturity evaluation. The screen is illustrated in Fig. 2.

The second challenge is to “choose the right peach breed.” Players must choose the right breed of peach from the description. During the process, the game provides tips for players. Tips will show pictures of the peach to help players answer the questions easily. Therefore, users can learn through playing. In our approach, this relates to the knowledge maturity evaluation. The screen is illustrated in Fig. 3.

The final challenge is the “squared Q and A.” Nine questions are listed randomly on a grid that includes nine cells. Players must answer the peach related questions correctly and connect the cells in a line (see Fig. 4). Similar to Challenge 2, related tips are provided during the game. In our approach, this related to the knowledge strategy maturity evaluation.

After overcoming three challenges, players have the opportunity to play a slot machine (see Fig. 5) to receive their rewards.

Since the purpose of user verification is to determine whether or not our gaming recommendation system will be accepted by potential users, we employed an information management research method. We integrated theories related to gaming and IS acceptance into our study, and proposed an integrated model to verify the above system. Previous studies have indicated that perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use are critical determinants of the use of hedonically oriented information systems [31]. In regards to the hedonic view of game playing, previous studies have also pointed out three critical variables which affect users’ attitudes: perceived playfulness [26,32], flow experience [23,24,26,33–35], and enjoyment [17,24,26,34,35]. Our study also assessed the technology acceptance model (TAM) proposed by Davis [25], as well as IS satisfaction [36]. The TAM indicates the critical roles of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in users’ acceptance of information system [25]. However, Van der Heijden argued that since the TAM is focused on productivity-oriented applications, more variables related to hedonic systems (such as enjoyment) are required to assess other kinds of applications [31]. Finally, adding to the productivity perspective (TAM) and the hedonic perspective, we see satisfaction as another key factor affecting users’ acceptance of information systems [36]. Therefore, satisfaction also serves as a critical variable in our model.

Thus, this paper proposes an integrated research model based on the above perspectives (Fig. 6). Thirteen hypotheses (H) are included in this model.
                           H1a–H1d
                           Perceived enjoyment of the game will directly affect users’ satisfaction (H1a), flow (H1b), perceived ease of use (H1c), and perceived usefulness (H1d).

Perceived playfulness of the game will directly affect users’ satisfaction (H2a), flow (H2b), perceived ease of use (H2c), and perceived usefulness (H2d).

Perceived satisfaction (H3), the degree of flow (H4), perceived ease of use (H5), and perceived usefulness (H6) will directly affect users’ attitude toward the game.

Users’ attitude toward the game will directly affect their intention to play the game.

Our study includes 8 major variables with a total of 27 measurement items. Measurements were extended from prior studies and modified to fit the research context in the study (Table 2).

Our subjects
                         were undergraduate students who has experience with the mobile game developed in this study. When the game experience ended, participants were asked to fill out the research questionnaire. A total of 55 students provided valid responses to the questionnaire. Among them, 23 (41.8%) were male and 32 (58.2%) were female.

The validity and reliability of the measurements employed in this study are acceptable for future analysis. Testing results are shown in Table 3. The threshold values for each of the statistics employed in the study are as follows: composite reliability (CR) is >0.7 [38], and average variance extracted (AVE) is >0.5 [39]. Cronbach’s alpha was employed to determine the reliability of each variable. The threshold is >0.7 [38]. Table 3 shows that the alpha value for each variable is acceptable. In summary, our measures have acceptable reliability. Factor loading was employed to determine the discriminant validity of the measures. Cross loadings should be lower than the loadings of each indicator and the loading of each item should be higher than 0.5 [38]. The loadings of all indicators are higher than their cross loadings, and item loadings of each variable are larger than 0.5 (Table 3). Based on the above criteria, all of the indexes in this study are acceptable for analysis.

Next, we tested the proposed hypotheses by using partial least squares (PLS) [40]. The results are summarized in Table 4.

In this phase, the above results revealed three major findings. First, both enjoyment and playfulness positively affect user satisfaction and flow. Playfulness also affects perceived usefulness. In addition, three critical factors affect users’ attitudes toward the mobile game: satisfaction, flow, and perceived usefulness. Finally, attitude significantly affects users’ willingness to play the mobile game. In contrast to previous studies, we discovered that perceived ease of use is not a critical factor. Based on this observation, we determined that the mobile device itself is easy to use, and is more user friendly than are traditional information systems. Therefore, ease of use did not prove to be as critical in our study as it was in previous studies.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Present study established five criteria by interviewing the users (farmers and potential customers). Suitable methods were evaluated and selected to establish our scheme. We employed the ELECTRE method in this study for the following reasons. First, because this system utilizes the user’s the location, which is determined by a GPS, the AHP method appeared un-suitable for this study. Second, although there are many good MCDM methods (e.g., TOPSIS and PROMETHEE [41]) for processing the weights vector, we still employed the ELECTRE for this purpose because Aruldoss et al. [3] noted that the ELECTRE method is useful for solving the issues inherent in environmental valuation and environmental management. Regarding this method, we suggest that the weights vector should be processed using the TOPSIS and PROMETHEE methods to see how the ranking of the alternatives changes. Besides, the results of the ELECTRE are highly influenced by the weights. In this work, the weights are determined and adjusted by the mobile service designer without an evaluation method. In future study, we will design an adaptive MDCM approach which uses a consumer experience profile (e.g., purchasing behavior history, preferences, etc.) to adjust the pre-configuration weights (note that the initial weight of each criteria may be set as a mean value) in each round after the proposed service used.

Since the proposed system is not only an information system but also a gaming system, we integrated variables related to user acceptance of both computer games and information systems in order to evaluate user’s perceptions and experience of the system. In other words, we evaluated users’ experience and acceptance rather than
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         evaluating the recommendation method. A major finding of our study is that users’ perceived satisfaction, flow experience and perceived usefulness affect their attitude as expected. However, perceived ease of use proved to be insignificant. We can infer that, in comparison with a traditional information system, the smart phone is much easier to use, thus reducing the criticality of perceived ease of use. This finding can contribute to a better understanding of user acceptance of mobile applications. Finally, we recommend that to make a mobile system acceptable, more attention should be paid to the hedonic aspects of the user experience. Certainly, user satisfaction and perceived usefulness will also be affected by other hedonic variables. Overall, the results indicate that our proposed agricultural product recommendation app can be accepted by potential users to solve real live problems.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study employed the MCDM method to solve practical problems and has two major findings. First, through practical interviews, we identified five criteria (location, price, operational maturity, knowledge maturity, and strategy maturity) to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions regarding agricultural products. Next, in contrast to previous information management related studies, we found that perceived ease of use is not critical for user acceptance when the system is established on a mobile platform.

Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, this study proposed an MCDM based approach (modified ELECTRE) which contributes to mobile commerce development and agricultural product marketing. Based on the practical interviews, five criteria were included in our approach: location, price, operational maturity, knowledge maturity, and strategy maturity. Next, via the prototype system, users experienced the process and provided feedback for future development. Finally, through user evaluations and model testing, we now better understand users’ attitudes and intentions toward this system. Therefore, the results of this paper contribute to the development of mobile commerce and the online selling of agricultural products. These findings can enhance researchers’ understanding of mobile recommendation systems, and can serve as a reference for future academic research and practical applications in the area of mobile commerce. In the future, we can extend the approach presented in this paper to the online promotion of other products. We will also employ the TOPSIS and PROMETHEE methods to process the weights vector to see how the ranking of the alternatives changes. In addition, we will design an adaptive MDCM approach to resolve the issue of the ELECTRE results being highly influenced by the weights.
