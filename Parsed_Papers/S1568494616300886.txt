                  In this paper, a new path planning algorithm for unstructured environments based on a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) is presented. Our method uses as its input an aerial image or an unfiltered auto-generated map of the area in which the robot will be moving. Given this, the algorithm is able to generate a graph showing all of the safe paths that a robot can follow. To do so, our algorithm takes advantage of the training stage of a MSVM, making it possible to obtain the set of paths that maximize the distance to the obstacles while minimizing the effect of measurement errors, yielding paths even when the input data are not sufficiently clear. The method also ensures that it is able to find a path, if it exists, and it is fully adaptable to map changes over time. The functionality of these features was assessed using tests, divided into simulated results and real-world tests. For the latter, four different scenarios were evaluated involving 500 tests each. From these tests, we concluded that the method presented is able to perform the tasks for which it was designed.
