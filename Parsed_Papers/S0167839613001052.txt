                  We develop a method for computing all the generalized asymptotes of a real plane algebraic curve 
                        C
                      implicitly defined by an irreducible polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x

                        y

                        x

                        ]
                     . The approach is based on the notion of perfect curve introduced from the concepts and results presented in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013). In addition, we study some properties concerning perfect curves and in particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a plane curve to be perfect. Finally, we show that the equivalent class of generalized asymptotes for a branch of a plane curve can be described as an affine space

In this paper, we consider 
                        C
                      an irreducible real plane algebraic curve over 
                        C
                      implicitly defined by an irreducible polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        ∈
                        R
                        [
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        ]
                     . That is, we work over the field of complex numbers 
                        C
                     , but 
                        C
                      has infinitely many points in the affine plane over 
                        R
                     . Since every irreducible real curve has a real defining polynomial, we assume that 
                        C
                      is defined by the irreducible polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        ∈
                        R
                        [
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        ]
                      (see Chapter 7 in Sendra et al., 2007). The assumption of reality is included because of the nature of the problem, but the theory can be similarly developed for the case of complex non-real curves.

Under these conditions, we deal with the problem of computing the asymptotes of the infinity branches of 
                        C
                     . This question is very important in the study of real plane algebraic curves because asymptotes contain much of the information about the behavior of the curves in the large. For instance, determining the asymptotes of a curve is an important step in sketching its graph.

Intuitively speaking, the asymptotes of some branch of a real plane algebraic curve reflect the status of this branch at the points with sufficiently large coordinates. In analytic geometry, an asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.

More precisely, let 
                        C
                      be a real plane algebraic curve, and B an infinity branch of 
                        C
                     . A line ℓ is called the asymptote of 
                        C
                      at B, if for every 
                        ϵ
                        ∈
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                     , there exists 
                        M
                        ∈
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                      such that 
                        d
                        (
                        P
                        ,
                        ℓ
                        )
                        <
                        ϵ
                     , for every 
                        P
                        ∈
                        B
                      with 
                        ‖
                        P
                        ‖
                        >
                        M
                     .

If B can be defined by some explicit equation of the form 
                        y
                        =
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        )
                      (or 
                        x
                        =
                        g
                        (
                        y
                        )
                     ), where f (or g) is a continuous function on an infinite interval, it is easy to decide whether 
                        C
                      has an asymptote at B by analyzing the existence of the limits of certain functions when 
                        x
                        →
                        ∞
                      (or 
                        y
                        →
                        ∞
                     ). Moreover, if these limits can be computed, we may obtain the equation of the asymptote of 
                        C
                      at B. However, if this branch B is implicitly defined and its equation cannot be converted into an explicit form, both the decision and the computation of the asymptote of 
                        C
                      at B require some others tools.

Determining the asymptotes of an implicit algebraic plane curve is a topic considered in many text-books on analysis (see for instance Maxwell, 1962). In Kečkić (2000), is presented a fast and a simple method for obtaining the asymptotes of a curve defined by an irreducible polynomial, with emphasis on second order polynomials. In Zeng (2007), an algorithm for computing all the linear asymptotes of a real plane algebraic curve 
                        C
                      implicitly defined, is obtained. More precisely, one may decide whether a branch of 
                        C
                      has an asymptote, compute all the asymptotes of 
                        C
                     , and determine those branches whose asymptotes are the same. By this algorithm, all the asymptotes of 
                        C
                      may be represented via polynomial real root isolation.

An algebraic plane curve may have more general curves than lines describing the status of a branch at the points with sufficiently large coordinates. This motivates that in this paper, we are interested in analyzing and computing these generalized asymptotes. Intuitively speaking, we say that a curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              ˜
                           
                        
                      is a generalized asymptote (or g-asymptote) of another curve 
                        C
                      if the distance between 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              ˜
                           
                        
                      and 
                        C
                      tends to zero as they tend to infinity, and 
                        C
                      cannot be approached by a new curve of lower degree.

In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing all the g-asymptotes of a real algebraic plane curve 
                        C
                      defined by an irreducible polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                        ∈
                        R
                        [
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        ]
                     . For this purpose, we use the results in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013), where the notions of convergent branches (that is, branches that get closer as they tend to infinity) and approaching curves are introduced. In addition, in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013), we also provide some results that characterize whether two implicit algebraic plane curves approach each other at the infinity, and we present a method to compare the asymptotic behavior of two curves (i.e., the behavior at the infinity). In particular, we prove that if two plane curves have the same asymptotic behavior, the Hausdorff distance between them is finite. Some of these results are summarized in this paper (see Section 2).

The study of approaching curves and convergent branches leads to the notions of perfect curve (a curve of degree d that cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than d) and g-asymptote (a perfect curve that approaches another curve at an infinity branch). These concepts are introduced in Section 3. In this section, we also develop an algorithm that computes a g-asymptote for each infinity branch of a given curve. In Section 4, we provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for a curve to be perfect. In particular, we show that a perfect curve admits a polynomial parametrization. In Section 5, we observe that “proximity” is an equivalence relation for the set of perfect curves. Hence, an infinity branch of a given curve does not have, in general, a unique g-asymptote, but a whole “equivalence class” defined by infinitely many curves. We show that all the curves in a same class have the same degree d, and that any class is isomorphic to 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              d
                              (
                              d
                              −
                              1
                              )
                              /
                              2
                           
                        
                     . Finally, we present some results that allows us to obtain, under certain assumptions, all the curves within a class.

In this section, we introduce the notion of infinity branch, convergent branches and approaching curves, and we obtain some properties which allow us to compare the behavior of two implicit algebraic plane curves at the infinity. For more details on these concepts and results, we refer to Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013).

Throughout the paper, we consider an irreducible algebraic affine plane curve

We note that we work over 
                        C
                     , but we assume that the curve has infinitely many points in the affine plane over 
                        R
                      and then, 
                        C
                      has a real defining polynomial (see Chapter 7 in Sendra et al., 2007). We recall that the assumption of reality is included because of the nature of the problem, but the theory developed in this paper can be applied for the case of complex non-real curves.

From the above discussion, we deduce that there exists a one-to-one relation between infinity places and infinity branches. In addition, we can say that each infinity branch is associated to a unique infinity point given by the center of the corresponding infinity place. Reciprocally, taking into account the above construction, we get that every infinity point has associated, at least, one infinity branch. Hence, every algebraic plane curve has, at least, one infinity branch. Furthermore, every algebraic plane curve has a finite number of branches.

In the following, we introduce the notions of convergent branches and approaching curves. Intuitively speaking, two infinity branches converge if they get closer as they tend to infinity. This concept will allow us to analyze whether two curves approach each other. For further details see Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013).

Observe that two convergent infinity branches are associated to the same infinity point (see Remark 4.5 in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz, 2013).

In Lemma 1, we characterize the convergence of two given infinity branches (see Lemma 4.2, and Proposition 4.6 in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz, 2013).

Given an algebraic plane curve 
                        C
                      and an infinity branch B of 
                        C
                     , in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013) we analyze whether 
                        C
                      can be approached at B by a new curve 
                        
                           C
                           ¯
                        
                     . Intuitively speaking, if 
                        C
                      is approached at B by 
                        
                           C
                           ¯
                        
                     , and 
                        deg
                        (
                        
                           C
                           ¯
                        
                        )
                        <
                        deg
                        (
                        C
                        )
                     , one may say that 
                        C
                      
                     degenerates, since 
                        C
                      behaves at the infinity as a curve of less degree.

For instance, a hyperbola is a curve of degree 2 that has two real asymptotes, which implies that the hyperbola degenerates, at the infinity, in two lines. The behavior of an ellipse is similar; in this case, the infinity branches are complex but they can also be approached by (complex) lines. However, the asymptotic behavior of a parabola is different, since at the infinity, the parabola cannot be approached by any line. This motivates the following definition.


                     
                        Definition 4
                        A curve of degree d is a perfect curve if it cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than d.

A curve that is not perfect can be approached by other curves of less degree. If these curves are perfect, we call them g-asymptotes. More precisely, we have the following definition.


                     
                        Definition 5
                        Let 
                              C
                            be a curve with an infinity branch B. A g-asymptote (generalized asymptote) of 
                              C
                            at B is a perfect curve that approaches 
                              C
                            at B.

Note that the notion of g-asymptote is similar to the classical concept of asymptote. The difference is that a g-asymptote is not necessarily a line, but a perfect curve. Actually, it is a generalization, since every line is a perfect curve (this fact follows from Definition 4). Thus, the algorithm presented in Section 3.1 also computes the asymptotes being lines (see Example 1). Throughout the paper we refer to g-asymptote simply as asymptote.

In order to clarify this notion, let us consider a plane curve 
                        C
                      defined by the irreducible polynomial

                              x
                              ,
                              y

                              R
                              [

                      has degree 3, and two infinity branches. In Fig. 1
                     , one can check that these infinity branches are approached by the parabola 
                        y
                        −
                        2

                        3
                        /

                        =
                        0
                     , and the line 
                        y

Later we see that other plane curves of degree 3, like 
                        y

                        =
                        0
                      or 
                        
                           
                              y

                        −

                        0
                     , cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than 3. That is, they are perfect curves.


                     
                        Remark 3
                        The degree of an asymptote is less or equal than the degree of the curve it approaches. In fact, an asymptote of a curve 
                              C
                            at a branch B has minimal degree among all the curves that approach 
                              C
                            at B. Indeed, let 
                              D
                            be an asymptote of 
                              C
                            at B and let 
                              
                                 
                                    D

                            be another curve that approaches 
                              C
                            at B. From Corollary 1, 
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                            approaches 
                              D
                           , and since 
                              D
                            is perfect, we conclude that 
                              deg
                              (

                                    ′
                                 
                              
                              )
                              ⩾
                              deg
                              (
                              D
                              )
                           .

In the following, we show that every infinity branch of a given algebraic plane curve has, at least, one asymptote (see Theorem 2). In order to prove this property, we first need to show some previous results. For this purpose, let 
                        C
                      be a plane curve and 
                        B

We have shown that, for any infinity branch B of a plane curve 
                           C
                        , there always exists an asymptote that approaches 
                           C
                         at B. Furthermore, we have provided a method to obtain it. From these results, we obtain the following algorithm that computes an asymptote for each infinity branch of a given plane curve.

We assume that we have prepared the input curve

An indispensably tool in the development of the results presented in this paper is the notion of perfect curve. In this section we try to understand better this concept. For this purpose, in the following we show some properties concerning perfect curves. We start with a necessary condition for a curve to be perfect.


                     
                        Proposition 2
                        
                           A perfect curve is polynomial (i.e. it admits a polynomial parametrization).
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        Taking into account the results in Manocha and Canny (1991), one has that a curve is polynomial if and only if it has only one infinity branch. Thus, in order to prove the proposition, we only need to show that a perfect curve cannot have more than one infinity branch.

For this purpose, let 
                              C
                            be a perfect curve defined by the polynomial 
                              f
                              (
                              x
                              ,
                              y
                              )
                           , and let us assume that 
                              C
                            has two different infinity branches,

                            can be approached at

                            by an asymptote of degree

                           . Therefore, we get that 
                              C
                            is not perfect which contradicts the assumption. Hence, we conclude that a perfect curve cannot have more than one infinity branch. □

In the following example, we show that the reciprocal of Proposition 2 is not true. More precisely, we consider a polynomial curve 
                        C
                     , and we show that 
                        C
                      is not a perfect curve.

                            that has degree 2. Therefore, 
                              C
                            is not perfect. In Fig. 3

                     Proposition 2 states that a perfect curve has only one infinity branch but this condition does not ensure that the curve is perfect. In the following, we provide a characterization of perfect curves (see Proposition 3). For this purpose, we first remark some properties obtained from the definitions and results introduced before.


                     
                        Remark 7
                        
                           
                              
                                 1.
                                 Two approaching perfect curves have the same degree (see Definition 4).

Two asymptotes that approach the same branch have the same degree (see statement 1 above and Corollary 1).

Any asymptote that approaches a curve at a branch of degree n has degree n (see Remark 6 and Theorem 2).

From statement above and Lemma 2, we deduce that if B is a branch of a perfect curve then 
                                       ν

                           Let 
                           
                              C
                            
                           be an algebraic plane curve of degree n. 
                           
                              C
                            
                           is perfect if and only if it has a unique infinity branch B, and 
                           
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              =
                              n
                           
                           .
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        First, we assume that 
                              C
                            is perfect. From Proposition 2, we get that 
                              C
                            only has one infinity branch, B. It holds that 
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              ⩾
                              n
                           ; otherwise 
                              C
                            would be approached by asymptotes of degree less than n (see Remark 7, statement 3). Moreover, from Remark 5, we get that 
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              ⩽
                              n
                           . Thus, we deduce that 
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              =
                              n
                           .

Now, let 
                              C
                            be such that it has a unique infinity branch B, and 
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              =
                              n
                           . Let us assume that 
                              C
                            is not perfect. Then, there exists a curve 
                              
                                 C
                                 ¯
                              
                           , with 
                              deg
                              (
                              
                                 C
                                 ¯
                              
                              )
                              <
                              n
                           , that approaches 
                              C
                            at B. From Remark 3, we get that the asymptotes of 
                              C
                            at B have degree less than n, which contradicts Remark 7 (statement 3). Therefore, we conclude that 
                              C
                            is perfect. □

                                    n
                                 
                              
                           , and thus 
                              deg
                              (
                              B

                              n
                           . Then, by applying Proposition 3, we conclude that 
                              C
                            is perfect.

The following proposition states a sufficient condition for a curve to be perfect, which can be checked without computing any infinity branch. This result will play an important role in Section 5.


                     
                        Proposition 4
                        
                           Let 
                           
                              C
                            
                           be an algebraic plane curve with a unique infinity point P, and let P be regular. Then 
                           
                              C
                            
                           is perfect.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        Let 
                              deg
                              (
                              C
                              )
                              =
                              d
                           , and we assume that 
                              d
                              ⩾
                              2
                            (the case of lines is trivial). Let us prove that 
                              C
                            satisfies the conditions of Proposition 3; i.e., 
                              C
                            has a unique infinity branch, say B, and 
                              deg
                              (
                              B
                              )
                              =
                              d
                           .

We assume w.l.o.g. that 
                              P
                              =
                              (
                              1
                              :
                              0
                              :
                              0
                              )
                            (otherwise, we apply a linear change of coordinates). Since P is regular, there exists a unique place centered at P and hence, there exists a unique infinity branch associated to P (see Section 2). Therefore the first condition holds.

Now, we focus on the second condition. Let 
                              B
                              =

                              1
                           , we get that

                              ⩾
                              d

                              d

                           .

Therefore, 
                              C
                            has a unique infinity branch B, and

                              d
                           . From Proposition 3, we conclude that 
                              C
                            is a perfect curve.  □


                     
                        Remark 8
                        The reciprocal of Proposition 4 is not true. For instance, the curve

                              0
                            is perfect (see Example 3) but its unique infinity point, 
                              (
                              1
                              :
                              0
                              :
                              0
                              )
                           , is singular.

In Section 3, given an algebraic plane curve 
                        C
                     , and an infinity branch B of 
                        C
                     , we prove that 
                        C
                      can be approached by an asymptote at B. In the following, we see that this asymptote may not be unique. In fact, in most of cases, there are infinitely many asymptotes associated to a given infinity branch.

                      at its unique infinity branch (see Fig. 4
                     ).

Note that the relation of proximity is actually an equivalence relation for the set of curves having only one infinity branch. Clearly, it is reflexive, since every curve approaches itself. Moreover, statement 1 in Remark 2 ensures the symmetry.

                      at B. In this case, transitivity holds and then, we have an equivalence relation for the set of curves having only one infinity branch. In the following, we refer to the equivalence classes associated to this equivalence relation as proximity classes.

We observe that this property can be applied to perfect curves since, from Proposition 2, perfect curves only have one infinity branch. That is, we consider the above property restricted to the set of perfect curves and then, given a perfect curve 
                        C
                     , the set of perfect curves approaching 
                        C
                      determines a proximity class. Therefore, the set of asymptotes that approach a curve at a given infinity branch is also a proximity class.

In this section, we provide a method that allows, in same cases, to compute the curves in a proximity class. For this purpose, we first introduce the following definition.


                     
                        Definition 7
                        A regular perfect curve is a curve having a unique infinity point, which is regular.

From Proposition 4, regular perfect curves are a subset of the set of perfect curves. In the following, we prove a nice property of this subset which will allow us to decide whether two regular perfect curves approach each other by comparing their implicit polynomials.

More precisely, Theorem 3 states that a polynomial defining implicitly a regular perfect curve has some irrelevant terms (i.e. terms that do not affect the asymptotic behavior of the curve). If we modify the coefficients of these terms, we obtain a new perfect curve that approaches the original one. Hence, we can construct infinitely many different asymptotes approaching a given plane curve simply by manipulating its irrelevant terms.

In the following, we consider two approaching perfect curves 
                        C
                      and 
                        
                           C
                           ¯
                        
                     . From statement 2 in Remark 2, we have that both curves have a unique common infinity point P. In the next corollary, we prove that P is a regular point of 
                        C
                      iff P is a regular point of 
                        
                           C
                           ¯
                        
                     . Thus, we deduce that a perfect curve having a singular infinity point cannot be approached by a regular perfect curve.
