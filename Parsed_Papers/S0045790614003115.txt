                  Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems currently use the polling technique for monitoring electric utility networks. Unfortunately, conventional SCADA systems do not suit the needs of smart grids in terms of the required data rate. Polling-based wireless networks can extend the capabilities of SCADA systems as they provide low cost transceivers and bounded packet delay. However, the harsh environment of power stations negatively impacts the performance of wireless links. This paper introduces a field measurement-based study that focuses on the effect of power system noise and transients on packet delivery reliability of Zigbee and WiFi polling-based wireless networks. Extensive experiments show that the electromagnetic interference emitted from high voltage substations, during normal operation conditions, do not significantly affect wireless communication in the gigahertz range. Moreover, we analytically and experimentally demonstrate that abnormal operation conditions of power systems may negatively impact the reliability of packet delivery in polling-based wireless networks. Furthermore, we show that this negative impact can be mitigated by following some proposed technical considerations regarding the wireless standard, the operating frequency, the location, and the number of wireless transceivers used.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Smart grids represent the future of power grids as they provide the opportunity and a multitude of solutions for power utility companies to efficiently manage energy generation. Smart grids also integrate renewable energy resources into the classical power network, which changes its radial power flow nature. Therefore, power grid automation represents one of the highest priority objectives for the successful implementation of smart grids.

In the era of smart grids, the definition of power grid maintenance is broadened to include the self-healing activities, i.e., automated activities that preserve the function of an asset in the power network [1]. In other words, the full-fledged realization of self-healing in smart grids makes the power network capable of detecting system abnormal conditions, isolating system faults, and restoring system power without human intervention.

In fact, real-time monitoring and fast response during abnormal power system operation are important for fault detection, isolation, and system restoration procedures. Currently, SCADA systems are widely used to monitor/control conventional power grids. Admittedly, most of the current deployments of SCADA systems use the polling technique in order to send data to or from end devices or remote terminal units (RTUs) via low data rate multidrop communication links (e.g., 9.6kb/s or lower) [2,3]. Fig. 1
                      outlines the there basic phases of electric power supply (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) with a focus on the typical SCADA architecture for power distribution networks. Fig. 1 shows a SCADA master controller (usually located at a high/medium voltage substation
                        1
                        Distribution substations contain step down transformers, where the first voltage level (e.g., high) refers to the voltage level of the primary side of the transformer and the second voltage level (e.g., medium) refers to the voltage level at the secondary side.
                     
                     
                        1
                     ) monitors/controls medium voltage substations by communicating with their RTUs via a multidrop communication link using the polling technique [2]. In this technique, the SCADA master controller sends a request message to every RTU, one by one, asking for the availability of any system alarms or updated information. Each RTU replies back, if it has data to send. The request and the reply constitute a polling transaction. However, the current capacity of communication links in SCADA systems provides a delayed status of the monitored components with 3–5s information reporting latency [3]. In addition, most medium/low-voltage distribution substations (e.g., 11/0.24kV) are not covered by SCADA systems (i.e., no monitoring is available) [3].

Fortunately, the availability of low-cost easy-to-deploy miniature wireless transceivers makes it possible to transfer data representing fast changing physical phenomena in electric power systems with a high data rate. Therefore, wireless technologies can extend SCADA systems in medium/low-voltage distribution networks by combining high data rate with low data transfer latency, which are required to enable the realization of self-healing in these networks [2]. Consequently, the scope of this work addresses monitoring medium/low voltage substations. This is performed by using a single-hop polling-based wireless network in order to collect data from various sensors, which are distributed inside a substation, then sending it to a network controller (or coordinator) located also inside the substation. The infrastructure of the communication between the network coordinator and other SCADA system entities is out of the scope of this work.

Generally, power systems generate significant amount of electromagnetic interference that may negatively impact the operation of wireless communication links and their electronic circuits. This electromagnetic interference can cause erroneous packet reception, if it has sufficient power within the operating bandwidth of these wireless links. Therefore, our focus in this paper is on the reliability of packet delivery using polling-based wireless mechanisms provided by Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), WiFi-2.4GHz (IEEE 802.11g), and WiFi-5GHz (IEEE 802.11a) standards while operating inside medium/low voltage distribution substations. In fact, some polling-based schemes, which are introduced in IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 standards, trade off packet delivery reliability for fast data transfer. For instance, in IEEE 802.15.4, a coordinator does not have to acknowledge the data packets successfully received from end devices. This implies that no packet retransmission is performed. However, timely wireless transfer of sensed data without packet loss, specially during power system abnormal conditions, is crucial. The lost packets may contain very important sensed data. These abnormal conditions are usually related to fault conditions, which do not frequently occur [4,5], and hence they do not have any tangible effect on the communication network capacity or the average data transfer throughput. Thus, the main focus of this paper is on achieving reliable packet delivery of polling-based systems by reducing the probability of unsuccessful transactions to be almost zero, particularly when packet retransmissions are abandoned for fast packet delivery in real-time applications.

The paper presents four contributions as in the following.
                        
                           •
                           The path loss for wireless communication links inside medium/low voltage substations is experimentally studied by estimating the path loss exponent and the standard deviation for log-normal shadowing. This study is essential to analytically determine the probability of receiving certain amount of power by a wireless transceiver for some given transmitter–receiver distance.

The paper experimentally investigates the amount of electromagnetic interference power, which is emitted from different power system components, and its impact on Zigbee links during normal operation conditions of high voltage substations as a worst case scenario.

The paper offers an analytical expression to calculate the probability of unsuccessful polling transactions in the presence of impulsive transients electromagnetic interference for some given interference power level, location of the master polling controller, and end devices. The mathematical expression is validated by a comparative series of experiments using Zigbee, WiFi-2.4GHz, and WiFi-5GHz communication links in a lab-emulated yet realistic interference level based on actual impulse tests.

In the light of the presented analytical expression, the paper offers some technical considerations to achieve near zero probability of unsuccessful transactions based on the amount of interference power, the transmit power level of wireless transceivers given their placement in a distribution substation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights the most relevant related works in the literature. Section 3 presents the main characteristics of two polling-based wireless technologies showing their packet delay performance. In Section 4, we characterize the path loss model of wireless links in medium/low-voltage substations. An experimental field study for the effect of electromagnetic interference of power system components under normal operation conditions is provided in Section 5. Section 6 introduces an analytical and experimental study for the probability of unsuccessful polling transactions of different wireless technologies in the presence of impulsive transients electromagnetic interference. Technical issues and important considerations for reliable packet delivery over polling-based wireless networks in smart grids are discussed in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.

Wireless data transfer, by nature, may be subject to interference that affects the reliability of data delivery. However, only few research works in the literature address the efficiency of wireless technologies when operating in the harsh environment inside power stations. Shan et al. [6] introduce the impact of 400kV substation partial discharge activity and switching phenomena only on the performance of ZigBee transceivers but without addressing impulsive transients. The authors in [7] investigate the effect of 400kV transmission lines on wireless transceivers operating in 900MHz frequency range. In [8], the background noise and physical channel characteristics of the 2.4GHz frequency band are investigated in different power system environments. Based on the field study of [8], the authors in [9] conduct an analytical study for the impact of the measured wireless channel propagation characteristics in power stations on the performance of Zigbee links. However, the research works in [8,9] do not explore the effect of high electromagnetic interference or impulsive transients on Zigbee communications or other wireless technologies.

By using laboratory measurements in an earlier study [10,11], it has been shown that high power transients affect the quality of operation of Zigbee wireless sensors, causing a significant packet loss and delay. Also, a total disruption of communication links is observed, which may require resetting the Zigbee devices. In a previous work [12], an analytical model for high power transient signals has been introduced. The model estimates an upper bound on the amount of electromagnetic interference radiated during high power transients. This helps to predict whether a wireless link is subject to a complete disruption under high power transients or not, given the amount of transmit power and the wireless technology used.

The novelty of this research work lies mainly in the following points, which have not been touched before in the previous research works [10–12]. First, a realistic path loss model of medium/low voltage substations is experimentally characterized. Second, the results of extensive field measurements for the effect of the electromagnetic interference (emitted by some potential power system interferers such as high voltage transformers, overhead transmission lines, and switching components) on Zigbee links under normal operation conditions are introduced. Third, a mathematical expression for the probability of unsuccessful polling transactions (for polling-based wireless networks), under the effect of strong electromagnetic interference, is devised and validated by field experiments. Based on this expression, the paper presents some technical considerations for achieving near-zero probability of unsuccessful polling transactions during abnormal operation conditions of power system components.

At present, SCADA system deployments commonly rely on the IEC 61850 protocol for substation automation. The IEC 61850 uses the polling technique for real-time critical monitoring applications operating over Ethernet links and wireless networks [13]. We mainly address low cost polling-based wireless technologies based on the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi-2.4GHz and WiFi-5GHz) and IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee).

To the best of our knowledge, no study available in the literature addresses the combined effect of wireless path loss characteristics of wireless communication links, the power level of electromagnetic interference, the bandwidth, and the operating frequency on the reliability of data transfer of different polling-based wireless technologies (such as Zigbee and WiFi).

SCADA systems mainly depend on the polling technique for information exchange [3]. Typically, a SCADA control entity polls remote terminal units (RTUs) to send the information they have. RTUs are usually connected to sensors that provide analog or digital data such as the current level in a substation transformer or a circuit breaker position, respectively [3].

Polling is an access control technique for a shared communication medium that guarantees a contention free access for the communication devices competing to use the medium. In a polling-based communication network, a communication device can access a shared communication channel only after getting a polling request from a controlling entity.

At present, SCADA systems use multidrop low speed wired communication links (e.g., 9.6kbps), which can transfer very limited amount of information with a significant delay. However, the successful implementation of smart grids mandates providing the latest system status to the system controlling entities with low latency [3].

Using a polling access technique over wireless links extends the SCADA system capabilities with easy-to-deploy high data rate links. In this section, we shed some light on the packet delivery delay capabilities of two widely used wireless technologies that exploit the polling technique, namely, Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) and WiFi (IEEE 802.11).

IEEE 802.11 [14] provides two different mechanisms to access a single radio channel. The first one is the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF), which is based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. The second is the IEEE 802.11 point coordination function (PCF), which is a polling-based mechanism.

In IEEE 802.11 DCF, when the channel changes its state from busy to idle, a random backoff procedure is initiated at every node to resolve any possible contention conflicts among competing nodes by employing a backoff timer.

In IEEE 802.11 PCF, the time is divided into superframes. Each superframe starts by a beacon sent by the point coordinator (PC), which is usually the access point. A contention free period (CFP) follows the beacon and its duration is determined by the PC. The rest of the superframe contains a contention access period (CAP). During the CFP, the PC polls the network nodes one by one in a round robin fashion according to a polling list. Once a node receives a poll from the PC, the node should respond by an ACK only or data+ACK frame. However, if the PC does not receive an ACK, it waits for some time interval and then moves to the next node in the polling order [14].

In the following, we analytically compare between the packet delivery delay performance for the IEEE 802.11 DCF (CSMA/CA) and the IEEE 802.11 PCF. For presentation conciseness, we only show the equations that directly lead to the final results, whereas any other related details and/or equations can be obtained from their corresponding references. We assume a network of 
                           
                              N

                              10
                           
                         nodes (end devices) communicating with a coordinator by exchanging packets of size 
                           
                              L

                        bytes with a 2Mbps data rate. We also assume that packet arrivals follow Poisson process with a packet arrival rate of 
                           
                              λ
                           
                        .

First, we calculate the packet delivery delay assuming that network nodes communicate to each other only by using IEEE 802.11 DCF with 
                           
                              λ
                           
                         close to the network saturation point to get the highest possible throughput [15]. The packet service time
                           2
                           The packet service time is defined as the packet delay measured from the time moment when the packet is at the head of a node’s buffer to the instant of being successfully transmitted.

                         is the superframe duration, which includes the CFP and minimum CAP duration. Fig. 2
                         shows the relation between the node buffer utilization factor

                         and packet delivery delay. In fact, the higher the value of

                        , the higher the data traffic load at this node. Fig. 2 provides a comparison between the polling-based IEEE 802.11 PCF and the CSMA/CA-based IEEE 802.11 DCF in terms of packet delay performance at different values of

                         per node (i.e., different values of data traffic load per node). As observed in Fig. 2, the average packet delay for the polling-based IEEE 802.11 PCF is significantly shorter than IEEE 802.11 DCF for the same system parameters, specially with high data traffic load (
                           
                              ρ

                              0.97
                           
                        ). This indicates that WiFi polling-based networks can achieve shorter packet delay compared to CSMA/CA-based networks even with large data traffic loads. Moreover, they are capable of transferring a high data volume with a high data rate (up to 54Mbps [19,20]), which matches the requirements for automating various smart grid applications.

IEEE 802.15.4 has two basic modes of operation, namely, the beacon-enabled mode and the non-beacon mode. In the beacon-enabled mode, the time is divided into frames, where each frame has 16 time slots. The frame is divided into an inactive period and an active period (CFP+CAP), which is determined by the superframe order (SO) parameter. In the CFP, the wireless channel access is granted via guaranteed time slots (GTS) in a way similar to time division multiple access (TDMA) [21]. In the non-beacon mode, the access to the wireless channel is performed by using non-slotted CSMA/CA protocol. Here, we focus on the communication between the end devices and the coordinator via GTSs in the CFP, which can provide short packet delay for delay-sensitive smart grid applications.

According to IEEE 802.15.4, a personal area network (PAN) should have one PAN coordinator to control the PAN, while the other nodes can be end devices. Generally, an end device can send data packets directly to a coordinator, however, it is optional for the coordinator to acknowledge the data packets of the end device [21]. Therefore, the manufacturers of Zigbee transceivers introduce two modes of operations, namely, acknowledgment (ACK) mode and No-ACK mode [22]. A coordinator notifies the end devices through the beacon (in the beacon-enabled mode), if data packets are destined towards them. After that, the end devices poll the coordinator to get their data.

In fact, the No-ACK mode is devised to provide a fast data delivery between end devices (which are usually connected to sensors) and coordinators. In the sequel, we analytically evaluate the packet delay achieved by the No-ACK mode compared with the ACK mode. We assume that 7 end devices communicate with the coordinator using GTS in the CFP and no inactive period is considered. The packet delivery delay from an end device to a coordinator

                         illustrates the packet delay performance for the ACK and No-ACK modes, calculated by the aid of (4) and (5), with different values of packet arrival rate. Fig. 3 shows that the No-ACK mode outperforms the ACK mode in terms of packet delivery delay, specially when the packet arrival rate increases (i.e., amount of data to be transferred increases). This makes the No-ACK mode a strong candidate for Zigbee networks if they are used in delay-sensitive applications of smart grids.

Generally, the power level of the electromagnetic interference emitted from a power system component may be sufficiently high to cause bit errors, and hence unsuccessful packet reception. This may lead to a loss of the response of a polling request from the PC to one of the nodes or the loss of the request itself. Moreover, the IEEE 802.11 PCF assumes that receiving no response from a node after a polling request means the node has no data to send, while the response may have been lost. This makes the PC poll the next node in the polling list without waiting to receive correctly the data of the lost response. Also, in the No-ACK mode of Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), no acknowledgment is used, and hence there is no chance for packet retransmissions in case a packet is lost. In fact, both the IEEE 802.11 PCF and the No-ACK mode of IEEE 802.15.4 try to achieve fast packet transfer but at the expense of packet delivery reliability. Furthermore, the electromagnetic interference may affect the reception of beacon signals of polling-based systems leading to an undesirable packet delay as some nodes have to wait for the next superframe to send their data. Therefore, in Section 7, we introduce essential technical considerations that lead to achieving almost zero probability of unsuccessful polling transactions.

In this section, the wireless channel path loss model inside a distribution substation is characterized. The path loss is the difference between the transmit and received power in dB. The channel path loss model helps to calculate the received signal power at a wireless transceiver. This leads to evaluating the received signal-to-noise ratio, which controls the received packet error rate. We focus on medium-to-low voltage (11/0.24kV) distribution substations, which are mostly not monitored by current SCADA systems. Monitoring these substations provide smart grids with rich information that helps in automating fault localization and system restoration.

Wireless channel path loss can be estimated indoors by the aid of [24]

This is represented by the normally distributed random variable X in (6), which has a zero mean and a standard deviation

                      have to be determined. Therefore, field measurements are performed using two Xbee Pro units [22] forming a Zigbee communication link. The received signal power is recorded at each unit at different locations and different separation distances in medium-to-low (11/0.24kV) voltage distribution substations with typical dimensions of 8m×5m. Fig. 4
                      presents the results of the measurements as a scattered plot. Each point in this figure represents the path loss at some transmitter–receiver distance. Fig. 4 reveals that different path loss values are measured for the same transmitter–receiver distance but at different positions for the transmitter and the receiver due to the effect of obstacles on the signal path.

In order to find the value of n, we use linear regression to find the best fit that leads to the minimum mean square error between the estimated path loss calculated from (6) and the results of the field measurements. A straight line corresponds to a path loss exponent of

                      is obtained as depicted in Fig. 4. This value for n implies less attenuation for the wireless signals than free space (in free space

                     ) due to signal reflections coming from the metallic structure of a transformer. Moreover, the path loss is not likely to be large due to the small areas of these substations [24]. A standard deviation 
                        
                           σ
                        
                      of around 5.3dB is obtained based on the field measurements using the same approach described in [24].

This section experimentally investigates the wireless packet delivery reliability in the presence of electromagnetic interference emitted from power system components during normal operation conditions (NOCs). Although our main focus is on medium-to-low voltage (11kV/0.24kV) substations, we investigate here wireless packet delivery reliability inside high voltage 400kV substations. Indeed, this is a worst case scenario as the electromagnetic interference emitted from high voltage substations is higher than medium-to-low voltage substations [25].

We are particularly interested in observing the behavior of IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) under NOCs in three different locations inside 400kV substations, namely, under 400kV overhead transmission lines (OHTLs), close to the 400/220kV power transformers, and close to the substation static voltage, ampere, reactive (VAR) compensator (SVC). Zigbee transceivers are selected for this experiment as a part of our worst case scenario since they operate in the 2.4GHz band and usually transmit with low power (0–3dBm nominal).

In this experiment, the effect of the noise power level and the location of the noise source on the quality of a Zigbee communication link is monitored and measured. A spectrum analyzer is used to capture the frequency and power level of noise signals. The experiment is performed in two steps. First, the spectrum analyzer is used to measure the interference power in the entire 2.4GHz industrial-scientific-medical frequency band (from 2.4 to 2.5GHz) by sampling this band into small sub-bands and measures the average power in each as presented in Fig. 5
                     . In the second step, a communication link is established between two low power Xbee units [22]. One is configured as a coordinator, whereas the other is configured as an end device. We perform the loopback test provided by the manufacturer of the Xbee units through the accompanying X-CTU software [22]. In this test, the X-CTU software runs on a laptop directly connected to the coordinator device. The software repetitively sends a 32-Byte broadcast message for a selected number of times through the coordinator device to the end device, which echoes back each message. The X-CTU software counts the number of packets that are correctly received by the coordinator device. The test is performed the same way for the three locations mentioned above inside the power substation as in the following.

Around the power transformer, we perform the loopback test in four different positions as Fig. 6
                      reveals.
                        3
                        The positions are selected in a way that avoids having the end device completely blocked from the coordinator, which results in significant packet loss due to the weak signal level received.
                     
                     
                        3
                      
                     Fig. 5(a) shows that the average noise power level of the sampled 2.4GHz ISM band is mostly below −80dBm. The outcome of the loopback test indicates that there is a reliable packet delivery over the Zigbee communication link with no packet loss. This is expected as the average noise power level in each Zigbee channel, as illustrated in Table 1
                     , is around −84dBm. This is sufficiently below the received power level (from −34dBm to −61dBm) of a Zigbee device over the coordinator-end device distance range under test (26m as shown in Fig. 6) according to the dual-slope piecewise path loss model E adopted by IEEE TGn group for large areas [26]. The loopback test results indicate that a three-meter communication link (between the Zigbee coordinator and end device) is not affected by the electromagnetic field around the transmission line. Fig. 5(b) shows that the noise power level captured close to the 400kV-OHTL does not exceed −80dBm in most of the sample sub-bands. Also, Table 1 presents that an average noise power level of around −84.2dBm measured close to the 400kV-OHTL over different Zigbee channels. The noise power level that is captured in the vicinity of the SVC is illustrated in Fig. 5(b) to be mostly below −80dBm. The average measured amount of noise power in the vicinity of the SVC in each Zigbee channel is around −85.8dBm as in Table 1.
                        4
                        The recorded interference power value is a little bit less than the OHTL and the power transformer cases since the measurements are done indoors.
                     
                     
                        4
                      This indicates an insignificant effect on wireless communication links operating in the 2.4Ghz band. The results of the loopback test performed on a line-of-sight (LOS) three-meter Zigbee link in the vicinity of the SVC indicate no packet loss, which conforms with what we inferred from the spectrum analyzer measurements. Apparently, electromagnetic interference emitted from power system components under normal operation conditions has no significant effect on packet delivery reliability.

Impulsive transients represent one of the harshest phenomena that can impact wireless communication links. Indeed, some power system components (e.g., coils), when affected by impulsive transients, may radiate spurious electromagnetic emissions with a significant power level even in the gigahertz range.

The effect of impulsive transients on wireless communication links is investigated by conducting an impulse test on the stator winding of a 4kV induction motor [10]. A Zigbee link that consists of a coordinator and an end device is setup in the vicinity of the coil under test. It is found that the interference power radiated from power system components due to impulsive transients can negatively impact Zigbee wireless communication links causing unsuccessful packet transmissions and occasionally a complete disruption of the communication link [10,11].

It is worth noting that impulsive transient signals can also be obtained due to system faults [4]. This implies a possible loss of packets carrying important sensed data that could be used to support essential smart grid applications such as automated fault detection/localization and system restoration. However, the frequency of occurrence of these abnormal conditions is quite small [5]. Moreover, transients, by nature, stay for significantly short time, and hence their effect on the wireless link capacity or the average throughput of data reporting is negligible. Thus, in the sequel, we focus on studying the probability that an unsuccessful polling transaction happens in the presence of impulsive transients. We start first by analytically characterizing the probability of unsuccessful polling transactions. After that, we experimentally validate the devised analytical expression.

As a matter of fact, unsuccessful packet transmission happens when the received signal level at a wireless receiver input falls below the receiver sensitivity level S. Therefore, the probability of unsuccessful packet transmission for a packet sent by a transmitter j

It is imperative that an impulse test has to be repeated a large number of times for the sake of studying

                         and validating (14) by hardware measurements for different locations of coordinator and end devices. However, it is difficult and expensive to sufficiently repeat the impulse test as it may be destructive at times. Therefore, we regenerate impulsive transient signals, similar to the lab-emulated signals shown in Fig. 7
                        (a), using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulator [28] as revealed in Fig. 7(b). The simulated signal depicted in the figure is generated as a combination of a full-wave and a front-of-wave transient signals [29], which are produced using a sampling interval of 0.1ns. The composite transient signal magnitude, rise time, and decay time are controlled by the simulated full-wave and front-of-wave signals. For the simulated impulsive transient signals, we calculate the amount of interference power contained in the frequency bands of Channel 14, Channel 6, and Channel 36 of IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11a, and IEEE 802.11g standards, respectively. The calculations are done by the aid of (15) after applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the simulated signals in order to evaluate 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                              
                           
                        .

Consequently, we generate the estimated interference level of the simulated signals by using Keithley 2920 vector signal generator (VSG). In the experimental setup, the VSG emulates the impulsive transient electromagnetic interference so it is put near the bushings of a 1 MVA distribution transformer. The experiment is performed by one coordinator-end device communication link. We vary the location of the end device around the transformer such as the distance between the interferer and the end device is kept at 1m as illustrated in Fig. 8
                        . This is reasonable since the deployment positions of wireless sensors for monitoring the transformer status are expected to be close to the transformer body. In addition, we check the communication link performance (under a continuous effect of the interferer) against different locations of the network coordinator by changing its location in three different sets of measurements. In each set, the distance d between the network coordinator and the end device is fixed at a certain value (i.e., 1, 2, and 3m for the first, second, and third set, respectively.) as shown in Fig. 8. The experiment is conducted for three wireless technologies as in the sequel and the results are shown in Fig. 9
                        . Table 2
                         summarizes the parameters and the equipment used for each experiment.


                        Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4): We use two Digi ConnectPort X2 [30] devices, one is configured as a coordinator and the other one as an end device. Each Digi ConnectPort X2 device contains a high power (12dBm) Xbee Pro Zigbee transceiver [22] connected internally to a microprocessor, which is capable of running small Python programs. A Python program is developed and installed over the two devices. The program emulates a polling transaction by sending a one-byte message from the network coordinator and the message is echoed back to the coordinator if it is received correctly by the end device. If the message is not received back successfully by the coordinator, an unsuccessful polling transaction is considered.


                        Fig. 9(a) shows that the analytical and the simulation results for 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         versus the interference power (in dBm), for different coordinator-end device distances, are in close match. Fig. 9(a) depicts that an increase in the coordinator-end device distance leads to an increase in the probability of unsuccessful transactions. The reason is that the path loss increases when the distance between the coordinator and an end device increases as (6) and (7) imply. This weakens the received signal at the end device, and hence makes the received power falls below the receiver sensitivity, which leads to a packet loss.


                        WiFi-

                        GHz (IEEE 802.11g): In this experiment, two Netgear 3500L wireless routers [31] are used. The bridge mode is configured on both routers. In this mode, one router acts as a base (coordinator) unit, whereas the other one acts as a repeater (end device). The base unit is connected to a laptop. Similar to the experiment performed on the Zigbee-based devices, the polling transaction is emulated by issuing the Internet control message protocol (ICMP) ping command from the laptop to the end device in the presence of the interferer. The ping packet has to go over the air through the WiFi link (Channel 6) from the coordinator to the end device, which echoes it back to the coordinator. Unsuccessful pings imply unsuccessful polling transactions. Fig. 9(b) shows the analytical results of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         compared with the experimental results for the same interfering power levels that are used with Zigbee transceivers in the previous experiment. Fig. 9(b) reveals the same trend for

                         as in Fig. 9(a) but with generally smaller 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         values at the same coordinator-end device distance and interfering power. The reason is that the nominal transmit power for the Netgear 3500L routers is 16dBm, which is greater than the transmit power of the Xbee Pro transceivers.

The maximum amount of radiated interference power in the frequency band of Channel 6 of WiFi-2.4GHz due to the existence of the signal in Fig. 7(b) can be approximately calculated by using FFT then by substituting in (15) 
                        [12]. The calculated interference power is approximately −1dBm, which is higher than the interference level captured by Zigbee channels affected by the same signal (around −12dBm). This is due to the fact that the bandwidth of a WiFi-2.4GHz channel is almost 10 times the bandwidth of a Zigbee channel. Consequently, WiFi-2.4GHz links are more likely to be interrupted by impulsive transients than high-power Zigbee links during the occurrence of impulsive transients.


                        WiFi-5
                        
                        GHz (IEEE 802.11a): Here, we use Asus Dual Band N-900 wireless routers [32] configured in a bridge mode. The experiment is performed in a way exactly similar to the previous experiment, however, Channel 36 (5.18GHz) is used. The experiment and the analytical use of (13) and (14) provide the results of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         as given in Fig. 9(c). Fig. 9(c) evidently shows that the WiFi-5GHz links achieve less 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         for the same interference power level compared with both Zigbee and WiFi-2.4GHz links. The reason behind this better performance is the high transmit power that the Asus N-900 routers utilizes (22dBm). Although, the Asus Dual Band N-900 can be employed to perform the previous experiment, we use different router brand in each experiment as two different samples of commercial WiFi transceivers. Thus, they do not depend on specific implementation enhancements or problems related to the equipment manufacturer design. Fig. 9(d) shows the results for an experiment similar to the previous one for WiFi-2.4GHz using the Asus Dual Band N-900 wireless routers with a transmit power of 22dBm. Fig. 9(d) illustrates that WiFi-2.4GHz links with high transmit power achieve less 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    ut
                                 
                              
                           
                         at relatively high interference power levels (such as −15dBm) compared with the results of lower transmit power (16dBm) WiFi-2.4GHz links that are shown in Fig. 9(b).

On the other hand, WiFi-5GHz links can capture an interference power of −10dBm (based on FFT energy calculation and (15)) when they are subjected to an impulsive transient signal such as the one shown in Fig. 7(b). This amount is less than the interference power captured by the WiFi-2.4GHz links that have similar bandwidth due to the high operating frequency of the WiFi-5GHz links.

It is worth noting that the SNR values used to evaluate (14) are 22dB for the WiFi-2.4GHz (Netgear 3500L router) and 20dB for the Zigbee and Asus Dual Band N-900 router (WiFi-2.4GHz and WiFi-5GHz). These relatively high SNR values are mainly attributed to the performance of the automatic gain control (AGC) circuits of the wireless transceivers in the presence of a narrow band interferer as discussed in [33].

Fast polling techniques achieve low-latency packet transfer by sending packets without waiting for acknowledgments or without retransmissions. However, abnormal conditions such as impulsive transients can cause significant probability of unsuccessful polling transactions based on the interference power level. This may lead to the possibility of losing essential sensed data that can be used to locate/isolate a fault during abnormal conditions. Thus, achieving both packet delivery reliability and fast packet transfer over polling-based wireless networks require the reduction of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 ut
                              
                           
                        
                      to be nearly zero. In fact, this cannot be fully realized by selecting specific locations for polling coordinators and end devices as (13) and (14) may imply. The reason is that spurious electromagnetic emissions can arise from different locations (e.g., equipment terminals or breaker contactors) during impulsive transients, and hence the exact locations of the electromagnetic interference sources are not precisely known.

Therefore, the following proposed considerations should be taken into account for smart grid applications with high sensitivity to packet loss and latency. First, we propose using more than one wireless transceiver to send the same sensed data (packet replicas). This implies that each sensor, such as a multi-terminal current transformer (CT), will be connected to more than one wireless transceiver via a short wired bus instead of only one transceiver as in the case of wireless sensors. These wireless transceivers are placed normally at various locations around the monitored substation equipment and as close as possible to the deployed sensors.

Second, the usage of high power WiFi-5GHz transceiver (up to 35dBm in the range 5.745–5.805GHz [19]) is proposed since the 5GHz range captures less interference than the 2.4GHz range while supports up to 54Mbps data rate, which allows one transceiver to send data simultaneously from multiple sensors. Fig. 10
                     (a) shows the probability of unsuccessful transactions with varying transmit power level for different number of packet replicas (i.e., different number of transceivers used to transmit the same data packet). Since an independent polling transaction is performed for each transceiver, the probability of unsuccessful transactions of m replicas is the result of multiplying 
                        
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 ut
                              
                           
                        
                      for a single replica m times. The data shown in Fig. 10(a) is for a worst case scenario of a high interference power of −5dBm, where the interferer is 1m away from the end device and the coordinator-end device distance is 3m. For a certain interference power, Fig. 10(a) reveals that the higher the transmit power and/or the number of replicas, the less the probability of unsuccessful transactions since the received power increases as well. As depicted in Fig. 10, sending the same sensed data from only three different transceivers (3 packet replicas) with high transmission power (35dBm) can lead to almost zero probability of unsuccessful transactions. Moreover, Fig. 10(b) shows the ns-2 simulation results for the successful packet delivery ratio (PDR) for both transmission directions (coordinator-to-end device and end device-to-coordinator). The figure illustrates the cases of transmitting two and three replicas with different transmit power levels. The simulation is performed for an IEEE 802.11a network that contains a coordinator and 3 end devices with exactly the same parameters used in Fig. 10(a). Different shadowing values are used in each simulation trial under a continuous application of −5dBm interference level. In practice, impulsive transients stay for a very short duration and happen with a quite small frequency of occurrence [4,5]. Fig. 10(b) shows that, in a worst case scenario of a continuous application of impulsive transients interference, sending 3 replicas with a high transmit power will lead to almost 
                        
                           100
                           %
                        
                      PDR in both transmission directions.

By following the above considerations, a polling-based WiFi-5GHz technology can outperform a typical SCADA system in terms of message reporting delay. Fig. 11
                      shows the message delay performance of a typical SCADA system [34] compared with IEEE 802.11 PCF with different numbers of monitored units. The IEEE 802.11 PCF system sends 3 message replicas for the same sensed data. We assume that each monitored unit generates data messages following Poisson distribution with an average message generation interval of 1s and a message size of 48bytes [34]. A worst-case data rate of 6Mbps for WiFi-5GHz is considered, whereas a relatively high SCADA data rate of 9600bps is used [2,3]. In a typical SCADA system, a controller polls monitored units one by one in a round-robin fashion. If a monitored unit does not have data to send, it sends a null message [34]. Here, it is assumed that all units have data to send. As depicted in Fig. 11, using a polling-based WiFi-5GHz technology achieves significantly shorter message transfer latency than typical SCADA systems even if the same sensed data is sent three times.

The paper offers an experimental study for the performance of different polling-based wireless communication technologies inside distribution substations, under normal and abnormal operation conditions (such as impulsive transients). Under normal operation conditions, we experimentally show that wireless communication links operating in the 2.4GHz range can withstand the spurious electromagnetic interference emitted by a power transformer and other high voltage equipment. Furthermore, the paper analytically and experimentally addresses the effect of the occurrence of abnormal operation conditions, such as impulsive transients, on the successful transmission of polling transactions via different wireless technologies (IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11g, and IEEE 802.11a) inside a distribution substation. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate that a reliable packet delivery via wireless communications can be realized during impulsive transients. It can be performed by sending multiple replicas of the sensed data via multiple wireless transceivers that use high transmit power and operate within the upper frequency bands of the 5GHz range. As a future extension to this research work, we plan to study the effect of impulsive transient interference on communication links employing transmit diversity techniques with multiple antennas.
