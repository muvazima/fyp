                  Despite the high prevalence of rhinosinusitis, current inhalation therapy shows limited efficacy due to extremely low drug delivery efficiency to the paranasal sinuses. Novel intranasal delivery systems are needed to enhance targeted delivery to the sinus with therapeutic dosages. An optimization framework for intranasal drug delivery was developed to target polydisperse charged aerosols to the ostiomeatal complex (OMC) with electric guidance. The delivery efficiency of a group of charged aerosols recently reported in the literature was numerically assessed and optimized in an anatomically accurate nose-sinus model. Key design variables included particle charge number, particle size and distribution, electrode strength, and inhalation velocity. Both monodisperse and polydisperse aerosol profiles were considered. Results showed that the OMC delivery efficiency was highly sensitive to the applied electric field and electrostatic charges carried by the particles. Through the synthesis of electric-guidance and point drug release, focused deposition with significantly enhanced dosage in the OMC can be achieved. For 0.4µm charged aerosols, an OMC delivery efficiency of 51.6% was predicted for monodisperse aerosols and 34.4% for polydisperse aerosols. This difference suggested that the aerosol profile exerted a notable effect on intranasal deliveries. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the OMC deposition fraction was highly sensitive to the charge and size of particles and was less sensitive to the inhalation velocity considered in this study. Experimental studies are needed to validate the numerically optimized designs. Further studies are warranted to investigate the targeted OMC delivery with both electric and acoustics controls, the latter of which has the potential to further deliver the drug particles into the sinus cavity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common airway diseases that affects 10–15% of the population worldwide and costs $5.8 billion in health care in the U.S. per year [1]. Treatment of rhinosinusitis includes oral therapy, aerosolized inhalation therapy, surgery intervention, and saline irrigation. For allergic rhinosinusitis, a combination of oral and topical steroids and antihistamines will be typically prescribed to eliminate inflammation sources. For chronic rhinosinusitis, a functional endoscopic sinus surgery is often needed to enlarge the sinus opening and recover sinus drainage. In both cases, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to the diseased site is highly desirable, which has the advantage of having a higher drug concentration at the target, acting directly on the site of disease, while minimizing systemic side effects [2–4]. Studies have demonstrated that the dosage at the diseased site, rather than the total dose, should be used as the predictor of clinical outcomes [5]. In addition, the initial site of drug deposition has a significant effect on its bioavailability and associated therapeutic effectiveness [6]. An efficient therapeutic intervention, before or after surgery, is crucial in reducing the risk of recurrences. Furthermore, systemic medications, such as oral corticosteroids, are not effective for many patients and tend to cause considerable adverse effects [4]. Inhalation treatments with topical medications show only modest therapeutic efficacy. There is still a high rate of functional sinus surgeries in rhinosinusitis patients.

Although considerable research was conducted in exploring nasal formulations to improve drug absorption, little effort has been undertaken in upgrading delivery devices targeting the paranasal sinuses [1,4]. Because the middle meatus and sinuses are poorly ventilated during normal breathing, drug delivery to these regions is limited. Most nasally administered medications, such as nasal sprays, will be filtered by the nasal valve and prevented from reaching the middle meatus or sinuses [1]. Nebulizers with small particles and swirling flows have demonstrated significantly improved aerosol delivery beyond the nasal valve region [4]. They can also deliver certain amounts of doses to the sinus; however, the sinus delivery efficiency is very low (<1%). Moreover, there is a considerable amount of unintended deposition into the lungs, which can lead to the irritation of lung tissues. Concerns of pulmonary function deterioration have been raised related to extended inhalation of steroids and insulin [7]. One approach to avoid pulmonary deposition is the bi-directional nasal delivery technique, where drugs are released only during oral exhalation with the soft palate closing the nose off from the lower airway [8]. The setback of this approach is that more than 95% of the drugs will deposit in regions other than the target site, causing significant waste and adverse side-effects [9]. More recently, sinus delivery methods, that include humming and pulsating aerosols, are under active investigation; such techniques have demonstrated improved delivery efficiencies to the paranasal sinuses. However, even with these novel strategies, the delivery efficiency to the middle meatus and sinus is limited, i.e., less than 5%, aside from the substantial drug wastes in other regions of the respiratory tract and the associated adverse side effects [1].

Among all the complexities of the nose anatomy, there are three challenges that are thought to preclude effective delivery of drugs to the maxillary sinus: the nasal valve, the slit-like opening to the middle meatus, and the narrow ostium to the sinus. The nasal valve has the minimum cross-section area in the nasal chamber and behaves as the flow-limiting sector of the nose. The vena-contracta effects associated with the nasal valve induces elevated particle deposition in the nasal valve area due to the enhanced particle inertial impaction. Previous clinical studies demonstrated that a majority of administered medications with MDIs and nasal sprays were wasted in the nasal vestibule and valve regions [1]. The second challenge is the slit-opening to the middle meatus, which is formed by two overlapping flaps of turbinate tissues (middle and inferior conchae) and prevents effective air ventilation and particle transport to the middle meatus. During natural breathing, the majority of inhaled air passes through the nasal median passage and only a small fraction of air is ventilated into the middle meatus via the slit-opening. The third challenge is the thin ostium to the sinus. Mucus and air from the maxillary sinuses drain into the nose under the middle turbinate through the ostium, which is located high on the nasal lateral wall and opens to the hiatus semilunaris of the middle meatus. The maxillary sinus ostium is a funnel-shaped passage about 3–6mm in diameter and 1–22mm in length [10]. The area under the middle turbinate is the ostiomeatal complex (OMC), as shown in 
                     Fig. 1a. Mucus blockage and bacteria proliferation in the OMC are frequent causes of infection in the maxillary sinus. Furthermore, the OMC itself is the most common area for sinus-related disorders and is the primary target for aerosolized drug therapy [10].

Electric control of charged particles has been suggested for targeted drug delivery to the human nose and lungs [11–13]. Enhanced particle deposition in the airways due to electrostatic charges was demonstrated in human subjects, in vitro airway replicas, and numerical modeling [14–24]. Xi et al. [20] numerically explored the potential applications of electric forces to guide charged particles to the olfactory region and predicted significantly enhanced olfactory dosages from electric field guidance. In the same manner, magnetic control of ferromagnetic particles is also promising to target particles to a designated anatomical site [25]. Numerical studies demonstrated that it was feasible to enhance the olfactory dosage to therapeutic levels with magnetophoretic controls [26,27]. Considering the secluded positions of the OMC and sinuses, targeted delivery to the sinuses presents an even more formidable challenge than to the olfactory region. Only a low percentage of inhaled airflow can be ventilated to the OMC and virtually no airflow can penetrate into the sinus. This challenge could be worse in rhinosinusitis patients who suffer from blocked ostia, obstructed nasal passages, and impaired ventilation due to mucosal swelling or nasal polyps.

In a recent study, Xi et al. [28] developed an optimization framework for delivery of charged particles to the OMC. By optimizing multiple design variables, the OMC dose was increased from 45.0% with the baseline model to 72.4% with the optimized system. However, the delivery system developed in Xi et al. [28] was designed specifically for 20nm charged particles. Particle size has been shown to be a critical factor influencing the topical delivery efficiency [20,28]. For delivery systems either with or without E-guidance, smaller micrometer particles have persistently led to higher deposition fractions beyond the nasal valve, presumably because of the reduced inertia impaction loss in the front nose. In a recent study, Golshahi et al. [29] developed an aerosol induction charger and demonstrated the feasibility of generating aerosols with electrical charges one order of magnitude above the diffusion limit through a combination of induction charging and droplet evaporation. A vibrating mesh nebulizer that produced 2.5–4µm droplets was used in conjunction with aqueous solutions of albuterol sulfate and sodium chloride for aerosol generation. The droplets were subsequently charged in an induction charger with electric field strength of 1–5kV/cm and were fully dried by evaporation in airflows of 90L/min within the charging chamber. The resulting particles consisted mainly of albuterol sulfate and sodium chloride, with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of approximately 0.4µm. The average charge number was around 480, which is approximately 5% of the Rayleigh limit of 0.4µm particles [29]. The size distribution of the polydisperse aerosols ranged from 0.03µm to 6.60µm. Charge numbers for particles with a diameter of 0.095–0.96µm were also measured, which fell between the predicted values for dried particles (upper bound) and initial droplets (lower bound) based on the theory of Reischl et al. [30].

The objective of this study is to numerically design a drug delivery system targeting the above-mentioned experimentally generated particles (MMAAD: 0.4µm) at the OMC region in the nasal middle meatus. The rationale underlying the proposed design is that the path of a charged particle can be controlled by applying an appropriate electrical force so that it can escape filtrations and reach the target site. This study has four specific aims: (1) to develop a computational model for nose-sinus drug delivery of charged particles, (2) to design and optimize the delivery system to the OMC for 0.4µm monodisperse aerosols, (3) to conduct a sensitivity analysis of design variables, and (4) to identify the optimal OMC delivery system for polydisperse charged aerosols.

@&#METHODS@&#

A nose-sinus airway model that was reconstructured based on MRI scans in Xi et al. [28] was implemented in this study (Fig. 1b). This MRI data set has been used in multiple in vitro and numerical deposition studies [31–35]. MIMICS (Materialise, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to convert the MRI scans into contours defining the nasal cavity and the maxillary sinus. A surface geometry was constructed from these contours in Gambit.

The diagram of the delivery system for charged particles is shown in Fig. 1b. This system consists of multiple electrodes positioned around the nose to generate an external electric field. When a charged particle is inhaled into the nose, an electric force is exerted onto it and diverts it from its original path. With a proper electric field, the particle can be guided to the target site with reduced deposition in the anterior nose. To further enhance the delivery efficiency, drug particles can be selectively administered into the nose from specific points (i.e., point drug release) instead of the entire nostril [20,36]. In practice, a vibrating mesh nebulizer can be used to generate charged particles, which acquire electrostatic charges either through induction or corona charging [29,37] (Fig. 1c). The charged particles subsequently enter a focusing chamber and are accelerated to a particular exit speed [38]. The benefit of knowing the particle release velocity is that the particle trajectory can be found and the path adjustments required for improved depositions can be determined. The target in this study is the OMC, which hosts the ostium orifice to the maxillary sinus and is where most sinus-related disorders occur [39].

The objective of the design is to maximize the OMC delivery of monodisperse or polydisperse charged aerosols when subjected to an electric field. Due to the complex nasal architecture and the poor ventilation to the middle meatus, only a low percentage of particles can penetrate into the OMC.

Design constraints are the topological feasibility of the electrode layouts, the allowable range of the electric potential, and the electrostatic charge limit of particles. The nozzle exit has a rectangular shape and an area of 5.25mm2 in this study. The inhalation velocity is 0.1m/s. The particle diameter ranges between 0.095 and 0.96µm with a mean of 0.4µm. The mean charge number is 480, which is 4.3% of the Rayleigh limit (11280) for 0.4µm particles [40]. The electrode voltage is below 250V.

There are three categories of design variables: device-related, particle-related, and patient-related. The device-related variables include the drug release position, the nozzle shape, and three electrode groups (E-groups). Among the three E-groups, the first aims to reduce nasal valve filtrations and contains four electrodes, the electric potentials of which are parameterized with B1, T1, T2, and T3. Similarly, the second E-group has one electrode (B2) that facilitates particles to enter the middle meatus through the slit-opening, while the third E-group has two electrodes (C1, C2) to attract particles to the OMC. The point-release position and nozzle shape are parameterized as (x, z, a, and A/a), where A is the nozzle area. The particle-related variables include the density ρ, diameter d
                        
                           p
                        
                        , and charge number n. The patient-related variable is the inhalation velocity, Vin (m/s). In total, fourteen design variables will be examined in this study (
                        Table 1).

The Nelder-Mead algorithm was applied for design optimization in this study [41]. It is a nonlinear gradient-free algorithm for problems whose objective function derivatives tend to be unknown or very noisy. This algorithm uses a simplex (a generalized triangle in N dimensions) to control the search direction by comparing the objective function at each test point of the simplex [41]. The point with the worst result will be rejected and replaced with a new point to start the next search. The process generates a sequence of triangles that constantly get smaller till converging to the optimal point.

Incompressible and isothermal airflow were assumed in this study, with steady inhalations. The inlet Reynolds number at the nostril was approximately 64; therefore, the laminar flow model was implemented to resolve the airflow field.

Lagrangian approach was used to track particle trajectories. Aerosols in this size range have very low Stokes numbers and particle inertia. The governing equation of particle motions is [42],

The distribution of airflow and pressure inside the nose-sinus geometry are demonstrated in 
                        Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the stream traces that were seeded at the left nostril. Nearly no streamline enters the sinus cavity (a dead zone with no outlet). The airflow motion inside the sinus is extremely low, which is four orders of magnitude lower than that of the airflow in the nasal cavity. Due to the flow stagnation, the pressure is nearly uniform within the sinus. The partition of inhaled airflow to different regions in the nose is shown in the middle panel of Fig. 2b. The majority (~80%) of the inhaled airflow goes through the median passage (MP, 55%) and the nasal floor (or inferior meatus, IM, 25%). Less than 10% of airflow is ventilated to the middle meatus (MM) where the OMC is located. In principle, drug aerosols that can be ventilated to the MM should be no more than 10% of the aerosols that are administered into the entire nostril. The fraction that can deposit in the OMC and enter the sinus through the ostium should be even much smaller. To enhance the deposition efficiency in the OMC, the point-release technique is needed. This method administers drug particles into a selected small area, where particles have the highest possibility to reach the target (Fig. 2b, right panel).

In our previous study [28], an E-guided delivery system was optimized for 20nm monodisperse particles. This optimized design was adapted as the baseline design in this study and its performance was tested for 0.4µm monodisperse particles with a charge number of 480. It is not surprising to observe a much lower OMC deposition efficiency (34.6%), as compared to 72.4% for 20nm particles (with a charge number of 136), in light of differences in both particle sizes and charge numbers. The electric field that worked best for 20nm particles does not work the same way for 0.4µm particles because of their different particle charge-mass ratios.

Particle deposition in the absence of an electric field was also presented in 
                        Fig. 3. Without electric field guidance, negligible amount of administered particles can reach the OMC region. Instead, most particles are filtered out by the two barriers, i.e., the nasal valve and the narrow slit leading the middle meatus. Compared to the baseline OMC delivery efficiency (34.6%), only 2.7% of administered doses can be delivered to the OMC without electric guidance, even the point release strategy has been applied. This large difference highlighted the importance of electric guidance in reducing unwanted wall losses and achieving precise targeted drug delivery.

A multi-variable optimization of the baseline design was subsequently performed by following the methodology detailed in Xi et al. [28]. The design variables include electrode voltage, release position, and inhalation velocity. The resultant deposition pattern and deposition fraction (51.6%) are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3a. More focused depositions were attained at the OMC. Furthermore, particle deposition in the nasal valve region was eliminated. Fig. 3c compares the time evolution of the OMC deposition fraction (DF) between the baseline and optimized designs. The longer time for the OMC DF to start as well as to reach the maximal in the optimized design is due to the smaller inhalation speed than that of the baseline design. The time evolution of OMC DF without E-field was also superimposed in Fig. 3c, which shows no perceivable deposition in the OMC region. The optimized design thereof will be referred as “Opt_1” in later sections to distinguish the optimized design for polydisperse aerosols (Opt_2).


                        
                        Fig. 4 shows the deposition pattern and OMC deposition fraction with the Opt_1 design as 0.4µm monodisperse particles are released into the entire nostril. A more dispersed deposition distribution and a considerably lower deposition fraction were observed even with electric field guidance. The majority of administered particles failed to reach the OMC region. Compared to the point release method (51.6%, Fig. 3c), the OMC deposition decreased by a factor of 19–2.7%. The significantly higher OMC deposition with point release explained the seemingly unreasonable discrepancy between the 10% MM flow partition (Fig. 2b) and 51.6% OMC deposition fraction with the optimized design (Fig. 3c). The discrepancy was taken into consideration as particles must enter the MM before reaching the OMC. The point-release position was identified using an inverse approach by tracing back the particles that had deposited in the OMC region to their release positions at the nostril [36]. As a result, particles released from this position are more likely to go to the OMC. The aforementioned inconsistence actually emphasized the crucial role of the point-release strategy in targeted drug deliveries within the nasal cavity. Without it, the OMC delivery will decreases by one order of magnitude. Similarly, without the electric field guidance, negligible amount of particles can reach the OMC region.

To better understand the OMC deposition mechanisms, the sensitivity of the OMC DF to different design variables were systematically studied. The results are shown in 
                        
                        Figs. 5 and 6 for the particle charge, particle size, and carrier flow speed, respectively. Fig. 5a shows the surface deposition patterns for monodisperse 0.4µm particles with six different charge numbers using the Opt_1 design. Very different deposition patterns were observed among the six charge numbers. Besides, no apparent correlation was noted between the deposition pattern and charge number, indicating that the charge number is not reflective of deposition patterns. For the high level charge (20%), particle deposition at the nasal floor (red ellipse) was noted due to the large attraction force from the bottom. As expected, the highest deposition fraction was obtained for the Rayleigh limit ratio of 5.0% (charge number=564) because all other cases are off-design conditions. There is no particle deposition in the OMC region at the two high charge levels (15% and 20% of the Rayleigh limit ratio, Fig. 5b). Overall, the OMC deposition exhibits high sensitivity to the electrostatic charges.

Comparisons of surface deposition patterns and deposition fractions among cases with different particle sizes are shown in Fig. 6. The charge level in terms of the ratio of the Rayleigh limit was kept the same for all particle sizes considered. Relatively similar surface deposition patterns were predicted for submicrometer particles (0.1–1.0µm), while a much different (more focused) pattern was predicted for 2.0µm particles. The OMC deposition fractions are also similar among the five submicrometer particles (41.0–51.8%), as opposed to a much lower deposition fraction (6.6%) for 2µm particles. Relative to the charge number, the sensitivity of the OMC deposition to the particle size (submicrometer) is lower.

The aerodynamic force on a particle depends on several parameters, such as the airflow inlet velocity, the exiting speed of particles from the device nozzle, and the administration angle. The effects of airflow and particle inlet velocities were considered by varying ±40% relative to their original magnitudes (6.1cm/s for airflow, and 10.5cm/s for particles, Opt_1 in Table 1). Within this uncertainty range, the OMC deposition fraction exhibits certain levels of sensitivity to the airflow velocity; however, the sensitivity was observed to be much lower than that of the particle charge or diameter (figure not shown). Furthermore, the OMC deposition appeared to be independent of the initial particle velocity within ±40% particle velocity uncertainties (figure not shown).

Golshahi et al. [29] recently reported an aerosol induction charger that produced highly charged polydisperse droplets. 
                        Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the mass fraction and charge number of the aerosol as a function of the particle diameter. The original experiment contained measurements of twelve stages using an electric low pressure impactor. Only six stages were retained (S3–S8) due to the high uncertainties in measurements for very small (S1, S2) and very large (S9–12) particles [29]. The mode of the particle mass distribution was 0.388µm with a charge number of 411. The large particles (0.96µm) constituted a small mass fraction (~4%) but carried the largest amount of electrostatic charges (Fig. 7). Considering the high sensitivity of the OMC deposition to the particle charge and diameter, an accurate quantification is essential to reliably predict the delivered dosage to the target site.

The optimized design of the E-guidance delivery for polydisperse aerosols (Opt_2) is shown in 
                        Fig. 8 in comparison to both the baseline and the monodisperse-based optimized (Opt_1) designs. The optimized design variables for the monodisperse and polydisperse aerosols are also listed in Table 1. The overall OMC deposition fraction was 34.4% from the Opt_2, 27.9% from the Opt_1, and 25.4% from the baseline, which was significantly lower than those of 0.4µm monodisperse aerosols (Fig. 8 vs. Fig. 3). This is not surprising due to a wide spectrum of particle sizes and charge numbers of the polydisperse aerosol considered herein and their varying responses to electric controls. Particle deposition (red solid arrow) in the nasal valve region was observed for all the three designs. However, the latest design (Opt_2) yielded the least valve loss among the three. The fraction of particles that deposited in the nasopharynx was also least in the Opt_2 design, as illustrated in Fig. 8a in both the lateral (dashed arrow) and top (rectangle) views of the deposition pattern. These particles managed to penetrate into the middle meatus under electric field guidance but failed to deposit there by escaping the electric attraction from the two cone electrodes positioned near the OMC.

The time evolution of the OMC deposition fraction among the three designs is shown in Fig. 8b. Compared to Opt_1, the new design (Opt_2) started the OMC deposition at an even later time after drug administration, which is consistent with a lower inhalation velocity (4.7cm/s vs. 6.1cm/s in Opt_1), as listed in Table 1. It took approximately four seconds for all released particles to deposit in the OMC region with the new design (Opt_2). To better understand the low OMC deposition fraction for polydisperse aerosols, depositions were further computed for individual particle sizes with the new design (Fig. 8b, right panel). The highest deposition fraction (58.4%) was obtained for 0.388µm particles, which also has the largest mass fraction (30.0%). By contrast, the new design gave very low OMC deposition fractions for larger particles (0.621µm and 0.960µm, Fig. 8b). Hence, the final design was a compromise of the performances for all particle sizes and charge numbers that compose the polydisperse aerosol considered in this study.

The most desirable feature of the newly proposed delivery system is its capability to precisely target medications to the OMC, where turbinate mucosal swelling and ostium blockage occurs during a sinusitis episode. This is achieved by the synergy of two separate approaches: particle point-release and control of particle motion using electric force. Results of this study demonstrated highly focused particle deposition in the OMC, and particularly around the sinus ostium. This focused dose will have the benefits of quicker onset of action, lower systemic side effects, and being more efficacious at lower doses [2,3]. Studies have demonstrated that the dosage at the diseased site, rather than the total dose, should be used as the predictor of clinical outcomes [5]. In addition, the initial site of drug deposition has an important effect on its bioavailability and associated therapeutic effectiveness [6].

Recently, Golshahi et al. [29] developed an induction charging device that generated polydisperse aerosols with a mean diameter of 0.4µm and an average charge number of 480. In this study, these experimentally generated charged particles were numerically tested in an image-based nose-sinus model to investigate their dosages to the OMC region. A motivation for the study was to improve the quality of treatments received by rhinosinusitis patients. Charged aerosols of both monodisperse and polydisperse distributions were considered, which gave different OMC dosages. Accordingly, optimized designs were identified for monodisperse and polydisperse charged aerosols separately. It is noted that the high flow rate and the hygroscopic properties of the experimentally generated particles in Golshahi et al. [29] were not taken into account in the modeling herein. Being produced by drying sodium chloride droplets at 90L/min, these particles prone to have high velocities and experience hygroscopic growth in the warm and moist air of the nose [43], both of which will decrease the OMC doses predicted in this study. Several possible ways exist to generate submicrometer charged particles at reduced flow rates. One can modify the nebulizer to a lower output rate in the hope of sufficient drying at low flow rates. A mixer-heater add-on device can also be used to control the particle size [44]. Regarding the particle hygroscopic effects in the nose, the design in this study can be adjusted to include such effects and a new optimized design can be achieved [45,46].

Results of this study show that low flow rate and small particle size are needed for effective OMC delivery. A lower inhalation velocity will give the particles more response time to the applied electric force inside the nose. A smaller particle with the same electrostatic charges will be more responsive to the electric field guidance. Furthermore, a smaller particle has more surface area per unit mass than larger particles and hence allows for a larger charge-to-mass ratio. In this study, a baseline delivery efficiency of 34.6% and an optimal efficiency of 51.6% were predicted for monodisperse (0.4µm) particles with approximately 480 charge numbers. In comparison, the baseline delivery efficiency was predicted to be 45.0% and the optimized efficiency and 72.4% for 20nm particles with a charge number of 100 [28]. For both particle sizes, the inhalation velocities for optimal OMC delivery are slow, with 0.047m/s for 0.4µm and 0.117m/s (2L/min) for 20nm particles. The lower flow rate and smaller particle size desirable for enhanced deliveries are consistent with the recent developments of new nebulizer devices. The poor sinus bioavailability of drug aerosols using nasal spray pumps results from the high speed and large size (~50µm) of the squamous droplets, where the majority of droplets deposited in anterior nose due to the high inertia [47]. The PARI Sinus device that was claimed to improve sinus bioavailability with sonic pressures used a jet nebulizer that generated 3µm droplets and 6L/min output flow [6]. A recent development commercialized as the eFlow electronic nebulizer by PARI incorporated a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which could narrow the particle size distribution (more monodisperse) and reduce the output flow rate by half (3L/min) [48].

The distribution of the particle sizes and charges were observed to have an important effect on the deposition fraction to the OMC region. Lower OMC dosages with the same average particle size, but with polydisperse distributions, were predicted for both the baseline (25.4% vs. 34.6%) and optimized (34.4% vs 51.6%) designs in this study. In principle, all nebulized aerosols are polydisperse with varying size deviations. Compared to jet or ultrasound nebulizers, vibrating mesh nebulizers vibrate a mesh with multiple ultrafine apertures, which generates micrometer droplets as the solution passes through the mesh [49]. Coupled with a drying chamber or a mixer-heater add-on device, submicrometer particles can also be achieved. As a result, an aerosol charger coupled with a mesh vibrating nebulizer and a drying chamber may yield better delivery efficiencies. 
                     Fig. 9 shows the envisioned delivery system, which includes a head brace that houses low voltage electrodes to generate an external electric field (Fig. 9a) and an aerosol charging device. Three conceptual designs of the aerosol charger are shown in Fig. 9b-d, respectively. The first design uses a disk-shape vibrating mesh nebulizer and releases charged aerosols in the horizontal direction, while the second design can utilize any standing nebulizer (such as a Drive Voyager Pro nebulizer). In both designs, a high voltage electrode is implemented to charge aerosols through induction charging. The secondary flow in the first design (Fig. 9b) was intended to form a swirling flow near the tube wall to reduce particle losses to the surface of the wall. For comparison purposes, an aerosol charger based on a jet nebulizer (Design 3) is shown in Fig. 9d in terms of both the CAD model and 3-D printed prototype. In this design, a ring-shaped high voltage electrode was used to charge nebulized aerosols by corona charging [50].

The optimization framework of intranasal E-guidance drug delivery developed in this study provides a versatile tool in the development of targeted delivery devices. The influences of various design factors can be evaluated and refined to improve the targeted delivery efficiency. These factors include device-related (electrode layout and strength), drug-related (size, distribution, charge, density) and patient-related (breathing, age, health) factors. To the authors׳ knowledge, this is the first study that numerically optimized the nasal delivery design with polydisperse aerosols, which incorporating the varying contributions from aerosols of different sizes and charges into one overall design objective. Considering that all drug aerosols are polydisperse, the optimization framework in this study will give a more realistic estimation of the delivered doses. In comparison to in vitro experiments, numerical simulations can save tremendous time and resources and dramatically shorten the design duration. Moreover, simulations can uncover details that are difficult to identify experimentally but appreciably affect the overall performance of the delivery system. The insights obtained via numerical modeling can be implemented to a thoughtful re-design of the devices, ultimately improving the targeted delivery dosages. In addition, the optimization platform in this study can be readily modified to design and optimize intranasal devices targeting at other nasal anatomical sites such as the frontal sinus, ethmoidal sinus, sphenoidal sinus, and olfactory region. However, validations of the numerically predicted results in this study are required by comparison to complementary in vitro experiments using the suggested operating variables herein.

It is noted that the delivery system developed in this study can only guide the aerosols to the OMC region where the ostium leading to the maxillary sinus is located. However, it cannot further make the aerosols to navigate through the narrow, thin ostium into the sinus without over-sophisticated electric field near the sinus ostium. Gas exchange between the main nasal passage and the sinus is very low, if there is any (Fig. 2a). Based on the velocity scale in Fig. 2a (nose: 0–300cm/s vs. sinus: 0–0.03cm/s), the sinus ventilation is estimated to be four orders of magnitude lower than the main flow. The lack of sinus ventilation in this study is corroborated by Moller et al. [51] that significant sinus ventilation could only be observed when applying pulsating flows. On the other hand, the feasibility of delivering aerosols into the sinus has been demonstrated with pulsating flows, even though the delivery efficiency (1–5%) still needs to be improved [51–55]. Aerosols have been observed to penetrate into the maxillary sinus when a pressure gradient was applied between the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity [56]. Based on the observation that humming can induce rapid gas exchanges, Maniscalco et al. [54] reported more homogenously distributed particles in the nasal cavity and aerosol deposition in the sinus. The latter was achieved by enhanced airflow penetration into the otherwise non-ventilated space. Using a pulsating flow with 100Hz frequency, Durand et al. [55] measured an increase of particle deposition into the sinus by a factor of five. The particular mechanism is speculated to function by sound resonance around the sinus ostium yet requires further verification to be certain. It is suggested that by combining the electric-guidance with a pulsating flow, more particles can be delivered into the maxillary sinus. Electric guidance can facilitate particle transport into the OMC region while pulsating pressure waves can enhance navigation through the ostium and into the sinus. Future studies on delivery systems with both electric and acoustic controls are warranted. Specifically, more investigation is needed into the effect of the length and diameter of the sinus ostium, as well as the sinus shape and volume, on the optimal acoustic controls.

The design of the proposed delivery system was based on the nasal airway of a healthy subject. In sinusitis patients, airway obstruction and sinus ostium blockage caused by the mucosal inflammation leads to more impaired ventilations in the nasal passage and sinuses. As a result, it will be more challenging to deliver drugs to the OMC in sinusitis patients. Modifications of electrode strengths are needed to adapt to the required particle trajectories in sinusitis patients versus healthy subjects. For severely obstructed airways, decreased OMC delivery doses are expected. Furthermore, drug particles may not be able to enter the sinus if the diameter of the ostium canal is less than 1mm [56]. To address the above challenges, vasoconstrictors can be applied to the patient to ease the airway obstruction before administering therapeutic agents.

Other limitations that may influence the realism of this study include the assumptions of steady inhalations, rigid surface, one particle size, limited electrode layouts, and numerical modeling only. A low airflow inlet velocity (0.1m/s) was utilized to extend the particle response time to electric forces as well as to reduce the particle inertia. A pattern of breathing in and then briefly holding can also be an alternative to the slow inhalation. The reason underlying the selection of slow inhalation over breathing-holding herein was that a reference streamline was needed to determine the E-potentials to steer a particle from the reference path to the designated path. The uncertainties of delivery efficiencies related to breathing variations can be mitigated by telling patients to breathe steadily and by administering drugs only during the steady phase. In this study, 0.4µm particles with 480 a charge number of 480 were considered based on its feasibility to generate as demonstrated in a recent study [29]. For other particle sizes, a different set of design variables may be needed to give optimal delivery efficiency. A potential setback of using 0.4µm or smaller particles is the longer time needed to administer equivalent doses relative to large micron particles. Golshahi et al. [29] measured the output rate of the nebulizer in their study as 439.3±42.9µL/min. For a given 1000µL solution, for instance, it takes approximately 2–3 seconds for drug administration. Considering the lower inhalation velocity used in this study, longer periods of administration are expected. Additionally, the nose-sinus model in this study was based on medical images of one healthy subject and, therefore, cannot account for the inter-subject variability or the health-disease difference. Future numerical studies with a large cohort of nose-sinus models at varying disease stages are needed to evaluate the variability in design performance. Complementary in vitro experiments are needed to validate the predicted performance of the proposed drug delivery technique.

In summary, an intranasal delivery system was designed and optimized that targeted 0.4µm charged aerosols to the OMC in an image-based nose-sinus model with both monodisperse and polydisperse aerosol profiles. Specific findings of this study are:
                        
                           1.
                           With the synergy of the optimized point-release and electric control, an OMC delivery efficiency of 34.4% was predicted for the polydisperse charged aerosols as reported in the literature.

Much lower OMC delivery efficiency was predicted for polydisperse aerosols than for monodisperse aerosols (34.4% vs. 51.6%), indicating that the aerosol profile exerted a notable effect on intranasal deliveries.

Sensitivity analysis suggested that the OMC deposition fraction was highly sensitive to the charge and size of particles and is less sensitive to the inhalation velocity considered in this study.

The electric-guided delivery system shows promising results of significantly enhanced OMC dose than standard nasal devices. Further studies are warranted to investigate the targeted OMC delivery with both electric and acoustics controls, the latter of which has the potential to further deliver the drug particles into the sinus cavity.
