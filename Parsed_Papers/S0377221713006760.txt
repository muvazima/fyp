                  In this paper, we address the 2-dimensional vector packing problem where an optimal layout for a set of items with two independent dimensions has to be found within the boundaries of a rectangle. Many practical applications in areas such as the telecommunications, transportation and production planning lead to this combinatorial problem. Here, we focus on the computation of fast lower bounds using original approaches based on the concept of dual-feasible functions.
                  Until now, all the dual-feasible functions proposed in the literature were 1-dimensional functions. In this paper, we extend the principles of dual-feasible functions to the m-dimensional case by introducing the concept of vector packing dual-feasible function, and we propose and analyze different new families of functions. All the proposed approaches were tested extensively using benchmark instances described in the literature. Our computational results show that these functions can approximate very efficiently the best known lower bounds for this problem and improve significantly the convergence of branch-and-bound algorithms.

The m-dimensional vector packing problem (mD-VPP, with 
                        
                           m
                           ∈
                           N
                           ⧹
                           {
                           0
                           }
                        
                     ) is a generalization of the well known 1-dimensional bin packing problem (1D-BPP). In the latter, items with different lengths have to be packed into a minimum number of larger objects, or bins. In the mD-VPP, there are m feasibility (capacity) constraints, one for each dimension of the problem, i.e. the sum of the lengths of all packed items must not exceed the bin size in any of the m directions. Unlike in m-dimensional bin packing problems, the dimensions of the mD-VPP are independent. As an example, for m
                     =2, these dimensions may represent the volume and the weight of an object. When m
                     =1, the problem reduces to the 1D-BPP. Hence, the mD-VPP is 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hard in the strong sense (Garey and Johnson, 1978). In this paper, we focus on the 2D-VPP. However, whenever it is possible, we will generalize our results to the m-dimensional case.

The mD-VPP was described first in Garey et al. (1976) to address a special multiprocessor scheduling problem with resource constraints. In that paper, the authors analyzed the worst-case behavior of a generalization of the well-known first fit heuristic used for the 1D-BPP, and they explored two variants based on a preordering of the items (the first fit decreasing and the level heuristic).

Other approximation schemes and worst-case performance results concerning the mD-VPP were reported in Yao (1980), de la Vega and Lueker (1981), Woeginger (1997), Chekuri and Khanna (1999), and Kellerer and Kotov (2003). In Yao (1980), Yao showed that for any o(n
                     log
                     n)-time algorithm A, there is an instance where A generates a solution that uses at least m times the number of bins of the optimal solution. de la Vega and Lueker (1981) showed that a solution with m
                     +
                     ε times the optimal number of bins can be found in linear time for the mD-VPP by applying an extension of their algorithm for the 1D-BPP. In Chekuri and Khanna (1999), described an approximation algorithm for the mD-VPP with a better worst-case performance ratio of 1+
                     εm
                     +
                     O(ln ε
                     −1).

For the 2D-VPP, Woeginger (1997) proved that there is no polynomial time approximation scheme for this special case unless 
                        
                           P
                           =
                           NP
                        
                     . Recently, Kellerer and Kotov (2003) proposed an O(n
                     log
                     n)-time algorithm with an asymptotic worst-case performance ratio of 2 for the 2D-VPP. In Chang et al. (2005), described an O(n
                     2)-time algorithm that extends the algorithm of Kellerer and Kotov (2003), and that leads to solutions with no more than 1/(1−
                     ϱ) times the number of bins of the optimal solution plus one, with ϱ representing the largest fraction between the sizes of the items and the sizes of the bins. In Bansal et al. (2006), described polynomial time randomized algorithms for the 2D-VPP with a worst-case ratio of nearly 1.525.

Spieksma was the first to propose an exact approach for the 2D-VPP in Spieksma (1994). The author described different lower bounding procedures, and developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that relies on these bounds. In this paper, the author described also a heuristic based on the first fit decreasing rule.

The approaches of Spieksma (1994) were later improved by Caprara and Toth in Caprara and Toth (2001). The authors discussed different lower bounding procedures based on bounds for the 1D-BPP and on the linear relaxation of a column generation model. They described algorithms for computing the bounds, they explored the worst-case performance behavior of these bounds, and they proposed heuristics and exact algorithms for the problem. Extensive computational results were reported on instances with up to 200 different items. These results show an improvement compared to previous approaches.

The bounds obtained by column generation are of excellent quality. However, they are obtained with a high computational cost. For the 1-dimensional cutting-stock problem, fast lower bounds can be obtained using the so-called dual-feasible functions (DFFs) (Lueker, 1983). These functions are related to dual solutions of the column generation model, and therefore there is always a function leading to the optimal value yielded by this model.

One of the contributions of this paper is the extension of the concept of DFFs to the m-dimensional case. Several difficulties arise when one wants to generalize the results obtained for 1-dimensional DFFs. They are induced by the fact that the comparison between item sizes have to be done componentwise, and therefore, monotonicity and superadditivity take a different sense. In this paper, we propose several new families of functions, and we analyze those properties which are relevant to evaluate the quality of the lower bounds that these functions can generate. We describe different lower bounding procedures based on these functions, and we report on the complexity of each one. Our approaches were tested on benchmark instances of the literature. Our computational experiments show that high quality bounds can be obtained for this problem using the vector packing dual-feasible functions proposed in this paper. Furthermore, we tested our lower bounding procedures within a branch-and-bound algorithm to evaluate their potential impact on the convergence of this type of algorithms. We analyzed the behavior of the algorithm with and without our lower bounding schemes. The results obtained show that significant improvements can be achieved with the former approach.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the notation that will be used throughout the paper, and we describe two integer programming formulations for the mD-VPP. In Section 3, we briefly recall the basics of dual-feasible functions. In Section 4, we define formally the concept of vector packing dual-feasible functions, and we explore some general properties of these functions. The quality of the lower bounds obtained with vector packing dual-feasible functions is discussed in Section 5. In Section 6, we propose and analyze new classes of vector packing dual-feasible functions. The lower bounding procedures that can be derived from these functions and their corresponding complexity are described in Section 7. Extensive computational experiments are reported and discussed in Section 8. Some final conclusions are drawn in Section 9.

Constraints (3) ensure that the demands of the items are fulfilled. The capacity constraints are represented by (4). There is a capacity constraint for each bin and dimension of the problem.

This model was presented and discussed also in Caprara and Toth (2001) for m
                           =2. It suffers from the same typical weaknesses of the assignment models for cutting and packing problems: a weak continuous lower bound and symmetry. As shown in Caprara (1998), the lower bound provided by the linear programming (LP) relaxation of (2)–(6), rounded up to the next integer, equals the bound L

In Caprara and Toth (2001), the authors described a column generation model for the mD-VPP which is obtained from (2)–(6) by dualizing the demand constraints (3). The resulting model has an exponential number of columns that represent the feasible patterns satisfying the capacity constraints (1). Let P denote this set of patterns. The model states as follows.

This reformulation leads to a pricing subproblem that is a multidimensional knapsack problem. Since this problem does not have the integrality property, the lower bound given by the LP relaxation of (8)–(10) will be at least equal to the bound provided by the LP relaxation of (2)–(6). In practice, this bound is quite strong, but its computation is time consuming for any large scale instances as shown in Caprara and Toth (2001).

Dual-feasible functions were first proposed by Johnson in Johnson (1973). These functions can be used to compute lower bounds for different combinatorial optimization problems, and also to derive valid inequalities for integer programming problems (Clautiaux et al., 2010; Fekete and Schepers, 2001). A function f:[0,1]→[0,1] is a dual-feasible function (DFF), if for any finite set

A DFF f is a maximal dual-feasible function (MDFF), if there is no other DFF g:[0,1]→[0,1] such that g(x)⩾
                     f(x), for all x
                     ∈[0,1]. For f:[0,1]→[0,1] to be a MDFF, it is necessary and sufficient (Clautiaux et al., 2010; Rietz et al., 2010) that f is symmetric, i.e.

All the DFFs described in the literature are 1-dimensional functions. One of the contributions of this paper is to extend for the first time the concept of DFF to the m-dimensional case. A comprehensive survey and comparative study of the 1-dimensional DFFs proposed in the literature is provided in Clautiaux et al. (2010). This study allowed to identify the following DFFs as some of the best functions proposed so far. From this point forward, we will use the abbreviation frac(x)≔

                     −⌊x⌋, for any

Dual-feasible functions (DFFs) have been used essentially to compute bounds and inequalities for cutting and packing, routing and scheduling problems (Clautiaux et al., 2010). The functions described in the literature are defined exclusively for 1-dimensional domains. Computing lower bounds for the mD-VPP by separating the problem into m instances of the 1D-BPP, and by applying these functions independently to each one of these instances may lead to arbitrarily bad results. In this paper, we introduce the concept of vector packing dual-feasible functions, where the 1-dimensional domain is now replaced by an m-dimensional one. These functions can be applied directly to mD-VPP instances without separating the m dimensions, and hence, they may lead to much stronger lower bounds for the mD-VPP. Our objective is to approximate the lower bounds provided by the LP relaxation of (8)–(10) through efficient (polynomial-time) lower bounding procedures that rely on these m-dimensional dual-feasible functions.

In this section, we introduce formally the definitions of vector packing dual-feasible function and maximal vector packing dual-feasible function. We show that some general properties for the 1-dimensional case can be generalized to the multidimensional case, and we give a complete characterization of maximal functions for the m-dimensional case. Finally, we show how to build such maximal functions from non-maximal ones by forcing symmetry.

A formal definition of a vector packing dual-feasible function is given next.

A VP-DFF is said to be maximal if there is no other VP-DFF that dominates it in the sense stated in the following definition.
                           Definition 2
                           A VP-DFF f is maximal (VP-MDFF), if there is no other VP-DFF g with g(x)⩾
                              f(x) for all x
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                              .

Some simple VP-DFFs are, for example, the projections to the jth coordinate of the argument-vector (j
                        =1,…,
                        m), i.e. f
                        
                           j
                        (x)=
                        x
                        
                           j
                        . These functions lead to lower bounds for the mD-VPP which are already known from the 1D-BPP.

The necessary conditions from the 1-dimensional case stated in Carlier and Néron (2007) for a function to be maximal are still valid for the higher-dimensional case. However, it remains to be checked how the higher-dimensional case can be described and if stronger sufficient conditions are needed. These ideas are explored in the following theorems.

The properties (11)–(13) of Theorem 1 are also sufficient conditions for a function f:[0,1]
                           m
                        
                        →[0,1] to be a VP-MDFF. However, it is possible to derive sufficient conditions that are more restricted. These sufficient conditions are stated in Theorem 2. This theorem will help to simplify the proofs of maximality that will be described in the next sections. Before introducing these new sufficient conditions, we describe first in Lemma 1 an additional assertion that will be needed to prove the maximality of a VP-DFF.

First, we prove that the conditions 1 and 2 imply respectively that (13) and (11) hold for all x, y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w. Then, we will show that f is a VP-DFF and that it is maximal by resorting to Lemma 1.

Suppose that y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               with y
                              
                                 r
                              
                              >1/2. Let x≔w
                              −
                              y. That yields x
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               with x
                              
                                 r
                              
                              <1/2 such that the condition 1. implies that (13) holds for this x. That gives 1=
                              f(x)+
                              f(w
                              −
                              x)=
                              f(w
                              −
                              y)+
                              f(y), and hence (13) holds also for y and therefore for all x
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                              .

Let x,y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               be given, with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w. Now, we show that (11) holds:
                                 
                                    •
                                    if x
                                       
                                          s
                                       
                                       >
                                       y
                                       
                                          s
                                       , then we can exchange x and y. That does not change the validity of (11), i.e. the inequality (11) holds now if and only if it was true before. Therefore, we may assume x

In the following propositions, we show that the functions resulting from the convex combination of VP-MDFFs or from the composition of a VP-MDFF with a MDFF remain maximal.

                        , and the function F is normalized to F(w)=1 and the range [0,1]. Then F has to be non-decreasing and superadditive. F is maximal if and only if it is symmetric in the sense (13).

In this section, we show how a VP-MDFF can be built from a superadditive m-dimensional superadditive vector function by forcing symmetry. This result is a generalization of a scheme developed for the 1-dimensional case and described in Clautiaux et al. (2010).

For this proof, we resort to Theorem 2. That requires to verify that g is both symmetric and superadditive.

First, we show that the range of g belongs to [0,1]. Because of the superadditivity and the range of the function f, this function f is also non-decreasing, and hence, we have that

                              , and hence, the function g is symmetric.

It remains to be proved that g is also superadditive. For that purpose, let x, y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                              , with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w. Because of (15), one has o
                              ∈
                              A, and hence w
                              ∈
                              M. The superadditivity of f implies f(2o)⩾2f(o) and f(o)⩽0, and hence we have that f(o)=0 due to the range of f.

To show that g is superadditive, we have to resort to the following case distinction that covers all the possibilities concerning which case of the definition of g has to be used, i.e. to which of the sets

                                        in contradiction to (15).

Because of (15), it is also impossible that x, y
                                       ∈
                                       M.

All the remaining cases are obtained by exchanging x and y, and hence, they are similar to the previous cases. Hence, all conditions of Theorem 2 are satisfied, such that g is a VP-MDFF.□

The set M in Proposition 3 can be chosen in various ways. For instance, we may have

In this section, we propose new classes of VP-MDFFs. When general schemes for generating VP-MDFFs are proposed, we describe and analyze some specific functions that can be obtained from these schemes. To simplify the notation, the parameters of the functions will be omitted whenever it is possible.

Our first set of VP-MDFFs is based on the projection of the m-dimensional data into 1-dimensional domains. The following proposition gives a formal definition of these VP-MDFFs.

According to Proposition 1, any convex combination of VP-MDFFs is a VP-MDFF, and therefore x
                              ↦
                              u
                              ⊤
                              x is also a VP-MDFF. Furthermore, as shown in Proposition 2, the composition of a VP-MDFF and a MDFF yields again a VP-MDFF, and hence f is a VP-MDFF. □

Some of the ideas of the 1-dimensional MDFFs discussed in Clautiaux et al. (2010) can be adapted for the m-dimensional VPP. For instance, the function due to Martello and Toth, which maps small items to zero and large ones to 1, while the other items remain unchanged, can be generalized as follows. Note that the difficulty in this generalization is to find a suitable definition of small and large items when vectors are involved.

                                       .
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

For this proof, we resort to Lemma 1. We will show that f
                              1 is a VP-DFF, i.e. that for any x,y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w, it follows that f
                              1(x
                              +
                              y)⩽1. Then, the symmetry will be verified.

To start the proof that f
                              1 is a VP-DFF, several situations with respect to x, y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               have to be analyzed. First, observe that x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w implies x
                              ⩽
                              w
                              −
                              y and h(x)⩽
                              h(w
                              −
                              y), due to the monotonicity of h. We distinguish the following cases:
                                 
                                    1.
                                    If h(w
                                       −
                                       y)⩽0, then f
                                       1(x)=0. Since f
                                       1(y)=1, one has f
                                       1(x)+
                                       f
                                       1(y)=1;

The case h(w
                                       −
                                       x)⩽0 is similar to the previous one;

Assume that h(w
                                       −
                                       x)>0 and h(w
                                       −
                                       y)>0. Then, f
                                       1(x)+
                                       f
                                       1(y)⩽
                                       g(x)+
                                       g(y)⩽ 1, because g is a VP-DFF.

In all cases, it follows that f
                              1(x)+
                              f
                              1(y)⩽1. Using induction, that implies

                               with 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          ∑

                              1 is a VP-DFF.

To prove that f
                              1 is maximal, according to Lemma 1, it remains to show that f
                              1 is symmetric. For this purpose, recall that g is by definition a VP-MDFF. According to Theorem 1, g must be symmetric. To prove that f
                              1 is symmetric, we distinguish the following cases with regard to x
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                              :
                                 
                                    1.

                                       −
                                       x)>0, then f
                                       1(x)=
                                       g(x) and f
                                       1(w
                                       −

                                       x). The symmetry of g yields f
                                       1(x)+
                                       f
                                       1(w
                                       −
                                       x)=
                                       g(x)+
                                       g(w
                                       −
                                       x)=1;

if h(x)⩽0, then f
                                       1(x)=0 and f
                                       1(w
                                       −
                                       x)=1, and hence f
                                       1(x)+
                                       f
                                       1(w
                                       −
                                       x)=1;

if h(w
                                       −
                                       x)⩽0, then f
                                       1(x)=1 and f
                                       1(w
                                       −
                                       x)=0, and hence f
                                       1(x)+
                                       f
                                       1(w
                                       −
                                       x)=1.

Therefore, f

In the following proposition, we introduce a new VP-MDFF. We describe first the general function for the m-dimensional case. For the sake of clarity, the function for the 2-dimensional case is given next in Corollary 6. The idea consists in assigning the value zero to very small items and the value 1 to large ones, while another VP-MDFF is applied to the remaining items.

                              is a VP-MDFF.
                           

The proof relies on Theorem 2. First, we will show that f is symmetric, and then that it is non-decreasing. The latter will be used to prove the superadditivity of f.

Recall that since g is a VP-MDFF, it is symmetric due to Theorem 1. To show that f is symmetric, we distinguish the following three cases for a given x

                                       g(y) because g(y)⩽1. According to Theorem 1, it holds that g(y)⩾
                                       g(x). It follows that f(x)=
                                       g(x)⩽
                                       g(y)⩽
                                       f(y).

It remains to show that f is superadditive. For this purpose, let x,y
                              ∈[0,1]
                                 m
                               with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w. Because of the monotonicity of f, the superadditivity is obvious for the case where f(x)=0 or f(y)=0. Therefore, we will assume that f(x)>0 and f(y)>0. Suppose that there is an i
                              ∈{1,…,
                              m} with x
                              
                                 i
                              
                              >1−

                                 i
                               and x
                              
                                 j
                              
                              ⩾
                              u
                              
                                 j
                              , for all j
                              ∈{1,…,
                              i}. Because of y
                              ⩽
                              w
                              −
                              x, it follows that y
                              
                                 i
                              
                              <
                              u
                              
                                 i
                               and y
                              
                                 j
                              
                              ⩽1−
                              u
                              
                                 j
                              , for all j
                              ∈{1,…,
                              i}, and hence, f(y)=0 in contradiction to the assumption f(y)>0. Exchanging x and y would yield a similar result. Therefore, f(x)=
                              g(x) and f(y)=
                              g(y). Since f is non-decreasing and f(x)>0, it follows that f(x
                              +
                              y)>0. Hence, f(x
                              +
                              y)⩾
                              g(x
                              +
                              y) according to the definition of f, because g(x
                              +
                              y)⩽1. Since g is a VP-MDFF, it is also superadditive due to Theorem 1. Therefore, g(x
                              +
                              y)⩾
                              g(x)+
                              g(y)=
                              f(x)+
                              f(y), such that f is superadditive. □

In this subsection, we introduce a new VP-MDFF in its general form, and a similar function for the 2-dimensional case. This VP-MDFF depends on a non-decreasing function whose properties are stated below. At the end of the subsection, we describe how this non-decreasing function should be chosen so as to obtain the best lower bounds with the corresponding VP-MDFFs.

The proof relies on Theorem 2. First, we verify that the function f is well defined, i.e. for any argument there is exactly one value assigned. Then, we show that f is symmetric, non-decreasing and finally superadditive.

                              ∈[0,1], with x
                              ⩽

The proof relies on Theorem 2, and it is organized as the one for Proposition 8. First, we verify that f is well defined, i.e. we assign to any argument exactly one value. Then, we show that f is symmetric, non-decreasing and superadditive. The analysis can be restricted to the cases with x

The function f is defined with the required domain and range. If x
                              1
                              ∈{0,1}, then the first or second line in the definition of f applies, while the fourth and fifth line explicitly exclude the case x
                              1
                              ∈{0,1}.

The symmetry becomes obvious for x
                              1
                              ∈{0,1}. If x
                              1
                              =0, then f(x)=0 and 1−
                              x
                              1
                              =1, and hence f(w
                              −
                              x)=1. If x
                              1
                              =1, then f(x)=1 and 1−
                              x
                              1
                              =0, and hence f(w
                              −
                              x)=0.

To show that f is non-decreasing, choose any x, y
                              ∈[0,1]2 with x
                              ⩽
                              y and (x
                              1
                              ∈{0,1} or y
                              1
                              ∈{0,1}).

If x
                              1
                              =0, then f(x)=0⩽
                              f(y). If x
                              1
                              =1, then y
                              1
                              =1, and hence f(y)=1=
                              f(x). The proof for y
                              1
                              ∈{0,1} is similar. It remains to show that f is superadditive. Let x, y
                              ∈[0,1]2 with x
                              +
                              y
                              ⩽
                              w. If f(x)=0 or f(y)=0, then the monotonicity of f implies that f is superadditive. Therefore, we assume that f(x)>0 and f(y)>0. We have x
                              1, y
                              1
                              >0 and x
                              2, y
                              2
                              ⩾
                              k, which yields x
                              2
                              +
                              y
                              2
                              ⩾2k
                              >1−
                              k and x
                              1
                              +
                              y
                              1
                              >0, and hence f(x
                              +
                              y)=1. Since f is non-decreasing and symmetric, it follows that f(y)⩽
                              f(w
                              −
                              x)=1−
                              f(x). Hence, we have f(x)+
                              f(y)⩽ 
                              f(x
                              +
                              y) such that f is superadditive. □

In the following proposition, we show how the g function in Proposition 9 should be defined so as to get the best lower bound that can be obtained from the corresponding VP-DFF f(x;

Assume that we are given a function g: [0,1]→[0,1] that satisfies the prerequisites of Proposition 9, i.e. g is non-decreasing and obeys the condition (25). First, we analyze the structure of the resulting bound (16), then we simplify the function g without decreasing the obtained bound z[f]. We will show that an optimal function g can be found, which has only function values in {0,1/2,1}.

If the function f of Proposition 9 is applied to an item of size (y
                              1,
                              y
                              2) and with order demand b, then one of the values 0, b, b/2, b

                              g(y
                              1) or b
                              −
                              b

                              g(1−
                              y
                              1) is added in the bound z[f], because f(y)∈{0,1/2,1,
                              g(y
                              1),1−

                              1)}. Therefore, applying the function f of Proposition 9 to an instance with n items and a bin size (1,1) yields the lower bound (16) in the form

                                        to maximize the expression (26) under the given conditions.

The simplifications of the bound (26) can be done in a loop, which leads always to g(x)∈{0,1/2,1} for the considered arguments and an optimal staircase function g. Since that holds for all values k, which have to be explored (and that are not more than n
                              +1 ones), the assertion follows. □

                        1 and a
                        2 is pseudo-polynomial.

In this section, we discuss the implementation details of the lower bounding procedures related to the VP-MDFFs proposed above, and we report on the complexity of these procedures. We focus on the specific procedures that were implemented and tested, and whose results are reported in Section 8.

First, we recall the complexity of computing lower bounds for the mD-VPP using the column generation approach applied to formulation (8)–(10). The generation of a new column for (8)–(10) requires to solve an m-dimensional knapsack problem, which is well-known to be 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -complete. At each iteration of the column generation algorithm, the corresponding m-dimensional knapsack problem can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time using dynamic programming. Furthermore, the number of columns of (8)–(10) grows exponentially with the number n of items in the problem. Below, we will show that our VP-MDFF based lower bounding procedures for the mD-VPP are much more efficient than the column generation approach. Indeed, all these procedures except the last one are algorithms of polynomial complexity.

Below, we identify the specific VP-MDFFs that were considered. A lower bounding procedure for the mD-VPP is defined from each function. These procedures rely essentially on (16). The details of the implementation of each one of these VP-MDFF based lower bounding procedures and their corresponding complexity are discussed next.

                        BJ,1}. The last two functions lead respectively to the functions of Corollaries 1 and 2. The cases (d) and (e) are associated to VP-MDFFs constructed from Corollaries 3 and 4 with g based on Proposition 5 with f

Using (28) simplifies the search for the best parameter values with low complexity. Computing z[f] from (16) requires 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                      evaluations of the VP-DFF f for each chosen parameter set. In the form (28), the effort 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                      is needed only once for an initial parameter set. After that, if each change of the parameters modifies the sets I
                     1 and I
                     2 by at most one element, recomputing z[f] requires only the complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           1
                           )
                        
                      instead of 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                     . Therefore, if the parameter sets are adapted according to the input data, the total complexity can be reduced by a factor up to n in the evaluation of z[f].

When the statement t
                     ≔
                     h(l
                     
                        i
                     ) is reached for a given i, then using c
                     ≔
                     t implies h(l
                     
                        j
                     )⩽
                     c for all j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     i}, due to the sorting that is done at the beginning. Items l
                     
                        j
                     , with h(l
                     
                        j
                     )=
                     c, will still be counted for s, but all later processed items are assigned values 0 or 1 in the VP-MDFF f of Corollary 5. Therefore, the set I
                     2 does not contain any of the remaining items for this value c, such that it is only necessary to count the number of remaining items, which will get the value 1 due to the function f of Corollary 5. If in the last repeat-until-loop, the counter k is increased, then these items must be put into new containers, but the residual space in these containers can be used for small items. Therefore, it is necessary to subtract k before comparing t with the former bound z.

Since the index i is decremented in every passage of the loops, the complexity without the sorting would be 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           mn
                           )
                        
                     . Sorting n items requires 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n

                           )
                        
                      comparisons and possible exchanges. Since we have also to consider the dimension m of the items, the complexity becomes 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           mn
                           ln
                           n
                           )
                        
                     .


                     Case (g)
                  

A lower bounding procedure based on (16) and on the VP-MDFF of Corollary 6 is described in Algorithm 2. Since the functions (21) and (22) share some similarities (f(x)=
                     x
                     
                        r
                      for some x with the parameter r
                     ∈{1,…,
                     m}, and f(x)∈{0,1} otherwise), it is again advantageous to rewrite the bound (16) in the form (28), but with other sets I

                     1,
                     u
                     2) have to be tested, and the computation of the bound (28) for one pair (u
                     1,
                     u
                     2) requires a complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                     , a naive implementation would have the total complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . However, by using a suitable sorting, the complexity decreases to 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      as it happens in Algorithm 2. The goal of the sorting is that for fixed variables q and u
                     1, the change of the sets I
                     1 and I
                     2 in every step where u
                     2 is modified applies to at most one element. This objective is achieved by the sorting in Algorithm 2. When u
                     2
                     ≔ℓ
                        i,3−q
                     
                     ⩽1/2 is set for a given i
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n}, it follows for all j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     i} that either ℓ
                        j,3−q
                     
                     ⩽
                     u
                     2 or ℓ
                        j,3−q
                     
                     >1−
                     u
                     2. Therefore, except for ℓ
                        j,3−q
                     
                     =
                     u
                     2, no more items j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     i} can belong to I
                     2. Algorithm 2 is used with q
                     =1 and q
                     =2, and the better of the two bounds is chosen.

The worst case is reached when all the values ℓ
                        iq
                      are different and less than 1/2. In this case, the outer loop is passed n
                     +1 times with u
                     1
                     ∈{1/2−
                     ε,ℓ

                     ∈{1,…,
                     n}. Therefore, the complexity of the algorithm is 
                        
                           O
                           (

The variables k
                     1 and k
                     2 count the number of items that (may) get the value 1 in the comparison with u
                     1,u

                     k

                     Case (h)
                  

The lower bounding procedure related to (h) relies on the bound (26), which was derived from (16), and on the VP-MDFF of Proposition 9. In our implementation, its complexity is 
                        
                           O
                           (

                     . The details of our implementation are given in Algorithm 3. The function g used in this VP-MDFF is the one described in Proposition 10. After sorting the items, we choose 
                        
                           O

                     ∈{1,2} and ε
                     >0 being an enough small constant. If q
                     =2 then the function f of Proposition 9 is taken literally, while for q
                     =1 the first and second dimension are exchanged. For each value of k, the function g is obtained optimally according to Proposition 10. For this purpose, we use a vector of length 
                        
                           O

                      is assigned a value 0, 1 or 1/2 in the function f of Proposition 9. If that is not the case, i.e. the function g plays a role in the evaluation of

A lower bounding procedure based on (16) and on the VP-DFF of Proposition 11 with forced symmetry according to Proposition 3 requires first to choose two items as vectors s and t. Since there are

                      possibilities, we have to make

                      calls to a subroutine to obtain the optimal values for a
                     1, a
                     2, u
                     1, u
                     2 on which this VP-DFF relies. In this subroutine, we compute first the optimal dual values u
                     1, u
                     2 for the two items of sizes s and t. For this step, we need to solve a linear optimization problem. After that, we compute the values a
                     1 and a
                     2. The complexity of this embedded subroutine is comparable with the one of dynamic optimization and can therefore be high. Without additional restrictions, this complexity will not be simply a polynomial in n, because a
                     2 could be as large as max
                        i∈{1,…,n}{1/max

                        id
                     }. If all input data are integer with the maximum M, i.e. the container is not normalized to the unit cube, then this ratio can reach M, and hence the total complexity becomes 
                        
                           O
                           (

                                 2

                     , which is pseudo-polynomial. Nevertheless, since we have to consider only two items to evaluate this bound, the complexity may be lower than if n pieces would have been considered.

Except for the last function, the complexity of these lower bounding procedures is polynomial. This allows to compute lower bounds much faster than by column generation. As a comparison, four of the five lower bounding procedures discussed in Caprara and Toth (2001) have a complexity that ranges from

                     . In the next section, we report on computational experiments that illustrate the efficiency of our procedures.

In this section, we report on two sets of computational experiments that we conducted to evaluate both the quality of the bounds and the performance of the lower bounding procedures related to the VP-DFFs described above. As shown in Section 5, the best bound that a VP-DFF can generate is at most equal to the bound z
                     
                        CG
                      of the LP relaxation of (8)–(10). While this bound is well-known to be strong, computing it by solving (8)–(10) through column generation can be very time consuming. Our first set of computational experiments shows that the VP-DFFs can approximate the bound z
                     
                        CG
                      very efficiently. In practice, it takes usually a fraction of seconds to compute the bounds using VP-DFFs. In our second set of experiments, we focus on the impact that the lower bounding procedures described above may have on the convergence of a branch-and-bound based algorithm for the 2D-VPP.

We conducted our experiments on two sets of instances of the 2D-VPP. The first set (instance set I) was proposed in Caprara and Toth (2001) for the vector-packing problem, the second (instance set II) was proposed in Berkey and Wang (1987) and Martello and Vigo (1998) for the two-dimensional bin-packing problem. Within each group of the first set, the instances are further divided into 4 sets of 10 instances each according to the number of items which belongs to {25,50,100,200}. In the second set of instances, each set contains 50 instances divided in 5 sets of 10 instances with a number of items per instance in the set {20,40,60,80,100}. This set originally contains 10 groups of instances. However, for this set, we only kept the groups where the bound of Spieksma is strictly smaller than the column generation lower bound. Therefore, we only report our results for sets 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 of Berkey and Wang (1987) and Martello and Vigo (1998). The indices of these groups of instances have been updated accordingly. All the experiments were conducted on a PC with an Intel Core i3 CPU with 2.27gigahertz and 4gigabytes of RAM.

For some of our VP-DFFs, we used the 1-dimensional DFF f
                     
                        CCM,1 proposed in Carlier et al. (2007) and described in Section 3. The results for our first set of experiments are reported in Tables 1–4
                     
                     
                     
                     . The entries in these tables have the following meaning: Inst. stands for the group of instances, n for the number of items, z
                     
                        C
                      represents the lower bound given by the LP relaxation of (2)–(6) (equivalent to the bound of Spieksma (1994)) and z
                     
                        CG
                      the lower bound given by the LP relaxation of (8)–(10). The columns (a)–(i) are associated respectively to the cases (a)–(i) introduced in Section 7.

In Tables 1–4, we report on the quality of the lower bounds provided by our VP-DFFs. In these tables, the results related to the VP-DFFs are divided in three parts. In the first part, we give the average lower bound obtained with the corresponding VP-DFF. The second part (Best bound) indicates the number of times the VP-DFFs give the best bound among all the VP-DFFs from cases (a)–(i). The last part of these tables (Equals z
                     
                        CG
                     ) shows the number of times the bound given by the VP-DFF is equal to the column generation bound z
                     
                        CG
                     .

From Tables 1 and 2, we can observe that the average lower bounds provided by the VP-DFFs are very near from the average column generation bound. The worst case is for the group 9 of instances with n
                     =25. For this case, the relative gap between the bounds based on VP-DFFs is at least 14%. Note that, for these instances, z
                     
                        C
                      and z
                     
                        CG
                      are small values. Furthermore, the difference between z
                     
                        C
                      and z
                     
                        CG
                      for all the instances of this group is always equal to 1. For all the other instances of this set, one of our VP-DFFs gives always a lower bound whose relative gap compared to the column generation bound is at most 7%. For the instance sets 1, 4, 5, and 10, the lower bounds provided by the VP-DFFs are always equal to the column generation bound z
                     
                        CG
                     , which is in turn always equal to z
                     
                        C
                     .

The performance of our VP-DFFs is better illustrated in the final part of Table 1, where we report on the number of times the bounds obtained with the VP-DFFs are as good as the bounds given by the LP relaxation of the column generation model. Almost all the VP-DFFs provide a bound equal to z
                     
                        CG
                      for a significant number of cases. In fact, for 309 of the 400 instances of set I, one of our VP-DFFs always gives a lower bound that is equal to z
                     
                        CG
                     . For the other instances, the average value of the differences between z
                     
                        CG
                      and the best bounds obtained with a VP-DFF is equal to only 1.87. Note that the bounds obtained with VP-DFFs are computed usually in a few milliseconds, i.e. much more efficiently than using column generation. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the only group of instances (apart from the sets 1, 4, 5, and 10) where the bound z
                     
                        CG
                      was reached for all the instances with at least one of our VP-DFFs is the group 8, for which the difference between z
                     
                        C
                      and z
                     
                        CG
                      is large. The best results are obtained for groups 2, 3, and 8. For the two first, the instances were generated uniformly on both dimensions: functions denoted (g), (h) and (i) lead to the best results for them. For group 8, where many items are large on exactly one dimension, functions (a) to (e) perform better.


                     Tables 3 and 4 illustrate the results obtained with the instance set II. For each group, there is always one VP-DFF that provides a lower bound with a relative gap of at most 5% compared to z
                     
                        CG
                     . For this set of instances, the best results are achieved with the VP-DFF of Proposition 11 (and the corresponding lower bounding procedure related to the case (i) introduced in Section 7). In 273 of 350 instances, the best bound is given by this VP-DFF, while for 200 of these instances, this bound is equal to z
                     
                        CG
                     . The VP-DFF of case (i) returns the best results for all instances of groups 1, 2, 3, and 6. For groups 4, 5, and 7, the best results on average are obtained by VP-DFF (g). In the three groups where (g) performs better, the number of items that are large on both dimensions is small (10% on average). For groups 1, 2, 3, and 6, this ratio is much larger, which hints that (i) is well suited to such instances.

For 255 of the 350 instances in set II, there is always one VP-DFF that yields a bound equal to z
                     
                        CG
                     . For the remaining instances, the average value of the differences between the bounds provided by the VP-DFFs and z
                     
                        CG
                      is equal to only 1.2. These results confirm the previous ones obtained for the instance set I. For the majority of the cases, the VP-DFFs presented in this paper lead to lower bounds that are as good as the column generation bound. The advantage is that they require only a very small fraction of the computing time that is needed to compute the column generation bound. For the other instances, the lower bounds achieved with these VP-DFFs remain very near from these column generation bounds.

The objective of our second set of experiments is to evaluate the impact of our lower bounding procedures on the convergence of a branch-and-bound based algorithm for the 2D-VPP. We consider again the cases (a)–(i) described in the previous section. We compare in particular the impact of our procedures with an alternative approach that relies essentially on column generation. For this purpose, we implemented a branch-and-price algorithm for the 2D-VPP, and we tested two versions of this algorithm: one without the lower bounding procedures related to the cases (a)–(i) and another that resorts to these procedures. In the latter, we tested each one of the cases (a)–(i) separately. The results of these experiments are reported in Tables 5–7
                     
                     
                     .

At each node of the branching tree, the LP relaxation of (8)–(10) is solved exactly using column generation. The corresponding restricted master problems are solved using CPLEX 12.2. The pricing subproblems are multidimensional knapsack problems, which are solved also up to optimality using CPLEX 12.2. At each iteration of the column generation procedure, the most attractive column is added to the restricted master problem, which is solved again until there are no more attractive columns. If the solution of the restricted master problem at a given node is not integer, and the node cannot be pruned by bound, two nodes are created using the following branching rule. Let δ
                     
                        ij
                      denote the sum of all the variables λ
                     
                        p
                      in (8)–(10) that include both the item i and the item j, with i,j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} and i
                     ≠ 
                     j. Among all the fractional δ
                     
                        ij
                      at a given branching node, we choose the one that is closer to 0.5. Assume that a and b are the items related to the variable δ
                     
                        ij
                      that is selected, and let P′ be the subset of patterns that include both the items a and b. The branching constraints that are enforced stand respectively as follows:

                     . Note that this branching scheme works for instances whose items have unit demands b
                     
                        i

                     =1,…,
                     n. The branching tree is explored using a depth-first search strategy. This pure branch-and-price algorithm is denoted by BP in Tables 5–7.

As an alternative, we implemented and tested a version of this algorithm that resorts to the lower bounding procedures related to the cases (a)–(i) described above. At each node of the branching tree, we first apply one of these lower bounding procedures. Let z
                     
                        VPDFF
                      denote the resulting bound. If the node cannot be pruned immediately using z

                      in the master problem and we solve it using column generation. All the other features of the branch-and-price algorithm remain unchanged. We tested this version of the branch-and-price algorithm with each one of the cases (a)–(i) individually. In Tables 5–7, the results related to each case are given in the columns identified with the corresponding index (a)–(i) of the case.

Column opt. in Tables 5–7 represents the number of instances solved up to optimality and t is the corresponding average computing time (in seconds) required to solve these instances. All the experiments were conducted with a time limit of 600seconds. In these tables, we removed the lines of the instance sets for which none of the approaches were able to find an optimal solution for at least one instance within the time limit.

The results for the instance set I reported in Table 5 shows that the branch-and-price algorithm with our lower bounding procedures clearly outperforms the pure column generation based version of this algorithm. The reduction in the total computing time required to find an optimal solution goes up to nearly 99%. These results are even more impressive for the group 5 of instances. In this case, the pure branch-and-price algorithm failed in finding the optimal solution within the time limit for all the instances, while the branch-and-price algorithm with our lower bounding procedures could find these optimal solutions in much less than 1second for the majority of the instances. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, most of the instances of the set II are solved efficiently with the pure branch-and-price algorithm. Nevertheless, our lower bounding procedures still improve the convergence of the algorithm and reduces the total computing time to reach an optimal solution by up to nearly 63%. Note that the branching constraints

                      are used to eventually strengthen the lower bounds provided by the VPDFFs. These constraints force the items i and j to appear in the same pattern. These items are replaced by a single one with the sum of the sizes in both dimensions, which may impact positively in the quality of the lower bound. Indeed, from this node downward the lower bounds computed with the VPDFFs are obtained from the resulting instance with these aggregated items.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we extended the concept of DFF to the multidimensional case. The functions that were proposed apply directly to the vector packing problem and, as a consequence, we called them vector packing dual-feasible functions. We explored the properties of these functions, and we described different families of such functions. We analyzed also the complexity of the related lower bounding procedures that can be defined from these functions. To evaluate the quality and performance of our approaches, we conducted a set of computational experiments on benchmark instances. Our results show that our functions are able to generate strong lower bounds. The utility of multidimensional dual-feasible functions goes far beyond the computation of lower bounds for vector packing problems. Indeed, these functions can be used to obtain valid inequalities for general mixed integer programs, i.e. any integer programming problem with multidimensional knapsack constraints.
