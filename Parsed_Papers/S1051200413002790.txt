@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The theory of multirate statistical signal processing and its applications have found an increasing attention by various researchers over the last two decades. This theory is roughly concerned with the problems of power spectrum estimation, prediction, and the reconstruction or estimation of a stationary random signal when the multiple observations at different sampling rates of this signal are available instead of the signal itself [1]. The methods developed to solve these problems can be classified into three main groups referred as Kalman filter-based methods, Wiener filter-based methods, and methods using Maximum Entropy (ME) principle.

The studies based on the Kalman filter theory were carried out by Chen and his coworkers [2–6]. From the viewpoint of a multirate state-space modeling, in [2], a Kalman filter-based algorithm for estimating/interpolating the values of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) random signals from its noisy decimated versions is discussed, and is generalized for ARMA signals in [3]. The same approach is adapted to estimate the input signal transmitted through a transmultiplexer system with a noisy channel [4,5]. Ultimately, in [6], the Kalman filter theory is employed to reconstruct the input signal having the form of AR or ARMA in noisy filterbank systems, from the multirate state-space modeling standpoint.

The methods on the basis of the ME principle for optimally estimating the power spectrum and the samples of a wide-sense stationary (WSS) random signal through its low-resolution (LR) forms measured by multiple sensors are investigated by Jahromi et al. [7–11]. In [7], a mathematical theory of applying the ME principle for the estimation of the power spectral density of a random signal over its low-sampling-rate measurements is presented. Regarding to this problem, in [8], the use of the ME principle is considered in a more general framework involving the evaluation of this principle from a geometrical perspective and an algorithm namely Maximum Entropy Interference Engine (MEIE) for calculating the ME-based power spectrum estimate of the signal from given autocorrelations of its LR measurements. In [9], an optimal least-mean-squares estimator combined with MEIE is proposed to acquire an estimate of the samples of a random signal based on its LR multiple observations. Using the generalized cross-correlation technique and the theory of the perfect reconstruction synthesis filterbank, in [10], the problem of fusing two low-rate sensors for the reconstruction of a high-resolution (HR) signal in the presence of time delay of arrival (TDOA) is considered at an introductory level. A detailed research including the design conditions of analysis/synthesis filters for TDOA estimation and HR signal reconstruction is presented in [11]. As a consequence, more comprehensive information associated with Jahromiʼs studies on multirate statistical signal processing can be found in [1]. Recently, an iterative ME power spectrum estimation algorithm based on the fast Fourier transform and a novel matrix representation is developed for the determination of the power spectrum of a random signal from its low-sampling-rate observations [12].

The use of the optimal linear filtering strategy referred as the Wiener filter theory for the goals of prediction, estimation and reconstruction of an HR WSS stochastic signal from its noisy LR observation sequences at different sampling rates are conducted under the leadership of Therrien [13–23]. Within these scopes, the problem of estimating a WSS random signal from two sequences, one of which is observed at full rate and the other is observed at half rate, both of them affected by measurement noise, is considered in [13]. In addition to detailed examination of this problem, in [14], linear prediction on successive samples of a WSS random process is explored by employing the multichannel representation of multirate signals, and the multichannel Levinson algorithm is applied for linear prediction. In [15], the multirate linear prediction problem is analyzed in a more general framework and a sliding window predictor involving the use of the multichannel Levinson algorithm is suggested. Stationary conditions of random signals sampled at different rates are discussed in [16]. In [17], using the least-squares approach, three different optimal filter structures are described for estimating a random process from a set of two observations, one of which is observed at full rate with a low signal-to-noise ratio and the other is observed at arbitrary low-sampling-rate with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Details related to this subject can also be found in [18]. A generalized version of the problem mentioned in [13] is addressed in [19] which is a preliminary study of the dissertation presented in [20], where optimal multirate filtering strategy is developed through the second-order statistics for achieving an estimate of the HR signal from multiple LR measurements at different sampling rates. Further analysis including the use of optimal filtering for sequential classification and linear prediction is offered at this dissertation as well. In [21], derivations introduced in [19] and [20] are applied to the problem of reconstructing an HR signal or image from a set of its noisy and distorted LR observations. Finally, in [22], the multirate optimal filtering procedures in [19–21] are extended to two-dimensional (2-D) case in terms of the least-squares approach from which 2-D signal or image reconstruction task can directly be performed by processing 2-D signals or images observed at low-sampling-rates. It can be turned to [23] for additional information related to this study.

Unlike three main groups of methods expounded above, some different approaches dealing with the statistical multirate signal estimation are suggested [24–26]. In [24], a multirate version of the LMS algorithm of adaptive filtering is developed so as to estimate the desired signal from two sequences. It is noted that, in the presence of interference, one of these sequences is observed at full rate and the other is observed at arbitrary low rate. Another adaptive filtering algorithm for multirate signal estimation is developed based on a lattice filter structure [25], where a sequential adaptive least squares lattice filter is presented for the estimation of the underlying signal from noisy, low-sampling-rate L observations. Finally, in [26], a compressive sensing formulation is derived for reconstructing a signal over several measurements observed at different sampling rates.

In this paper, for the purpose of improving the performance of the HR signal reconstruction realized by using a set of linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) Wiener filters [21,23], two empirical methods that integrate empirical mode decomposition (EMD)- and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression-based noise reduction schemes with the LPTV Wiener filter structures are proposed. Based on the intuition of obtaining better results, the proposed methods originate from the idea of reducing the effects of white noise existing in the LR observations before using them directly with these filter structures. Although we do not make a theoretical contribution to the concept of signal reconstruction, simulation results show that making these integrations in the framework of the proposed methods leads to a considerably better signal reconstruction performance than the method of [21,23], under certain conditions. Accordingly, in the first proposed method, each noisy LR observation is decomposed into its intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by means of the EMD. After then the noise reduction is carried out with subtracting the first IMF from each noisy LR observation. At last, the resulting LR observations are utilized with the LPTV Wiener filters so as to reconstruct the HR signal. To filter noise influentially, in the second proposed method, the LS-SVM regression is applied to each noise reduced LR observation signal. Finally, an almost noise-free HR signal is reconstructed by using the double-reduced-noise LR observations with the LPTV Wiener filters.

The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows: In Section 2, we define the statement of the problem to be considered. An existing method addressing and solving this problem is briefly presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the methods proposed for improving the performance of the optimal filtering procedure mentioned in Section 3 are offered. Section 5 is devoted to demonstrating the performance of the proposed methods with regard to the existing method of reconstructing HR signal and image data from its noisy low-sampling-rate observations. Lastly, concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Finally, the optimal filtering procedure outlined above for reconstructing the HR signal from its noisy LR observation sequences is represented by a scheme depicted in Fig. 2
                     , and the steps of this reconstruction procedure are summarized in Table 1
                      as Method-I.

Note that the noisy HR signal vector

                        [
                        n
                        ]
                      is employed in calculating the correlation vectors and the correlation matrices defined by Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. However, the samples of noisy HR signals 
                        
                           
                              s
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                        [
                        n
                        ]
                      are not observable in practice. To overcome this problem, pseudo noisy HR signals can be formed by upsampling and time shifting the noisy LR observations 
                        
                           
                              x
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                        [
                        m
                        ]
                      because of the fact that zero valued samples generated after upsampling and time shifting operations will be extracted in the calculation of the observation vector described by Eq. (2).

The signal reconstruction procedure shown in Fig. 2 only uses LPTV Wiener filters. To improve the performance of this signal reconstruction procedure, two methods integrating the noise reduction schemes with the LPTV Wiener filters are proposed. While the first method combines a set of LPTV Wiener filter structures with EMD-based noise reduction scheme, the second method combines the LPTV Wiener filter structures with both EMD- and LS-SVM regression-based noise reduction schemes. The proposed methods originate from the idea of reducing the effects of AWGN existing in the LR observations before using them with the LPTV Wiener filter structures [27].

As a part of Hilbert–Huang transform invented by Huang et al. in 1996, EMD is a method decomposing any complicated signal into a series of IMFs with degree of frequencies in decreasing order and a monotonic residual [28,29]. An IMF is defined as a time series in which the absolute difference between the total number of extrema and zero-crossings must be at most one, and, at any point, the mean of the envelopes described respectively by the local maxima and minima needs to be zero [29]. The systematic way to obtain the IMFs and the residual is called sifting process, which is summarized as follows.

At the beginning of sifting process, assume that

                         is majorly considered as it is connected with the AWGN [30]. In line with this opinion, the noise reduced version of Eq. (21) can be obtained by eliminating the first IMF on it, as shown in Fig. 4

Thereafter, the noise reduced versions of LR observation signals obtained by Eq. (22) are employed with the LPTV Wiener filters as shown in Fig. 5
                        . Note that the noise reduction blocks in Fig. 5 are constituted with regard to Fig. 4. Thus, the output of each noise reduction block and an estimate of the HR signal will be

It is expected that an estimate of the original HR signal by virtue of the structure proposed in Fig. 5 results in lower noise level than that of an estimate achieved by only using the structure illustrated in Fig. 2. The steps of this reconstruction procedure are summarized in Table 2

SVM is a kernel-based learning method its basics have been found out by Vapnik in 1995. Kernel-based algorithms are convex optimization problems that can usually be solved analytically. The main idea in the SVM is to select the best hypothesis for classifying data. Since it cannot be found such a hypothesis, data to be modeled is represented by kernel functions in a very high-dimensional space [31].

In this study, LS-SVM is used because of its learning rate and radial basis Gaussian kernel function defined by [31–33]

In the representation of linear or nonlinear signals, the model gets close to the original signal when the length of training data increases. On the other hand, noise occurring in the course of the collection of training data causes to move the model away from the signal. Therefore, robustness of the used methods is very important for the truth of the model [31,33]. For this reason, in this paper, LS-SVM is preferred for filtering noise in an effective manner. By the nature of Gaussian based kernel function, generalization ability of the model increases as the value of σ increases. Thus, the model is less affected by outlier data and acts as a low-pass filter (LPF) [27]. The noise reduction operation provided by using Eqs. (22) and (24) is depicted in Fig. 6

(24) are used with the LPTV Wiener filters as shown in Fig. 5 where the structure in Fig. 6 is utilized as noise reduction blocks. Thus, the outputs of the noise reduction blocks and an estimate of the HR signal will be

                         as Method-III.

To compare the performances of the proposed methods (referred as Method-II and Method-III) with the method of employing only LPTV Wiener filter structures (referred as Method-I) for the reconstruction of an HR signal from its noisy LR observations, some simulation examples are implemented in Matlab R2011b. Simulations are realized for 1-D simulated signals and for 2-D images that are processed row-by-row or column-by-column. Throughout the simulations, the decimation factor is

                        3
                      and the number of LPTV Wiener filter coefficients is taken as 
                        P
                        =
                        8
                     . Furthermore, in the proposed methods, the first IMFs of the related LR observations are obtained by choosing the threshold value as

                      that is required to terminate sifting process taking the stopping criteria defined by Eq. (17) into account.

For 1-D simulated signals, as a part of Method-III, all samples of each LR signal

                      are employed as training data for the LS-SVM regression process in which time indices of each LR signal are normalized to the closed interval of [0, 1]. In this case, σ parameter is determined by performing grid search on noise reduced LR signals

On the other hand, during the reconstruction process of 2-D images, the σ parameter is determined experimentally because of heavy computational load. In this manner, several image reconstruction trials are performed for the σ values of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1. Among these σ values, the comparable trial results are attached to the current paper. Note that the performance evaluations of the methods are made over the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) defined for gray-scale images by

                            are shown in Fig. 8
                           . It is observed from this figure that satisfactory improvements are performed by the proposed methods. Particularly, the Method-III with the σ parameters signed in Fig. 8(c) results in a remarkable reconstruction performance such that the reconstructed signal almost fits well with the desired HR signal. The NMSE values calculated as 0.24163, 0.20588, and 0.013041 for Method-I, Method-II, and Method-III, respectively, support this claim as well.

It is worthwhile to note that, even though the Method-III offers the best results, it fails in detecting signal peaks. The reason of that can be explained as follows. As it is known, a triangular wave is made up of sinusoidal waves at an infinite number of different frequencies namely harmonics whose amplitudes are proportional to the inverse square of the harmonic number. Although a large portion of the power of triangular wave is carried at the smaller number (first and third) of harmonics, rapid changes (triangular peaks) are mostly represented by the higher harmonics. In the framework of the Method-III, the first IMF which corresponds to the high frequencies (or the higher number of harmonics) in the signal is excluded from the signal and then smoothing operation resulting from the LS-SVM regression is applied to it. As a result, the smoothed versions of triangular peaks are obtained. This is the expected result in using the Method-III for the signals having such characteristics.

Also important to note is that the signal reconstruction performances of the proposed methods are influenced by the frequency of the signal (

                           . In the first case, the NMSE performances of the three methods are assessed over five different signal frequencies by keeping the sampling frequency constant (

                            the better the signal reconstruction performances of the proposed methods. The reason of that can be explained by the nature of EMD. Fundamentally, the EMD treats as a filterbank such that while the first and the last IMFs exhibit high-pass and low-pass characteristics, respectively, the intermediate IMFs show band-pass characteristics. As a result, it can be said that the EMD provides a better separation in low frequencies than that of high frequencies. The components in high frequency band are compounded nearly [30].

As is seen in Fig. 9(a), the proposed methods especially the Method-III present a better signal reconstruction performance for low-frequency signals with small number of samples (

For the signals shown in Fig. 10, the reconstruction results and the corresponding squared errors obtained by the compared three methods are illustrated in Fig. 11
                           . We can deduce from Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) that the Method-II does not provide any improvement on the Method-I. Concomitantly, the respective NMSE values 0.21716 and 0.22777 for the Method-I and Method-II approve this observation. On the other hand, the Method-III with the σ parameters indicated in Fig. 11(c) exhibits a superb reconstruction performance such that it is nearly impossible to visually distinguish the reconstructed and the desired signals from each other. The NMSE value 0.00005622 provided with the Method-III confirms this assertion as well.

Unlike the first signal considered in Fig. 7(a), the second signal has smooth peaks and consists only of two harmonics. Thus, it is not confronted with a problem in detecting these peaks by employing the Method-III. This is the expected result in using the Method-III for the signals having smooth changes.

As is in the first signal considered, it appears from Fig. 12
                            that the signal reconstruction performance of the proposed methods is influenced by the signal frequency and the sampling frequency chosen. For the specific sampling frequency

                            in Fig. 12(a) show that a remarkable improvement in the quality of the reconstructed signal is obtained particularly by the Method-III for low-frequency signals where

                           , 8, 16} Hz. As in the first signal analyzed, when the signal frequency is increased, however, the proposed methods fail to reconstruct the original signal. The reason of that can be explained with the ratio

                            increases, relatively, and the frequency selectivity of the EMD decreases. As mentioned before, the usability of the Method-III for high-frequency signals can be supplied by increasing the sampling frequency

                            relatively to the signal frequency

                        Example 2
                        In this example, the mentioned three methods are used for the HR image reconstruction task where the image is individually processed in row-by-row or column-by-column directions. Hence, each row or each column of the desired HR image is separately considered as the desired signal 
                              d
                              [
                              n
                              ]
                           . Furthermore, each row or each column of the observed M noisy LR images is separately considered as an observation vector whose samples are defined by 
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              [
                              m
                              ]
                              |
                              i
                              =
                              0

                              …
                              ,
                              M
                              −
                              1
                              }
                           . The observation vector corresponding to each row of the associated noisy LR image is used in the compared methods to reconstruct the associated row of the HR image. The reconstruction procedure is repeated row-by-row until an estimate of the whole HR image is created. Similarly, the observation vector corresponding to each column of the related noisy LR image is processed by the compared three methods to reconstruct the related column of the HR image. The reconstruction process is repeated column-by-column until an estimate of the whole HR image is acquired. At the end, an estimate of the HR image obtained by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of two HR images created with row-by-row and column-by-column processing is also introduced for comparison purposes.

Three noisy LR forms with SNR =0 dB of the considered HR image are constructed by applying the observation model in Fig. 1 to each row or column of the HR images, individually. Subsequently, each row or column of noisy LR images is used separately with Method-I, Method-II and Method-III.

As made in Example 1 for the Method-III, all samples for each row or column of noisy LR images are utilized as training data in LS-SVM regression, and time indices of each LR observation are normalized to the closed interval of 
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           .

Simulation results received through row-by-row and column-by-column processing of each noisy LR image are presented in Figs. 13 and 14
                           
                           , respectively. It is concluded from these figures that the proposed methods provide enhancements in reconstructing the considered HR image, as compared to that of Method-I. The PSNR values tabulated in Table 4
                            support this assessment as well. According to the numerical values in Table 4, the satisfactory results with the minimum noise degrees are acquired by the Method-III for 
                              σ
                              =
                              0.1
                           , where the PSNR values are maximized. Nevertheless, the reconstructed images have visually poor quality because of becoming blurred. Succinctly, there is a trade-off between visual quality and PSNR in using Method-III with large σ values. In the sense of both visual quality and PSNR, several trials reveal that the reasonable image reconstruction results are satisfied by the Method-III with 
                              σ
                              =
                              0.05
                           .

Finally, for trial purposes, the square roots of the sum of the squares of two reconstructed HR images in Figs. 13 and 14 are obtained and the results of this operation are demonstrated in Fig. 15
                           . We can infer from the PSNR values in the last column of Table 4 and the image results in Figs. 13–15 that both the visual qualities of the reconstructed images and the corresponding PSNR values have increased for all methods.

It is worthwhile to note that the entire image results presented here are displayed by applying contrast stretching to them. In this manner, the intensity values of the displayed images are in the range of 
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              255
                              ]
                           . It is also required to make such an arrangement to calculate the corresponding PSNR values of the resulting images.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we were interested in reconstructing an unobservable stationary random signal from a set of its existing noisy LR observations. In a statistical multirate HR signal reconstruction procedure, the noisy LR observations are utilized with the LPTV Wiener filter structures to reconstruct the HR original signal. For the purpose of improving the performance of this procedure, two empirical methods that combine EMD- and LS-SVM regression-based noise reduction schemes with the LPTV Wiener filter structures were proposed. Based on the intuition of obtaining better results, the proposed methods originate from the idea of reducing the effects of noise on noisy LR observations before utilizing them directly with these filter structures. Although we do not make a theoretical contribution to the concept of signal reconstruction, it was established by several computer simulations that the HR signal reconstruction performance was improved by the proposed methods under certain conditions, as it is expounded in simulation results section. Peculiarly, the second proposed method has introduced a better reconstruction performance for the low-frequency signals having a small number of samples. In this case, it can be valuable for processing sonar and electrocardiogram signals. On the other hand, this method can be made applicable for reconstructing high-frequency signals by using it with a large number of LR observation measurements.

Furthermore, it was revealed in applying the proposed methods to multirate image reconstruction task that the second method with the proper choice of σ values provided better performance than the method simply using LPTV Wiener filters. These preliminary results suggest using these methods in multirate statistical data estimation and super-resolution image reconstruction.

Finally, some aspects and future directions related to the proposed methods can be pointed out as in the following:
                        
                           1.
                           Wiener filter tends to reduce noise effect intrinsically, which results in blurring on the reconstructed signal. Taking this fact into consideration, in the methods proposed for the aim of filtering noise influentially, instead of extracting the first IMF from the considered observations, a noise reduction operation can be applied to the IMFs that are believed to be associated with noise. Subsequently, observations synthesized by combining the filtered IMFs along with the other components arising from the EMD can be used with the LPTV Wiener filters. By this way, it can be prevented missing high frequency information of the signals possessing rapid changes, and thereby, the blurring effect is minimized.

Without using LPTV Wiener filter structures, a method based only on EMD and/or LS-SVM regression can be derived for the statistical multirate signal reconstruction.

In the current paper, the optimum σ value in LS-SVM regression is ascertained automatically by grid search in the reconstruction process of the 1-D signals. In 2-D case, however, the σ value is determined experimentally because of heavy computational load. It can also be tried to use grid search in determining the optimum σ value for 2-D signals.
