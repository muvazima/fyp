                  In this study, we developed a DEA–based performance measurement methodology that is consistent with performance assessment frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard. The methodology developed in this paper takes into account the direct or inverse relationships that may exist among the dimensions of performance to construct appropriate production frontiers. The production frontiers we obtained are deemed appropriate as they consist solely of firms with desirable levels for all dimensions of performance. These levels should be at least equal to the critical values set by decision makers. The properties and advantages of our methodology against competing methodologies are presented through an application to a real-world case study from retail firms operating in the US. A comparative analysis between the new methodology and existing methodologies explains the failure of the existing approaches to define appropriate production frontiers when directly or inversely related dimensions of performance are present and to express the interrelationships between the dimensions of performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The performance of modern organizations that operate in competitive marketplaces is based on multiple interrelated dimensions, which are both endogenous (controllable by the organizations) and exogenous (either non-controllable or partially controllable by the organizations). An important study in the area of performance management is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) (Kaplan & Norton, 1992). The BSC goes beyond the traditional financial measures for assessing the performance of organizations as it also incorporates customers, internal processes, and learning and growth perspectives (Kaplan & Norton, 1996).

The fundamental drawback of the BSC is the ambiguity of putting the theory into practice by modeling the conceptual framework so as to yield specific and measurable results (Amado, Santos, & Marques, 2012). In addition, the link among the dimensions of performance is vague, and the impact on the performance of trade-offs that may exist among these dimensions is not explicit (Otley, 1998).

Several studies, most of which are performed within the area of Operational Research, have been published providing scientific underpinning to performance assessment frameworks. Many of these studies use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for evaluating performance. DEA is a nonparametric methodology for assessing the production process of operational units. DEA provides a robust quantitative framework that enables the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of each unit under evaluation and yields measurable results that lead to the optimization of each unit's performance. Since the publication of the seminal paper by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978), a significant number of extensions of DEA have been developed (Emrouznejad, Parker, & Tavares, 2008). A selected list of DEA-based studies related to performance assessment in a multi-dimensional setting is provided in Table 1.
                     
                  

The studies presented in Table 1 either do not deal with the mixed relationships between the dimensions of performance or omit a discussion of whether the targets decision makers set for a number of dimensions of performance are satisfied. As a result, the benchmarking either does not express reality or is not flawless. Drawing on the results presented in the studies listed in Table 1, it is questionable if the units located in the frontier are appropriate benchmarks for the remaining units of the sample as it is unknown whether these units are qualified in all dimensions of performance incorporated in the evaluation.

In this paper, we address the issues raised in existing studies. We modify and extend the methodology developed by Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) to measure performance considering both the direct and inverse relationships among the dimensions of performance. The modified methodology relaxes the major assumption of the work of the said authors, which is that of fixed weights between the original and the adjusted variable levels. The adjustment of variables that fail to meet certain user-defined criteria is crucial for the construction of appropriate production frontiers. These frontiers consist of units that are not only assigned performance scores equal to unity, but also report scores at least equal to threshold values for all dimensions of performance. Our methodology guarantees that all units deviating from the frontier will become qualified in all dimensions of performance when they are projected to the frontier. The methodology developed in this study is not a straightforward extension of the work of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011). This conclusion draws on the outputs of the comparative analysis between our methodology and the methodology of the two authors, which is presented in Sections 2 and 3 of this paper.

This study unfolds as follows. Section 2 analyzes the performance assessment methodology and compares it with the methodology of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011). Section 3 justifies the selection of variables, clarifies the underlying relationships among them, and provides a real-world numerical example to present the properties and advantages of our methodology relative to competing approaches. Conclusions, limitations, and future research are presented in the final section of this study.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The methodology we develop in this paper extends the work of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) to a multivariable setting. All the variables incorporated in the performance measurement are interrelated either directly or inversely. The scope of the methodology presented in this study is to measure performance and define an optimal level for every dimension of performance, which respects a threshold value set by decision makers.

Unlike existing studies that do not consider the underlying relationships between the dimensions of performance (e.g. they deal with the dimensions of performance either in pairs or separately (García-Valderrama, Mulero-Mendigorri, & Revuelta-Bordoy, 2009; Mukherjee, Nath, & Pal, 2003), our methodology introduces a unified approach to performance measurement where all dimensions of performance are simultaneously interrelated. Our methodology accommodates dimensions of performance that are both controllable by the firm (e.g. efficiency) and not controllable or not completely controllable, which are either inversely related (e.g. customers’ satisfaction) or directly related (e.g. profits) to the controllable variables.

Since this methodology is an extension of the work developed by Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011), we present the new approach in a step-by-step manner and compare it with these authors’ work. Our methodology involves three steps.

Step 1 draws on a modified expression of the directional distance function developed by Cheng and Zervopoulos (2014). This step is applied to the firms under assessment for only classification reasons.

In program (1) we select input orientation as the direction vector

                     . This decision complies with the input orientation of step 2, where an improvement in users’ satisfaction requires the employment of additional inputs. However, program (1) is flexible enough to support output orientation (i.e.

                     ). Step 2 may also accommodate output orientation or no orientation by modifying program (3).

In the study by Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011), step 1 used a conventional variable returns to scale (VRS) DEA program (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984). This program is also appropriate for the first step in the current study. However, it is not qualified for step 3 as it is not as flexible as an extended expression of program (1) to measure the performance of complex production sets.

If at least one of the exogenous variables inversely related to efficiency is disqualified (e.g. an exogenous variable scores lower than a user-defined threshold value), then step 2 should be applied. This stage is regarded as preprocessing, aiming to define new (increased) inputs or new (decreased) outputs, depending on the orientation of the analysis, in order to bring disqualified exogenous variables to desirable levels.

If more than one variable inversely related to efficiency in the same firm is disqualified, expression (2) and program (3) should be applied to the variable with the lowest score (i.e. 
                        
                           m

                              z
                              
                                 k

                     , where h⊂j).

The efficiency score of the firms with disqualified exogenous variables is estimated as follows:

                     ). The value 0.5 in a satisfaction measurement scale expresses a neutral position (i.e. neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) of the user. Hence, if the extreme value of the scale above 0.5 represents maximum satisfaction and the extreme value of the scale below 0.5 denotes maximum dissatisfaction, scores higher than 0.5 express satisfaction.

The expression (2.ZP) applies only to cases with a single exogenous variable (i.e. zh, h⊂j). In addition, it refers only to efficient firms (i.e.

                      ≤ 1) with at least one disqualified exogenous variable.

Expression (2) satisfies the inverse relationship between some of the exogenous variables (e.g. 
                        
                           min
                           (

                     ) and efficiency. The managerial interpretation of this relationship is that the utilization of additional resources is a prerequisite for the improvement of some dimensions of performance (e.g. customers’ satisfaction) when the outputs and technology are fixed.

                     , which denotes net profits in the application that follows in Section 3.2 of this paper, is affected by changes in both inputs (e.g. number of employees) and outputs (e.g. net sales). In this context, the non-oriented approach is regarded as being the most appropriate for our case study as it provides flexibility for the program to define the impact of changes in inputs and/or outputs on net profits.

The decision on the orientation of program (6) depends on the characteristics of the case study to which this program is applied.

Program (6), which captures the relationships among all variables, is as follows:

Program (6) satisfies the four properties that Tone (2001) regarded as important for designing measures of efficiency, which are: (a) units invariance; (b) monotonicity; (c) translation invariance; (d) reference-set dependence. Proofs for properties (a), (b) and (d) are provided in Tone (2001). Proof for property (c) appears in Färe and Grosskopf (2010).

The data set we use for applying the new performance assessment methodology comes from retail firms that operate in the US (Table A1 in the Appendix). The data set consists of 36 firms. We use three inputs (i.e. number of employees, number of stores, and operating and administrative expenses) and one output (i.e. net sales). In addition, we select two exogenous variables that are inversely related to efficiency (i.e. customers’ satisfaction (CS) and employees’ satisfaction (ES)) and one exogenous variable that is directly related to efficiency (i.e. net profits). These three variables are partially controlled by the firms. The two satisfaction variables encompass subjective criteria of customers and employees for the quality of the services provided and the work environment, respectively. The net profits are affected by exogenously fixed factors, such as taxes and interests payable.

The selected dimensions of performance are in line with the concept of the BSC. In particular, in the BSC context, profits are an indicator of the financial perspective of firms (Amado et al., 2012); customers’ satisfaction expresses the customers’ perspective (Dyson, 2000; Kaplan & Norton, 1996); employees’ satisfaction, which encompasses employees’ morale and perception of the work environment, indicates the learning and growth perspective (Kaplan & Norton, 1996); and efficiency is a measure of the internal perspective (Dyson, 2000). The scope of the BSC is to determine the actions that can lead a firm to long-term success. Similarly, the methodology presented in this study identifies and measures the appropriate adjustments in the inputs employed and outputs produced in order to accomplish high standards for every dimension of performance. The holistic approach of performance measurement implemented in this paper is appropriate for ensuring firms’ sustainability.

A significant number of studies have evaluated the underlying relationships among the dimensions of performance. In particular, a direct link is present between customers’ satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction (Kaplan & Norton, 2001; Soteriou & Zenios, 1999). Both measures are perceptions of the quality of services and the quality of the work environment. Higher perceptions of the quality of services and work environment commonly requires investment in personnel (e.g. increase in the number of employees), in training for personnel, in operating systems, in the reward system, and in the tangibles of an organization that raise the operating expenses of firms.

In the pursuit of improving customers’ and employees’ satisfaction, the profits of a firm will inevitably decline, especially in the short run, because of the increased costs (Banker, Chang, Janakiraman, & Konstans, 2004; Gustafsson & Johnson, 2002; Kamakura, Mittal, de Rosa, Mazzon, 2002). Profits are directly related to efficiency, regardless of the chosen orientation (i.e. input minimization, output maximization, simultaneous input minimization and output maximization). Unlike the relationship between profits and efficiency, customers’ and employees’ satisfaction are inversely related to efficiency (Anderson, Fornell, & Rust, 1997).

If additional dimensions, beyond those selected in this paper, are incorporated into the assessment of performance without any information about the underlying relationships among the dimensions, the method developed by Banker et al. (2004) can be applied prior to our methodology to identify the unknown relationships.

By applying step 1 of the performance measurement methodology presented in Section 2, we classify the firms according to their performance in each dimension. Highly efficient (HE) firms are considered to be only those assigned efficiency scores equal to unity. In addition, we regard as qualified the firms that report customers’ satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction scores greater than a user-defined threshold value (e.g. α* = 0.550). Customers’ satisfaction (CS) and employees’ satisfaction (ES) scores greater than the threshold value are labeled HCS and HES, respectively. The scores that fall below the threshold value are labeled LCS and LES.

Drawing on the scores illustrated in Table 2
                        , there are five efficient firms (i.e. Costco, Gap, Raley's, The Fresh Market and Wal-Mart). One firm (i.e. The Fresh Market) of the five fails to score at least equal to the threshold value (i.e. α* = 0.550) regarding employees’ satisfaction. This firm (i.e. The Fresh Market) is regarded as an inappropriate benchmark for the inefficient firms as it is disqualified in one dimension of performance. The production process of this firm and also of the additional seven firms presented in bold in Table 2 (e.g. Big Lots, CVS Caremark) need adjustment according to step 2 of the methodology discussed in Section 2 of this study.

The eight firms disqualified in at least one exogenous variable that is inversely related to efficiency are introduced in step 2. The adjustment of the efficiency score (ζ) and the scores of both disqualified and qualified exogenous variables of the same firm is based on expressions (2), (4) and (5). The results obtained from the adjustment process of efficiency, customers’ satisfaction (CS) and employees’ satisfaction (ES) are displayed in Table 3
                        . After the adjustment, there is no disqualified exogenous variable, while the efficiency scores ((ζh
                        )
                           ad
                        ) fall short of the original efficiency scores (ζh
                        ).

The adjusted scores assigned to efficiency and one of the two exogenous variables, which are inversely related to efficiency, measured according to the methodology of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011), are illustrated in Table 3 under the heading adjusted scores(2). The efficiency adjustment formula in their work, which corresponds to expression (2), is expression (2.ZP) in Section 2 of this study.

Expression (2.ZP) applies only to efficient firms (i.e. 
                           
                              
                                 ζ
                                 h
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ) with a single exogenous variable inversely related to efficiency (i.e. zh
                        ) that falls below the threshold value (i.e. α*). The work of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) cannot be extended to a multi-exogenous variable setting. Consequently, as shown in Table 3, the adjustment is applied only to the exogenous variable ES and the efficiency score (ζ) while the second exogenous variable remains unchanged. The omission of adjustment of the exogenous variable CS fails to express the inverse relationship between this variable and efficiency.

Taking into account the inverse relationship between CS and ES and efficiency as well as the input orientation of program (1), we note that the increase in the CS and ES scores requires the employment of additional resources and the increase of operating and administrative expenses. The increased inputs (
                           
                              x

                        ) obtained from program (3) are presented in Table 4
                         under heading (1). The values in brackets denote the change (increase) in the new input levels compared to the original input levels. In Table 4, the adjusted inputs obtained using the methodology of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) (i.e. expression (3.ZP) in Section 2 of this study) are displayed under heading (2).

The adjusted inputs and exogenous variables (i.e. CS and ES) replace the original inputs and exogenous variables, respectively, in the data set. The modified data set is introduced in program (6). Program (6) is non-oriented as it accommodates both the minimization of inputs and exogenous variables that are inversely related to efficiency and maximization of outputs and exogenous variables that are directly related to efficiency. The non-orientation of program (6) (i.e.

                        ) expresses all of the interrelationships between variables (i.e. inputs and outputs) and dimensions of performance (e.g. customers’ and employees’ satisfaction and net profits). For instance, net profits are expected to increase not only by the reduction of inputs, but also by the increase in outputs (i.e. net sales). Program (6) is adjustable to the conditions that apply to diverse markets by selecting appropriate direction vectors.

Drawing on the results displayed in Table 5
                        , the methodology presented in Section 2 manages to identify benchmark firms that are qualified in all dimensions of performance. In other words, the benchmark firms need to be efficient and assigned customers’ and employees’ satisfaction scores at least equal to a user-defined threshold value as well as the optimal net profits of these firms to be not less than their original net profits. The performance measurement framework we present in this study complies with the microeconomic theory as it facilitates profit maximization while also respecting constraints that ensure the sustainability of the firms. The identification of appropriate benchmarks enables firms that deviate from the production frontier to become qualified in all dimensions of performance when they are projected to the frontier.

Unlike the performance measurement framework presented in this study, the methodology of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) fails to construct an appropriate production frontier when multiple exogenous variables are present. In particular, five firms are regarded as top performing (i.e. Big Lots, CVS Caremark, Dillard's, Family Dollar and Shoppers Food & Pharmacy) while they are assigned employees’ satisfaction scores lower than the threshold value α* = 0.550. This distortion affects the firms that are not located in the frontier as their projection to the frontier is not adequate to qualify them in all dimensions of performance.

Drawing on the results presented in Table 6, it is obvious that the performance scores are affected by the dimensionality of the production set. Overestimated performance scores are common in finite samples (Banker, 1993), which are available in most of the real-world case studies. This study does not deal with the upward biased performance estimators obtained from DEA. This limitation is commonly addressed by applying smoothed bootstrapping (Kneip, Simar, & Wilson, 2008, 2011; Simar & Wilson, 1998, 2000) or alternative methods that deal with uncertainty in DEA, such as IDEA (Cooper, 1999), Chance-constrained DEA (Cooper, Huang, & Li, 1996; Land, Lovell, & Thore, 1988; Olesen & Petersen, 1995) and Monte Carlo simulation (Banker, Charnes, Cooper, & Maindiratta, 1987). Dyson and Shale (2010) provide a comprehensive presentation of these methods.

The performance assessment framework applied to this study justifies the net profit maximization for the firms that deviate from the production frontier by increasing net sales and/or decreasing resources and operating and administrative expenses. For instance, in Table 6, the retail firm Best Buy can reach top performance (i.e. θ = 1.0000) and report an $1,265.5 m increase in net profits through a marginal increase in net sales and a significant decrease in operating and administrative expenses by $1,222.79 m. Taking into account that the number of employees and stores of Best Buy should not be modified, the key for attaining top performance and maximum net profits is the reduction in salaries, stores expenses, utilities and other operating expenses.

As discussed in Section 2 of this work, the appropriateness of our methodology for identifying qualified firms in all dimensions of performance as benchmarks is also illustrated in Table 7A
                        
                         andB. The results of the new methodology are tested against those obtained from the methodology developed by Lim and Zhu (2013). The performance measurement methodology put forth by Lim and Zhu (2013) is applicable when target levels for some variables are present, which the units should strive to achieve. In this study, instead of target scores, we set minimum target scores or threshold values (i.e. α* = 0.550), with the aim of not having any of the firms under evaluation report scores for the exogenous variables that are lower than the threshold value.

Furthermore, we developed two scenarios to cross-check the results of our methodology against those based on the methodology of Lim and Zhu (2013). In particular, we used the following non-oriented program:

In the first scenario, the original data set is introduced in program (7) without any prior adjustment. In the second scenario, steps 1 and 2 of the methodology discussed in Section 2 were applied to the data set prior to its introduction in program (7).

In Table 7A, scenario 1 fails to identify qualified benchmarks in all dimensions of performance. In particular, the retail firms Big Lots, CVS Caremark, Delhaize America, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy and The Fresh Market are regarded as top performers (i.e. θ = 1.0000) while they are assigned ES scores lower than the target score (i.e. 
                           
                              ω
                              =
                              0.550
                           
                        ). In scenario 2 (Table 7B
                        ), program (7) manages to identify appropriate benchmark firms. The two scenarios reveal the importance of applying the adjustment process presented in step 2 of our methodology to the data set prior to the performance evaluation.

Regardless of the success or failure in identifying appropriate benchmark firms by program (7), this particular program cannot be used for the measurement of performance when variables with inverse and direct interrelationships are present. To be more precise, program (7) fails to capture the inverse relationship between CS and ES on one hand and performance (η/φ) and net profit on the other hand. Focusing on the retail firm Best Buy, which is assigned performance scores of 0.8797 and 0.8808 by scenario 1 (Table 7A) and 2 (Table 7B), respectively, a decrease in the resources employed and output produced to enable the projection of the firm to the frontier increases net profits but does not affect CS and ES scores. Respecting the inverse relationship of CS and ES with performance, a decrease in inputs for attaining higher performance is expected to lead to a decrease in CS and ES scores. The cases in which scenarios 1 and 2, and particularly program (7), fail to express the relationship between the dimensions of performance are highlighted in grey in Tables 7A and 7B.

The performance measurement methodology presented in this paper is applicable to a setting with multiple interrelated dimensions of performance when direct or inverse relationships are present between these dimensions. This methodology constructs an appropriate production frontier, which consists solely of firms that are simultaneously qualified in all dimensions of performance. Our methodology is a modified and extended version of the one put forth by Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011). A major novelty of the new methodology is the relaxation of the assumption of fixed weights between actual and adjusted input or output variables. The new methodology is not limited to the measurement of performance when a single exogenous variable is present, such as in the methodology that Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) use. In addition, the methodology presented in this study can be regarded as a scientific foundation of performance assessment frameworks, such as the Balanced Scorecard.

The properties of the new methodology were presented through a real-world application. Our case study consisted of 36 retail firms operating in the US. The appropriateness of our methodology for measuring performance when multiple interrelated variables with user-defined threshold values are incorporated in the evaluation was also discussed through a comparative analysis with the methodology of Zervopoulos and Palaskas (2011) and Lim and Zhu (2013).
                  

The managerial implications of our methodology were discussed in both Sections 2 and 3. Its fundamental advantage for decision makers is the development of appropriate production frontiers that facilitate realistic benchmarking based on all of the incorporated dimensions of performance. Future research could focus on the extension of this methodology to a stochastic setting in which uncertainty in data and relationships between the dimensions of performance is present.
