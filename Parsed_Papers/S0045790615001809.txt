                  In a wireless sensor network where sensors are arranged into a flat topology, sensors near the sink consume much more energy than sensors at the boundary of the network. Sensors near the sink relay many packets than far away sensors to the sink. After these sensors expire, energy holes are created near the sink. Therefore, other sensors cannot reach to the sink and the network becomes disconnected. In this paper, we propose some strategies that can balance energy consumption of the deployed sensors and reduce energy holes from the network by balancing the communication load as equally as possible. We performed extensive experiments on the proposed algorithm using various network scenarios and compared it with other existing algorithms. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed work in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and other important network parameters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of low cost, low power, small sensing devices, where sensor nodes are deployed into a monitoring field without a preconfigured infrastructure [1]. After deployment, sensor nodes find neighbour nodes and organize themselves into a network [2,3]. The maximum amount of the energy of a sensor is consumed on two major tasks, viz sensing data from the monitoring environment and transmitting data to a sink or Base Station (BS) [4]. Energy consumption on sensing is dependent only on the sampling rate and does not depend on the network topology or location of the sensors. Therefore, energy consumption on sensing is constant. However, the data routing strategy is the most significant factor that determines the performance of the network [5–7]. In a homogeneous WSN, sensors near the sink consume much more energy compared to the sensors far away from the sink. Since, sensors near the sink relay many packets from sensors at the margin of the network [8], communication load of these sensors is much more compared to the far away sensors and they expire earlier than the far away sensor. After the expiry of these sensors, energy holes or communication gaps are created near the sink [9,10].

Hence, far away sensors cannot transmit data to the sink and then the network becomes disconnected, but still most of the nodes can survive for a long period of time [11–14]. Thus, load distribution among the deployed sensors is one of the most critical problems in the designing of WSNs. It has a profound impact on the network lifetime and performance of the network. Therefore, it is necessary to design and develop a load balancing scheme for WSNs to prolong the network lifetime and performance of the network.

Several cluster-based load management approaches have emerged in the literature review. Most of them have selected cluster head, depending on the remaining energy of the sensor nodes [2,8,15]. Cluster-based data routing strategy is more suitable for energy conservation compared to the direct data transmission. Most of the clustering approaches select cluster head dynamically in each round for better energy management among the sensor nodes. However, each round cluster head selection process imposes extra message overhead or traffic load on these approaches. An on-demand based cluster head selection strategy has selected cluster head depending on the network demand and reduces extra cluster formation overhead from the network. Thus, an on-demand based cluster head selection strategy is perfectly suitable for WSN load management scheme.

In this paper, we propose a new cluster-based load management scheme, referred to as load management scheme for energy holes reduction in wireless sensor networks (LMSEHR) that can balance the energy consumption of the deployed sensor nodes and minimize energy holes creation in the WSN by balancing communication load as equally as possible. For doing this, proposed scheme does not make any assumptions like node distribution, node capacities, and network size. It does not use any location awareness Global Positioning System (GPS) to locate the position of the deployed sensor node. In this paper, we only consider deployed nodes which are varied in their transmission power and are capable of computing their remaining energy. In our proposed scheme, all sensors are organized into distinct clusters and each non-cluster head node belongs to exactly one cluster as a cluster member node. To achieve better energy management, proposed scheme selects CHs on-demand basis. The CHs are selected from the special regional nodes that can reduce extra message overhead and time delay in cluster head selection process. Furthermore, CHs communication load are balanced by the associative cluster heads. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
                        
                           •
                           We propose a new load management strategy for large scale sensor networks where communication load and residual energy of deployed sensors are used for CHs selection.

We focus on the problem of minimizing energy holes within the network. Then, we mathematically derive an optimal solution based on the load balancing strategies.

We propose special region based CHs selection mechanisms for energy and time saving.

We also propose a load balancing data routing strategy for balance energy consumption.

We carry out extensive simulations. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are verified by comparing with other existing algorithms.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work which provides an exhaustive survey about the previous work is discussed. Section 3 states the problem of load-balancing and network model. Section 4 presents the problem formulation and the assumptions made in this paper. The proposed load management scheme is presented in Section 5. Section 6 gives simulation results and some discussions. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper.

Minimizing load is a major objective in several multi-hop wireless networks. This requirement has become more important for WSNs where sensor nodes are powered by batteries. Numerous studies have been conducted to reduce the load of the sensor nodes and to extend lifetime of the network. Cluster-based data routing strategy is one of the most popular data gathering mechanisms that has been used to maximize WSN lifetime. It also helps to reduce the communication load and data redundancy from the large scale WSNs. Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) [15] is a well-known dynamic clustering approach where CH load dynamically rotates amongst the non-CH nodes that balance energy dissipation between the non-CH nodes. It works in two phases: (a) setup phase, and (b) steady state phase. In the setup phase, the entire network is divided into different clusters. For cluster formation, each node selects a random number between 0 and 1. If the selected random number is less than the threshold value, the node is selected as a CH. After cluster formation, CHs allocate a time slot to each cluster member node or non-CH node, depending on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach. In steady state phase, each cluster member transmits sensing information to the CH according to the given time slot. CHs aggregate receiving data and it transmits to BS. The main disadvantages of the LEACH protocol can be summarized as follows.
                        
                           •
                           The LEACH protocol follows random cluster head selection strategy. Therefore, in this approach message overhead is very high.

The LEACH protocol selects CHs based on some probability. If any node is detected of low residual energy, it may be selected as a CH for data gathering process. As a result, number of cluster head election process is increased throughout the network lifetime and it potentially degrades the functionality of the network.

The LEACH protocol does not assure even distribution of the CHs within the network.

In LEACH protocol, CHs directly transmit aggregated data to the BS by the single-hop communication, which is unrealistic for the large scale WSN. In medium scale WSN, direct data exchange mechanism increases communication load within the CHs and hence it creates high load difference between CHs and cluster member nodes.

In [16], Younis and Fahmy have proposed a hybrid distributed clustering approach known as Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed (HEED) clustering. This approach selects CHs by considering residual energy of the sensors and inter-cluster distance. It considers remaining energy of the sensors as a primary parameter and inters cluster communication cost as secondary parameter. HEED usefully minimizes intra-cluster communication cost and effectively distributes CHs throughout the network. However, HEED increases communication overhead during the computation of the communication cost between the nodes. The main drawbacks of the HEED protocol can be summarized as follows.
                        
                           •
                           HEED protocol follows random CHs selection strategy like LEACH protocol that creates high energy overhead within the network.

In HEED, every CH communicates with the BS via other CHs. Since CHs close to the BS relay many packets from CHs far away from the BS, it creates unbalanced energy consumption between the CHs. As a result, HEED suffers from the energy holes problem.

In [17], the authors Taheri et al. have proposed an energy-aware distributed dynamic clustering protocol. In this clustering approach, CHs are selected with non-probabilistic fashion. It selects CHs by considering delay times. The CHs selection delay time is inversely proportional to the residual energy. This approach uses fuzzy logic rules in order to choose final CHs from a tentative CH set. It also uses on-demand basis CHs selection mechanism to minimize energy consumption of the deployed sensor nodes. The disadvantages of ECPF protocol are as follows.
                        
                           •
                           In ECPF protocol, overall energy consumption of the deployed nodes is neither balanced nor minimized.

In this protocol, CH election process mainly depends on the delay time, but in upper round when residual energy of nodes is less, the delay time is very short. Therefore, in upper rounds CHs are selected in minimum time interval and then high amounts of energy is consumed for CHs selection process.

In ECPF protocol, fuzzy logic rules are used for effective CHs selection. Hence, limited computing capacity nodes are required more time and energy to selects CHs from tentative CHs set.

In [18], Soro and Heinzelman have proposed a CH selection approach for coverage preservation. It selects CHs by considering network coverage and residual energy of the sensor nodes. On the other hand, this approach also chooses active nodes and router nodes depending on the different coverage-aware cost metrics. It puts extra message overhead within the network. In this approach, overall energy loss of the sensor nodes is neither balanced nor minimized.

In [19], Kim et al. have proposed a CH election mechanism using fuzzy logic in wireless sensor networks (CHEF). Like the approach [17] this approach also uses if-then rules for CHs selection. Here, CH selection occurs in a distributed manner. For CHs selection, two parameters are evaluated by the fuzzy logic if-then rules, one of them is remaining energy and the other is local distance. Local distance is calculated by the sum of distances between the node and the node which is within the average radius of the preferred clusters. The main disadvantages of CHEF approach are as follows.
                        
                           •
                           The CHEF approach follows random clustering strategy; hence, energy overhead is very high in this approach.

This approach has not balanced energy consumption between the CHs and cluster member nodes that influence to create energy holes or communication gaps within the network after some initial rounds.

Energy Balance Clustering Approach for Gradient (EBCAG) based data routing is studied in [20]. This approach divides entry network into unequal size of clusters and tries to overcome the hotspots problem in multi-hop WSNs. The main idea behind unequal size cluster formation is to adjust the cluster size with respect to the distance between the CH and the BS. In this approach, each sensor node maintains a gradient value that defines its minimum hop count to the sink. The size of a cluster is determined by the gradient value of its CH. The disadvantages of the unequal clustering approach are as follows.
                        
                           •
                           In EBCAG approach, each sensor node maintains a gradient value that increases extra energy overhead within the network.

In this approach, high amount of energy is consumed during different size cluster formation and maintenance.

In [21], the authors Low et al. have proposed an efficient clustering based on load balancing algorithm for wireless sensor network. This approach allocates each sensor nodes to a gateway node in such a way that it distributes the overall network traffic load among the gateway nodes. The authors concede a breadth-first search (BFS) to find out the least load gateway node within the network. The main disadvantages of this load balancing approach can be summarized as follows.
                        
                           •
                           This approach leads to a large number of message exchanges over the network for efficient allocation of each sensor node to a gateway node. It puts a large overhead and time delay for the large scale WSNs.

This approach really takes much more amount of memory space for building a BFS tree for individual sensor node.

                      must be able to communicate with the BS via multi-hop communication. CHs can use a data routing strategy to minimize and balance communication load, as discussed in Section 5. The following requirements must be met by the proposed scheme.
                        
                           1.
                           Clustering process is completely distributed. Node independently makes decision based on the local information.

At the end of the cluster formation time, each node is selected either a CH, or cluster member node and each cluster member node should belong to a single cluster.

CHs and cluster members load should be minimized.

CHs and cluster members load are distributed in such a way that can reduce energy holes from the network. Energy utilization of each deployed node should be maximized.

Clustering and routing mechanisms should be efficient in terms of processing complexity and message overhead.

We assume our sensor network model as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              We assume all sensor nodes are uniformly deployed in the target area. All deployed sensors become static once they are deployed.

Sensor nodes are powered by non-renewable on board energy source. The initial energy of each sensor is Emax
                                 .

Sensor nodes sense data at a constant rate and it transmits to the destination node.

We assume there is a perfect Media Access Control (MAC) layer in the network, i.e. transmission scheduling is collision less.

Nodes are location unaware.

The BS is not limited in terms of energy, memory, and computational power.

In this paper, the radio model for energy is adopted from [4,22]. The free space and multipath channels are used depending on the transmission distance between a source node and receiver node. The multipath (mp) model is used when the transmission distance of the source nodes is greater than a threshold value d
                     0, otherwise the free space (fs) model is considered. Let

The first part of the equation indicates energy consumed in reception of packets from (m
                        −1) nodes in the cluster. The second part indicates the energy consumed by the CH in transmitting messages. Now consider, each cluster member node sends data to CH by multi-hop communication. Therefore, average communication load of a cluster member is represented by

The proposed load management scheme is divided into two phases, namely clustering and routing. In the clustering phase, deployed sensor nodes are organized into kc
                      number of clusters. CHs are selected according to the highest energy level and lowest load from the special regional nodes. In the routing phase, CHs select associative cluster heads with respect to its acting load condition. Then associative cluster head selects another sub associative cluster head depending on its present load condition. Associative cluster heads reduce CHs load and balance energy dissipation between the CHs and cluster member nodes. The working procedure of the proposed load managed scheme is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The proposed clustering and data routing strategies are subsequently described in the following sections.

Here, deployed sensor nodes are divided into δ size of clusters, where total energy loss (Etotal
                        ) of the network is minimized. The cluster size δ is calculated according to [15].

CHs are selected on the basis of average load and remaining energy of the special regional nodes. Every CH and cluster member nodes calculate its residual energy (Eresidual
                        ) at the end of the data transmission phase. Initially, Eresidual
                         of the deployed nodes are same. Therefore, CH selects on the basis of NL information of the cluster member nodes. After the initial round, CH is selected from the special regional nodes depending on their NL and Eresidual
                         information. Then, minimum numbers of nodes that belong to the special region participate in CH election process. For cluster head selection, acting CH sends beacon messages within the special regional nodes. When special regional nodes receive the beacon message, they are prepared to select new CH. When the new CH election process is triggered between the special regional nodes, then another cluster member node waits for next new CH acknowledgement. For non-demand clustering, each CH sets a timer to start next new CH election process on the basis of its current energy status.

We now present the proposed load balancing routing mechanism. Here, CHs select the next hop associative cluster heads for data routing in such a way that associative cluster head must reduce and balance each CH load with respect to their cluster member nodes. In sub associative cluster head selection process, each CH calculates its transmission distance to the BS and it compares with the threshold distance

For associative cluster head selection, each CH transmits ADV message composed of 2 tuples (ID, code) where code contains associative node selection request. When any node receives ADV message from CH, node sends JOIND message composed of 2 tuples (ID, energy level). Energy level information consists of current Eresidual
                         energy condition of the node. CH selects highest Eresidual
                         node as an associative cluster head and transmits data to associative cluster head. Associative cluster head based data transmission process reduces unbalanced CH load from the acting CH set during the data transmission process. Similarly, sub-associative cluster head also reduces and balances associative cluster head load during the data routing process. The detailed description about this load balanced data routing algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.

                              Message and time complexity of the proposed clustering method is O(1) for each sensor node and O(N) for N sensor nodes in the network.
                           

In cluster formation phase, a sensor node either nominates itself as a CH or acts as a cluster member node. Therefore, the message complexity of the proposed clustering scheme is O(1). In the worst case, each sensor needs to process n
                              −1 CHs. Therefore the time complexity of the proposed scheme is O(N).

The time complexity of the proposed load balancing routing algorithm is O(N) for N sensor nodes in the network.

In load balancing data routing phase, each CH needs to calculate the residual energy of the node to select an associative cluster head for which it requires checking the residual energy of N
                              −1 nodes in the worst case. Therefore, the time complexity of the proposed data routing scheme is O(N).□

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with the existing EBCAG [20], LECH [15], HEED [16], ECPF [17], and CHEF [19] algorithms in terms of first node dies (FND), half of nodes remain alive (HNA), last node dies (LND), and other important network parameters such as global energy loss by the network, clustering overhead, average energy consumption, number of elected cluster heads. All the algorithms are simulated through MATLAB R2012b and C programing. The simulation parameters used in the simulation are provided in Table 1
                      
                     [15,20,22–23]. In the simulation, we assume sensor nodes are uniformly deployed in the sensing field. All simulations have been conducted in two scenarios.
                        Scenario 1
                        We simulate a WSN with a 500m by 500m field and BS is placed at the coordinate (510, 210).

We simulate a WSN with a 700m by 700m field and BS is placed at the coordinate (710, 330).


                     Fig. 2
                      shows the load variation of the LMSEHR scheme among the randomly deployed sensor nodes. This is measured with the data receiving energy loss and data transmission energy loss. In LMSEHR, CHs and cluster members load are minimized and balanced in such a way that the load difference between the CHs and cluster members is minimized. On the other hand, energy distribution in LMSEHR can be easily inferred from the Fig. 2.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows the unutilized energy of the deployed sensor nodes in LMSEHR scheme. The unutilized energy is less in our proposed scheme due to proper load balance among the CHs and cluster member nodes. Moreover, in LMSEHR scheme, CH transmission cost is reduced by the associative cluster head. Hence, a node can transmit its data to the BS even with its minimum remaining energy level. Therefore, energy utilization of the proposed scheme is better.


                     Fig. 4
                      indicates the amount of data transmitted by each CH. This figure also shows the uniform load distribution between the CHs. Uniform load distributions can improve functionality of the network. Since, BS receives data from all clusters throughout the network lifetime. The LMSEHR scheme reduces and distributes data routing load of the deployed sensor nodes through the efficient number of cluster formation within the network that can divide the entire network into effective size of clusters and reduce transmission cost of the deployed sensor nodes. Furthermore, CHs select associative cluster according to their acting load condition and hence associative cluster head also select sub associative cluster head depending on acting load. Therefore, data routing load of the network is uniformly distributed and balanced among all deployed sensor nodes.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the global energy of LMSEHR in Scenario 1 with 100 nodes. The global energy loss in LMSEHR scheme is 22.3% less compared to EBCAG, 47.26% less compared to LEACH, 48% less compared to HEED, 40.23% less compared to ECPF, and 51.23% less compared to CHEF scheme. Therefore, the network lifetime of LMSEHR has increased 24% compared to EBCAG technique, 49% compared to LEACH, 55.66% compared to HEED, 47.43% compared to ECPF, and 61% compared to CHEF. This is caused due to the on-demand cluster head election process and load balancing between the cluster members and CHs.


                        Fig. 6
                         shows global energy loss in Scenario 1 with 200 nodes. The global energy loss of LMSEHR is less by 23.24% compared to EBCAG technique, 48.12% compared with ECPF, 51% compared with LEACH, 54% compared with HEED, and 58% compared with CHEF respectively. In Fig. 6, it is seen that the network lifetime of LMSEHR has increased as compared to Fig. 5. This is due to the increment of node density in the network and load balancing through the associative cluster head.


                        Fig. 7
                         demonstrates global energy loss in Scenario 2 with 100 nodes. In LMSEHR sachem, global energy loss is less by 23% compared to EBCAG, 49% compared to LEACH, 46% compared to HEED, 39% ECPF and 54% CHEF algorithms. Therefore, network lifetime in LMSEHR scheme is increased by 25% compared to EBCAG scheme, 52% compared to LEACH, 49.02% compared with HEED, 44.43% compared with ECPF scheme, and 64% compared with CHEF respectively. If node deployment area is increased, global energy loss is also increased due to increment of transmission range of the deployed sensor nodes. Hence, network lifetime is decreased in Fig. 7 compared to Fig. 5.


                        Fig. 8
                        , shows that LMSEHR has lesser global energy loss of 21%, 52%, 47%, 40.13%, and 56% as compared to EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF, and CHEF in Scenario 2. It is due to efficient load balancing between CH and cluster member nodes, where CH loads are reduced by the associative cluster head.


                        Fig. 9
                        a shows the comparison results in terms of Fast Node Dies (FND) at Scenario 1. It is seen that in LMSEHR scheme FND occurs after more than 12.3% rounds compared to EBCAG, 14.28% rounds as compared to ECPF, 73.91% rounds as compared to HEED, and 78.02% rounds as compared to LEACH respectively. From Fig. 9a, it can be observed that if number of nodes is increased, FND time decreases very slowly in LMSHR as compared with EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF, and CHPF schemes. Fig. 9b shows the comparison results in terms of the Half of Nodes Alive (HNA). From this figure, it can be observed that LMSEHR performs better than the EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF and CHEF when considering the HNA metric. This causes due to the elimination of extra load from the cluster heads and cluster member nodes. Fig. 9c shows the comparison results in terms of Last Node Dies (LND) at Scenario 1. As can be seen from the figure that LMSHR scheme performs 25% better than EBCAG, 50% better than ECPF, 62.11% better than HEED, 64% better than LECH, and 74% better than CHEF when considering the LND metric. Fig. 9a–c show that LMSEHR scheme performs better than EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF, and CHEF schemes in terms of FND, HNA and LND. Hence, it can be observed that LMSEHR scheme successfully reduces energy holes from the network.


                        Fig. 10
                        a–c show the comparison results in terms of FND, HNA and LND at Scenario 2. From these figures, it can be observed that in large scale WSN, LMSEHR also performs better than the EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF, and CHEF when considering FND, HNA, LND metrics.


                        Fig. 11
                         shows the average energy consumption comparison in Scenarios 1 and 2. This is the measure of the ratio between the sums of energy consumption of all deployed nodes to the total number of deployed nodes. Average energy consumption rate of LMSEHR is less as compared with EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECPF, and CHEF. This is caused due to the elimination of message overhead from cluster formation phase.


                        Fig. 12
                        a–b show average energy commotion of the CHs. The average energy consumption of the CHs in LMSEHR is less as compared to EBCAG, LEACH, HEED, ECFP and CHEF due to minimization of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    CH
                                 
                                 
                                    E
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         load. In the proposed scheme, CH loads are minimized through the associative cluster head and associative cluster head loads are reduced by the sub associative cluster heads. Therefore, average energy consumption in LMSEHR scheme is less compared to the other load management schemes.


                        Figs. 13 and 14
                        
                         show details of the number of CHs election process in Scenarios 1 and 2. It is seen that LMSEHR has less number of CHs election process as compared with LEACH, HEED, and CHEF. It is due to minimum load distribution among the CHs and cluster member nodes. However, on demand clustering process mainly reduces the number of CH election process from the network.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have proposed a new energy efficient load management scheme for wireless sensor network which is not only energy efficient but also able to balance load. In the proposed scheme, cluster heads have been selected in non-probabilistic fashion based on the residual energy and communication load of the nodes. It has been shown that the proposed clustering algorithm has required O(N) time complexity for N sensor nodes. We have developed associative cluster head based simple but elegant data routing strategy that balances energy differences between the CHs and cluster member nodes. The proposed scheme has been simulated extensively using two different scenarios of WSN. Simulation results have been compared with five existing algorithms. The proposed scheme has been shown to outperform all these algorithms in terms of FND, LND, HNA including global energy loss, energy utilization in both the scenarios. In the future, this work deserves to be considered for being applied to some real-life applications such as agricultural crop monitoring or livestock monitoring.
