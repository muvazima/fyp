                  We consider a discrete time version of the popular optimal dividend payout problem in risk theory. The novel aspect of our approach is that we allow for a risk averse insurer, i.e., instead of maximising the expected discounted dividends until ruin we maximise the expected utility of discounted dividends until ruin. This task has been proposed as an open problem in Gerber and Shiu (2004). The model in a continuous-time Brownian motion setting with the exponential utility function has been analysed in Grandits et al. (2007). Nevertheless, a complete solution has not been provided. In this work, instead we solve the problem in discrete time setup for the exponential and the power utility functions and give the structure of optimal history-dependent dividend policies. We make use of certain ideas studied earlier in Bäuerle and Rieder (2011), where Markov decision processes with general utility functions were treated. Our analysis, however, includes new aspects, since the reward functions in this case are not bounded.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The dividend payout problem in risk theory has been introduced by de Finetti (1957) and has since then been investigated under various extensions during the decades up to now; see, for instance, Grandits et al. (2007) or Yao et al. (2011). The task is to find in a given model for the free surplus process of an insurance company, a dividend payout strategy that maximises the expected discounted dividends until ruin. Typical models for the surplus process are compound Poisson processes, diffusion processes, general renewal processes or discrete time processes. The reader is referred to Albrecher and Thonhauser (2009) and Avanzi (2009), where an excellent overview of recent results is provided.

In Gerber and Shiu (2004) the authors propose the problem of maximising the expected utility of discounted dividends until ruin instead of maximising the expected discounted dividends until ruin. This means that an insurance company is equipped with some utility function that helps it to measure the accumulated dividends paid to the shareholders. If this utility is increasing and concave, the company is risk averse (see Remark 2.2). To the best of our knowledge, there is only one work (Grandits et al., 2007), in which this idea was taken up. More precisely, Grandits et al. (2007) consider a linear Brownian motion model for the free surplus process and apply the exponential utility function to evaluate the discounted dividends until ruin. It turns out that the mathematics involved in the analysis of this problem is quite different from the one used in the risk neutral case and only partial results could be obtained. In contrast to the same problem with a risk neutral insurance company, where the optimal dividend payout strategy is of a barrier type (see e.g., Asmussen and Taksar, 1997), the authors in Grandits et al. (2007) are not able to identify the structure of the optimal dividend policy rigorously. They show imposing some further assumptions that there is a time dependent optimal barrier.

We study the same problem but with a discrete time surplus process. The risk neutral problem within such a framework can be found in Section 1.2 in Schmidli (2008) or in Section 9.2 in Bäuerle and Rieder (2011). By making use of the dynamic programming approach the authors in Bäuerle and Rieder (2011) and Schmidli (2008) prove that the optimal dividend payout policy is a stationary band-strategy. Albrecher et al. (2011), on the other hand, consider a discrete time model that is formulated with the aid of a general Lévy surplus process but the dividend payouts are allowed only at random discrete time points. This version can again be solved by the dynamic programming arguments. However, the problem with a general utility function is more demanding. Like in the continuous time setting (Grandits et al., 2007), it requires a sophisticated analysis. It is worth mentioning that Markov decision processes with general utility functions have been already studied in Kadota et al. (1998) and Bäuerle and Rieder (2014). Moreover, there are also some papers, where the specific utility functions are considered. For example, Jaquette (1973); 1976) and Chung and Sobel (1987) are among the first who examined discounted payoffs in Markov decision processes with the decision maker that is equipped with a constant risk aversion, i.e., grades her random payoffs with the help of the exponential utility function. The common feature of all the aforementioned papers is the fact that they deal with bounded rewards or costs. Therefore, their results cannot be directly applied to our case, where the payoffs are unbounded. We make use of the special structure of the underlying problem and show that the optimal dividend payout policy is a time dependent band-strategy. The value function itself can be characterised as a solution to a certain optimality equation. Furthermore, we also study the dividend payout model with the power utility function. As noted in Bäuerle and Rieder (2014), the original Markov decision process can then be viewed as a Markov decision process defined on the extended state space. We employ these techniques to solve our model, but only in the first step, where we use an approximation of the value function in the infinite time horizon by value functions in the finite time horizons. In contrast to the exponential utility case, we can only partly identify the structure of the optimal dividend payout policy. However, we are able to show that there is a barrier such that when the surplus is above the barrier, it is always optimal to pay down to a state below the barrier. The value function is again characterised as a solution to some optimality equation. Summing up, the optimal dividend payout problem with the exponential utility function can be solved completely in the discrete time case, in contrast to the continuous-time problem in Grandits et al. (2007), whilst for the case with the power utility function we are at least able to identify the important global structure of the optimal policy.

The paper is organised as follows. In the next section we introduce the model together with mild assumptions and general history-dependent policies. Section 3 is devoted to a study of the exponential utility case. We show first that the value function J for discounted payoffs satisfies an optimality equation and give a lower and an upper bound for J. Then, we identify properties of the minimiser of the right-hand side of the optimality equation. This enables us to show that the minimiser indeed defines an optimal policy, which is a non-stationary band-policy. The non-stationarity is based only on the time-dependence. The power utility case is treated in Section 4. We pursue here a little different approach, but it also leads to an optimality equation. The policies obtained in this setting are really history-dependent. Nonetheless, we are still able to show that the optimal policy is of a barrier-type. In Section 5 we provide the policy improvement algorithm for the model with the exponential utility. Finally, Section 6 is devoted to concluding remarks and open issues.

Assumption (A2) allows to avoid a trivial case, when the ruin will never occur under any policy π ∈ Π.

                        Remark 2.1
                        In our study, we assume that the random variables {Zn
                           } only take integer values and the initial capital is also integer. From the proof of Lemma 1.9 in Schmidli (2008), it follows that in our problem we can restrict without loss of generality to the integer dividend payments.

                           is called the Arrow–Pratt function of absolute risk aversion. Hence, the second term accounts for the variability of X (for a discussion see Bielecki and Pliska, 2003). If Uγ
                            is concave like in our case, then l( · ) ≥ 0 which means that the variance is subtracted. This fact implies that the decision maker is risk averse.

In this section we assume that the insurer is risk averse and grades her random payoffs by taking the expectations of the exponential utility function of these random rewards. More precisely, we assume that the decision maker is equipped with the constant risk coefficient γ < 0. The objective of the risk averse insurer is to maximise the expected discounted payoff function:

Our discounted model with the exponential utility function reveals some kind of non-stationarity that is implied by a discount factor. Therefore, one can extend the state space in the following way 
                           
                              
                                 X

                              :
                              =
                              X
                              ×
                              I
                              ,
                           
                         with I ≔ [γ, 0) (cf. also Di Masi and Stettner, 2000; Bäuerle and Rieder, 2014). If the process is in the state (x, θ) and the insurer selects an action a ∈ A(x), then the probability of moving to a next state (x′, θ′) is q(x′|x, a), if θ′ = θβ and is 0, if 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ′
                              
                              ≠
                              θ
                              β
                           
                        . The second component of the state space keeps the track of the discount factor that changes over time in a deterministic way.

Furthermore, we can define an extended history-dependent policy

                              Theorem 3.1 was proved in the literature for the general state space, weakly continuous transition probabilities and bounded costs or rewards (Bäuerle and Rieder, 2014; Di Masi and Stettner, 2000). However, we deal with unbounded payoffs, therefore we have to truncate them at the level m and then let m tend to infinity. Such a procedure may have a meaning from the numerical point of view.

Let us now consider the policy π
                        + = (g, g…), where g(x) = x
                        + for every x ∈ X. Hence, this policy asks the insurer to pay out everything at each time point until ruin occurs. Denote by

                              Thus we have equality and, in particular, J(x − f*(x, θ), θ) = G(x − f*(x, θ), θβ), which implies that a = 0 minimises the expression eθaG(x − f*(x, θ) − a, θβ). We claim that a = 0 is the only minimiser of the above expression. Note that, if f*(x, θ) = x, then J(x − f*(x, θ), θ) = J(0, θ) and the result holds true. If, on the other hand, f*(x, θ) < x, then

                              . Now let x > ξ(θ). We know from Lemma 3.7 that f*(x − f*(x, θ), θ) = 0, which implies by definition of ξ(θ) that f*(x, θ) ≥ x − ξ(θ). On the other hand, by (3.9) we obtain that

Assume that the surplus process equals x
                              0 ∈ X. If x
                              0 ≥ 0, then either x

                              0 > ξ(γ). However, from Theorem 3.8 we know that in both cases the risk reserve (surplus) just after dividend payment is always less or equal to ξ(γ) ≤ ξ*. Therefore, the ruin will occur, if there appears a sequence of length ξ* + 1 of negative incomes. But the probability that such a sequence appears, equals

In the risk neutral dividend payout problem, the optimal policy is a stationary band-policy, i.e., it consists of the same band-function at all time points. The risk neutral problem can formally be obtained as a limit

                              . Hence, the exponential utility function only implies some kind of non-stationarity of the optimal policy and thus does not really make it necessary to consider history-dependent policies.

In this section we assume that the insurer is equipped with the power utility function Uγ
                     (x) = xγ
                     , where γ is a fixed number from the interval (0, 1).

Contrary to the exponential utility function, the power utility function reveals certain non-separability, that is implied by the fact that the expectation operator is only linear. Therefore, we again extend the state space by defining the new state space

                         (cf. Bäuerle and Rieder, 2014). In this case, the second component is responsible for the accumulated payoffs so far. If the process is in the state (x, y) and the insurer selects an action a ∈ A(x), then the probability of moving to a next state (x′, y′) is q(x′|x, a), if

                        . Hence, we can observe that the second component is again established in a deterministic way, but it differs from the previous case, since y′ depends on the action chosen by the insurer.

Let us define the feasible extended histories of the process up to the kth day as follows
                           1
                        
                        
                           1
                           We use the same symbol hk
                               as in the previous section to denote an extended feasible history of the process up to the kth day. But there is no confusion, since hk
                               in this subsection refers only to the power utility case. The same remark applies to the policy σ, the set Ξ and the functions J and Jπ

                              Consequently, w = J. Eq. (4.6) follows from (4.3) by letting n → ∞ and replacing the maximum with the limit.□

The counterpart of Theorem 4.2 is Theorem 4.1(a) in Bäuerle and Rieder (2014). However, again as in the exponential case this theorem was proved for general state space, weakly continuous transitions and bounded costs.

The next lemma provides the following bounds for the function J.

Note that in the case of a power utility, the optimal policy is history-dependent, but depends on the history only through the accumulated discounted dividends given by (yk

It is well-known that the logarithmic utility function U(x) = log (x) can be obtained as a limit from the power utility since

                              and we can follow the same line of analysis. It is worth mentioning that the power and logarithmic utility functions are examples of the so-called HARA (hyperbolic absolute risk aversion) utilities, whereas the exponential utility function belongs to the CARA (constant absolute risk aversion) class of utilities. The reader is referred, for instance, to Bäuerle and Rieder (2011); 2014), Çanakoğlu and Özekici (2010),Föllmer and Schied (2011) and references cited therein, for further properties of the aforementioned functions.

In this section we provide one numerical tool to solve these problems which is known under the name Howard policy improvement. We restrict the presentation here to the exponential utility function: Start with an arbitrary policy of the form π = (f( ·, γ), f( ·, γβ), …) induced by a decision rule f where we assume that f is such that f(x, θ) ≥ x − s* for all x > s* and all θ.

                                    The property of h shown in (b) now implies that ruin occurs with probability 1 under h and thus as in the proof of Theorem 3.11 we obtain with n → ∞ that Jf
                                     ≥ Jh

From the proof it follows that in case f ≠ h, the inequality Jh
                     (x, θ) ≤ Jf
                     (x, θ) is strict for at least one (x, θ). Now suppose no improvement is possible, i.e., h = f. Hence Jf
                      is another solution of (3.2). By Remark 3.2 
                     Jf
                      ≤ J. On the other hand by the definition of J we have Jf
                      ≥ J which implies J = Jf
                     .

Finally if the iteration does not stop we obtain a non-increasing sequence

In this paper, we study the discrete time problem, suggested by Gerber and Shiu (2004), of maximising the expected utility of discounted dividends until ruin. We restrict our attention to the integer-valued surplus process and to integer payments. To the best of our knowledge, the only paper that examines a similar issue (with the exponential utility) is Grandits et al. (2007), where the wealth of insurance company is driven by a Brownian motion with drift. However, the authors have not been able to solve the problem rigorously. Namely, assuming that a certain integral equation for the barrier function b(t) has a desirable solution (see Standing Assumption in Grandits et al., 2007), they prove that b(t) is indeed the barrier they search for (a barrier function is a band function with n = 0 in Definition 3.1). Moreover, the numerical experiments provided in Section 1.4 in Grandits et al. (2007) are given without their convergence proofs. This fact and the lack of a complete solution in continuous time and any solution in discrete time to Gerber and Shiu’s suggestion indicate that the problem is not straightforward from the mathematical point of view. Firstly, similar as in Bäuerle and Rieder (2014) and Grandits et al. (2007) we note that the optimal strategy is time dependent in a certain way. In order to get rid of non-stationarity we extend the state space to the two-dimensional space. Within such a new framework our problem becomes stationary. Secondly, since our dividend payments can be unbounded we cannot directly apply the results from Bäuerle and Rieder (2014) and Di Masi and Stettner (2000) to deduce that the value function satisfies the corresponding Bellman equation for the exponential and power utility functions. Nonetheless, we are able to show that in both cases the value iteration algorithm works (see Theorems 3.1 and 4.1) and in the exponential function case Howard’s policy improvement algorithm works (see Section 5). These facts, in turn, may have a significant meaning, when one thinks of numerical examples. Moreover, we are also able to describe the structure of optimal strategies for both utility cases and to prove for the exponential function case that the optimal policy is a band-policy.

Numerical experiments are difficult. Let us first recall that the maximisation of the expectation of discounted dividends in the model given by (2.1) with

                      was a challenging analytical problem. The reader may find the complete solution, for instance, in Morrill (1966), where it was shown that the optimal policy is of barrier type. Our problem, as already mentioned, is non-stationary and non-separable. Therefore, the methods that solved analytically the risk neutral problem are useless here. Moreover, as was noted by Gerber and Shiu (2004), in contrast to the risk neutral problem one can expect that in the model with exponential function the optimal policy is not of barrier type. This fact does not make easier potential calculations. Obviously, since obtaining an analytical solution is a challenge, one can think of numerical methods used in dynamic programming such as value iteration, policy improvement or others, see Powell (2011). However, our surplus process proceeds on the space

                     ) requires some truncation of the state space to a finite one in order to obtain numerical results. In addition, in this model we meet one more obstacle that has not been treated so far, namely the exponential and power utility functions that imply non-stationarity and non-separability. Therefore, the problem of calculating numerically optimal strategies and value functions for models with these or other utility functions is left open.
