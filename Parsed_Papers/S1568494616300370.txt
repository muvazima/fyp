                  This paper addresses the problem of speech enhancement and acoustic noise reduction by adaptive filtering algorithms. Recently, we have proposed a new Forward blind source separation algorithm that enhances very noisy speech signals with a subband approach. In this paper, we propose a new variable subband step-sizes algorithm that allows improving the previous algorithm behaviour when the number of subband is selected high. This new proposed algorithm is based on recursive formulas to compute the new variable step-sizes of the cross-coupling filters by using the decorrelation criterion between the estimated sub-signals at each subband output. This new algorithm has shown an important improvement in the steady state and the mean square error values. Along this paper, we present the obtained simulation results by the proposed algorithm that confirm its superiority in comparison with its original version that employs fixed step-sizes of the cross-coupling adaptive filters and with another fullband algorithm.
