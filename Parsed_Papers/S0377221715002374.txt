                  Facing severe budgetary constraints, public transport companies are forced to efficiently manage staff, one of the most expensive resources.
                  The driver rostering problem in a public transit company consists of defining rosters, that is, assigning daily crew duties to the company's drivers for a pre-defined time horizon, ensuring transport demand in a specific area, at low operating costs, while complying with legal restrictions and agreements between the company and the driver unions.
                  The objective of this paper is the study of mathematical models and optimization techniques that lead to new computational tools able to solve the bus driver rostering problem with days-off patterns by producing solutions that increase efficiency and reduce operating costs, while improving or maintaining the service quality and balancing the drivers’ workload.
                  Three mixed integer linear programming formulations are presented and compared from a theoretical point of view: an assignment/cover model, a multi-commodity flow model and a new multi-commodity flow/assignment model.
                  Based on a hierarchy of the decisions made during the resolution of the problem, a new decompose-and-fix heuristic is developed by exploring the underlying structure of the multi-commodity flow models. The heuristic solves the sequence of sub-problems identified by the hierarchy, while fixing or bounding the value of some variables to incorporate previous decisions.
                  Computational experiments were carried out with instances, derived from real world data and from benchmark data, characterized by a days-off pattern in use at two Portuguese public bus transport companies. Computational results confirm the good performance of the decompose-and-fix heuristic.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Public urban transport companies face an increasing burden regarding operating costs, being expenditure on staff the bulk of these costs. Efficient management of human resources is needed, in particular, regarding staff engaged to the driving of buses. Therefore, companies require the enhancing of techniques for planning bus drivers’ work.

The driver rostering problem in public transit companies aims at assigning daily crew duties to each driver defining a sequence of workdays and days-off which is the driver schedule to be in force during a rostering period of pre-determined length, the rostering horizon. A roster is the set of all driver schedules, together with the particular work shifts that drivers must work on. The rosters must comply with law, labor regulations and drivers’ union agreements, and also meet the demand for transport in specific urban areas. Such a problem is usually highly constrained and dependent on the particular contexts where it may arise.

We can step back until at least the sixties of the last century to find Operational Research studies on bus drivers scheduling and rostering (e.g. Bennett & Potts, 1968). Since then, a variety of surveys may be found, either on edited volumes of conferences or on specific papers that present methods and/or models for dealing with problems in specific cases, as surveyed by Ernst, Jiang, Krishnamoorty, Owens, and Sier (2004a); Ernst, Jiang, Krishnamoorty, and Sier (2004b). More recent publications include the survey by Van den Bergh, Beliën, De Bruecker, Demeulemeester, and De Boeck (2013), a reference model for timetabling and rostering proposed by Causmaecker and Berghe (2012), as well as, other works on rostering in different transport contexts. Lusby, Dohn, Range, and Larsen (2012) propose a column generation based heuristic to roster ground staff with days-off pattern for an airline company and Nishi, Sugiyama, and Inuiguchi (2014) solve a railway rostering problem in a cyclic context by a Benders decomposition algorithm. Xie, Kliewer, and Suhl (2012) integrate the cyclic crew scheduling and driver rostering problems and propose a multiobjective network problem solved with standard software followed by a simulating annealing for improvement on one of the objectives. Other relevant study for crew rostering in a cyclic environment is Hartog, Huisman, Abbink, and Kroon (2009) where a planning process uses integer linear programming models to build train driver rosters. Nurmi, Kyngäs, and Post (2011) propose a model that separately schedules days-off and shifts within a non-cyclic environment. The problem is solved with a population-based local search heuristic that is applied in a Finish bus transit company. Other studies involving population based heuristics (evolutionary or scatter search) are presented in Respício, Moz, and Pato (2013) for non-cyclic bus driver rostering, Burke et al. (2010) and Maenhout and Vanhoucke (2010) for airline rostering and Dornberger, Frey, and Hanne (2008) for railway rostering.

Multi-commodity multilayer network flow models have been widely used to describe rostering problems, e.g. Aronson (1986) and Aringhieri and Cordone (2004) for personnel rostering in general and Moz and Pato (2003) for nurses. As to the authors’ knowledge, the first formulation for bus driver rostering in a multilayer network is due to Carraresi and Gallo (1984). In transport contexts, several studies involving multi-commodity flow models were published, namely, the ones by Cappanera and Gallo (2004) for airline crew rostering and Xie and Suhl (2014) for cyclic and non-cyclic crew rostering problems in public bus transit.

The authors studied the bus driver rostering as a sub-problem of the integrated vehicle-crew-roster problem. Firstly, in Mesquita et al. (2011), a roster problem with no pre-defined pattern was addressed in the last step of a sequential algorithm. Later on, in Mesquita, Moz, Paias, and Pato (2013), a roster problem where drivers work according to a pre-defined days-off pattern was studied as a sub-problem of a Benders decomposition approach. Although good quality results have been attained for the integrated vehicle-crew-roster problem with days-off pattern, the rostering part revealed to be too CPU time consuming which pointed to deeply research on the rostering problem on its own.

In what follows, Section 2 presents the description of the bus driver rostering problem with days-off pattern (DRP). Section 3 is devoted to the theoretical complexity of the problem. In Section 4 three mixed integer linear programming formulations (MILP) are presented: an assignment/cover model, a multi-commodity flow model and a new multi-commodity flow/assignment model, the last two defined on multilayer networks. In Section 5 the linear relaxations of the models are studied with respect to the bounds they provide for the optimum value of DRP. Section 6 describes the new decompose-and-fix heuristic approach. Computational experience, carried out on a set of instances derived from real world and benchmark data, will be presented and commented in Section 7. Lastly, some conclusions will be drawn in Section 8.

In most public urban transport companies, drivers are divided into small groups depending on several factors like seniority, employment relationship with the company, and urban area to cover. The rostering for each group may stand on different strategies.

The problem here presented is devoted to the assignment of a set L of crew duties to a pool of |M| drivers who work according to a pre-defined days-off pattern without cyclic crew duty assignments, during a rostering horizon of |H| days.

The set of crew duties of day h ∈ H is denoted by Lh
                     , hence 
                        
                           L
                           =
                           
                              ⋃
                              
                                 h
                                 ∈
                                 H
                              
                           
                           
                              L
                              h
                           
                        
                     . Rosters must comply with internal norms of the companies, Labor Law and unions’ agreements. These requirements are related to the minimum number of weekly days-off that drivers must get; the minimum number of consecutive days-off; the number of days-off that must match with weekend days; the maximum number of consecutive workdays; and the number of hours that drivers must rest between two consecutive workdays. In order to meet the requirement on the number of rest hours between consecutive crew duties, set L is partitioned, according to the starting time, in two sets of crew duties: the set of early duties and the set of late duties. A driver cannot be assigned to an early duty if he worked a late duty the day before. Moreover, companies usually do not assign drivers to different duty types on consecutive days, therefore the sequence early-late is also considered infeasible. Furthermore, crew duties are classified according to their spread into short, normal and long. Normal duties correspond to working days with a spread that forces the inclusion of a break time for lunch but does not include overtime. Short crew duties have a shorter spread than normal duties since they allow the possibility of not including lunch time. Long duties have a longer spread than normal duties thus including overtime. The combination of these two classifications, which classifies a crew duty according to both the starting time and spread, defines the type of each crew duty.

The days-off pattern is defined by a set S of days-off schedules that may be represented by a 0-1 matrix (0 for a day-off, 1 for a workday), where each row corresponds to a weekday and each column to a feasible sequence of days-off and working periods, that is, a particular days-off schedule.

The days-off schedules defined in a rostering matrix 
                        
                           
                              [
                              
                                 a
                                 h
                                 s
                              
                              ]
                           
                           
                              h
                              ∈
                              H
                              ,
                              s
                              ∈
                              S
                           
                        
                      (
                        
                           
                              a
                              h
                              s
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                      if day h is a workday in schedule s and 0, otherwise) already satisfy some of the rostering constraints of the problem. These constraints are those related to the days-off and those that bound the number of consecutive workdays.

An example of such a 0-1 matrix is represented in Table 1
                      for the case of a rostering horizon of 49 days and a pattern that gives the distribution of days-off in each schedule. This table displays seven days-off schedules each of which comprising seven consecutive weeks of the rostering horizon beginning on a Monday. This particular case corresponds to a cyclic days-off pattern as the structure of days-off is repeated regularly. Although cyclic, this pattern does not require that crew duties are assigned to drivers on a cyclic basis. Each schedule consists of a sequence of working and rest periods, containing 1 week with 1 day-off, 5 weeks with 2 consecutive days-off and 1 week with 3 consecutive days-off. Every period of 3 consecutive days-off includes Saturday and Sunday and if it also includes a Friday then it will be followed by 5 consecutive workdays.

Although the example in Table 1 presents a cyclic days-off pattern, a rostering matrix 
                        
                           
                              [
                              
                                 a
                                 h
                                 s
                              
                              ]
                           
                           
                              h
                              ∈
                              H
                              ,
                              s
                              ∈
                              S
                           
                        
                      may also contain a non-cyclic days-off pattern. In fact, the referred matrix may contain any combination of 0-1 columns that define the set of feasible days-off schedules. A theoretical bound on the cardinal of S is given by 2|
                     
                        H
                     
                     |, however in practical situations the actual figure is significantly lower than 2|
                     
                        H
                     
                     |.

Considering a fixed pool of drivers, one of the objectives is to identify the workforce needed to operate the regular service of vehicles so as to keep some drivers available for occasional service or to substitute those absent. This is accomplished by assigning rostering costs per driver (rm
                     , ∀m).

Given a group of drivers, the corresponding rostering matrix, and a set of anonymous crew duties, the DRP aims at defining a minimum cost roster for the rostering horizon, where each driver is assigned to at most one days-off schedule, each crew duty is covered by exactly one driver, while ensuring the minimum rest periods between consecutive crew duties. Moreover, for a roster to be well accepted by the drivers of the company, it should provide a balanced distribution of the short and the long crew duties among the drivers.

The DRP is NP-hard. This may be proved by showing that there is a known NP-hard problem, the set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients, which is polynomially transformable to the DRP (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988). In the sequence, we will see that the DRP with cyclic days-off pattern is also NP-hard.

                        Proposition 1
                        
                           The DRP is NP-hard.

Let us consider instances of the rostering problem such that:

there are only normal early crew duties, thus there are neither constraints preventing non feasible sequences of crew duties, nor the terms on roster balancing in the objective function, hence the objective function only concerns to minimization of costs.

The problem defined as a result of the above particularizations (DRPart) aims at determining the minimum number of drivers to assign to schedules of S ensuring the covering of all crew duties. Given that the crew duties are all of the same type, one may assume without loss of generality that, on each day, crew duties can be arbitrarily assigned to drivers working according to a schedule that covers that day. Consequently, DRPart aims at determining the minimum number of schedules s ∈ S covering all crew duties, which corresponds to solve the generalized set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients:

As proved, the generalized set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients is polynomially transformable to the DRP. On the other hand, the generalized set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients has the set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients as a particular case, a well-known NP-hard problem (Garey & Johnson, 1979). Hence, any exact algorithm for DRP will solve the set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients which states the NP-hardness of DRP (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988).□

                           The DRP with cyclic days-off pattern is NP-hard.

                            are columns of a cyclic boolean matrix. The generalized set covering problem with equal objective function coefficients, and constraint matrix which columns are taken from a cyclic boolean matrix is the so-called cyclic scheduling problem. The cyclic scheduling problem was proved to be NP-hard by Bartholdi III (1981), hence the proposition holds.□

This section presents three mathematical formulations for DRP. It begins by a brief presentation of an assignment/covering model that directly uses the rostering matrix. Afterwards, to take advantage from network characteristics of the rostering problem, two multi-commodity network flow formulations are developed.

In all formulations, the objective function measures the quality of the solution in terms of driver costs, related to the drivers assigned to work and the respective salaries, as well as roster balancing.

An assignment/covering model has been used in Mesquita et al. (2013) to describe the rostering sub-problem within the integrated vehicle-crew-roster problem. The corresponding assignment variables can be aggregated insofar as crew duties of equal type are considered as homogeneous within this study. The characterization of crew duties in Section 2 defines six crew duty types: early short (ET), early normal (EN), early long (EO), late short (AT), late normal (AN) and late long crew duties (AO), respectively, t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Therefore, the model includes covering variables wms
                         = 1 if driver m is assigned to days-off schedule s or 0 otherwise; assignment variables 
                           
                              
                                 y
                                 
                                    t
                                    h
                                 
                                 m
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                         if driver m works a crew duty of type t on day h or 0 otherwise; and variables ηT
                         and ηO
                         to evenly distribute the short and long duties among the drivers. Concerning the parameters, the model includes: C
                        
                           th 
                         equal to the number of crew duties of type t to be covered on day h; rm
                        , the cost that penalizes the assignment of driver m to regular driving work, as described in Section 2. Moreover, parameters λT
                         and λO
                         are associated to variables ηT
                         and ηO
                        , respectively, with the aim of balancing the assignment of undesirable duties.

Constraints (AC1) state that each driver is assigned to one days-off schedule or is available for other service in the company. Equalities (AC2) impose that all crew duties of each type, in a solution, must be assigned to drivers. Constraints (AC3), where parameter

                         if h is a workday for schedule s, impose coherence between the assignment of a crew duty and the schedule assigned to each driver. Inequalities (AC5) forbid the sequence late-early duties to ensure that drivers rest a given minimum number of hours between consecutive duties. Furthermore, constraints (AC4) forbid the sequence early-late duties. Together, (AC4) and (AC5) impose a day-off period between changes of duty types. Inequalities (AC6) and (AC7) calculate, respectively, the maximum number of short and long duties assigned to a driver. Constraints (AC8), (AC9) and (AC10) define the domain of the variables. Constraints (AC6), (AC7), (AC8) and (AC10) along with the two last terms of the objective function ensure that variables ηT
                         and ηO
                         take non-negative integer values in the optimal solution. The theoretical dimension of AC is O(|M|(|S|+|H|)) for variables and O(|M||H|) for constraints.

In alternative to model AC one may consider two formulations, both based on a multilayer multi-commodity network.

Each layer of nodes, except the first and the last, represents a day of the rostering horizon, a day-layer. The first and the last layer of nodes contain an artificial origin node and an artificial terminal node, respectively. Each day-layer is composed by at most seven nodes, one representing the day-off  ‘duty’  (DO), and the remaining corresponding to crew duty types occurring on that day.

In accord with each pre-defined days-off schedule, there is an arc linking two day-layer nodes if the corresponding pair of crew duty types may be performed on consecutive days by some driver. There is also an arc from the origin to each node of day-layer 1 and from each node of the day-layer |H| to the terminal node. Furthermore, all nodes of a day-layer are linked to the day-off node of the next day-layer. A specific parameter is associated with each crew duty node, representing the number of crew duties of that type that must be assigned to drivers on that day. This parameter determines the amount of flow passing through that node and is equal to the capacity of the node. This parameter is not defined for day-off nodes.

A days-off schedule s in this network, satisfying the respective pattern of days-off, corresponds to a sub-network, linking the origin to the terminal node. Fig. 1
                         presents the first four day-layers for days-off schedule s2 and days-off schedule s4 described in Section 2.

The vertex set of the day-layer nodes V = {1, …, n, n + 1, …, n + |H|}, contains the nodes 1 to n, each one corresponding to a crew duty type occurring on a day (n ≤ 6|H|) and the nodes n + 1 to n + |H| corresponding to the day-off ‘duties’.

The arc set is represented by A. Each arc (i, j) of the network corresponds to a sequence identified by the crew duty types and days associated to nodes i and j, respectively. The sub-network corresponding to schedule s has arc set represented by As

In the first multi-commodity flow model, MF, a commodity corresponds to a pair (m, s), thus associating driver m to schedule s.

A feasible solution to the rostering problem is a |M×S|-commodity flow in this network from the origin to the terminal node that satisfies the conservation flow on the nodes for each commodity, that is, both for drivers and schedules, and the capacity of the nodes. All arcs starting at the origin node have associated costs to penalize the launching of a new driver on a schedule.

Model MF involves binary variables

                           where T is the set of short crew duty types, O is the set of long crew duty types, along the rostering horizon, and Cj
                            is the capacity of node j (the number of crew duties of the corresponding type to be performed by drivers of the company).

Inequations (MF1) state that each driver is assigned to at most one schedule. Equations (MF2) ensure that the number of drivers assigned to a node is equal to the capacity of that node. Equations (MF3) are flow conservation constraints on nodes for drivers and schedules. Inequations (MF4)/(MF5) calculate the maximum number of short/long duties assigned to a driver. Constraints (MF6) and (MF7) define the domain of the variables. The theoretical dimension of MF is O(|M||S||H|) both for variables and constraints, since crew duties are aggregated by type.

In alternative to model MF, one may consider another model with fewer commodities. For this new model, denoted by MFA, each commodity corresponds to a days-off schedule. Hence, there are only |S| commodities and the flow of commodity s in the network defines the number of drivers working on days-off schedule s.

A feasible solution to the rostering problem is a |S|-commodity flow from the origin node 0 to the destination, node n + |H| + 1, that satisfies flow conservation for schedules on the nodes, and the capacity of each node. The flows of the |S| commodities are integer valued and each flow unit, from node 0 to node n + |H| + 1, is assigned to a specific driver. Consequently, two types of variables are needed, beyond the above defined ηT

For each node  j ∈ {1, …, n}, constraints (MFA1) state that the total inflow is equal to the number of drivers that must be assigned to the crew duty type represented by the node. (MFA2) are flow conservation constraints for the commodities. (MFA3) link variables f and z, ensuring that, for each node in

                            the inflow of commodity s is equal to the number of drivers assigned to that node and working according to schedule s. Constraints (MFA3′) link the same type of variables corresponding to node 0. Constraints (MFA4) state that, if a driver is assigned to node i in schedule s then he is also assigned to a successor of node i on the same schedule. Constraint set (MFA5) imposes that, for each schedule, a driver is assigned to the same number of nodes in each day-layer. That is, if he is assigned to schedule s at node 0 then he will be assigned to exactly one node, in schedule s, in each day-layer. It follows that, (MFA6) along with (MFA4) and (MFA5) guarantee that each driver is assigned to at most one schedule. Moreover, a driver working in the rostering horizon performs exactly one crew duty in each day-layer. Due to the minimization objective, a driver is assigned to a schedule if he covers at least one crew duty in the rostering horizon. Finally, inequalities (MFA7)/(MFA8) calculate the maximum number of short/long duties assigned to a driver and constraints (MFA9), (MFA10) and (MFA11) define the domain of the variables. As for MF, the theoretical dimension of MFA is O(|M||S||H|) both for variables and constraints.

Since x satisfies constraints (MF2), then by (5.2) y satisfies (AC2).

Since x satisfies constraints (MF3), then (w, y) satisfies (AC3), (AC4), (AC5) by the design of the network. In fact, (MF3) imposes the conservation flow on node j for each pair (m, s) and for all node j of V. Therefore, if driver m enters node j by schedule s, then he leaves node j by the same schedule. Since node j corresponds to a crew duty type on a day h this is equivalent to (AC3). Moreover, as there are only arcs linking pairs of nodes corresponding to crew duties which may be performed on consecutive days by the same driver, constraints (AC4) and (AC5) are also satisfied.

As t =1 and t = 4 refers to short crew duty types, constraints (MF4) can be rewritten by separating the first term per days, thus obtaining the inequalities

To prove that (z, f, η) is a feasible solution of 
                        
                           MFA
                           ¯
                        
                      we must prove that it satisfies constraints (MFA1) to (MFA8), (
                        
                           
                              MFA
                              9
                           
                           ¯
                        
                     ), (
                        
                           
                              MFA
                              10
                           
                           ¯
                        
                     ) and (MFA11).

The proof respecting (MFA11) follows immediately, because the variables ηT
                      and ηO
                      take the same values in both solutions and (MF7) holds for (x, η).

By (5.4) and since the solution component x satisfies (MF2) then f satisfies (MFA1).

Summing constraints (MF3) in m we obtain

                      this inequality and applying (5.3) we obtain (MFA4).

By aggregating constraints (MF3) for the duty types of each day and taking into account (5.3), one proves that z satisfies (MFA5).

If x satisfies MF1, then z defined by (5.3) in the case of i= 0 satisfies (MFA6).

Considering relations (5.3) and (5.5) one has

                     . But, also by (MFA5), the sum of work assignments of driver m in all the crew duty types in schedule s on a specific day is equal to the respective sum on the following day. Therefore the sum of each driver work assignments is always less than or equal to one on every day, from day 2 to the last day of the rostering horizon, thus proving that

                     Propositions 3 and 4 point to a better performance of a MILP solver based on the multi-commodity flow models as compared with AC due to the non-inferior quality of the respective linear relaxation lower bound. The proof of Proposition 4 shows that, in general, the number of feasible solutions of 
                        
                           MFA
                           ¯
                        
                      is less than the number of feasible solutions of 
                        
                           MF
                           ¯
                        
                     
                     . This suggests an eventual better performance of a MILP solver based on model MFA.
                  

All mathematical models proposed in this study involve a large number of integer variables and a significant dual degenerescence. Consequently, the use of a generic MILP solver will consume a great amount of computing resources often stopping out of memory without finding any feasible solution. Therefore, heuristic methods are developed by taking into account the structure of the mathematical models and the potentialities of the MILP solver. MILP-based heuristics have been developed for difficult ILP or MILP problems as seen in Wolsey (1998).

As suggested in Mesquita et al. (2013), to solve model AC, at the root node of the branch-and-bound algorithm, we analyze the linear relaxation solution and fix to 1 the value of decision variables which are most likely to take value 1 in the rostering integer optimal solution. Branching is performed over y variables, while fixing to 1 the values of variables such that 
                        
                           
                              y
                              
                                 t
                                 h
                              
                              m
                           
                           ≥
                           0.85
                        
                     . This fix-and-branch-and-bound heuristic will be further denoted by F&BB.

Preliminary computational results showed that, for MF and MFA models, the majority of the variables attained values less than 0.5 in the optimal solution of the respective linear relaxation. Thus, a procedure similar to the one adopted for AC is no longer appropriate, as one may see in Appendix A, where F&BB designed for MF and MFA, as well as the respective results obtained from a set of instances are presented. Alternatively, by exploring the underlying multi-commodity flow structure, we propose a decompose-and-fix heuristic (D&F). The basic idea of this heuristic is to identify in a mathematical formulation a set of sub-problems to be solved sequentially.

In general, the definition of the sub-problems is based on a hierarchic ordering of the decisions that are involved in the resolution of the original problem. At each level of the hierarchy, the decisions are taken assuming that the previous levels’ decisions have already been made. Consequently, decisions of one level will constrain decisions of the subsequent levels, and there is no guarantee of attaining a feasible solution to each sub-problem. However, as we will show below, one may devise a suitable choice of sub-problems for DRP whose resolution leads to a feasible solution, if one exists. In DRP we can define the following hierarchy of decisions, each one related to a step of the decompose-and-fix heuristic:

                        
                           -
                           determine a set of active days-off schedules;

assign drivers to the active days-off schedules;

assign crew duty types per day to drivers.

D&F will be first explained in detail for the MFA model and summarized in Fig. 3. Concerning MFA, the set of integer variables may be, naturally, partitioned into three subsets:

                                 0
                                 
                                    m
                                    s
                                 
                              
                              )

                           )
                        
                     . Variables f, z
                     0 and z determine, respectively, the set of active days-off schedules that will cover all crew duties, the assignment of each driver to a specific days-off schedule and the sequence of crew duty types each driver will perform during the rostering horizon. Each one of these subsets of variables induces a different combinatorial structure associated with specific constraints included in MFA, defining the sub-problems MFAF, MFAZ0 and MFAR. D&F heuristic is based on the sequential resolution of these sub-problems, while fixing or bounding the value of some variables to incorporate previous decisions. In Step 1, to obtain a set of active days-off schedules, constraints (MFA3) to (MFA8) are relaxed and one solves the multi-commodity network flow problem MFAF defined by:

The optimal solution of MFAF, f *, is an integer flow that covers all crew duties. In f
                           * each unit of a commodity flowing from the origin to the destination determines the use of a days-off schedule by a driver. Although MFAF has no longer variables z, a feasible solution to MFA may be built from f * by assigning each unit of flow to a driver. Hence,

                        Lemma 2
                        
                           The optimal value of MFAZ0 is lower or equal to the optimal value of MFA.

A feasible solution to MFA can be built from the optimal solution of MFAZ0. In f
                           * each unit of flow defines a path from node 0 to node n + |H| + 1 that covers exactly one node in each day layer. Since the flow satisfies the capacity constraints on each node, one can build a feasible solution to MFA by assigning, at each node, exactly one crew duty to each unit of flow. In addition the two variables ηT, ηO
                            are set equal to the minimum value large enough to satisfy (MFA7) and (MFA8). Although feasible, this solution is unaware of workload balancing.

Moreover, the objective function of MFA has two non-negative components, one representing salary costs and the other workload balancing. By solving MFAZ0 after MFAF, one can see that the optimal value of MFAZ0 is the minimum value for the first component of MFA objective function (salary costs component). Hence, one has

                     * may be selected at Step 3.

Concerning model MF, taking into account (5.4), Step 1 and Step 2 of the D&F heuristic are performed in a similar way as D&F for MFA. Concerning Step 3, a branch-and-bound algorithm is applied to the resulting restricted multi-commodity network flow model, MFR, within a pre-defined time limit.

An alternative decompose-and-fix heuristic, denoted by D&Fa, is described in Appendix. Although Step 1 is equal in D&F and D&Fa, some features of the D&F Step 3 are moved to Step 2 of D&Fa. In this heuristic, based on the optimal solution of the multi-commodity network flow sub-problem MFAF, variable fixing is only performed at Step 2 to assign drivers as well as crew duty types to schedules.

The three different models were tested with instances derived from real world data and from benchmark data. More precisely, we have compared the LP relaxation solutions and also the feasible solutions obtained by the heuristics. All the algorithms were coded in C using the CPLEX Optimization Studio Academic Research 12.5 library and ran on an Intel® Core™ i7-2620M CPU 2.70 gigahertz RAM 8.00 gigahertz. The time limit for the branch-and-bound was set to 10,800 seconds.

Although the main objective of this section is to address the specific situation that arises at two bus transit companies in Portugal it is also important to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models and heuristics under different conditions for benchmark data. The real instances were derived from urban bus services operating in the city of Lisboa, instances L1 to L10, and in the city of Porto, instances P1 to P6, and were designed to cover the service of buses with two types of demand for timetabled trips, one for Monday through Friday and the other for weekend days. As for benchmark data instances, we considered the set of 10 instances trips200Axx.txt, involving four depots and available at http://people.few.eur.nl/huisman/instances.html for the multiple-depot vehicle and crew scheduling problem. Each file tripsxxxAxx.txt gives the daily timetabled trips for Monday through Friday, being the weekend trips randomly selected, with probability 0.4, from the respective non-weekend daily trip set. For both real and benchmark data instances, the set of crew duties is obtained by solving an integrated vehicle and crew scheduling problem. For more details see Mesquita and Paias (2008) and Mesquita et al. (2013).

For all instances tested the roster time horizon is 49 days and the days-off pattern adopted is the cyclic one described in Table 1 which is in use at the two Portuguese companies for a group of drivers.

For each instance the set of crew duties L is partitioned in two sets of two different crew duty types: the set of early duties, those that start before 3:30 p.m. and the set of late duties that start after 3:30 p.m. The set of crew duties is also partitioned according to their maximum spread: short crew duties have a maximum spread of 5 hours and do not include a lunch break, normal duties have a spread that ranges from 5 to 9 hours and long duties, from 9 to 10.75 hours, thus including overtime. In Table 2
                        , we characterize the test instances concerning the number of crew duties, the number of short, normal and long duties, as well as, the number of early and late duties.
                     

The rostering parameters used to balance the different components of the objective function were set to rm
                         = 5,  λT
                         = 0.5, λO
                         = 1. Such choice of parameters is explained by the priority given by management to the goal of minimizing the number of drivers. Besides, minimizing the number of long duties is more relevant than minimizing the number of short duties due to overtime costs incurred by long duties. Note that, these instances are cyclic with respect to the days-off, have equal costs for all drivers and have more than one type of crew duties.

In this section we compare, from a computational point of view, lower bounds given by LP relaxations and upper bounds obtained with the heuristics designed for the three mathematical models AC, MF and MFA.


                        Tables 3–5
                        
                         report the bounds obtained and the corresponding CPU time. The first column gives the instance name and the second column defines the rows to display the results from each mathematical model. Columns 3 and 4 present, respectively, the optimal value of the LP relaxation of each model and the CPU time, in seconds, needed to obtain it. Columns 5 and 6 give the results of Step 1 of the decompose-and-fix algorithm. They show, respectively, the value of the optimal flow, which corresponds to the minimum number of drivers required to accomplish all daily crew duties (#drivers), and the CPU time, in seconds, spent in Step 1. Step 2 is related to the assignment of drivers to schedules. The time spent in this step is 0 seconds on average so it is not presented. Columns 7 and 8 display, respectively, the optimal value of the LP relaxation at the root node (v(sol)) and the CPU time spent to obtain it, in Step 3 of the decompose-and-fix algorithm. Columns 9–13 show the best feasible solution attained by the branch-and-bound: the value of the best feasible solution (UB), the number of drivers it includes (#drivers), the maximum number of short (deltaS) and long (deltaL) duties assigned to a driver and the CPU time consumed. The two last columns display the gap (gap = (UB − lb)/lb) and the total CPU time in seconds.

For this test set, the lower bounds given by the LP relaxations of the three models are similar. The LP relaxation lower bound of MF or MFA (equal by Proposition 4) strictly outperforms the correspondent bound obtained from AC for four instances (L1, L2, L6 and P1). As to the CPU time to attain the lower bounds, on average, AC has the smallest value.

Comparing the optimal values of the LP relaxation for the multi-commodity flow models (column 3) with v(sol) that corresponds to the LP relaxation of MFAR (column 7), we note that on average the absolute value of the difference between these bounds is 3.0 for L-instances, 4.5 for P-instances and 3.4 for H-instances, being the maximum difference 4.9 for L7, 5.3 for P2 and 5.7 for H4. To assess whether these differences are significant, we computed (v(sol) − lb)/lb and obtained, on average, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.01, respectively, for L-instances, P-instances and H-instances. Moreover, worst case values are 0.02, 0.04, 0.02 attained, respectively, by L2, P1, and H4. These small differences suggest that fixing some drivers to schedules, in Step 2, may not affect the quality of the upper bounds achieved in Step 3.

The quality of the heuristic solutions may be evaluated by the gap in column 14. Although the gap values are very similar, analyzing the upper bounds we may conclude that for the L-instances, D&F for MF and for MFA attained better results than F&BB in 50 percent of the instances, and the same bound in the remaining 50 percent. For the P-instances the results obtained from the three models were similar, except for P5 and P6, where D&F for MFA gave the worst upper bound. In the case of the H-instances, F&BB performed worse for three instances (H2, H3 and H6) and for the remaining seven the results were similar to those of D&F.

From the point of view of the companies it is important to analyze the number of drivers required and the type of duties assigned to each driver. For all instances, the number of available drivers, |M|, was enough to cover the demand. Except for one test instance (P5 in the case of MFA), the number of drivers given by the best solution of the heuristics is equal to the minimum number of drivers required. Concerning the long duties, D&F performed, on average, better than or equal to F&BB. For short duties D&F for MFA performed worse in only one instance (P6).

Additionally, given the number of drivers assigned to work, trivial lower bounds can be computed respectively for the maximum number of short (long) duties assigned to a driver. A lower bound for the ηT
                         (ηO
                        ) value may be calculated by dividing the total number of short (long) duties, presented in Table 2, by the number of drivers assigned to work and rounding up. Comparing ηT
                         (ηO
                        ) values obtained by the D&F heuristic with the corresponding trivial lower bounds, one may conclude that the heuristic attained these lower bounds for all instances for the MF model and for all except one (P6) for the MFA model.

As to the CPU time consumed by the branch-and-bound, F&BB attained the time limit for 21 out of the 26 instances tested, and the shortest time in three of the remaining five. D&F stopped in the time limit for one instance (P6). Moreover D&F for MFA spent the shortest time for 22 out of the 26 instances, while D&F for MF spent the shortest time for one out of the 26.

The quality of LP relaxation bounds apparently does not influence the CPU time of the branch-and-bound neither the quality of the final feasible solutions obtained. In fact, for the reported four cases where the LP relaxation lower bound of MF or MFA strictly outperforms the correspondent bound obtained from AC, the final feasible solutions were the same except for one case. Additionally, for instance L8 the lower bounds given by LP relaxation of AC, MF and MFA are equal, as for the upper bounds, they are equal but the CPU time is much higher in the case of AC. In general, for these test instances, the lower and upper bounds obtained from AC, MF and MFA models are very similar. However, concerning CPU time, by exploiting the underlying network structure of MF and MFA, D&F highly outperformed F&BB. In particular, D&F for MFA showed the best performance, concerning the CPU time and the lower bounds, and a performance slightly worse than D&F for MF regarding upper bounds.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper proposes two multi-commodity flow models, MF and MFA, for the driver rostering problem with days-off patterns and without cyclic crew duty assignments. Theoretical properties of the problem and of the models have been studied. The underlying network structure of MF and MFA suggested a decompose-and-fix heuristic to solve the rostering problem. The basic idea of this heuristic is to identify in a mathematical formulation a set of sub-problems to be solved according to a hierarchic ordering of the decisions that are involved in the resolution of the original problem.

A computational experiment was performed with instances built from data of bus transit companies and from benchmark data. The computational results showed the good performance of the heuristic, regarding both the quality of the upper bounds and the computing time needed to obtain them.

The current research may provide a useful tool to help planning departments of bus transit companies when preparing rostering for drivers. Although the experiments were carried out considering the specific rules of the bus companies, the models are general and suitable for different practical situations and different cyclic or non-cyclic patterns of days-off schedules.

Moreover, the decompose-and-fix approach can be included in an integrated crew-rostering or vehicle-crew-rostering system or else be adapted to solve rostering problems arising in operational contexts other than public transit companies.

The theoretical comparisons presented in Section 5, concerning the lower bounds obtained from the LP relaxation of AC, MF and MFA, suggested that a F&BB heuristic adapted to MF or MFA could perform better than with AC. However, for MFA, as for MF, we noticed that the majority of the variables take value less than 0.5 in the optimal LP relaxation solution making it difficult to fix to 1 the value of some decision variables. Taking into account the results obtained with the F&BB heuristic for AC and the hierarchy of decisions to solve DRP, stated in Section 6, we want to simultaneously determine a set of active days-off schedules and to assign drivers to these active days-off schedules based on the optimal LP relaxation solution of MF (MFA).

Step 2 considers the restricted problem resulting from Step 1 and branches over variables x in case of MF or over variables z in case of MFA.

Computational results for the set of L-instances are presented in Table A1, columns 1–9. A time limit of 10,800 seconds was imposed to stop the branch-and-bound. Whenever this time limit was reached, the best feasible solution, if one exists, was adopted. The results obtained are detailed in columns 4–7, which follow the same notation as in Tables 1–5 (Section 7). Concerning the UB and the CPU time one can see that regarding MF and MFA no significant improvements were achieved while compared to AC. In fact, F&BB for MF and MFA, only performed better than F&BB for AC with instances L3, L4, L5 and MF had the best performance with L6. Moreover, neither F&BB for MF nor F&BB for MFA found a feasible solution for L9 in 10,800 seconds. As to the CPU, F&BB for MF and MFA performed better than for AC only for instances L1 and L2.

Comparing the results of this heuristic with the ones obtained from D&F, we noticed an excess of computing time as a consequence of much less variable fixing.
                  

In alternative to the above F&BB and to the D&F presented in Section 6 we have considered a different decompose-and-fix heuristic (D&Fa), described below for model MFA. Step 1 of D&Fa is equal to Step 1 of D&F. Let f
                     * denote the optimal solution of MFAF and S
                     * the set of days-off schedules induced by f
                     *.

                     . This corresponds to fixing the subset of schedules from S
                     * that cover each crew duty type (excluding days-off) in each day.

Finally, Step 3 assigns crew duties to drivers, taking into account the decisions made on Steps 1 and 2. It solves problem MFARZ which results from MFA by fixing variables

                      and 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              m
                           
                           
                              z
                              j
                              
                                 m
                                 s
                              
                           
                        
                      as set in Step 2. Note that, some features of Step 3 in D&F heuristic are moved to Step 2 in D&Fa. In fact, in D&Fa Step 2, the assignment of crew duties to schedules depends on the optimal solution of the multi-commodity network flow sub-problem MFAF. Afterwards, in Step 3, the assignment of drivers to specific crews is constrained by the variable fixing of previous step, whereas in D&F this assignment is decided only in Step 3, after fixing some variables 
                        
                           z
                           i
                           
                              m
                              s
                           
                        
                      at the root node. The D&Fa heuristic is summarized in Fig. A1.

Computational results are presented in Table A1, columns 1–3 and 10, 11.

Columns 10 and 11 concern Step 3 of D&Fa. They present, respectively, the optimal solution value of the LP relaxation, in the root node of the branch-and-bound, and the CPU time needed to obtain it. Comparing the values in column 10 with the UB given by the D&F heuristic for the corresponding instances (Table 3) we realize that, with the D&Fa approach, it was impossible to improve, or even to obtain, the UB given by D&F. This suggests that the assignment of crew duties to drivers, in Step 3, is hardly constrained by the previous variable fixing thus resulting in less balanced solutions.
