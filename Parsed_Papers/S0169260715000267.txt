                  A normal cardiac activation starts in the sinoatrial node and then spreads throughout the atrial myocardium, thus defining the P-wave of the electrocardiogram. However, when the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) approximates, a highly disturbed electrical activity occurs within the atria, thus provoking fragmented and eventually longer P-waves. Although this altered atrial conduction has been successfully quantified just before PAF onset from the signal-averaged P-wave spectral analysis, its evolution during the hours preceding the arrhythmia has not been assessed yet. This work focuses on quantifying the P-wave spectral content variability over the 2h preceding PAF onset with the aim of anticipating as much as possible the arrhythmic episode envision. For that purpose, the time course of several metrics estimating absolute energy and ratios of high- to low-frequency power in different bands between 20 and 200Hz has been computed from the P-wave autoregressive spectral estimation. All the analyzed metrics showed an increasing variability trend as PAF onset approximated, providing the P-wave high-frequency energy (between 80 and 150Hz) a diagnostic accuracy around 80% to discern between healthy subjects, patients far from PAF and patients less than 1h close to a PAF episode. This discriminant power was similar to that provided by the most classical time-domain approach, i.e., the P-wave duration. Furthermore, the linear combination of both metrics improved the diagnostic accuracy up to 88.07%, thus constituting a reliable noninvasive harbinger of PAF onset with a reasonable anticipation. The information provided by this methodology could be very useful in clinical practice either to optimize the antiarrhythmic treatment in patients at high-risk of PAF onset and to limit drug administration in low risk patients.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, increasing its incidence with age [1]. It may appear as paroxysmal AF (PAF), featuring arrhythmic sequences that terminate spontaneously after some seconds, minutes, hours or even days. In contrast, persistent AF requires medical intervention for its termination, whereas permanent AF cannot be reverted back to sinus rhythm or its termination is not recommended [2]. Nowadays, it is well-known that AF provokes electrophysiological changes within the atria, such as electrical, contractile and structural remodeling, that reduce the probability of its termination [1,3]. Indeed, approximately between 15 and 31% of PAF patients progress to persistent or permanent AF during a time period between 4 and 8 years [4]. Although AF is not a rapidly lethal disease, it can involve very disabling complications, such as cardiac failure and atrial thrombosis, with the subsequent risk of a stroke [1,5]. Hence, once a PAF episode terminates spontaneously, the early prediction of the next episode onset is a relevant clinical challenge. In fact, a wide variety of works have tried to predict the onset of PAF from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), because it provides a non-invasive and low-cost approach to study the heart function. To this respect, the early use of pacing and drug treatments may prevent the recurrence of a new PAF episode, thus yielding electrical stabilization and avoiding that PAF degenerates into permanent AF [1,4].

A normal cardiac activation starts in the sinoatrial node and then spreads throughout the atrial myocardium, thus defining the P-wave in the ECG [6]. Given that P-wave morphology may change when the atrial depolarization wavefront spreads in an abnormal way and/or presents accessory pathways, reentries or conduction delays [7], its noninvasive analysis has received great attention in recent years. Indeed, P-wave duration is today accepted as the most reliable noninvasive marker for atrial conduction characterization. Its prolongation has been associated with history of AF [8], development of arrhythmias after bypass surgery [9] and progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF [10]. However, it is worth noting that the P-wave prolongation is attributed to atrial structural remodeling rather than on AF itself. Indeed, previous works have shown that patients with lone PAF failed to demonstrate any remarkable P-wave prolongation [11]. Similarly, P-wave duration has not been predictive of new-onset AF in patients with congestive heart failure [12]. Therefore, this electrophysiological alteration has not been considered as an unavoidable requirement for AF development [13].

Within this context, several authors have studied different morphological aspects of the P-wave to quantify additional atrial conduction disturbances. Thus, the P-wave morphology has been characterized from its singular value [14] and wavelet [15] decomposition or by its hidden Markov [16], Gaussian [17] and high-order polynomial [18] modeling. Nonetheless, the P-wave spectral content estimation has proven to be an extremely easy and useful way to quantify atrial properties alteration [19,20]. Indeed, previous works have revealed that P-waves before the onset of PAF contain more high-frequency energy than normal ones [19,20]. Additionally, P-wave spectral analysis has been able to discern between PAF patients and healthy subjects from the sinus rhythm ECG [19,21–23], quantify the effect of low dose sotalol in PAF patients [24] and stratify the recurrence risk of arrhythmic episodes over a time period of one year in PAF patients [15]. However, it has to be remarked that all these approaches have required signal-averaged ECG recordings in order to avoid the background noise effect [25], thus hindering the possibility of quantifying the P-wave morphology variability over time.

Although not completely understood, the transition from sinus rhythm to AF is often associated with progressive atrial electrophysiological alterations that may cause discontinuous propagation of sinus impulses [26]. Such increasing abnormalities result in a nonuniform and anisotropic atrial conduction, which is thought to play a major role in the initiation of reentry and, therefore, in the onset of PAF [26]. This uncoordinated atrial activity reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node and can be conducted to the ventricles, thus leading to a fast and irregular heart rate [1]. Taking advantage of this heart rate alteration, some authors have tried to predict with some time in advance the onset of PAF. Thus, several methods estimating time, frequency and complexity features of the RR series can be found in the literature [27–29]. However, they have only shown ability to reveal changes few minutes prior to the onset of PAF. Another drawback of these schemes is their need of complex RR series parameters combinations to predict successfully the onset of PAF, thus blurring the clinical meaning of each single parameter within the classification approach. Similarly, the identification of a high number of premature atrial complexes in the ECG has proven to be a good predictor of imminent PAF onset [30]. However, it has also been reported that the presence of these ectopic beats decreases considerably as the distance to the PAF onset increases [27]. Hence, the prediction is only feasible few minutes before the arrhythmia starts, thus turning unachievable the application of any efficient prophylactic therapy [31].

In contrast to all the aforesaid works, the P-wave duration variability analysis over time has proved a significant ability to quantify atrial electrophysiological alterations up to one hour preceding the onset of PAF [32]. Thus, the hypothesis of the present study is that the P-wave spectral characterization variability over time could provide clinically relevant and new information about the onset of AF. Hence, the present study focuses on quantifying the P-wave spectral variability during the 2h preceding the onset of PAF from single-lead ECG recordings. This analysis represents an initial step in the global aim to determine the earliest reliable anticipation able to predict the onset of a PAF episode through the noninvasive study of atrial electrical activity.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this retrospective study, 46 patients suffering from idiopathic PAF were analyzed. None of them were under antiarrhythmic drug treatment at the time of the study and suffered from heart disease, hyperthyroidism or pulmonary disease. Moreover, echocardiographic analysis proved that any patient enrolled in the study had atrial enlargement, such as Table 1
                         shows. From the 24-h Holter ECG recording of each patient, expert cardiologists annotated AF episodes, defined by irregular ventricular response and absence of P waves [33]. The number of arrhythmic events per patient was 2.9±1.8 in mean, with an average duration of 4.1±2.2h. The mean duration of the normal sinus rhythm intervals among arrhythmic episodes was 5.87±3.42h. From each patient, the longest sinus rhythm interval in the recording was selected and the 2h segment preceding the onset of PAF were analyzed. To evaluate the proposed method ability in characterizing the P-wave spectral content variability over time, the interval under study was divided into two one hour-length segments. The first set of segments comprised the hour immediately before the onset of PAF, which will be referred as ECG segments close to PAF. The second set comprised those segments one hour away from the episode and will be named as ECG segments far from PAF. On the other hand, 53 healthy volunteers, without previous history of arrhythmia or structural heart disease were used as a control set. To avoid possible confounding effects in the study, these healthy individuals were age-, gender-, and heart rate-matched to the PAF patients (see Table 1). An ECG segment of one hour in length was randomly chosen from the Holter recording of every healthy subject. Finally, the study was granted ethical approval by the Hospital Ethics Committee (RC-2011-25) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Following previous recommendations about time and amplitude resolutions for the appropriate P-wave analysis [34], the Holter recordings were acquired with a sampling rate of 1000Hz and 16-bit resolution over an amplitude range of ±10mV. Moreover, although three leads (II, aVF and V1) were recorded, only V1 was considered in the study because the P-waves were larger in this lead.

On the other hand, the lack of a standard definition of the P-wave onset and offset motivated the use of an automatic delineator based on the phasor transform to determine its fiducial points [16,35]. This algorithm has been validated making use of databases manually annotated by expert cardiologists, providing a sensitivity of 99.27% and a positive predictivity of 98.75% in the P-wave detection. Furthermore, the algorithm is able to delineate the P-wave with notably reduced location errors. Indeed, even in the presence of noise provoking a remarkable P-wave distortion, the delineator provided location errors lower than 8 ms [35]. Briefly, the algorithm first preprocesses the original ECG (y(n)) by applying a forward/backward filtering strategy to remove the baseline wander, high-frequency noise and power-line interference. This type of bidirectional filtering has proven to preserve the P-wave fiducial points [16,36]. Next, each instantaneous ECG sample (
                           
                              y

                           )
                        ) is converted into a phasor with magnitude M(n) and phase φ(n), such that

                           {

                        . Given that the maximum instantaneous phase variation in the ECG is found on the QRS complexes, these waves were located as the segments exceeding a threshold in φ(n). Next, the corresponding R-peak was marked as the maximum magnitude point within the segment. Thereafter, an adaptive windowing, relative to the R-peak position, was used to detect the presence of the P-wave in each beat. When a P-wave was found, the P-peak was marked as the maximum value within the seek window. Around this peak, two 75 ms windows were established and the local minima within them, detected by the first derivate of φ(n), were provided as the P-wave onset (n

                        L being its total length in samples. Obviously, this index will be slightly different for every P-wave, because each one will have a different length. Finally, a baseline was constructed by linear interpolation between the amplitudes at inception and termination of the P-wave and was removed by subtraction. After this processing, the P-wave is referred to as 
                           
                              w

                           )
                        . More details on the algorithm can be found in [35].

It is interesting to note that the delineator has the ability to deal with ectopic beats in the same way as with normal beats [35]. Therefore, the P-wave fiducial points originated from atrial and ventricular premature complexes can be automatically detected without any additional requirement. However, the method cannot determine whether a P-wave is distorted or not, thus providing its fiducial points in any case [35]. In order to prevent the presence of distorted P-waves in later steps of the study, their detection and delineation was visually supervised by expert cardiologists. In this process, P-waves masked by the end of the preceding T-wave or presenting an unrecognizable morphology due to overlapped noise were discarded. Nonetheless, it has to be remarked that less than 4% of all the analyzed P-waves were finally removed.

When a high-resolution spectrum is desired and only a short-duration signal is available, e.g. a P-wave, parametric approaches provide a better alternative to those based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for power spectral estimation [37]. These methods are based on modeling a data sequence as the output of a linear system characterized by a rational system. In fact, the spectral estimation procedure consists of two steps: the method's parameters are first estimated and then the power spectral density (PSD) is computed from these estimates. The autoregressive (AR) method is the most frequently used model-based method, because the estimation of AR parameters can be done easily by solving linear equations [38]. In the AR method, data can be modeled as the output of a causal, all-pole, discrete filter whose input is white noise. Hence, the m-order AR model for a P-wave can be expressed as [38]

                         must be found. For this purpose, many different techniques have been proposed, such as Yule-Walker or Least Squares (LS) methods. The first algorithm is based on creating a biased estimate of the signal's autocorrelation function and solving the least squares minimization of the forward prediction error, thus being complex and presenting a high computational burden [38]. Moreover, it is well known that the performance of this approach worsens as the number of samples decreases [39]. In contrast, the LS method has been found to be more accurate than the Yule-Walker's because its estimated parameters are closer to the true values [38]. However, the lack of guaranteed stability is a significant drawback for the LS method [38]. In contrast to these two algorithms, other recursive proposals, such as the Burg's method, avoid calculating the autocorrelation function and instead estimate the reflection coefficients directly, thus being computationally simpler [38]. Moreover, it always guarantees a stable model, being notably more accurate than the Yule-Walker algorithm [39]. Therefore, the Burg's method was used in this work. Once the AR model parameters are estimated, the PSD can be computed as [38]

A critical issue in AR modeling is the order m chosen [38]. A model order which is too high will overfit the data and represent too much noise, but a model order which is too small will not sufficiently represent the signal. Therefore, a compromise has to be reached. Although there are many methods to estimate optimal model order [40], the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used, because it is the most common and works well in combination with the Burg's method [37]. This index is defined for a m-order AR model as

The first component represents the fitting ability (higher order, better fit), while the second one represents a penalty function with increasing order. AIC is computed for order 1 to a certain maximum order and then the m value that minimizes the AIC function is chosen to be the optimal order [37].

After its spectral estimation, the absolute energy of every P-wave was quantified as in Stafford et al.'s works [19,21]. Thus, the absolute energy contained in the frequency band between 20 and 150Hz was computed in intervals of 0.5Hz as

Although the P-wave spectral content has been mostly analyzed from frequencies near to zero up to 150Hz [21–23], a recent work has revealed statistically significant differences among healthy subjects and PAF patients from higher frequency values. Indeed, Vassilikos et al. [15] defined the low (50–90Hz), medium (100–150Hz) and high (160–200Hz) frequency bands and the maximum energy in each one of them was computed. In line with this work, similar parameters were here computed as

                        It is interesting to note that this index has proved previously a significant ability to differentiate among P-waves with normal and abnormal morphology [41]. Indeed, uniform conductions of the electrical signal during atrial activation provided low values of f
                        
                           m
                        , whereas the presence of high-frequency components due to non-uniform conductions and randomly varying activations were reflected by high values of this feature. Nonetheless, it has to be remarked that median frequency was computed from the P-wave wavelet decomposition [41].

Finally, the variability of these parameters over time was estimated in the same way as in a previous work, in which the time course variability of temporal P-wave features was successfully assessed [32]. In this case, only parameters related to the P-wave timing were assessed without studying spectral features. This method allowed a remarkable noise reduction in the analysis, which is required given the relatively low amplitude of the P-wave with respect to the background noise in the ECG [25]. Briefly, once the aforementioned features were computed from every single P-wave, the corresponding generated data series were divided into groups of 10 values. Next, the variability within each group was computed as the difference between the 90- and 10-quantiles of its values. Outliers originated by impulse noise or artifacts were thus rejected. As the endmost step, the time course of every feature, over the one hour-length ECG recording, was estimated through the least-squares method to fit a linear model according to the variability in every single group of P-wave features. Thus, a positive value of the fitting line slope (α) suggests increasing variability and, therefore, higher dispersion in the data. In contrast, a negative value indicates decreasing trend in the data variability, thus reaching more stable values. Finally, constant values of the parameter over the studied time period could be represented by a value of α close to zero.

In order to compare the proposed P-wave spectral parameters with the classical time-domain approach, the time course variability of the P-wave duration (Pdur) was also computed for each patient. The P-wave duration was defined as the distance between its offset and onset expressed in seconds, i.e. Pdur
                        =
                        L/1000, where L is the P-wave length in samples. Similarly, the variability in the series of distances between the peak of successive P-waves (PPk) was also quantified. In a recent work this parameter has provided a notable ability to identify the onset of PAF [32].

The performance of each single parameter variability to discriminate among groups of ECG segments was evaluated by means of a stratified 2-fold cross-validation. Thus, the database was first partitioned into 2 equally sized folds, rearranging the data to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole. Subsequently, 2 iterations of training and validation were performed, such that within each one a fold of the data was held out for validation whereas the other was used for learning. For each learning set, two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to obtain discriminant thresholds between ECG segments close to PAF and far from PAF onset and between ECG segments far from PAF onset and from healthy subjects. Each ROC was created by plotting the fraction of true positives out of positives versus the fraction of false positives out of negatives at various threshold settings. The α value providing the highest percentage of ECG segments correctly classified, that is, the accuracy, was selected as optimum threshold. Thereafter, these two thresholds from the test set were used to determine the number of ECG segments correctly classified for each group and the global accuracy, i.e., the ratio between the correctly classified ECG segments and the total number of analyzed ones. Finally, these values were averaged for the two iterations.

Moreover, a stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) was performed with the objective of improving the ECG segment group classification. Variable selection was performed by a forward stepwise approach including, at each step, the feature which led to maximization of the Lawley–Hotelling trace (Rao's V). As for the single metrics, SDA classification performance was also assessed making use of a stratified 2-fold cross-validation strategy.

Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests proved that the fitting line slope (α) distribution was normal and homoscedastic for all the studied parameters. As a consequence, results were expressed as mean ±standard deviation for all the ECG segments belonging to the same group and statistical differences among the α distributions for the three groups were tested by a one-way ANOVA test. In addition, t-Student's test was used to analyze the difference between pairs of groups. In both cases, a statistical significance (p) value lower than 0.05 was considered as significant.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In order to estimate appropriately the P-wave spectral content, the most adequate selection of the AR model order m was investigated. Thus, every P-wave was adjusted to an AR model with values of m from 1 to 20 and AIC was computed. For the three analyzed groups of ECG segments, a decreasing trend was observed for the AIC values. However, they did not change significantly after reaching a 4th order model, therefore, this value of m was chosen to estimate every P-wave PSD.

Mean and standard deviation values of the slope α computed from the analyzed parameters for the three considered groups of ECG segments are shown in Table 2
                     . For all the parameters, α values presented an increasing trend from healthy ECG segments to those far from PAF and, next, to those close to PAF. As an example, Fig. 1
                      displays representative ECG segments showing P waves and their spectral content for a healthy subject as well as AF patients far from PAF and close to PAF. As can be observed, a higher variability occurs in the P-wave duration and its high-frequency energy as the onset of PAF approximates. Moreover, it was also noticed that all the parameters provided statistically significant differences among groups when a one-way ANOVA test was used, such as Table 2 reflects. Similarly, statistically significant differences between ECG segments far from PAF and close to PAF and between ECG segments far from PAF and those from healthy individuals were also noticed via a Student's t-test.

In order to obtain a reliable classification performance, a stratified 2-fold cross-validation was run five times for each parameter, 10 learning and 10 test sets being analyzed. Thus, the number of ECG segments correctly classified for each group as well as the global accuracy value presented in Table 3
                      were averaged for the corresponding 10 folds. As can be observed, parameters derived from the P-wave spectral analysis did not improve the discriminant ability of Pdur. However, the average variability from the test sets associated to P
                     80 and f
                     
                        m
                      only classified incorrectly 2.9% and 4.8%, respectively, of ECG segments less than the P-wave duration variability. Moreover, the remaining spectral features presented a higher global accuracy than the rhythm metric PPk. Indeed, these parameters improved the PPk global accuracy between 1.4% and 11.9%, respectively.

As for single parameters, the SDA classification performance was validated by running five times a stratified 2-fold cross-validation. For each iteration, the discriminant power provided by each selected subset of features was assessed by the Wilks’ lambda test. This test yields the equality probability of the group centroids, in the parameters space, under the assumption of normal distribution with equal covariance. For all the cases, the minimum value of this statistic was obtained for the same combination of two parameters, suggesting that this subset incorporated most of the discriminant power associated with the entire 16-parameter set. Thus, the first feature to enter the discriminant model was always the P-wave duration, which is coherent, since it provided the best single classification. Thereafter, the feature P
                     80 was added to the model because it provided a discriminant ability greater than the remaining features when used in conjunction with the metric Pdur. It is interesting to note that this discriminant model outperformed the global accuracy from the test sets of each single feature. To this respect, the discriminant model showed an averaged global accuracy of 88.07%, discerning appropriately 85.87%, 76.09% and 89.13% of ECG segments from healthy subjects, far from PAF and close to the onset of PAF, respectively. This fact implies an increase of 7.1% and 10% in the global discriminant ability with respect to that presented by the Pdur and P
                     80, respectively.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The present work introduces for the first time an algorithm with ability to characterize the P-wave spectral variability over time from a single-lead ECG recording. Results showed that all the analyzed parameters evolved showing an increased variability trend as the PAF onset approximated. This outcome is in agreement with the intermittently disturbed conduction observed in the atrial tissue susceptible to PAF [26]. To this respect, the presence of decreased and different cell refractory periods in various atrial regions is a common electrophysiological alteration preceding the onset of PAF, which can provoke overlapping between atrial depolarizations and possible premature atrial repolarization [1,9]. Moreover, other intra-cellular or inter-cellular factors, such as connections, ion channels and regulatory proteins, can cause the genesis of site-specific conduction delays [13,42] which, together with the presence of structural abnormalities in atrial walls, such as fibrosis, may alter constantly the way through which the sinus beat travels across the atria [13]. Hence, this site-dependent inhomogeneous and intermittent atrial conduction results in a highly variable and fragmented P-wave morphology over time. In fact, highly fractionated atrial endocardial electrograms have been observed in patients close to the onset of PAF [26].

Although variability analysis over time provided statistically significant differences among ECG segment groups for all the analyzed parameters and they could be considered as potential risk indicators of PAF onset, the most relevant metric was P
                     80. This result is in agreement with previous findings which revealed that patients with idiopathic PAF presented the greatest energy increase at frequencies between 80 and 150Hz [21,43]. The remaining parameters quantifying P-wave absolute energy only showed a slightly lower predictive ability (between 3.65% and 4.16% lower for the test sets). This result seems to be coherent because P
                     20, P
                     30, P
                     40 and P
                     60 also include the energy contained by P
                     80. In fact, the correlation of these features with P
                     80 was always statistically significant and higher than 82%. Nonetheless, none of these features (P
                     20, P
                     30, P
                     40 and P
                     60) improved the discriminant ability of f
                     
                        m
                     . This frequency time course also suggests a higher variability when the onset of PAF approximates, thus reflecting successfully notable variations in the P-wave high-frequency energy content. As could be expected, this feature provided a statistically significant correlation with parameters estimating relative energy between high- and low-frequency, i.e., PR
                     20, PR
                     30, PR
                     40, PR
                     60 and PR
                     80. Indeed, for all the cases a correlation coefficient higher than 76% was noticed. However, f
                     
                        m
                      proved to be a more accurate discriminator among ECG segments from healthy subjects, far from PAF and close to PAF onset than the metrics quantifying the P-wave relative energy.

Nevertheless, it has to be remarked that any spectral parameter improved the classification performance obtained from the P-wave duration variability, although all of them presented a higher global accuracy than the P-wave rhythm variability. However, the global accuracy of spectral parameters such as P
                     80 and f
                     
                        m
                      was only a 2.9% and 4.8% lower, presenting the additional advantage of not requiring an extremely precise identification of the P-wave boundaries [44]. Indeed, the lack of standard measurements of the P-wave onset and offset and the fact that they are usually determined manually have limited the clinical value of time-domain approaches to distinguish different groups of patients [17]. To this respect, it is worth noting that while the diagnostic accuracy observed for the P-wave duration variability in the present work was only slightly lower than the one reported in a previous study [32], a notable decrease in the classification rate for the metric PPk was noticed. However, a considerably wider database and a more robust statistical analysis has been carried out in the present study.

Furthermore, it is also important to remark that the linear combination of the P-wave duration and P
                     80 through a discriminant model increased their global accuracy more than 7%, which could be indicative of a notable complementarity between them. Hence, it could be considered that the feature P
                     80 provides additional morphological information to the one revealed by the P-wave duration. This finding is in agreement with previous works which have suggested that a thorough analysis and quantification of the P-wave morphological features could be useful for AF risk stratification and could improve the sensitivity and specificity of screening methods based only on time-domain parameters [17,45]. Overall, the present discriminant model might be considered as a reliable noninvasive marker of the fractionated electrical activity that characterizes the atrial depolarization of PAF patients during sinus rhythm. Moreover, it can offer important advantages over invasive electrophysiological studies [43]. Firstly, it can provide information on the activation wavefront, rather than on individual groups of cells that contribute to local electrograms, which would require an impractical number recordings using an intra-atrial approach. Secondly, the information is gathered from the surface ECG and may, therefore, be obtained comfortably during patient follow-up evaluations or drug assessment.

On the other hand, it should also be noted that the studied databases of healthy subjects and PAF patients were representative enough and both groups were homogeneous in terms of confounding factors, such as age [46,47], gender [48] or heart rate [49]. To this respect, previous works have shown that P-wave duration increases slightly with age [46,47], and that in men P-wave is normally longer than in women [48]. Additionally, it is well-known that changes in automatic tone may affect P-wave duration through effects on either the conduction velocity or changes in atrial size or pressure that may arise from the associated change in heart rate [49]. However, it could be considered that the autonomic nervous system activity had no significant effects on the presented results because PAF patients and healthy subjects had similar heart and respiratory rates during the ECG recordings and the PQ segment duration was similar in both groups.

Finally, some limitations merit consideration. First, the present work was a retrospective study with a limited sample size. Larger prospective studies are needed to further validate the proposed methodology and reinforce the obtained results. Second, the P-wave spectral content variability 2h before the onset of PAF has only been assessed. Thus, considering the promising obtained outcomes, extended studies considering wider time intervals before the onset of PAF would be developed in future works. Finally, although some authors recommend evaluating the P-wave in lead II [16,45], only lead V1 was analyzed. This lead provides additional information concerning intra-atrial conduction defects because it can reflect the posterior left atrial potential, unseen in the limb leads [50]. On the other hand, although the P-wave analysis from orthogonal XYZ leads has provided relevant clinical information about the alteration of atrial properties [13], these leads have never been used to analyze P-wave variability over time. In fact, this kind of recordings are rarely performed in daily clinical practice [51]. Moreover, the current proposed transformations to reconstruct XYZ leads from the standard ECG leads have not provided a highly accurate outcome [52]. Nonetheless, it could be of interest to consider the study of XYZ leads in future works.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present study, surface ECG P-wave spectral variations 2h before the onset of PAF have been analyzed for the first time. Metrics extracted from the P-wave autoregressive spectral estimation have shown an increasing variability trend over time. This trend suggests a more intermittently disturbed and fragmented atrial conduction when PAF onset approximates, which is in agreement with clinically accepted electrophysiological observations. More precisely, the P-wave high-frequency energy (between 80 and 150Hz) has reported a similar global accuracy to the most classical time-domain approach, i.e., the P-wave duration, for discerning between healthy subjects, patients far from PAF and patients less than one hour close to a PAF episode. Furthermore, this metric is less dependent on a highly precise delineation of the P-wave boundaries. Finally, this parameter has provided additional complementary information to the P-wave duration, because their linear combination improved the global accuracy more than 7%. Nonetheless, further studies are required to validate these findings and carry out more long-term PAF risk predictions.
