                  Suppliers network in the global context under price discounts and uncertain fluctuations of currency exchange rates have become critical in today’s world economy. We study the problem of suppliers’ selection in the presence of uncertain fluctuations of currency exchange rates and price discounts. We specifically consider a buyer with multiple sites sourcing a product from heterogeneous suppliers and address both the supplier selection and purchased quantity decision. Suppliers are located worldwide and pricing is offered in suppliers’ local currencies. Exchange rates from the local currencies of suppliers to the standard currency of the buyer are subject to uncertain fluctuations overtime. In addition, suppliers offer discounts as a function of the total quantity bought by the different customer’ sites over the time horizon irrespective of the quantity purchased by each site.
                  We first provide a literature review on the overlapping items of suppliers’ selection and risk due to currency. Then, we model the problem using the mixed integer scenario-based stochastic programming method. The objective is to minimize the total system expected cost (purchased price+inventory cost+transportation cost+supplier management cost). Finally, we conduct numerical studies to show the value of the proposed model and we discuss some relevant managerial insights into the theory and practice of supply chain management research.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The selection of suppliers is a strategic process that determines the long viability of a company, especially when purchasing costs constitute a significant portion of the operating costs. The suppliers’ selection plays a key role in achieving the objectives of an effective supply chain (Ng, 2008). The suppliers’ selection is a complex decision making problem, which should include both quantitative, and qualitative criteria, as well as global factors to account effectively for suppliers’ performance (Amid, Ghodsypour, & O’Brien, 2009; Aissaoui, Haouari, & Hassini, 2007; Sawik, 2010; Xu & Nozick, 2009). Some researchers agreed that a combination of factors should fit not only the technical requirements, but also the company’s strategy. Some of these factors might include: financial metrics, consistency of the supplier, relationship, flexibility, technological capability, customer service, reliability and price (Bode, Wagner, Petersen, & Ellram, 2011; Choi & Hartley, 1996; Qu, Huang, Chen, & Chen, 2009). The combination of factors to better select suppliers is not trivial, we refer the reader to Dickson (1966), Weber, Current, and Benton (1991), Bhutta and Huq (2002), Demirtas and Ustum (2008), Chen (2011) for more details about the suppliers’ selection criteria. The decisions related to the suppliers’ selection problem in the relevant literature are, mainly, which suppliers to select and how much to order from each supplier in each period and over the planning horizon.

With the globalization of industrial activities and the expansion of offshoring there has been a steady increase in the global purchasing. Most companies have several sites located worldwide and are concerned with purchasing raw materials and components for these sites from a global network of suppliers. The sourcing economic development and the need for competitive advantage have increased the trend of sourcing products across the global marketplace. The global purchasing environment has unintended consequences; it exposes organizations to considerable sourcing risks and imposes new challenges that must be considered in the supplier selection process (Aloini, Dulmin, & Mininno, 2011; Hopkins, 2010). Some researchers (Aloini et al., 2011; Christopher, Mena, Khan, & Yurt, 2011; Sawik, 2010) outlined and classified the significant risks associated with global outsourcing.

One of these significant risks includes the currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in the exchange rates impact the sourcing from a global network of suppliers using different currencies. Different and fluctuating currencies expose the buyer to the currency risk. When different currencies are involved, the buyer should cope with the uncertain fluctuations of the exchange rates. Recently, the executive vice president procurement of Airbus argued that their procurement strategy is highly influenced by the €/$ fluctuations. Airbus decided to reduce $ exposure by increasing $ spend volume. It seems necessary that the suppliers’ selection models evolve to take into account the currency fluctuation uncertainty in order to be in line with the new challenges faced by purchasing managers in global environments. The literature seems to be rather scanty on analytical approaches that integrate the currency fluctuation uncertainty in the suppliers’ selection process; which is our underlying tenet in this research paper. We model the currency fluctuations through a scenario-based approach. The motivation behind this modeling approach will be presented in detail in Sections 3 and 4.

If one considers the exchange rate fluctuations between the supplier currency and the currency of reference then the purchasing price (expressed in the currency of reference) would depend on the order placement time. In this case, the buyer may have interest in ordering large quantities when the exchange rate is attractive. Therefore, the orders amounts and placement times decisions should be considered. The orders are likely to impact the total purchasing cost and, consequently, the suppliers to be selected. This also raises related inventory issues at the buyer’s site. The inventory level incurred at the buyer’s site and, consequently, the inventory cost are highly correlated to the amount and placement time of orders. In our model, we propose that the inventory costs with currency risk be taken into account in the assessment of suppliers’ selection decisions in the global context.

Often complicating the supplier selection problem for the buyer is the presence of price discounts offered by suppliers (Xia & Wu, 2007). Crama, Pascual, and Torres (2004) indicated that traditional discount models involve one of two types of discounts: quantity discounts – based on the quantity of each item ordered – or business volume discounts – based on the total dollar value of all items ordered. In the suppliers’ selection literature that incorporates discounts, the discounts are commonly calculated based on the nature of business done with each buyer. The discounts are not calculated based on multiple buyers’ sites. It should be noted that in many global companies there is a central purchasing department that is concerned with the negotiations with suppliers and the provisions to the different subsidiaries. In our research, this is the commonly found situation in the automotive sector; companies have generally many offshore sites that consume the same type of input items. Hence, an increasing number of suppliers are finding more meaningful to offer discounts as a function of the total quantity of each item bought by the different customer’ sites over a given time horizon, irrespective of the quantity purchased by each site. It seems to be a limited supplier selection models and methods addressing suppliers’ discounts from this perspective. Our research work capitalizes on this void in the literature and proposes a model where suppliers are assumed to offer discounts based on the total quantity supplied to the different buyer’s sites.

The global purchasing context, where buyer’ sites and suppliers might be geographically dispersed, rises the impact of transportation costs on the suppliers’ selection decision. Zelda and Zabinsky (2011) argue that the purchasing cost must include the costs associated with the whole purchasing process and over the purchased item’s entire life in addition to the purchasing price. Among these costs, transportation costs constitute a significant bulk. Nevertheless, Aissaoui et al. (2007) indicate that very little attention has been paid to transportation/logistics costs in the existing supplier selection research. Our proposed model explicitly considers the transportation costs in the global suppliers’ selection process.

In this paper, we propose a mixed integer stochastic programming model for the supplier selection in the global context. The use of this mathematical programming/optimization approach is driven by two main conditions. First, the model allows the flexibility for selecting a variety of variables and facilitates the inclusion of uncertainty into these variables. Second, it allows allocating orders to each supplier with probabilistic conditions. Moreover, the selected technique takes into account the different constraints of the problem (Ding, Benyoucef, & Xie, 2003), which we have briefly outlined and will be discussed in detailed in Section 4. We consider the typical case where a global company is concerned with purchasing a given product for its different sites from different potential suppliers. We take into account the global supplier selection aspects discussed above.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review on existing suppliers’ selection models, and on a variety of risks associated with the selection of suppliers, additional emphasis is provided on currency fluctuation risk and discounts. Section 3 is dedicated to the problem statement. Section 4 addresses the mathematical formulation for the problem under study. In Section 5, the computational experiments and managerial insights are presented. Section 6 provides concluding remarks and future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

A key component in developing a reliable supply chain is the selection of suppliers. The sourcing of products from across the world has become an increasing trend by companies around the world looking for new sources of competitive advantage. These corporate initiatives to have prompted unexpected and unintended issues that have increased the complexity of supply chains. Some of these issues expose companies to different types of risks (Christopher & Lee, 2004) and traditional suppliers’ selection models are evolving to incorporate such uncertainties. Our paper addresses some of these uncertainties. We review the analytical suppliers’ selection literature from the perspective of assessing how well existing models fit in the context of global suppliers selection. In particular, we identify how sourcing risks, price discounts and logistics costs have been accounted for in the mathematical model-based suppliers selection approaches. Our main focus is on research published in the last decade.

Many analytical techniques have been used to address the suppliers’ selection problem. An innovative research presented by De Boer, Labro, and Morlacchi (2001) reviewed the literature on suppliers’ selection and classified it according to the supplier’s selection stage. De Boer et al.’s framework was revisited by Wu and Barnes (2011) in the context of agile supply chains. Their findings showed the need for the development of methods able to incorporate qualitative and quantitative goals. Wu’s and Barnes’ classification clustered the analytical models by linear weighting, by mathematical programming, by fuzzy set theory and by analytical hierarchical process. For more details on the different techniques and related references, please refer to Wu and Barnes (2011). Wadhwa and Ravindran (2007) classified the supplier selection to enhance outsourcing operations. These researchers broadly clustered the related literature by the method used in modeling the problem. The three clusters include: single or multi-objective mathematical programming methods, game theoretic methods, and artificial intelligence applications to supplier selection. For a detailed review of these three clusters, we kindly refer the reader to Wadhwa and Ravindran (2007).

Sourcing risks associated with supply chain management have been a topic of great interest by academicians and practitioners. Risk makes the supply chains vulnerable and consequently impacts the organization’s performance. Global outsourcing has brought a significant risk to organizations worldwide; many of these risks evolved due to the nature of worldwide transactions and operations. Risk has been addressed from different perspectives.

Some researchers explored the qualitative aspects of risk and uncertainty and its associated mitigation strategies (Wieland & Wallenburg, 2012; Cavusgil & Deligonul, 2012; Choi & Linton, 2011; Wilson, 2012). In the same line of research, Christopher et al. (2011) classified the different types of global sourcing risks as Supply risk, Environmental and sustainability risk, Process and control risk, and Demand risk. Their work expanded on Christopher and Peck’s (2004) framework. As it is pertinent to our research paper, we are addressing a segment of the Environmental and sustainability risk. This includes fluctuations of interest rate, currency fluctuations, quota restrictions, high levels of CO2, and so forth. For an in-depth analysis of a variety of global risks, we refer the reader to Christopher et al.’s (2011) research.

Others researchers have addressed risk uncertainty or sourcing risk through quantitative models. Xu and Nozick (2009) formulated a two-stage stochastic program to optimize suppliers selection and hedge against the disruption caused by the loss of production capability at the suppliers’ sites. Xu and Nozik considered different disruption scenarios. One of the scenarios specified the severity of the production capability lost at each suppliers’ site in each time period. In this work, the researchers integrated the transportation mode selection with the supplier selection. However, Xu and Nozik’s model ignored price discounts and inventory costs. Their model’s objective function was to minimize the expected cost over the planning horizon.


                        Sawik (2011a) addressed the optimal selection of supply portfolio in a make-to-order environment in the presence of supply chain disruption risks. Two types of disruption scenarios were considered: scenarios with independent local disruptions of each supplier and scenarios with local and global disruptions that may result in all suppliers disruption simultaneously. Disruptions may arise from equipment break downs, local labor strike, bankruptcy, local natural disasters, etc. The problem was formulated as a single-or bi-objective mixed integer program and considered a single buyer. Moreover, price discounts and logistics costs (transportation and inventory) were not included. The model minimized the total expected cost, which includes the ordering cost, the purchasing price, the cost of defects and the cost of shortages. The minimization of the total expected worst-case cost is also considered in this work. Sawik (2011b) investigated the problem of multi-period supplier selection and order allocation in make-to-order environment while considering supply chain disruption and delay risks. The main selection criteria are: price, quality of purchased parts, and reliability of supplies. The author proposed a mixed-integer programming approach to incorporate risk that uses conditional value-at-risk via scenario analysis. Sawik (2013) addressed the issues of supply chain materials flows due to disruption risks. In his mixed integer programming approach he accounted for disruption risks such as risk-neutral, risk-averse or mean-risk supply portfolio. These works did not account for currency exchange risk.

Zelda and Zadinsky (2011) developed a scenario-based stochastic model and a chance-constrainted model for suppliers selection. Their model captured the risk associated with uncertain customer demand and supplier capacity. Also, the model considered the provision of multiple plants with multiple products. The total purchasing cost to minimize included purchasing price with business volume discounts, pipeline inventory costs and transportation costs, coordination costs and penalty costs for exceeding the supplier’s capacity. The problem did not account for the time dimension and inventory cost at the buyer’s sites.


                        Hammami, Frein, and Hadj-Alouane (2012) developed an optimization model for supplier selection. The focus of the model was on the low-cost suppliers’ issues. Such issues included the uncertainties of delivery lead times from suppliers’ sites to buyer’s sites, and the impact of the safety stock at the buyer’s sites. The researchers minimized the total cost. This included the purchasing price, the transportation cost, the inventory cost and the supplier management cost. The price discounts were ignored in their model.


                        Ravindran, Bilsel, Wadhwa, and Yang (2010) developed a risk adjusted supplier selection problem as a multicriteria optimization. The models accounted for value-at-risk type risk of disruption due to natural events and miss-to-target type of risk of quality. The models offered four different alternatives via the value path approach, which seems a valuable tool to compare objectives among suppliers. Their model did not address the currency risk or discounts. Also Bilsel and Ravindran (2011) developed a supplier selection approach incorporating uncertainties due to demand for products, capacities at suppliers as well as transportation and other variable costs. The disruptions considered are due to exogenous events but did not include currency risk. Bilsel and Ravindran’s model provided proactive mitigation strategies for the type of uncertainties addressed.

The price discounts offered by suppliers are included in many supplier selection models in the literature. Different types of discounts are considered in the literature. Crama et al. (2004) proposed a procurement decision model where each supplier offers quantity discounts based on the total quantity of items purchased by the company. This model considered local discounts to which each plant is entitled independently of the company’s consolidated purchases and group discounts to which each plant is entitled as a consequence of the company’s cumulative purchases. The problem was formulated for both single plant and multi-plant situations as a non-linear mixed 0–1 programming model. The objective function minimized the total purchasing price.


                        Murthy, Soni, and Ghosh (2004) addressed the vendor selection problem for make-to-order items in the presence of volume-based discounts for bundles. The researchers considered bundling discounts being offered by suppliers when suppliers can gain savings in setup costs associated with producing a family of items. The problem is formulated for a single buyer as a mixed-integer programming model where the objective is to minimize the fixed and variable sourcing costs.


                        Xia and Wu (2007) developed a multi-criteria suppliers selection model for a single buyer where suppliers offer price discounts on total business volume for different products. The researchers proposed a multi-objective mixed integer programming model where the price and the number of defective items were minimized while the qualitative weight of suppliers and the number of items delivered on time were maximized.

A fuzzy multi-objective model to deal with the suppliers selection problem for a single buyer was proposed by Amid et al. (2009). The problem was formulated in such a way as to simultaneously considered the imprecision of information and the order quantities assigned to each supplier based on price breaks. Suppliers offered price breaks as a function of the order quantity. The problem included three objective functions: minimizing the net cost, minimizing the net rejected items, and minimizing the net late deliveries.


                        Sawik (2010) developed single and multi-objective mixed-integer programming models where the selection of suppliers is based on price and quality of purchased parts and reliability of on time delivery. Two types of discounts were considered: quantity and business volume discounts. Sawik postulated the situation with a single buyer.

One can note that these previous research have made great contributions to the supplier selection literature, but most of them ignored sourcing uncertainties and did not address the transportation and inventory issues.

Previous research shows limited supplier selection models considering the impacts of currency fluctuation uncertainty on sourcing decisions. In previous research, sourcing risks often refer to the uncertainties on the buyer’s demand and supplier’s capability, to quality of materials flow or quality of products, to natural events as disruptive to the supply chain and other; please refer to Christopher et al. (2011) for a complete review of the types of risks and their categorization. A supply chain disruption as a Bernoulli random variable was introduced in the model developed by Babich (2005). He also used the theory of financial options, which are beyond the scope of this paper. In Babich’s (2005) model, a firm has the option to address disruptions by deferring ordering decisions until uncertainty is unfolded and the supplier has the option to defer pricing decisions. This model provides interesting options to mitigate uncertainty; however, most industries do not have the luxury to adopt such approach. The product or finish good needs to be in a timely manner in the market to allow the firm to stay competitive. Thus, it is very likely, that the currency fluctuation risk addressed in our approach has not been fully explored yet.

Moreover, relatively few papers have developed effective models for supplier selection problems addressing simultaneously the sourcing uncertainties and the price discounts offered by suppliers. One can also note that supplier selection methods under price discounts often ignore the inventory and transportation costs that are correlated to the sourcing decisions. As underlined by Aissaoui et al. (2007), very little attention has been paid to logistics costs in the existing suppliers selection research. Furthermore, previous research has focused on the single buyer situation, but it is unclear how the developed models can be generalized to consider the situation where the buyer has multiple sites.

In this research paper, we develop a supplier selection model that integrates the exchange rate fluctuation uncertainties with price discounts while explicitly considering transportation and inventory costs in a context of multiple buyer’s sites. Our research makes contributions: First by addressing complexities in the supplier selection models that has not been presented in the literature. Second, by using a well-known methodology – mixed integer stochastic programming – to capture a new paradigm in the area of supply chain management. Third, our model present opportunities for further research on the subject of supplier selection with the integration of other disciplines such as social sciences, management and so forth.

We consider the typical global purchasing case where a global company is concerned by purchasing a product for its different sites from different potential suppliers over a given planning horizon. The set of potential suppliers could be obtained after a preselection process in which several qualitative criteria might be considered. The sets of buyers’ sites and potential suppliers are respectively denoted by J and I.

The supplier selection decisions are typically undertaken over the long-term with a time horizon ranging from one to three years. At the beginning of the planning horizon, the agreements must be established with suppliers. The purchasing managers should determine the suppliers to be selected and the total amount to be allocated to each selected supplier over the planning horizon. We denote by Q
                     
                        i
                      the total quantity to be sourced from supplier i over the planning horizon. Based on the quantity Q
                     
                        i
                     , the supplier offers price discounts. The discount schedule of a given supplier i is characterized by N
                     
                        i

The currency of payment may be different from one supplier to another. In order to assess the total purchasing cost, all prices must be expressed in a unique standard currency. As typically assumed, the currency of the parent company is taken as reference. The currency exchange rates are usually subject to fluctuations over time; these fluctuations are very difficult to predict on the long term. The difficulty economists have had in finding an empirically successful exchange rate theory is well documented (e.g., Taylor, 1995). Nonetheless, a company has to forecast what the exchange rate would be in the future to make decisions. In order to predict currency fluctuations on the long term, financial analysts typically elaborate different exchange rate scenarios on a quarterly basis. Some currency fluctuations scenarios over a time horizon ranging from one to three years are published by financial organisms and can then be used in our modeling approach. Consequently, we formulate the problem under study as a scenario-based stochastic model to address currency fluctuations.

We divide the planning horizon into periods k (k
                     ∈{1…K}) according to the time periods of the available currency fluctuation forecasts. For instance, if the exchange rates scenarios are elaborated on a quarterly basis then a period k would designate a quarter. We let Ω denote the set of all possible scenarios defined by a scenario tree. A particular instance of exchange rates fluctuations scenarios is referred to by ω. The exchange rate from the currency of supplier i to the standard currency in period k under scenario ωis denoted by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 k
                                 ω
                              
                           
                        
                     . A probability of occurrence, P
                     
                        ω
                     , is associated with every scenario ω.

Under currency fluctuations, the purchasing price (expressed in the currency of reference) depends on the order placement period. For a given scenario, the buyer may have interest in ordering large quantities when the exchange rate is attractive in order to get a smaller price (expressed in the currency of reference). We let 
                        
                           
                              
                                 q
                              
                              
                                 ij
                              
                              
                                 k
                                 ω
                              
                           
                        
                      represents the quantity ordered by site j from supplier i in period k under scenario ω. This also raises the inventory issue since items would be hold in stock when the available quantity in a given period is larger then the demand in this period. We denote by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 s
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 k
                                 ω
                              
                           
                        
                      the inventory level in site j at the beginning of period k under scenario ω.

The first-stage decisions are basically the suppliers to be selected and the total quantity to be ordered from each supplier. The second-stage decisions are associated with each exchange rates scenario. They represent the quantity ordered by each site in each time period and the inventory level in the buyer’s sites. These second-stage decisions depend on the first-stage decisions and affect the suppliers’ evaluation at this stage.

The objective is to minimize the total expected purchasing cost over the planning horizon while satisfying the different problem constraints. The total cost is the sum of the supplier management cost, the purchasing price, the transportation cost, and the inventory cost. The supplier management cost is incurred once the supplier is selected and refers to the cost of doing business with the supplier. It basically represents the cost of integrating and developing suppliers. When low-cost suppliers are involved, the management cost may be substantial as experienced by many global companies. Indeed, a hard work may be required to get a low-cost supplier in line with the strategy of the company. Quantity discounts are considered in the purchasing price. The transportation cost depends on the location of the supplier’s site and the buyer’s site. Finally, the inventory cost in a buyer’s site is calculated for each time period based on the average inventory level in this period.

We formulate the supplier selection problem as a mixed integer scenario-based stochastic programming model. The main decisions that must be made immediately (first-stage decisions) are the suppliers to select and the total quantity to purchase from each supplier over the planning horizon. There are different scenarios for future exchange rates fluctuations over the planning horizon. Associated with each scenario are the second-stage variables: the quantities ordered in each period and the incurred inventory levels in buyers’ sites. In the model, future decisions depend on the first-stage decisions made today and affect their evaluation. In the objective function, we minimize the expected total cost (in a statistical sense) over all scenarios included in the model.

The objective function (1) minimizes the total expected cost Z expressed in the currency of reference. This cost is the sum of the supplier management cost, the purchasing price, the transportation cost, and the inventory cost. Unlike the purchasing price, all the cost factors are assumed to be directly expressed in the currency of reference. Indeed, the impact of the currency risk associated with these costs on the supplier selection decisions can be neglected if one considers the price risk.

In our model, the purchasing contracts are assumed to be expressed in the currency imposed by the supplier which is generally the currency of the supplier’s country. This is a valid assumption in many situations especially for North American and European suppliers. However, in some cases, the purchasing contracts may be expressed in the buyer’s currency. The model can be easily modified to take this situation into account. Indeed, we replace the purchasing price

In this case, the suppliers profits are subject to currency fluctuation uncertainty and suppliers may see their profits going down. We can also consider alternative situations where the currency risk is shared between the buyer and the supplier. For instance, we can extend the model to consider the case where the purchasing price changes if the currency fluctuation exceeds a given level (purchasing price increases if the fluctuation is profitable to the buyer and vice versa). This aspect can be integrated in our model but will complicate the solving approach as it will introduce other non-linearities in the objective function.

In order to conduct experiments, we solved the deterministic mixed integer programming equivalent of the proposed stochastic program by using the commercial optimization software Cplex. This is an efficient solving approach given the reasonable size of the obtained mixed-integer program. Our experiments are performed based on a realistic case study that we describe in the next section. The experiments are guided by two main goals:
                        
                           •
                           Evaluate the cost saving obtained by applying the proposed model to the suppliers’ selection problem,

Derive managerial insights that may be interesting for both academicians and practitioners.

The computational experiments conducted with the proposed mathematical model are inspired from the case study presented in Xu and Nozick (2009). The structure of this case study and the parameters used are based on a realistic problem faced by a US automotive manufacturer. It concerns the provisioning of two assembly plants with a single common part. One plant is located in Detroit, Michigan, and the second is located in Russelsheim, Germany. The demand at each plant is characterized by an annual volume of 1,084,500 and 723,000 units in Detroit and Russelsheim, respectively. The planning horizon is assumed to be one year and each period k is assumed to be a quarter. The demand of the product is assumed to be evenly distributed over the periods. Therefore, the quarterly volume of demand is 271,125 and 180,750 in Detroit and Russelsheim, respectively. The US dollar is taken as the currency of reference.

The potential suppliers are listed in Table 1
                        . Since there is only one supplier in each city we reference the supplier by the cityname. Table 1 gives the unit price offered by each supplier in its local currency and in USD (the considered exchange rates are given in Table 4). We also give the supplier management cost (in USD) that represents, in this case study, the cost to engage with a supplier. Shanghai is the lowest cost supplier but with the highest management cost. The maximum amount that can be obtained from any supplier in a quarter is also given in Table 1. Note that the low-cost supplier Shanghai has the lowest capacity.

Parts are shipped under a multi-modal transportation format that might include truck, rail, or ship. For instance, to supply Detroit from Shanghai, we use ships from Shanghai to Los Angeles and then trains from Los Angeles to Detroit. From Shanghai to Russelsheim, we use ships to enter Europe via Rotterdam and then trucks from Rotterdam to Russelsheim. The unit transportation costs from suppliers’ sites to buyers’ sites are given in Table 2
                        . They were calculated based on the distance travelled by each transportation mode and based on standard costs. The per-unit quarterly holding cost is assumed to be $2.56 and $2.78 in Detroit and Russelsheim, respectively.

We assume that suppliers offer quantity discount schedule with three intervals as shown in Table 3
                        . These discount rates are used to calculate the unit purchasing prices 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    U
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                        . For example, the unit price offered by the supplier in Cleveland becomes $21.34 if the total ordered quantity over the planning horizon is larger than 500,000 units.

The baseline forecasts of currency exchange rates are taken from the financial market forecasts that have been published by the Royal Bank of Canada (2012). These forecasts are given in Table 4
                        . They predict the exchange rate fluctuations of EUR, JPY, and CNY compared to USD on a quarterly basis over one year. The baseline forecasts will be used to build the different scenarios of exchange rates fluctuations as will be detailed later. Note that a scenario in the model is obtained by specifying the exchange rates of EUR, JPY, and CNY in each quarter over the planning horizon.

The purpose here is to show the relevance of taking the exchange rates into account when undertaking supplier selection decisions in the global context. It is important to note that we do not deal here with the fluctuations of exchange rates or the uncertainties of these fluctuations. Indeed, we only evaluate the impact of considering constant and known exchange rates on the supplier selection decisions.

For every currency, we consider a unique constant value of exchange rate over the planning horizon (fluctuations and uncertainties are ignored). Consequently, there is only one scenario of currency exchange rates in the model. For the CNY and JPY currencies, we take the average value of the exchange rates presented on Table 4. Hence, for instance, the exchange rate USD/CNY is assumed to be 6.225 in each quarter. Then we solve the model for different values of the exchange rate $/€. Figs. 1 and 2
                        
                        , present the total cost and the quantity allocated to the European supplier (Madrid) as a function of the exchange rate $/€.

One can first note that the purchasing cost and the model solution are very sensitive to the value of the exchange rate. The increase of the exchange rate $/€ leads to significantly increasing the total quantity Q purchased from the European supplier in Madrid. For instance, if the exchange rate goes up from 0.75 to 0.8 then the quantity purchased from Madrid increases by 92%. If the exchange rate $/€ is smaller than 0.65 then the supplier in Madrid is not selected by the model. Our results validate the relevance of including currency exchange rates in the evaluation of supplier selection decisions.

In real-world situations, the currency exchange rates are not constant as assumed in the previous experiment but fluctuate over time. Here, we let the exchange rates fluctuate over time but we still consider only one scenario of exchange rates (uncertainty is not considered). For the CNY and JPY currencies, we take the exchange rates given in Table 4. We generate different forecasts of $/€ exchange rates over the planning horizon using the following method. Indeed, we first specify a rate of fluctuation; for instance, 5%. Then, we randomly generate exchange rates while ensuring that, in each quarter, the $/€ exchange rate has the following lower and upper limits: 0.771∗(1−5%) and 0.771∗(1+5%). Note that 0.771 is the average value of $/€ exchange rates over the planning horizon for the baseline forecast given in Table 4 (Indeed, 0.771= (0.752+0.763+0.781+0.787)∗1/4). We also ensure that, for each generated forecast, the average value of $/€ exchange rates over the planning horizon is equal to 0.771 as for the baseline forecast.

Twenty forecasts of $/€ exchange rates over the planning horizon are randomly generated according to the above conditions for each rate of fluctuation. Thus, we obtain twenty instances of the model for each fluctuation rate. We solve the different instances of the model and obtain the optimal costs and decisions. We compute the average cost and quantity allocated to supplier Madrid for each fluctuation rate. Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         show the average total cost and the average quantity purchased from Madrid as a function of the fluctuation rate.

These experiments show that a company can capitalize on the currency fluctuation if this fluctuation can be predicted and known. According to Fig. 3, the higher the percentage of fluctuation is, the smaller the total purchasing cost becomes. The model determines the placement times of orders that allows taking profit during the periods when the $/€ exchange rate increases. Results from Fig. 3 explain that higher exchange rates fluctuations generate larger opportunities for optimizing the orders placement times. From Fig. 4, it is also observed that the increasing rate of fluctuation entices an increase in the quantity of products purchased from Madrid. According to our model, to capitalize on the periods when the value of the exchange rate $/€ increases, companies should purchase more products from Madrid and enhance their gains.

Therefore, the real problem faced by purchasing managers is not the fluctuation of currency exchange rates but rather the uncertainty of this fluctuation. Uncertainty will be addressed in the next section.

The proposed model adopts a scenario-based stochastic programming approach to model the uncertainties of fluctuating exchange rates in the suppliers selection problem. It is important to evaluate the relevance of such an approach. A simpler approach would be to consider the expected value problem, where the decision maker replaces all random variables by their expected values and solves a deterministic model. We can distinguish between two cases: (1) the case where the expected values of exchange rates are time-dependent (fluctuation is considered) and, (2) the case where the expected values are constant (fluctuation is not considered).

This first deterministic model is called deterministic model with fluctuations (DMF) since exchange rates are time-dependent but uncertainty is ignored. The second deterministic model is called deterministic model with constant exchange rates (DMC). We evaluate hereafter the value of the stochastic solution compared to the deterministic solutions in the above cases. It is important to note that most existing supplier selection models in the literature implicitly assume that exchange rates are constant (DMC) or fluctuating but known (DMF).

In order to measure the importance of considering the stochastic version of a model, the Value of the Stochastic Solution (VSS) has always been used in the literature. It measures the expected gain from solving a stochastic model rather than its deterministic counterpart (where all random variables are replaced by their means) (Birge, 1982).

In our case, VSS
                           =
                           Z(optimal solution of the counterpart deterministic model)−
                           Z(optimal stochastic solution). It measures the expected decrease in cost from solving the stochastic version of the suppliers selection model rather than the simpler deterministic one. Recall that Z is the objective function of the proposed stochastic model.

In order to conduct our experiments, we consider 3 forecasts of exchange rates fluctuations from each foreign currency to the standard currency over the planning horizon: the first one corresponds to the baseline forecast (Table 4) and the others are randomly generated with a maximum fluctuation rate of 20% (compared to the exchange rates of the baseline forecast). Since we have 3 foreign currencies, the total number of scenarios in the stochastic model is 33
                           =27.

As stated earlier, two deterministic models can correspond to our stochastic model: DMF and DMC. For DMF, there is only one scenario where the exchange rate from a given currency to the standard currency in a given quarter is the average value of the exchange rates of the different forecasts of this currency in this quarter weighted by the probability of each forecast. For instance, if the forecasts of exchange rates from EUR to USD are those given in the first three rows of Table 5
                           , then the exchange rates USD/EUR for DMF will be those of row 4. For instance, in the first quarter, (0.752∗0.4)+(0.793∗0.3)+(0.700∗0.3)=0.749.

For DMC, the exchange rate from a given currency to the standard currency is constant. It is computed as the average value of the exchange rates of DMF. In the example of Table 5, the exchange rate USD/EUR for DMC is 0.759 in each quarter. Indeed, (0.749+0.799+0.762+0.724)/4=0.759.

We consider different classes of instances according to the probabilities associated with the different forecasts. For instance, for the first class of instances, the baseline forecast of the exchange rates from a given foreign currency to the standard currency has a probability of 0.5 and each randomly generated forecast has a probability of 0.25. The different scenarios of the stochastic model (27 scenarios) are obtained by making all the possible combinations of the forecasts of the different currencies. The probability of each resulting scenario is calculated accordingly. Twenty instances are generated in each class. For each instance, we solve the stochastic model and the two deterministic models DMF and DMC. We then compute the VSS with regards to DMF and DMC. Given the space restrictions, we show in Table 6
                            the results for only three instances from each class.

We thought the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations is important for the supplier selection problem. Observing Table 6, we conclude that, in fact, it is. Indeed, the gains resulting from the use of stochastic solutions instead of the deterministic solution, either with or without fluctuations, can be very large. For instance, the gain with regards to DMC is above $1,000,000 in many cases. We tested 80 instances (20 instances ∗ 4 classes). For all these instances (not only those shown in Table 6), the average gains were 182,566 and 811,802 with regards to DMF and DMC, respectively. This clearly proves the importance of capturing the uncertainties of currency exchange rates fluctuations in the supplier selection problem.

As may be expected, the gain with comparison to DMC is larger than the gain compared to DMF. Many suppliers selection models in the literature consider the exchange rates to be constant. These models are clearly not suited for the global context and can lead to undertake inadequate decisions and to significantly increase the purchasing cost. The use a deterministic suppliers selection model where the fluctuations of exchange rates are considered but not the uncertainty (like the DMF) is a trade-off between capturing the currency risk and considering a simple optimization model.

It is also interesting to compare between the proposed stochastic model, DMF, and DMC in terms of purchasing decisions. From the instances of Table 6, we selected one representative instance for each class. The instances 1, 4, 7 and 11 of Table 6 were selected. In the following figures, we present the optimal solution obtained with each model and for each instance.

As shown in the figures below, the purchasing decisions are different from one model to another. Regarding instances, 1, 4, and 11, the same suppliers are selected by the different models. However, the quantity purchased from each supplier (Q
                           
                              i
                           ) is different from one case to another. In these cases, the solution of DMF is closer to the stochastic solution than the DMC solution. This is in line with the results of the previous section. Regarding instance 7, it is important to note that the stochastic model selects 3 suppliers (Cleveland, Shanghai, and Madrid) while DMF selects four suppliers. Hence, ignoring the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations in supplier selection models may lead to select a supplier that should not be selected if the currency uncertainty is considered. This proves once again the interest of our proposed model (see Figs. 5–8
                           
                           
                           
                           ).

Unlike many works in the literature, we calculate the discounts as a function of the total quantity bought by the different customer’ sites over the time horizon, irrespective of the quantity purchased by each site. In practice, we observed that many multi-sites companies are still negotiating locally with their suppliers. It is then interesting to evaluate the gain that these companies can achieve if they negotiate globally (for the requirements of the different sites) with suppliers that offer quantity discounts.

To conduct our experiments, we consider only one exchange rate fluctuation forecast for each currency (baseline forecast). We then have only one scenario. We compare the cost obtained by the proposed model (multi-site discount) to the cost given by a modified version of the model where discounts are calculated based on the quantity purchased by each site (single site discount). In this modified version, the decision variables

Transportation costs are very important in the global purchasing context. In this section, we focus on the impact of the transportation cost on the model solution. We consider only one currency exchange rate scenario (baseline forecasts). We vary the transportation costs by multiplying the transportation costs of our case study by 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc. Fig. 9
                         shows how the purchasing decisions vary with the increasing values of transportation costs.

The model solution is still unchanged when increasing the value of the transportation cost from 0.5∗baseline value to 3∗baseline value. Then, for transportation costs 4 times larger than the baseline values the quantity purchased from Shanghai decreases while the quantity allocated to Cleveland goes up. The quantity purchased from Shanghai takes the null value if the transportation costs are multiplied by 5. Thus, only a significant increase of transportation costs can lead the model to opt for local suppliers instead of distant low-cost suppliers. Clearly, this result cannot be generalized since it depends on the values of the other costs.

The difficulty with the stochastic programming model is its size and the corresponding computational difficulty required to obtain a solution. In order to evaluate the solvability of the proposed model with the commercial optimization software Cplex, we tested different classes of instances while varying the number of scenarios and their corresponding probabilities. For each class of instances, we randomly generated 20 scenarios. Experiments are conducted on an Intel Core duo 2.10GHz computer with 2.00 Go memory. We used Cplex 11.0 coupled with C++. We give in the following table the average computational time (in seconds) required to obtain the optimal solution for each class of instances.

The results of Table 8
                         show that it is possible to solve the model with Cplex in an acceptable amount of time even for relatively large instances for such a kind of problem. For instance, we were able to solve the model for our realistic case study in less than 17 mn with up to 81scenarios. However, as expected, the larger the size of the instance is the larger the computational time becomes. The use of a commercial optimization software is likely not a viable option for solving very large instances of our model. In this case, a specially tailored method needs to be developed. This is beyond the scope of the present paper.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We developed a mixed integer scenario-based stochastic programming model for the supplier selection problem in the global context. The buyer has multiple sites and sources a product from an international network of heterogenous suppliers. Suppliers offer prices in their local currencies. Exchange rates from the local currencies of suppliers to the standard currency of the buyer are subject to uncertain fluctuations over time. In addition, suppliers offer discounts as a function of the total quantity bought by the different customer’ sites over the time horizon irrespective of the quantity purchased by each site. The first-stage model decisions are which suppliers to select and which total quantity to order form each supplier over the planning horizon. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost which is given by the sum of the purchasing price, the inventory cost, the transportation cost, and the supplier management cost. In the archive literature, the suppliers selection problem has not been approached from our perspective.

We conducted a number of computational experiments on a realistic and documented case study. We experimentally supported the inclusion of exchange rates in the suppliers selection problem and showed that our model solution is sensitive to the value of exchange rates. We then evaluated the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the system cost and model decisions. We showed how the customer can capitalize on theses currencies fluctuations to decrease the total purchasing cost. Therefore, the real problem faced by purchasing managers is the uncertainty of currencies fluctuations and not the fluctuations themselves.

Our proposed model can assist managers to undertake purchasing decisions under currency fluctuations uncertainties. We then evaluated the value of the stochastic solution obtained by our scenario-based stochastic programming model compared to its deterministic counterpart when (1) there are fluctuations of exchange rates but uncertainty is ignored and (2) exchange rates are constant and uncertainty is ignored. Our results indicated that the value of the stochastic solution can be very large (over $ 1,000,000 in some cases) especially in comparison to the second deterministic model (DMC). The relevance of our model is supported.

In addition, we showed that ignoring the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations in supplier selection models may lead to select a supplier that should not be selected if the currency uncertainty is considered. Our model validated the proposition regarding the necessity of suppliers selection model that accommodate the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations in the global context.

We also evaluated the gain that a global company can achieve if it negotiates globally (for the requirements of the different sites of the company) with suppliers that offer quantity discounts rather than locally (each sites negotiates alone). We finally tested the impact of the increase of transportation costs on the suppliers selection decisions. We found out that only a large increase of these costs can lead to replace the low-cost supplier by a local supplier.

In our future research, it would be important to develop efficient methods to solve the large size instances of the proposed model for which the computational times with commercial softwares may be very large. It would be interesting to work on an efficient heuristic approach that explores and uses the specific characteristics of the model.
