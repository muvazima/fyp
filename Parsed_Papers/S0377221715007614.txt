                  The aim of this paper is to provide a new straightforward measure-free methodology based on convex hulls to determine the no-arbitrage pricing bounds of an option (European or American). The pedagogical interest of our methodology is also briefly discussed. The central result, which is elementary, is presented for a one period model and is subsequently used for multiperiod models. It shows that a certain point, called the forward point, must lie inside a convex polygon. Multiperiod models are then considered and the pricing bounds of a put option (European and American) are explicitly computed. We then show that the barycentric coordinates of the forward point can be interpreted as a martingale pricing measure. An application is provided for the trinomial model where the pricing measure has a simple geometric interpretation in terms of areas of triangles. Finally, we consider the case of entropic barycentric coordinates in a multi asset framework.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

What are the no-arbitrage bounds of a European or American put option when a two-period trinomial model is used? What can be said about the evolution of the option pricing bounds as a function of the parameters of the model? Is there any difference between the trinomial and a more general multinomial model? What are the option pricing bounds of a put option if the set of prices is a compact subset of the real line? What are the no-arbitrage bounds of a European digital option when a general continuous-time model is used?

It is the aim of the present paper to develop a straightforward, pricing measure-free approach to answer these questions at the level of difficulty comparable to the popular textbook of Hull (2011). The reason why our approach is straightforward comes from the fact that we derive the pricing bounds of a given option. In particular, we don’t make any use of the general theory of arbitrage and its consequences, the real difficult part of the story.

In the standard approach to option pricing, that will be called “universal”, one derives the consequences of no-arbitrage before envisaging the valuation of a given derivative such as an option. As is well-known, no-arbitrage means that if one can design an investment strategy (by taking positions on the existing traded financial securities) whose initial value is equal to zero at the current time, its future cash-flows can not be a positive random variable. No-arbitrage thus excludes the situation in which it is possible to make money with positive probability with a costless investment strategy. The consequences of this seemingly simple no-arbitrage condition turns out to be a very difficult mathematical problem in general because one must show that it is possible to separate the set of costless self-financing strategies from the set of positive random variables. Invoking a separation theorem when the conditions are satisfied

                        In continuous time models, no-arbitrage becomes no-free lunch to apply a separation theorem.
                     , it is shown that no-arbitrage is equivalent to the existence (but not uniqueness) of a linear functional, interpreted as a pricing probability measure

                     . However, once this measure is known (or chosen in case it is not unique), the valuation of a derivative such as a European option is a rather straightforward problem since it reduces to the computation of an expected value. For instance, if one uses a one period binomial model to price a derivative, when the pricing measure 
                        
                           Q
                           =
                           (
                           q
                           ,

                           q
                           )
                        
                      is known, one can value any derivative written on the underlying asset such as a stock. In this sense, this general approach to no-arbitrage is universal because the pricing measure 
                        Q
                      can be used to price any derivative written on the underlying asset. This approach is presented in most (more mathematically inclined) textbooks such as Bjork (2004), Elliott and Kopp (2005), Lamberton and Lapeyre (2008), Musiela and Rutkowski (1998). When we work with a finite market model (see e.g., Elliot & Kopp 2005 or Pliska 1997), as pioneered by Ritchken (1985) and Taqqu and Willinger (1987), the determination of the option pricing bounds can be done by using linear programming (Ritchken & Kuo, 1988; Musiela & Rutkowski, 1998; King, 2002; Van der Hoek & Elliott, 2006; Antonelli, Mancini, & Pinar, 2013; Camci & Pinar, 2009).

From a practical point of view, the problem is not, in general, to price any conceivable derivatives written on an underlying asset such as a stock, but to price a given derivative or a small subset of derivatives. Thus, if the difficult part is to derive the consequence of no-arbitrage in general, why not directly focus on the consequences of no-arbitrage for a given option? This is the approach which is followed in the present paper.

We consider here the case of a given option (or a linear combination of options with the same maturity), and we show that the determination of the set of arbitrage-free prices reduces to a well-known convex hull problem. In particular, the determination of the option pricing bounds does not require to use a pricing measure. Within our approach, no-arbitrage simply means that a certain point, called the forward point, must belong to the convex hull spanned by a set of points, which is either a convex polygon (incomplete market situation) or a segment (complete market situation). For a single period option pricing problem, i.e., with two dates, 0 and T > 0, the forward price is defined by the two dimensional vector (erTS
                     0; erTΠ
                     0), where S
                     0 and Π
                     0 are respectively the stock price and the option price at the current time, and the convex hull is spanned by the set of points (ST
                     (ω); ΠT
                     (ω)), where ω ∈ Ω is a state of the world (or scenario). An interesting aspect of our approach is that the underlying set of (stock) prices needs not be a finite set. For instance, if this set is a compact subset of the real line, the convex hull (of the graph of the option payoff) is still a convex polygon or a segment, and nothing is changed.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        We make the implicit assumption that ΠT
                           (ω) is finite for each ω.
                      What matters is thus not the characteristics of the set of prices, but the number of vertices of the convex hull. When this number is equal to two, the option price is unique and the market is complete. On the contrary, when it is greater (or equal) than three, the option price is not unique and the market is incomplete. For European options valued with a continuous time model (pure diffusion, jump-diffusion, infinite activity Levy), things are slightly more complex since the convex hull (of the graph of the option payoff) is not anymore a polygon, but, as we shall see, the European option pricing bounds can still be easily determined.

In a multiperiod model, the determination of the option pricing bounds requires to determine a final convex polygon (possibly a segment) which is obtained via a sequence of convex hulls. This (backward induction) process applies both to European and American options with finite maturity and never requires to use a pricing measure. While straightforward, the case of many periods can be tedious from a computational point of view. As a result, we illustrate our geometric approach using a two period model, where all the computation can be easily done without a computer. For simplicity, as in Boyle (1988) or Broadie and Detemple (2004), we consider the case of a trinomial model to value European but also American options. We are able to explicitly compute the pricing bounds as a function of the parameters of the trinomial model. As already said, this entails to determine a sequence of convex hulls, and thus does not make any use of a pricing measure. Since we end up with a convex polygon (possibly a segment) the forward point can be expressed as a convex combination of its vertices. The non-negative coefficients of such a combination, although generally not unique, define a local system of coordinates with respect to the vertices, and are called the barycentric coordinates.

                        Cartesian coordinates is a system of coordinates for the representation of a point in an n-dimensional space in terms of its distance, measured along a set of mutually axes, from a given origin. On the other hand, barycentric coordinates locate points relative to a set of existing points rather than an origin. For this reason, they are called local coordinates. See for instance the textbook of Vince (2010) and more specifically chapter 11 devoted to barycentric coordinates.
                      Let us denote by 
                        Q
                      the barycentric coordinates of the forward point. It becomes elementary to show that the discounted stock price, but also the discounted value of the option, are 
                        Q
                     -martingales, which means that the barycentric coordinates 
                        Q
                      can be interpreted as a martingale measure. Illustrations are provided for the case of a single period trinomial model for which the barycentric coordinates of a point inside a convex polygon are unique, which does of course not mean that the option price is unique. It is important to realize that within our approach, the pricing measure 
                        Q
                      critically depends on the derivative (call, put digital etc.) under consideration and is, in general, not equivalent to the underlying statistical measure 
                        P
                      due to the fact that many points are not relevant. However, it turns out that there are barycentric coordinates (that maximize an entropy function) for which 
                        Q
                      becomes equivalent to 
                        P
                     . This more technical material is presented in the last section of this paper in a multi assets framework.

The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. The first section is devoted to the assumptions. The second and third section are respectively devoted to the determination of the option pricing bounds and to the barycentric coordinates, interpreted as martingale measures. Since we offer a new elementary geometric approach, we made the choice to present the main results as propositions, and all the other elementary results as facts. Twenty facts are presented.

                     Dupačovà, Consigli, and Wallace (2000) introduced a framework intended for multistage stochastic programs (see also King, 2002 for an option pricing application) called scenario tree which encompasses recombining and non-recombining trees. It is used by Antonelli et al. (2013), Camci and Pinar (2009) and King (2002) for option pricing and they all consider the case in which the tree is non-recombining, i.e., in which each node at each time has a unique parent. In this paper, we consider the case in which the tree is recombining, i.e., in which each node may have more than one parent. This allows us to consider for instance a multiplicative multinomial stochastic process but it should be clear that our methodology holds indeed for any type of trees, recombining or not.

                     . In particular, the increments of S need not be stationary and/or independent, and S need not be a Markovian process. Actually, it is even not necessary to consider explicitly a stochastic process. The only features which need to be specified are the tree and the way information is revealed over time. Once again, the multiplicative model we consider is for the sake of simplicity only. While the contribution of our paper is theoretical (or methodological), there is also an important empirical literature on “implied trees”, see for instance the paper by Moriggia, Muzzioli, and Torricelli (2009).

Since it is our aim to provide a straightforward self-contained approach to derive the no-arbitrage option pricing bounds, we recall the definition of an arbitrage. Let 
                        
                           V
                           t
                           P
                        
                      be the value of the portfolio 
                        P
                      at time t ∈ {0, T}.

                        Definition 1
                        It is said that 
                              P
                            is an arbitrage portfolio if it satisfies the two conditions.

                              
                                 •

                                             T
                                             P
                                          
                                          
                                             (
                                             ω
                                             )
                                          
                                          ≥
                                          0
                                          ,
                                       
                                     where the inequality is strict for at least one ω ∈ Ω.

The above definition says that in the worst scenario in which

                              P
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                      (i.e., it is costless to form the portfolio 
                        P
                     ) the value of the portfolio at time T > 0 is positive with positive probability and zero with the complementary probability. It is important to realize that a situation in which there is no arbitrage opportunity can still be consistent with the existence of a “statistical arbitrage”. To see this, assume that 
                        
                           
                              V
                              0
                              P
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                      and that 
                        
                           E
                           (
                           
                              V
                              T
                              P
                           
                           )

                      is (very) large. The fact that the expected value of the portfolio is very high is consistent with no-arbitrage as long as there is a positive probability that 
                        
                           V
                           T

                      will be negative. For instance, if there is a single state of nature 
                        ω
                      ∈Ω such that

                      no matter how small are these two quantities, 
                        P
                      is not an arbitrage but can be interpreted as a statistical arbitrage.

                        See for instance the recent paper of Geyer, Hanke, and Weissensteiner (2014) in which they construct scenarios of financial assets returns (for portfolios) which are arbitrage-free.
                     
                  

Consider the case of a single-period model in which

                        . Note that the convex hull Γ is simply a convex polygon and that the number of vertices is at least equal to two and at most equal to N. We shall see later on that for call and put options, when N ≥ 5, i.e., the stock price can take at least five different values, the number of vertices of the convex polygon Γ is at most equal to four. In what follows, we shall denote by

                               is a vertex of Γ is denoted by Hf
                               ≔ H.

When one considers the so-called binomial model to value an option (call, put), Γ always reduces to a segment. However, when one considers say a trinomial model to value the option, Γ may be a convex polygon, indeed a triangle. We now define the forward point, which will be of critical importance in the rest of this paper. Let Π
                        0 be the price of the option under consideration at time

Since r, T, and S
                        0 are known, the only unknown is Π
                        0. The next proposition, although elementary to prove, is the core of our approach and will be applied to multi-period models.

                        Fig. 1 considers the case of an option which could be thought of as a “generalized” bull spread while Fig. 2 shows, among other things, the convex hull of the graph of that option (there are five vertices). When F
                        0 lies outside the (interior) of Γ, from Proposition 1, there must exist an arbitrage opportunity. To see how this arbitrage can be implemented, note that when F
                        0 ∉ Int(Γ), there exists a line 
                           D

                        0 from Int(Γ). On Fig. 2, the equation of this line

In Ritchken (1985), Ritchken and Kuo (1988) and Taqqu and Willinger (1987) Section 5, (see also the Appendix B in the textbook of Van der Hoek & Elliott, 2006), the option pricing bounds are derived using linear programming. Compared to Ritchken (1985) and the subsequent literature that rely on stochastic programming (e.g., King, 2002, Camci & Pinar, 2009), we use an approach which is based on convex hulls rather than on optimization. It offers the main advantage that one can also consider the case in which the set of prices has the cardinality of the continuum. It must however be noted that, in Proposition 2 (iii) p. 1225, by passing to the limit of continuous states, Ritchken (1985) is able to determine the lower bound for the particular case of a call option.

Note that from Proposition 1, we know that the forward price must lie in the interior of the convex hull. As a result, it must be the case erT
                         ∈ (d; u).

                               if there are no arbitrage opportunities, then, d < er
                               < u.

We now discuss the two situations one can have, i.e., Γ is a segment and Γ is a polygon.

                               from an option pricing bounds point of view, the multinominal model can be reduced to a trinomial one, i.e.,

From the above fact, it should be clear that when one uses the trinomial model

                         if we set u high enough, then, the determination of the set of arbitrage-free prices is not subject to any model risk.

                         are always connected. This needs however not be true in general see e.g., Fig. 2. As a simple consequence of the above fact, for calls and puts, 
                           
                              I
                              0
                           
                         is close to zero when erT
                         is close to d or close to u. Put it differently, when the option is deeply in (or deeply out of) the money, everything is as if the market was (almost) complete for that option.


                        What happens if the set of prices has the cardinality of the

                        where ζ is a positive random variable whose realization will be known at time T. Assume now that the set of possible realizations of the random variable ζ is the compact subset 
                           
                              Ξ

                        . Put it differently, the highest possible value of ζ is u and the lowest is d. Let 
                           
                              K

                         be the strike price of the option f, where m is a positive constant. Whether the option f is a call or a put, from Fact 4, it is easy to see that the vertices of the convex hull Γ are (dS
                        0, f(dS
                        0)), (mS
                        0, f(mS
                        0)) and (uS
                        0, f(uS
                        0)) if Γ is a polygon (see Fig. 5
                         for the case of a call option), and (dS
                        0, f(dS
                        0)), and (uS
                        0, f(uS
                        0)) if Γ is a segment. In such a situation, while the set of prices has the cardinality of the continuum, everything is as if, from an option pricing bounds point of view, we were working with a binomial or a trinomial model.

                               one can restrict the model to a trinomial one, i.e.,

                              .

The above fact and the previous discussion highlight the fact that, from an option pricing bounds point of view, what matters is not per se the properties of the set of prices (i.e., finite, denumerable, with cardinality of the continuum) but the number of vertices of the convex polygon Γ. Since the number of vertices of a (convex) polygon is finite, considering a set of prices which is a compact subset of 
                           
                              R
                              +
                           
                         is irrelevant from an option pricing bounds point of view.

Consider now the case set of possible realizations of ζ is 
                           
                              
                                 R
                                 +
                              
                              ,
                           
                         i.e., there is no upper bound to the stock price. This case is a slightly more difficult because the convex hull of the graph of the payoff of a European option is not anymore a polygon. But one can still determine the pricing bounds by using exactly the same methodology. To see this, let us consider the case of a put, call, and a binary option. Recall that the payoff of a European digital (i.e., binary) option is simply equal to the indicator function 
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                       T
                                    
                                    ≥
                                    K
                                 
                              
                              ,
                           
                         that is, zero if the stock price is lower than the strike, and one on the other case. The following fact provides the lower and the upper option pricing bounds by using Proposition 1. The aim of the following fact is not necessarily to provide new results but to show how Proposition 1 can be used when the convex hull is not anymore a polygon.

                           See for instance the textbook of Hull (2011), chapter 10 or the textbook of Sundaram and Das (2011), chapter 9. From the above fact, one can immediately deduce that the pricing bounds of a call (put) option is a non-decreasing (non-increasing) function of the risk-free rate r
                           
                         As far as we know, the pricing bounds of the digital option is new.

It is however important to note that the option pricing bounds given in Fact 7 are model-free because the unique obvious assumption which is made is that the stock price is positive (possibly zero) at maturity, i.e.,

                        ), we then obtain the so-called Black–Scholes model and we know that the option price is unique. The Black-Scholes price thus must lie somewhere between the model-free option pricing bounds and it is an easy exercise to show that this is indeed the case. There is however no contradiction between the no-arbitrage bounds found in the above fact and the uniqueness of the Black–Scholes price. Our approach only considers the set of realizations of the random variable ζ (i.e., only the support of the underlying probability measure 
                           P
                         plays a role, and not all the other characteristics of 
                           P
                        ). As a consequence, whether ζ is log-normally distributed or not is simply irrelevant since our approach is unable to make a distinction between two (probability) models as long as the set of realizations of ζ is 
                           
                              
                                 R

                              ,
                           
                         i.e., ST
                         ≥ 0. Our (geometric) approach of no-arbitrage thus does not allow us to prove uniqueness of an (European) option price in the particular case in which ζ is log-normally distributed.

                           Actually, what is fundamental in the Black-Scholes model is the notions of dynamic replication and self-financing strategies. These two notions play no role in this paper.
                         However, if the set of realizations of ζ is a compact subset of the real line, then, as we shall now see, the option pricing bounds can be reduced.

                         will be greater than s. As a result, the support of the underling probability measure is

                         which obviously makes no financial sense. Consider now the case in which the set of possible realizations of ζ is the compact subset [d; u]. Once d and u are specified, since S
                        0 is the current observed price, one can determine the option pricing bounds. For instance, if one assumes that 
                           
                              d

                         (i.e., the default of the issuer of the stock is not excluded), and u > 0, i.e., the set of realizations of ζ is [0, u], this may considerably reduce the bounds of the option. To see this, consider for example an at-the-money call option with maturity one year, i.e.,

                         this means that the (annual log) return of the stock can not be greater than 300%, which is a rather optimistic bound. In such a case, the upper bound of the call is now equal to

                        Teaching implications. Most if not all (finance) textbooks begin option pricing in discrete time models using the binomial model and then turn to the so-called continuous-time Black–Scholes model in which the underlying stochastic process is log-normal. In both cases, the option price is unique. While this approach allows students to understand the basics of option pricing, it fails to deliver the important message that the no-arbitrage option price is rarely unique because markets are in reality incomplete for various financial reasons (e.g., volatility risk, jumps risk, trading constraints on the underlying asset). However, since the general treatment of incomplete markets is too complex to be taught at an introductory level, one focuses on complete markets and consider only the binomial model.

                           The excellent textbook of Van der Hoek and Elliot 2006 is an exception since it is devoted to the binomial model but in appendix B, it also contains a general approach to incomplete markets within single period set-up. As has been shown by Ritchken (1985), (see also Taqqu & Willinger, 1987), the determination of the option pricing bounds for a single period model requires to use the duality theorem of linear programming and this is probably too advanced for an undergraduate first course on option pricing.
                         Only few textbooks even mentioned the trinomial model, but when this is done, the treatment is word of caution rather than a general analysis.

                           Consider for instance the case of two excellent textbooks. Back (2005) considers the trinomial model and shows that the problem is more complex since one can not, in general, perfectly replicate the payoff of the option when using a trinomial model. Sundaram and Das (2011) mention the trinomial model in an exercise (p. 248) and only remark that this is difficult.
                        
                     

We claim that our new methodological approach allows to directly start within an incomplete markets framework since there is no “gap of difficulty” between the binomial, the trinomial or even a multinomial model. By starting option pricing using the no-arbitrage principle within the geometric approach proposed in this paper, one may start with a trinomial model, use Proposition 1, and shows the students that the option price (e.g., call or put) is in general not unique. Moreover, one can easily shows the students how the difference between the upper and the lower bound vary with the parameters, i.e., d, m, u but also with the strike K. It is only in the particular case in which the convex polygon is a segment, as is the case for a binomial model, that the price is unique. From a pedagogical point of view, in such a situation, this provides a very natural opportunity to introduce a new concept, namely perfect replication. In the particular case in which the arbitrage-free price of the option is unique, then, the payoff (of the option) can be perfectly replicated with the traded assets. Note that, all this can be done without using the notion of a risk-neutral probability measure.

                         and then to check that the forward point lies in the interior of Γ. In a two period model, i.e.,

                         the logic is similar, we now have to determine a sequence of convex hulls.

Whether the option is of European or American type, we work backwards to determine the option pricing bounds. Since

                            we thus start the algorithm at time

                            one must thus repeat this operation N times. Once we get the set of forward points (a subset of them may be unique), one must now once again construct the convex hull spanned by this set of forward points, and this provides the “final” convex polygon denoted Γ. Applying once again Proposition 1 but now seen from time

                                 If the exercise value of the American option is equal (or lower) to the lower bound of the European option, then, the American pricing bounds remain identical to the European one.

If the exercise value of the American option is between the lower and the upper bound of the European option, then, only the lower pricing bound increases.

If the exercise value of the American option is higher than the upper bound of the European option, then, the option pricing bound reduces to one point, the exercise value.

The following fact summarizes the above discussion and also covers the situation in which the price of the European option is unique.

We shall now provide an illustration of how the recursion algorithm works. For notational simplicity, we shall assume that

                            and for the sake of interest, we shall consider at-the-money put option, i.e., with strike price

                           . As a result, it is never optimal to exercise the option at time 
                              
                                 t

                           . In Chockalingam and Muthuraman (2015), they also consider the pricing problem of an American option (i.e., they present a method to solve the free boundary problem) but they focus on continuous time models while we focus on discrete models.)

                         with T ≥ 3. To determine the option pricing bounds, it suffices to use a recursion algorithm similar to the one used for the two-period case. One reiterate this analysis for each node of the tree, starting from time T to time 0, and this entails to determining a sequence of convex hulls. As in the two-period case, this backward induction process leads to a final convex polygon denoted Γ, and the forward point (erTS
                        0; erTΠ
                        0) must lies once again in the interior of Γ. Unless Γ is a segment, this leads to the lower and the upper bound. As has been said, since our methodology holds for any types of trees, we don’t precise the tree used, recombining or not etc.

                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              . The determination of the option pricing bounds requires thus to determine a sequence of convex hulls.

In a finite market model, following the approach pioneered in Ritchken (1985) and in Ritchken and Kuo (1988), it is common to determine the option pricing bounds using linear programming (e.g., Antonelli et al., 2013, Camci & Pinar, 2009, Flȧm 2008, King, 2002, Musiela and Rutkowski, 1998, pp. 90–93, Pinar, Salih, & Camci, 2010). As in the general continuous time models, one is lead to take the infinum and the supremum over the set of martingale measures to find the lower and the upper bound respectively (
                           Π
                           0
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 Π
                                 0
                              
                              ¯
                           
                        ), also called the buyer and the seller’s price. Within our approach, not only we don’t need to introduce the buyer and the seller’s price, and the determination of 
                           Π
                           0
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 Π
                                 0
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         never requires to use a probability measure.

                           Fact 13
                           The determination of the option pricing bounds never requires to use a pricing measure nor does it require to make a distinction between the seller’s price or the buyer’s price.

It is important to point out once again that the price paid for this (conceptual) simplicity is that we derive the no-arbitrage bounds of a given option only. Our approach does not allow to derive the consequence of no-arbitrage in general.

From Fact 12, it should be clear that the number of vertices of the (final) polygon Γ (obtained by backward induction) is not known ex ante. Given a tree, the convex hull Γ will most likely be a polygon, i.e., with at least three vertices. However, if we consider the case of a recombining tree in which each node (for any date) generates only two children, we obtain the so-called multiplicative binomial model. In such a case, as is well-known, Γ reduces to a segment and the option price is unique. Within our framework, from an option pricing point of view, what counts is not per se the number of children of a given node of the tree, but the number of vertices of the convex hull. The characterization of complete market for a given option can be given as follows.

                           Fact 14
                           For a given option, the price is unique if and only if, at each node of the tree, the convex hull reduces to a segment, i.e., if the number of vertices of the convex hull is equal to two.

There are various algorithms to determine the convex hull of a set of points and it is well-known that if there are m ≥ 2 points of 
                           
                              
                                 R
                                 2
                              
                              ,
                           
                         the computation time to determine the convex hull is O(mln (m)), see e.g., chapter 3 of the textbook of O’Rourke (2004) for a presentation of various algorithms (e.g., the so-called divide and conquer algorithm) or the paper of Graham and Yao (1983). However, for basic options such as call and put, the determination of the convex hull is trivial and thus does not require any algorithm. Consider the specific case of a recombining trinomial model in which ζt
                         ∈ {d, 1, u} for all 
                           
                              t
                              ∈
                              T
                           
                         and let 
                           
                              C
                              =
                              1
                           
                         be the normalized cost associated to the determination of one convex hull (and the two option pricing bounds at a given time t for a given node).

                           Fact 15
                           Consider the valuation of an option using a trinomial model. Let n ≥ 3 be the number of periods. The computation time to determine the option pricing bounds is O(n
                              2).

So far, we have shown how to determine the lower and the upper bound of a European or American option without introducing a pricing measure. The aim of this section is now to show how a pricing measure can naturally be introduced within our approach. We have already seen that the sequence of convex hulls leads to a final convex polygon Γ, whether the option is European or American style. It turns out that a point P
                     0 that lies inside the convex polygon Γ can be expressed as a convex combination of its vertices vi
                     , where the weights qi
                     (P
                     0), for i ∈ H are called barycentric coordinates. Recall that H is the set of indices such that vi
                      is a vertex of Γ. As we shall now see, the barycentric coordinates will play the role of a pricing (martingale) measure.

The fundamental feature of barycentric coordinates is that they locate points relative to an existing set of points rather than to an origin, as it is the case for Cartesian or polar coordinates. For this reason, barycentric coordinates are sometimes called local coordinates. The following definition of barycentric coordinates is adapted from Floater, Hormann, and Kos (2006).

                        1, v
                        2,…, vN
                        . When

                         the polygon reduces to a triangle, and the barycentric coordinates of a given point P
                        0 in the triangle are unique. When N ≥ 4, the barycentric coordinates are not anymore unique, which means that, for a given point P
                        0 in the convex polygon, there is not a unique set of functions

                         such that the three properties of Definition 4 hold. A well-known example of barycentric coordinates are the Wachpress coordinates but this (Wachpress) system of barycentric coordinates is far from being unique. Quite recently, Floater et al. (2006) have developed a general construction of barycentric coordinates over convex polygons. The choice of a system of barycentric coordinates can be compared with the choice of a numéraire or a currency. A point in a polygon can be expressed by using different system of barycentric coordinates but they all represent the same thing.

                        Eqs. (13) and (14) just reflect the so-called martingality of the (discounted) stock price but also of the (discounted) option price, which means that 
                           Q
                         can thus be interpreted as a martingale measure. Note interestingly that our geometric approach yields the so-called linear pricing rule as a result. The following definition has been borrowed from Musiela and Rutkowski (1998).

                        Proposition 1 bis provides a very simple way, for a given option, to prove the equivalence between the absence of arbitrage and the existence of a generalized martingale measure. This contrasts with the universal (no-arbitrage) approach in which no arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent martingale measure. The reason why we obtain a generalized martingale measure is easy to understand. When we consider a single option, we have seen that say for call or put, in general, some prices Si
                         are simply irrelevant. For such points,

                                 )
                              
                           
                         is not a vertex of the convex polygon (i.e., i ∉ H) and is such that its weight is equal to zero.

                           In the next sub-section, we shall show that one can still find a system of barycentric coordinates, called entropic barycentric coordinates, which is such that 
                                 Q
                               is equivalent to 
                                 P
                              . We do this for a single period model in a general framework with d ≥ 2 stocks.
                         Within our approach, since we consider a single option, the pricing measure consistent with no-arbitrage is (in general) a generalized martingale measure and not an equivalent martingale measure. In the classical approach to no-arbitrage (called universal in this paper), since any conceivable options written on the underlying asset can be valued, it is clear that if 
                           Q
                         is not an equivalent martingale measure, one can design simple options for which there will be an arbitrage strategy.

This is the simplest case one can consider since the convex polygon Γ (i.e., the convex hull of the graph of the payoff) is either a segment or a triangle. For the sake of interest, we shall consider the case in which Γ is a triangle.

                           If the market quotes an option price Π
                              0 (e.g., put option), from uniqueness of the barycentric coordinates, 
                                 Q
                               becomes unique, and the market is thus complete.

From a financial point of view, this simply means that we now have an additional asset, the option. As a result, we have three states of the world and three traded assets; the market is complete, and the pricing measure 
                           Q
                         is unique.

In the previous section, we have shown that barycentric coordinates can play the role of a martingale measure. However, in general, the martingale measure is not equivalent to the statistical measure. We now show that one can indeed design barycentric coordinates to obtain an equivalent martingale measure. This Section is probably less elementary than the previous ones. We now explicitly consider the case in which there is a finite number d ≥ 1 stocks denoted by

                         (1957). In other words, the proof of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (in the discrete case) which asserts the existence of a martingale measure in a market with no arbitrage is already contained in the founding article of Jaynes (1957) which establishes a link between information theory and thermodynamics.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper has shown a novel (straightforward) geometric measure-free approach to determine the option pricing bounds in discrete time models. It fundamentally requires to determine a sequence of convex hulls but does not require to use a pricing measure. We have also shown how barycentric coordinates can play the role of a (martingale) pricing measure if one wants to introduce such a measure. One of the main conclusion of the present paper is that what really matters, from an option pricing point of view, is not the characteristics of the set of prices, but rather the number of vertices of the convex polygon. As already said in the paper, we believe that our approach may also have interesting consequences from a teaching point of view as it allows one to directly start introductory courses on option pricing in the incomplete markets case.

                           0 ∉ Int(Γ), the investment strategy considered is an arbitrage, and this concludes the first part of the proof. Assume now that there is an arbitrage. This means that it is possible to create a (δ, β) investment strategy such that Eqs. (27) and (28) are satisfied for at least one i, i.e., there exists a line that separates the forward point F
                           0 from Int(Γ). But this means that F
                           0 lies on the boundary of Γ or lies outside Γ, that is F
                           0 ∉ Int(Γ)□
