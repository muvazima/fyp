                  This paper presents a stochastic analysis of the transform-domain least-mean-square (TDLMS) algorithm operating in a nonstationary environment (time-varying plant) with real-valued correlated Gaussian input data, from which the analysis for the stationary environment follows as a special case. In this analysis, accurate model expressions are derived describing the transformed mean weight-error behavior, learning curve, transformed weight-error covariance matrix, steady-state excess mean-square error (EMSE), misadjustment, step size for minimum EMSE, degree of nonstationarity, as well as a relationship between misadjustment and degree of nonstationarity. Based on these model expressions, the impact of the algorithm parameters on its performance is discussed, clarifying the behavior of the algorithm vis-à-vis the nonstationary environment considered. Simulation results for the TDLMS algorithm are shown by using the discrete cosine transform, which confirm the accuracy of the proposed model for both transient and steady-state phases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most powerful and well-known adaptive algorithms is the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm [1]. Due to its features of low computational complexity and robustness for a wide range of operating conditions, this algorithm has been successfully used in many practical applications [2–5]. However, it is well known that, depending on the correlation level of the input data (i.e., eigenvalue spread of the input autocorrelation matrix), the LMS algorithm has its convergence rate compromised [1–5]. Aiming to overcome this drawback of the LMS algorithm, different strategies have been proposed and studied in the open literature [2–19]. Such strategies generally lead to better performance at the expense of a substantial increase in the computational load (for details, see [5]). Nevertheless, in many practical applications, it is important to consider the tradeoff between computational complexity and convergence rate. To meet this challenge, the transform-domain LMS (TDLMS) algorithm [6] arises as an interesting alternative to the LMS algorithm. The TDLMS is obtained by including a preprocessing stage into the LMS [2,4,6]. This preprocessing performs an orthogonal transformation on the input data followed by power normalization [2,17]. Such an approach aims to reduce the correlation level of the input data, thus enhancing the algorithm convergence rate for correlated data [5,6]. Hence, taking into consideration the practical applicability of the TDLMS algorithm, its stochastic model becomes an interesting tool to predict the algorithm behavior under different operating conditions.

In short, stochastic models can provide a comprehensive understanding as well as useful insights into the algorithm behavior [20], permitting one to identify undesired behavior and to modify the algorithm aiming to overcome such a problem or even improve its performance under specific operating conditions [21]. Moreover, having model expressions at hand, the use of extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for tuning the algorithm parameters as well as assessing its performance can be avoided [19–25], saving time spent on simulations. However, the analysis of adaptive algorithms has brought to light some mathematical challenges, which are mostly circumvented by the use of simplifying assumptions [5,25]. In general, accurate models require as few as possible simplifying assumptions, implying more mathematical difficulties during their development. Thereby, depending on the kind of assumptions used, there is a tradeoff between the difficulty of the involved mathematics and the accuracy of the obtained model.

Concerning the TDLMS algorithm, it is important to mention that most of the analyses presented so far in the literature focus exclusively on the case of a stationary environment [6,8,9,14,26,27]. On the other hand, the analysis of the TDLMS algorithm considering a nonstationary environment (i.e., a time-varying plant) has only been addressed in a few research works [15,25]. In [15], a modified power estimator is used in the TDLMS, leading to a model particularized for such a modified algorithm. Moreover, [15] assumes that the output of each transformation branch is a sequence of statistically independent samples [16], which significantly compromises the accuracy of the obtained model (especially, in the transient phase). In [25], model expressions for predicting the steady-state excess mean-square error (EMSE) of some key algorithms (including the TDLMS) have been derived. Nevertheless, particularly for the TDLMS algorithm, the model expressions presented there are not accurate (see [25, Fig. 11]). In addition, even with respect to the steady-state algorithm behavior, the results obtained in [25] have not been properly discussed. Therefore, a complete and accurate analysis of the TDLMS algorithm operating in a nonstationary environment remains an open problem.

Another important aspect in the analysis of the TDLMS algorithm resides in the determination of expected values in the form

                      and when the input data is weakly correlated. Therefore, the determination of accurate analytical expressions for computing such expected values is still an open issue.

In this context, focusing on the analysis of the TDLMS algorithm operating in a nonstationary environment (time-varying plant), the present research work has the following goals:
                        
                           i)
                           to determine analytical solutions for expected values in the form of (1) considering real-valued correlated Gaussian input data;

to obtain model expressions describing the transformed mean weight-error behavior, learning curve, and transformed weight-error covariance matrix;

to derive model expressions for the EMSE in steady state, misadjustment, step size for minimum EMSE, degree of nonstationarity as well as a relationship between misadjustment and degree of nonstationarity; and

to discuss how the algorithm parameters affect its performance.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the rule used to obtain time-varying plants characterizing the nonstationary environment considered and introduces the TDLMS algorithm. Section 3 derives the proposed model and discusses how the algorithm parameters affect its performance. In Section 4, simulation results are shown and discussed, aiming to assess the accuracy of the proposed model under different operating scenarios. Finally, Section 5 presents concluding remarks.

In this section, a brief description of the nonstationary environment considered in the development of the proposed model is firstly presented. Next, the general expressions describing the TDLMS algorithm are introduced.

A fundamental feature of adaptive filters is its capability to track variations of the underlying signal statistics in the surrounding environment. Hence, it is important to develop stochastic models characterizing the tracking capability of adaptive algorithms in nonstationary environments [5]. In this context, a plant (system to be identified) exhibiting a time-varying behavior is used here to describe the nonstationary environment considered [1–5]. For simplicity, we assume that the plant undergoes random variations according to a first-order Markov process, which is described by the following rule [4,5,32]:

In the literature, it is usually assumed that the value of parameter α in (3) is very close to 1 [3–5]; thus, the first-order Markov process [given by (3)] can be simplified (making 
                           α
                           =
                           1
                        ) to the commonly used random-walk model [3,33]. On the other hand, instead of simplifying (3) to the random-walk model as done in [15] and [25], we have preferred to keep α as a free parameter in the development presented here. Thereby, since the proposed model is not restricted to a specific value of α, the condition in which (3) reduces to the random-walk model (i.e., 
                           α
                           =
                           1
                        ) follows as a special case. Note also that, making 
                           α
                           =

In order to track variations of the plant weights, an adaptive filter of the same order is used (see Fig. 1
                        ). This adaptive filter has its weights updated by the TDLMS algorithm (see Fig. 2
                        ), which is given by [2,6]

Now, we proceed to derive model expressions describing the algorithm behavior, taking into account the nonstationary environment considered and the particulars of the TDLMS algorithm. Specifically, in this section, model expressions for the transformed mean weight-error behavior, learning curve, and transformed weight-error covariance matrix are firstly derived. Then, model expressions for the steady-state EMSE, misadjustment, step size for minimum EMSE, degree of nonstationarity, as well as a relationship between misadjustment and degree of nonstationarity are also obtained. Based on these expressions, we still discuss how the algorithm parameters affect its performance.

Therefore, from the model expression (13), along with (14) and (19)–(24), the transformed mean weight-error behavior of the TDLMS algorithm can be predicted.

For the TDLMS algorithm, an expression describing the learning curve can be obtained by substituting (9) into (8), and using (11), which results in

                         obtained as in [27]. Thereby, despite the use of the AP for obtaining the off-diagonal elements, matrix S is computed here in a more accurate way than that given in [27] (see Section 4.3).

Finally, taking into account the proposed solutions for P given by (19)–(24) and S given by (46)–(48), along with the model expressions (26), (42), (44), and (45), the algorithm learning curve is completely characterized.

                        , the misadjustment of the TDLMS algorithm is affected by the choice of the transformation matrix T.

In order to clarify the impact of the plant variation speed on the adaptive algorithm, Fig. 3
                         plots the model expressions (63)–(65) as a function of the parameters α [Fig. 3(a)] and

                                 ϕ

                         [Fig. 3(b)]. (The remaining parameter values are the same as used later in Example 1 of Section 4.1, considering 40 dB SNR.) Notice from these figures that the misadjustment 
                           M
                         is a convex function with respect to μ; consequently, there is a step-size value that leads to the minimum misadjustment 
                           M
                        . Particularly, observe from Fig. 3(a) that, for values of α close to 1, small misadjustment values are achieved by using intermediate step sizes; in contrast, as α is decreased, small misadjustment values are attained with small step sizes (μ tending to 0). In turn, notice from Fig. 3(b) that, for α close to 1, intermediate step sizes are required to attain the minimum misadjustment 
                           M
                         over a wide range of values of

                         is the incremental output variation. Note that the numerator of (72) characterizes the average power introduced by the plant variation and the denominator denotes the minimum MSE [3].

Regarding the numerator of (72), pre-multiplying both sides of (3) by T, substituting the resulting expression into (73), taking the expected value of both sides, and considering Assumptions A3 and A4, we obtain

Here, aiming to provide some insights on the conditions in which the adaptive filter would be able to properly track variations of the plant weight vector, we obtain an expression relating the degree of nonstationarity

                           M
                        . Thus, substituting (11) into (49), using (3), and considering Assumption A3, the EMSE is firstly rewritten as

Now, aiming to assess the accuracy of the proposed model, some examples are presented considering a system identification problem (see Fig. 1). In these examples, MC simulations obtained by averaging 200 independent runs are compared with results obtained from model predictions. For these examples, a zero-mean correlated Gaussian input signal with unit variance is used (see Assumption A1), which is obtained from an AR(2) process given by

                               shows the learning curves obtained for both SNR values. From these figures, a very good match between MC simulations and the proposed model is verified for both transient and steady-state phases.


                        
                           Example 2
                           In this example, considering also a nonstationary environment, the accuracy of the proposed model is assessed for different filter lengths and eigenvalue spreads of the input autocorrelation matrix. To this end, we now consider filters with

                              , aiming to assure the algorithm stability, with the remaining parameter values being the same as in Example 1. The results obtained for this scenario are depicted in Fig. 8
                              , in which a very good match between MC simulations and model predictions can be verified for these larger filter lengths and both SNR values considered. Note also that the proposed model performs well even for higher eigenvalue spreads, ratifying the accuracy of the methodology used to compute matrices P and S.

                           Here, the accuracy of the model expression describing the steady-state EMSE is verified in a nonstationary environment for different step-size values.

                              ) lead to higher steady-state EMSE values due to the tracking lag. On the other hand, slow time-varying plants (obtained by decreasing

                              ) lead to lower steady-state EMSE values [see Figs. 9(e) and (f)]. Specifically in Figs. 9(c) and (f), notice that under certain conditions there exists an intermediate step-size value for minimum EMSE. Therefore, these results come from confirming the discussion presented in Sections 3.5 and 3.6.


                        
                           Example 4
                           This example has three main goals, namely: a) to assess the accuracy of the proposed model (via learning curve) in a stationary environment (
                                 α
                                 =
                                 1
                               and 
                                 
                                    
                                       σ
                                    
                                    
                                       ϕ
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 0
                              ); b) to verify the impact of the value of M on the model accuracy; and c) to compare the proposed model with that given in [27], which is derived exclusively using the AP. To this end, two different values of M are used, i.e., 
                                 M
                                 =
                                 8
                               and 
                                 M
                                 =
                                 64
                              , whereas parameters N and μ are the same as in Example 1. The results obtained for this scenario are shown in Fig. 10
                              . Notice that the model given in [27] does not properly predict the algorithm behavior during the transient phase for small values of M; according to [27], satisfactory results are obtained for 
                                 M
                                 >
                                 30
                              . On the other hand, the proposed model exhibits very good accuracy for both transient and steady-state phases, irrespective of the value of M. Moreover, observe that the steady-state EMSE is smaller than that achieved in the nonstationary case (see Fig. 7), ratifying the discussion presented in Section 3.5.

In this section, simulation results are shown aiming to verify the validity of approximations (35)–(37). Such results are obtained by considering the scenario described in Example 1 for the case of 40 dB SNR, using 
                           M
                           =
                           8
                         and 
                           M
                           =
                           64
                        . These results are depicted in Figs. 11–13
                        
                        
                        ; in particular, Fig. 11 illustrates the accuracy of the first four elements on the main diagonal of (35) for both 
                           M
                           =
                           8
                         and 
                           M
                           =
                           64
                        . From the presented plots, we verify the reasonability of the approximation used, which is confirmed by the very good match between the curves obtained by MC simulations of

                        . In Figs. 12 and 13, the same presentation pattern of Fig. 11 is repeated for the approximations given by (36) and (37), respectively. Regarding Fig. 13(a), notice that (37) is less accurate for 
                           M
                           =
                           8
                        , becoming better as the value of M is increased [see Fig. 13(b)]. Therefore, observe that the approximations used in the model development exhibit satisfactory accuracy for both values of M considered.

Here, simulation results are presented in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed solutions for matrices P [given by (19)–(24)] and S [given by (46)–(48)] in comparison with those solutions obtained by using the AP in [27]. Such results, shown in Fig. 14
                        , are obtained by considering the same parameter values as in Example 1. From this figure, one verifies that the proposed approach for computing both P and S exhibits very good accuracy, i.e., a very good match between the results obtained by MC simulations and the proposed solutions. However, the same accuracy cannot be verified by means of the results obtained from [27].

In this paper, a stochastic model for the TDLMS algorithm operating in a nonstationary environment (time-varying plant) was presented, from which a model for a stationary environment follows as a special case. Specifically, we derived model expressions for the transformed mean weight-error behavior, learning curve, transformed weight-error covariance matrix, steady-state EMSE, misadjustment, step size for minimum EMSE, degree of nonstationarity, as well as a relationship between misadjustment and degree of nonstationarity. Based on these model expressions, we have also discussed how the algorithm parameters affect its performance and which conditions must be fulfilled so that the algorithm can properly track a time-varying plant. It is important to highlight that such expressions have been obtained by using a small number of simplifying assumptions and approximations, leading to a model that accurately predicts the algorithm behavior over a wide range of operating conditions. This accuracy is mainly due to the strategy used for computing some expected values arising from the model development. Moreover, in contrast to other models so far presented in the open literature, the proposed model is valid irrespective of the window length used to estimate the signal power at each transformation branch. Simulation results showed a very good match between MC simulations and model predictions, ratifying the effectiveness of the proposed model for both transient and steady-state phases.

                     . Therefore, the determination of P involves the calculus of a high-order hyperelliptic integral [see (107)]. However, there is no general solution for this kind of integral in the open literature [29]. Thereby, aiming to determine an analytical solution for such an integral, the approach described in [27] is considered to obtain (20) as an approximate solution.

                     S
                  

Here, the procedure carried out for computing matrix (41) is described. Such a procedure considers two strategies, one to determine the main diagonal elements of S and another for the off-diagonal elements. Specifically, the main diagonal elements of S are obtained in a similar way as in Appendix A, whereas the off-diagonal elements are computed by using the AP as in [27]. Thus, from the Gaussian probability density function (see Assumption A1) [33], the main diagonal elements of S are first expressed as

                      Finally, considering the approach described in [27], (47) is obtained as an approximate solution for the high-order hyperelliptic integral given in (114). In turn, (48) follows as an approximate solution for the off-diagonal elements of S.
