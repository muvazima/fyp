                  We present a scheme for coordinating decentralized parties that share central resources but hold private information about their decision problems modeled as linear programs. This setting is of particular importance for supply chains, in which the plans of independent, often legally separated, parties have to be synchronized. The scheme is based on an iterative generation and exchange of proposals regarding the parties’ input to or withdrawal from the central resources (i.e. primal information). We prove that the system-wide optimum can be identified in a finite number of steps. A simple numerical example illustrates the information exchange and the models involved when coordinating a two-stage supply chain.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coordination of decentralized systems involves a series of challenges. One is that decentralized parties may either prefer to keep some data private because it constitutes a strategic advantage for bargaining or may even be obliged to keep their data private due to anti-trust law. The latter especially applies in a horizontal collaboration of companies. In these cases the identification of a system-wide optimal solution may be a very hard task.

An important example of a decentralized system is a supply chain with legally separated parties. One would expect that today’s commercial information and planning systems will address the above-mentioned challenge. However, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems can create an overall transparency of shared data but do not provide functionalities for planning when some data have to be kept private. Even Advanced Planning Systems (APS), which have been created especially for decision support in supply chain planning, assume a central planner at the top of a planning hierarchy and thus access to the data of all supply chain partners involved – at least in aggregated form. The reason is that APS are based on the concept of hierarchical planning. Hence, a collaborative synchronization of plans over organizational boundaries in light of information asymmetries is currently neither covered by ERP systems nor by APS.

Another approach is to make use of a trusted third party, called mediator, which is supplied with all the data necessary for generating a system-wide optimum by solving a central model. What remains is a fair split of the gains of the central solution among all parties involved (e.g., Frisk, Göthe-Lundgren, Jörnsten, & Rönnqvist, 2010).

In case no central planning entity is accepted or available, a decentralized coordination scheme like the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition (Dantzig & Wolfe, 1960) has to be looked for. Note that the master model of the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition may be combined with one party’s local planning domain (see Sweeney & Murphy, 1979). Then no third party is needed. However, the exchange of dual prices for linking central resources in Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition may turn out to be an obstacle: First, not all managers may have an understanding of what dual prices signify and might be reluctant to reveal these data. Second, the exchange of dual prices may be undesirable because they allow the inference of capacity utilizations which are often regarded as being sensitive. A reason is that once underutilized capacities become known to the buyer she might exploit this information in future price negotiations with the supplier. Consequently, this information should be kept confidential. Third, in the context of operational supply chain planning prices for input materials, which represent a ”central” resource here, are often fixed beforehand and are not subject to negotiations at this planning level.

Thus, we have developed a new coordination scheme which supports the identification of a system-wide optimal solution in such decentralized settings, where parties’ decentralized decision problems can be modeled as linear programs (LP). LP are frequently applied for modeling supply chain decisions — both in theory and practice. As an example we refer to aggregate planning, where LP are used to trade off different cost factors such as inventory holding and backorder costs (see, e.g., Munhoz & Morabito, 2014).

The methodology of our coordination scheme is novel. We assume that parties play a specific role, namely that of the informed party (IP) or one of the reporting parties (RP). In the course of the scheme all parties exchange proposals as candidates for a coordinated solution and the RP communicate the corresponding profit changes compared to a given default solution to the IP. The proposals and profit changes are the primal output of mathematical programming (MP) models. The scheme is able to identify the optimum in a finite number of steps. Subsequently, the IP determines for each RP whether to keep the default central resource allocation or to implement the best proposal generated in the course of the scheme.

To illustrate the coordination by primal information we will outline how the scheme can be used in inter-organizational supply chains. Consider a two-tier supply chain. Let the upstream party (supplier) produce some products on a potential bottleneck resource and sell them to the downstream party (buyer). Let the availability of these products be a limiting factor in the sales and operations planning (S&OP) of the buyer. Thus, the buyer cannot fulfill customer demand without purchasing raw materials from the suppliers. This often occurs when the costs for capacity expansion are prohibitively high such as in process industries. To establish a coordinated solution in this scenario, the following research question has to be answered: How can we generate an optimal plan for this supply chain in a decentralized manner? Or taking the buyer’s perspective: how can she determine her supply chain wide optimal sales and purchase quantities without solving the centralized problem?

The most natural approach is that both parties exchange different proposals for the purchase quantities and jointly choose the best. This is a rather common approach, and underlies industry best practices like CPFR (Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment, see VICS, 2004), too. Especially in step 6 of the CPFR concept, named “Create order forecast”, parties are expected to balance the sales forecast with available capacities. However, instead of finding a balance for each party locally, our scheme could be employed advantageously to find a system-wide optimal balance iteratively. Moreover, our approach is related to APS software tools that often provide interfaces where a buyer and a supplier can exchange their preferred purchase plans iteratively (see, e.g., Knolmayer, Mertens, Zeier, & Dickersbach, 2009), stating the timing and quantities of a specific item. The iterative exchange of purchase plans (or more generally: proposals) is also the base of our scheme. However, our scheme also generates those proposals which finally will lead to an optimal system-wide solution. In our opinion it is a central asset that our mechanism is so closely aligned to common business practice. To emphasize the factor that makes the difference here, we refer to our information exchange as “primal” — i.e., direct solutions of the optimization problems like quantities — opposed to “dual” information like shadow prices.

Potential applications for our approach are given in many industries. An impressive example is the case study of Frisk et al. (2010) regarding collaboration of transport planning of logging trucks for eight large forest companies in Sweden. They report that cost savings of 8.3 percent can be obtained when solving a central linear transportation model compared to the sum of the optimal solutions of each company. Furthermore, comparing potential savings of the coordinated solution over the cost of the actual transportation yields a saving of 14.2 percent. Note that transportation costs account for about one third of the total raw material cost in the forest industry in Sweden. Further cases of collaborative planning can be found for instance in the semiconductor industry (e.g., Shirodkar & Kempf, 2006) and process industries (e.g., Berning, Brandenburg, Gürsoy, Mehta, & Tölle, 2002).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the setting including a small numerical example from S&OP. In Section 4, we outline the scheme, show the solution of the numerical example, and propose a solution procedure for one of the models which has a bilinear objective function. Section 5 concludes the paper. All proofs are given in Appendix B.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Coordination mechanisms in the form of contracts have been dealt with extensively in the literature (see Cachon (2003) and Tsay, Nahmias, and Agrawal (1998) for detailed reviews). In the majority of papers reviewed symmetric information is assumed while in Burnetas, Gilbert, and Smith (2007), Cachon and Lariviere (2001), Cachon and Zhang (2006), Corbett and de Groote (2000), Corbett, Zhou, and Tang (2004), Lutze and Özer (2008), Özer and Wei (2006), Schenk-Mathes (1995), Shang, Song, and Zipkin (2009), and Schmidt, Gaur, Lai, and Raman (2015) asymmetric information is addressed. An exception is the paper of Shang et al. (2009), who assume the existence of a third party with complete information about the decentralized problems. These papers rely on the adverse selection framework. This framework is characterized by a principal, who cannot identify his profit-maximizing solution due to private information such as hidden characteristics of the agent(s). In contrast, we consider a more symmetric setting here: All parties have some private data and decision authority preventing the others from implementing their individual profit-maximizing solutions. Furthermore, the focus of the underlying decision problems differs from ours: While the models of the above papers address uncertainties, they do not include general linear constraints like those used in deterministic MP.

On the other hand, most papers dealing with the coordination via MP models apply classical decomposition techniques (see Dantzig & Wolfe, 1960 and Benders, 1962) or their modifications. This has a long tradition, beginning with Dantzig and Wolfe when they interpreted their decomposition procedure as decentralized decision-making. There is a large number of papers which rely on the original algorithm of Dantzig and Wolfe or subgradient optimization and adapt it to specific application settings (see, e.g., Kutanoglu & Wu, 1999 and Walther, Schmid, & Spengler, 2008). Arikapuram and Veeramani (2004) used the L-shaped method as an alternative approach.

In general, the exchange of dual information, which is essential for classical decomposition, has several disadvantages compared to primal information. This has already been discussed in the introduction. Hence, we believe that the exchange of primal information has a better chance of acceptance in practice because decision makers clearly understand which piece of information they disclose.

The coordination of MP problems without the exchange of dual information has been addressed by only a few authors (e.g., Schneeweiss & Zimmer 2004; Fink 2006; Dudek & Stadtler 2005, 2007 and Kovács, Egri, Kis, & Váncza 2013). Like our approach, the papers of Dudek and Stadtler propose coordination schemes that rely on an iterative exchange of (supply) proposals. However, these schemes, as well as that of Kovács et al. (2013), are limited to the coordination of lot-sizing models. In contrast, our scheme is more general and can be applied to many different settings where the decision problems can be modeled as LP.

In this section we will describe the coordination of Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) in supply chains of legally separated parties. It is widely recognized that S&OP is highly relevant in practice (e.g., Chopra & Meindl, 2007). However, it is usually stated as a centralized decision problem. Subsequently, we will introduce the S&OP for a decentralized setting where existing information asymmetry among parties is kept as far as possible.

A main task of S&OP is the identification of the profit-maximizing sales, production and inventory quantities in a mid-term planning level usually divided into monthly time buckets. Synchronizing these mid-term plans has a series of benefits. First of all, this is the prerequisite for consistent operational decisions in different areas such as marketing and production. Moreover, the associated inter-departmental discussions often improve the mutual awareness and can help to drive the business towards a global optimum.

Applying S&OP for supply chains of legally separated parties raises an additional challenge: the plans of different parties have to be coordinated subject to the restriction that the suppliers’ sales quantities and the buyers’ production quantities have to match each other. We will illustrate this challenge by considering a single period S&OP model. Note that our approach can also handle the more realistic case of a multi-period S&OP model as long as it is an LP. The one-period S&OP model is based on the following parameters and decision variables:

                        The objective function maximizes the total profits. Constraint (1) sets an upper bound on the item demand. In (2) we ensure the availability of raw materials and semi-finished items for producing the end items. Capacity constraints are modeled by (3).

Next, consider that the responsibilities for the decisions Xj
                         are split between buyer and suppliers. Then the buyer’s model writes as:

                         as the decisions in the model of supplier n. When parties solve their decentralized problems independently from each other, constraints (4) are often not fulfilled. The main challenge in this setting is to find a feasible and near optimal solution, as further illustrated by the numerical example below.

Consider a setting with one buyer and two suppliers. Let the buyer produce three items (1, 2, 3) and sell two of them (1, 2). There are no upper bounds on demands. The parties’ production capacities are limited. For the production of items 1 and 2, predecessor items from supplier 1 (4, 5) and supplier 2 (6, 7) are needed. To be more precise, item 1 requires either to purchase item 4 from supplier 1 or item 6 from supplier 2. Similarly, item 2 requires either item 5 from supplier 1 or item 3, which can be produced inhouse at the buyer’s site. Furthermore, for each unit of item 2 the buyer has to purchase 0.5 units from supplier 2. The structure of this setting is illustrated by Fig. 1
                        .

Below, we will state the corresponding decision problems of the buyer (party #3) and the suppliers (parties #1 and #2). Note that contribution margins of items in the objective functions have been calculated based on the selling prices, the variable production costs, and the purchase prices paid to the suppliers for the input materials (for detailed data see Appendix A). A specific characteristic applies to item 3: if it is produced at the buyer’s site it will substitute item 5 from supplier 1. This way the buyer can save 1 monetary unit per unit of item 3, which explains the contribution margin of item 3. However, item 3 is limited to the required input for item 2 (see constraint (8)).

Assuming that the buyer has to coordinate the three-party supply chain such that overall profits are maximized the buyer faces a number of challenges. One is that variable production costs as well as available capacities at the suppliers’ sites usually will be unknown to the buyer. Consequently, the buyer does not know which quantities of items can actually be procured. Another challenge is a make-or-buy decision, i.e., either item 3 has to be produced inhouse or purchased from supplier 1 (item 5).

To coordinate the supply chain the buyer might start with her locally optimal solution, which is

                        . This solution, however, is not even feasible for supplier 2. In case the suppliers are unwilling to provide the necessary data to allow the buyer or a neutral mediator to generate an optimal central solution a decentralized solution procedure is needed.

Subsequently, we will present a new coordination scheme which is simply based on an iterative exchange of procurement plans and associated payments compensating the buyer for not implementing a default solution, which may be her locally optimal solution. This way an optimal solution for the whole supply chain can be achieved without sacrificing existing information asymmetries. Note that our coordination scheme will do without transferring marginal prices for purchased items which would be required if Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition was applied.

The coordination scheme proposed here covers not only the S&OP coordination problem, but also general LP. Therefore, we will outline the scheme in a generic way. Consider a system of decentralized, profit-maximizing parties that plan based on LP models and share some central resources. Central resources are capacity-constrained resources used by all parties, such as a common budget, supplier or facility. Define (C) as the centralized decision problem of this system.

                         exists, which would be implemented if the parties did not use the mechanism. For example, such a default solution can be exogenously given as the result of a long-term contract. In supply chains, upstream planning is another option. Here the buyer solves her problem without regard of the suppliers’ capacities and contribution margins. Often the default solution is suboptimal then, due to the lack of information and coordination.

                         hold for supply chain coordination settings in general because the material balances are the central resources there. Therefore, our assumption that the central resources b
                        0 are globally known is inherently fulfilled in these settings.

The coordination scheme mimics a real-world negotiation where parties exchange a series of proposals (“which are the possible scenarios?”) and evaluate their consequences (“which are the benefits of the different scenarios?”). There are two different roles for parties in the scheme. One party takes the role of the IP (informed party), who receives information about the cost changes of the others, so that this party is able to take over the lead in the negotiation. The remaining parties are the RP (reporting parties). In the S&OP example, the IP is the buyer, and the suppliers are RP.

Parties exchange information in a series of iterations. In each iteration each party generates one proposal. Let the index e denote the eth proposal generated and E the total number of proposals generated up to iteration l. That is, 
                           
                              E

                              2
                              l
                           
                         proposals have been generated after iteration l. Moreover, let 
                           
                              x
                              i
                              e
                           
                         and 
                           
                              x
                              i

                        , for the eth proposal and the default solution, respectively.

The following actions take place in each iteration: Each RP

                         to the IP. After that, each RP generates a further proposal, and so on. Fig. 2 summarizes the sequence of actions in the scheme for the case of two RP.

Note that in case the RP claim lump-sums as entrance fees for the negotiation from the IP, it can be shown under some mild conditions that the mechanism is strategy-proof, i.e., all parties have incentives for truthful information exchange (see Albrecht, 2010).

At first, we will outline how the proposals are generated by the RP. The RP apply model (CS1
                           i
                        ), which yields proposals showing a potential for system-wide profit increases and addressing regions of the solution space that have not been explored in previous iterations.

                         has to be chosen such large that it exceeds the potential cost effects from changes in the central resource use. An exemplary procedure for that is given in Section 4.3. Note that the solution xi
                         which has led to the unbounded ui

With a fixed, feasible value for ui
                        , (CS1
                           i
                        ) corresponds to the subproblem of Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. The fact that ui
                         is determined endogenously in (CS1
                           i
                        ) and not by a master problem is the crucial point that allows us to limit the exchange to primal information.

The IP runs a different model, (CS2
                           I
                        ), for generating new proposals. This model maximizes the profit of the IP and a convex combination of the other parties’ profit increases of previous proposals, while securing that the parties’ use of the central resources — including that of the IP — does not exceed the total availability b

                           I
                        ) is closely related to the master problem of Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. However, the decentralized decisions of the IP and the allocation of the central resources are determined simultaneously in (CS2
                           I
                        ).

                         summarizes the single steps of the scheme.

                           Theorem 1
                           
                              Following the scheme, the optimal solution for (C) is identified within a finite number of iterations.
                           


                        Theorem 1 shows that the exchange of primal information is sufficient for identifying the optimum of any decentralized system where the decision problems can be formulated as LP. This is a novel result. Its main impact for this paper is that it provides the theoretical foundation for the coordination scheme proposed. It advocates to structure the negotiation along the lines of the scheme because the system-wide optimum will be found that way.

Note that models (CS2
                           I
                        ) and (CS-E
                           i
                        ) are linear programs. Large-scale instances can be easily solved with an off-the-shelf solver (e.g., XpressMP). Model (CS1
                           i
                        ), instead, is a bilinear program, which is hard to solve in general. Section 4.4 outlines exact as well as approximate solution procedures for this model.

Next we will show how the scheme can be applied to the S&OP example of Section 3.2. The centralized problem (C) in this setting is composed by constraints (5)–(16) and an objective function which is the sum of the objective functions of (DP
                           i
                        ) (
                           
                              i
                              =
                              1

                              3
                           
                        ). Assume that we have the following default supply quantities:

                              =
                              1.5
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 X

                              =
                              1.5
                           
                         (see also Table 1
                        , iteration 0).

For stating (CS11), we have to rewrite each central resource constraint (14)–(16) by two separate inequalities. That is, we replace (14)–(16) by

                         compared to the default solution are communicated by the suppliers to the buyer.

How can this step be interpreted in the S&OP context? Supplier 1 would benefit if the buyer increases the demand for item 5 to 9 units, while not ordering any units of item 4 at all. He proposes the buyer to do so and reveals his potential benefits (10.5 monetary units). Similarly does supplier 2; he proposes to increase demand for item 6 to 9 units and to decrease demand for item 7 to 0, and states the resulting benefits (25.5 monetary units). Note that both proposals are conflicting because the buyer produces items 1 and 2, the successors of items 5 and 6, together on the capacity-constrained resources (5) and (6). This conflict is not transparent for the suppliers because the buyer’s capacity constraints are private information. Below we will show how this conflict will be resolved by the coordination scheme.

As the next step, the buyer solves (CS23) to derive a synthesis from the suppliers’ proposals:

                         to the suppliers 1 and 2, respectively. The interpretation of these proposals is as follows: Due to the capacity constraints (5) and (6) the buyer cannot fulfill the suppliers’ proposals. However, the buyer finds it beneficial for the supply chain to modify the default solution such that the suppliers’ proposals can be covered to a larger extent. In this context, he decides to stop the inhouse production of 3 and to outsource its substitute, item 5.

Next, the suppliers evaluate these proposals by models (CS-Ei). They realize that these proposals would increase their profits by

There are two more iterations. In iteration 2, the buyer has received sufficient information for determining the system-wide optimum. As no new solution is found in iteration 3, the scheme terminates. The single steps of the scheme are summarized in Table 1.

Model (CS1
                           i
                        ) has a nonlinear objective function. Therefore, it cannot be tackled directly by a standard solver. Fortunately, however, all of its variables and constraints are linear. Several procedures exist for calculating approximate solutions to problems with such characteristics (see, e.g., Floudas, 1995).

In this section we will present an exact and an approximate approach for solving (CS1
                           i
                        ). The exact approach can be applied in all cases where we have no more than one central resource. Here the optimal solution to (CS1
                           i
                        ) can be obtained by solving two different LP that are of a comparable size to (CS1
                           i
                        ). Our approach is based on the following analytical insights:

                        For both resulting quadratic terms in (43) we can apply a piecewise linear approximation.

This approach is quite powerful despite its simplicity. For example, it allowed to identify the optimal solution to our numerical example as well as to a series of supply chain planning problems reported in the computational study of Albrecht (2010).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new scheme for coordinating decentralized parties in which the parties’ individual decision problems can be modeled by LP has been presented. We have extended the body of knowledge by the following insight: For coordinating decentralized LP settings, we do not need to exchange dual information — like the common approaches such as Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. Instead, we showed that the system-wide optimum can be found even if we limit the information exchange to primal data.

For problem instances with a single central resource, computing times of our scheme are comparable to those of an LP of the same size. In case of several central resources, a piece-wise linear approximation of the objective function of model (CS1
                        i
                     ) is needed, which results in much larger computing times. In this case we are able to identify near optimal solutions for small problem sizes (e.g., three products, two time periods) in less than two minutes (see Albrecht, 2010). For larger problem sizes we recommend speed-up heuristics, such as those outlined in Albrecht (2010) (Table 2) .

Our approach is particularly interesting for companies collaborating with supply chain partners or competitors where the exchange of prices for goods or resources is either undesirable or even prohibited (e.g., due to antitrust law). CPFR is an example where supply chain partners are used to exchange primal information, namely the volume of goods. Our approach can be seen as an add-on to CPFR to guide the negotiation process in an intelligent way resulting in the system-wide optimum. As indicated in the introduction, potential benefits can be substantial.

For academics our approach represents a new avenue of research in supply chain coordination. Extensions for different problem classes and effective heuristic solution procedures are a promising field of research. As an example Puettmann and Stadtler (2010) have shown that the findings presented here for LP can be transferred to a heuristic for collaborative intermodal freight transportation with binary linear models. Further applications, e.g., to a collaborative assignment problem, are under way.

(b) With fixed ui
                           , the constraints of (CS1
                              i
                           ) are reduced to Di
                           . Hence, the optimal solution xi
                            to (CS1
                              i
                           ) is feasible, and we have xi
                            ∈ ext(Di
                           ). (Note that (CS1
                              i
                           ) may have multiple optimal solutions xi
                            including non-vertex solutions. To shorten the discussion of this issue, we assume that (CS1
                              i
                           ) is solved using an algorithm that limits its search to vertex solutions, like a primal simplex.)

The existence of a feasible value for ui
                            can be shown as follows: for the optimal solution xi
                            to (CS-E
                              i
