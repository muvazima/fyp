                  In this paper we generalise existing models of loss-averse preferences. This extension clarifies the impact of stochastic changes in risk on the optimal degree of risk taking. Our more general model highlights an intuitive link between the literature on loss-averse behaviours and the notions of prudence and temperance recently introduced in the literature. We also stress the link between our approach and the use of VaR and CVaR as risk measures.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the standard expected utility model (E-U) it is now well known that beneficial changes in the returns of a risky asset do not necessarily induce more risk taking by a risk averse decision maker (see, e.g., Fishburn and Porter, 1976, for the original contribution and Eeckhoudt and Gollier, 2013, for a survey).

In the E-U model with risk averse investors the utility function is assumed to be increasing and concave everywhere. This assumption has been challenged at least since Fishburn (1977) who developed an alternative model of choice under risk, the so-called “
                        
                           α
                           −
                           t
                        
                     ” model. In Fishburn (1977) the decision maker is concerned by a target level of wealth (denoted t) above which risk neutrality prevails. Below the target the decision maker pays attention to the extent of the failure to reach the target and this concern is expressed by the use of a specific concave power function, the exponent of which is denoted α (hence the “
                        
                           α
                           −
                           t
                        
                     ” terminology).

A little later, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) suggested to express loss aversion through a piecewise-linear utility function that is globally concave. In this model the loss of 1 euro below the target is more painful (in absolute value) than the pleasure attached to the gain of 1 euro above the target.

Other models expressing loss aversion with a linear utility above the target and a specific concave utility below the target have been suggested (for a short and useful review see Jarrow and Zhao, 2006, especially Section  2).

In this paper we postulate a more general version of loss aversion in which the utility function below the target is concave (so that we no longer refer to a specific power utility function) while linearity prevails above the target. Besides at the target level, the slope of the concave part equals that of the linear component (so that in the spirit of loss aversion models the loss of 1 euro below the target is more painful than a similar loss above the target).

As shown in Section 4, with such a model of loss aversion, stochastic improvements in the return of risky assets induce more risk taking under much less restrictive assumptions about the utility function than those prevailing under the general E-U model. Besides, and maybe more importantly, these less restrictive assumptions are linked to the notions of prudence (and temperance) that are relatively recent in the literature. As a result we can provide a link between the literature on loss aversion and new concepts for the analysis of risky choices.

While our results are first expressed in terms of classical stochastic dominance relationships between random variables, we next develop the special cases of (a) two risks with equal first moments that fulfill Rothschild and Stiglitz’s (1970) definition of “increasing risk”, and (b) two risks with equal means and variances that represent an increase in downside risk according to Menezes, Geiss, and Tressler (1980). An interesting result obtained in Section 4 is that prudence and temperance jointly constitute a sufficient condition for a loss-averse investor to decrease his optimal exposure to a risky asset whose downside risk increases. When modifications in risk involve a tail risk parameter, such as Value at Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), the reaction of a loss-averse agent can still be predicted unequivocally under mild requirements, that we describe in Section 5. As a consequence of the relationship between stochastic dominance and risk measures proved in Ma and Wong (2010), the proposed model of downside loss aversion emerges as a decision-theoretic foundation for VaR and CVaR in the asset management industry.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present notation and assumptions. In Section 3 we briefly review the original contribution of Fishburn and Porter (1976) and we introduce the model of loss aversion used all along the paper. Section 4 contains our main results on (first, second and n-th order) Stochastic Dominance, followed by some special cases of stochastic changes in risk. In Section 5 we provide a relationship between our results and VaR and CVaR. Some concluding remarks are summarized in the final section.

We consider a standard portfolio problem with one safe and one risky asset. The decision maker is endowed with a sure wealth w
                     0 > 0 that can be invested in a safe asset with return i ≥ 0 or a risky asset with random return X so that the final wealth W is a random variable defined by

                     . This is what Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) have termed a mean-preserving reduction in risk. Improvements in third and fourth degree risk have subsequently received an intuitive interpretation in terms of downside risk and outer risk reductions, respectively (Menezes et al., 1980; Menezes & Wang, 2005). All these characterisations, as well as their extensions to higher orders, are synthesized by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2006), who establish that stochastic improvements of general order n play a crucial role in connection with risk apportionment decisions.

To describe the effect of stochastic changes in risk on risk taking, we will make use of the following concepts related to the agent’s utility function. The Arrow–Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion is defined as

                        The concept of prudence will be analysed in more detail in Section 4. For an economic interpretation of the benchmark values of 1 for relative risk aversion and 2 for relative prudence, we refer the reader to Eeckhoudt, Etner, and Schroyen (2009).
                     . It is well-known that prudence is a necessary condition for decreasing absolute risk aversion, or DARA (see, e.g., Gollier, 2001, pp. 24–25, for a formal definition and related implications).

Although the simple portfolio problem is a classical topic in the economics of uncertainty, the impact on the optimal investment mix of a deterioration in the risky asset distribution (according to some degree of stochastic dominance) has challenged economists since the publication of Fishburn and Porter’s (1976) paper on the subject.

In a market consisting of one risky asset and one riskless security, Fishburn and Porter (1976) characterize the optimal investment mix of an agent whose utility function is twice continuously differentiable and strictly increasing. The first two derivatives of expected utility (2) are given by:

                        ensures that a
                        * is an interior solution, or, equivalently, that the initially optimal portfolio contains strictly positive amounts of both the safe and the risky asset.

Suppose now that some good news arrive and make the prospects of the risky asset better, in the sense of increasing the welfare of its holder. Intuition suggests that a rational agent should invest more in the risky asset as it becomes relatively more attractive. However, unless very specific restrictions are made on the shape of the utility function, a globally risk averse agent may surprisingly decide to decrease a
                        *.

In a subsequent stream of papers (see Eeckhoudt and Gollier, 2013, for a comprehensive survey), additional restrictions have been imposed on the utility function to sign the impact of a second degree stochastic improvement in risk unequivocally. These conditions are summarized in the following Proposition.

                                       The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is decreasing in wealth (i.e. the usual “DARA” assumption) and RRA(w) ≤ 1 for all w;
                                    

0 ≤ RP(w) ≤ 2 for all w.
                                    

It is striking that, without such restrictive assumptions on relative risk aversion or relative prudence, stochastic dominances of degree 1 and 2 are neither necessary nor sufficient for 
                           
                              a

                         to be increased. Thus, if a risk averse agent switches part of his wealth from the risky to the safe asset in response to a stochastic improvement in F, it does not follow that he is behaving contrary to the principle of maximising expected utility. Probably as a consequence of this puzzling result, the comparative statics of changes in risk in the context of portfolio choice has not been extended to higher degrees of stochastic dominance.

The main message of this paper is that we can preserve intuitive and unambiguous comparative statics results for all degrees of stochastic improvements in risk if we integrate one simple behavioural assumption (downside loss aversion) into the expected utility framework.

Although the economic literature on risky choice behaviour traditionally presumes global risk aversion, decision makers in investment contexts very frequently associate risk with failure to attain a target (or reference wealth level) t > 0. Assuming risk aversion for 0 ≤ w ≤ t and risk neutrality for w > t, we propose the following downside loss-averse utility function:

In our model of downside loss-averse preferences, the target denotes an exogenous reference point that divides outcomes into gains and losses in accordance with the decision maker’s own level of risk aversion (see Fishburn, 1977; Jarrow & Zhao, 2006). In investment contexts, a reference point is a natural criterion for determining clientele and immediately translates into a valid benchmark for investment advice.

                              t

                         appear to be reasonable target choices, our general framework allows for different target specifications according to the preference structure of individual investors

                           A different stream of literature links the notion of target to an aspiration level, which embeds a subjective evaluation of the probability of success/failure by a decision maker with limited cognitive resources or incomplete information (see, e.g., Castagnoli & Li Calzi, 1996; Diecidue & Van de Ven, 2008; Brown, De Giorgi, & Sim, 2012).
                        .

The assumption of downside loss aversion is consistent with a sizeable evidence that investors are sensitive to ruinous outcomes (Hwang & Satchell, 2010; Libby & Fishburn, 1977) and regard small deviations below target as being relatively harmless when compared to large deviations (Laughhunn, Payne, & Crum, 1980). Following Fishburn (1977), Bawa (1978), Jarrow and Zhao (2006), we assume that risk neutrality prevails above the reference point t, but, differently from the precedent authors, we do not restrict the shape of the concave part to the class of power functions.

Based on (5), the expected utility of a loss-averse agent becomes:

With the loss-averse utility function proposed in (5), stochastic improvements in risky returns induce more risk taking under much milder requirements than those imposed under the classical E-U model. For a simpler proof of this result, we assume that the concave part uI
                     (w) of the utility function (5) is continuously differentiable as many times as needed.

The first item in the above Proposition contains an intuitive solution to the comparative statics puzzle raised by Fishburn and Porter’s (1976) paper. When F undergoes a first degree stochastic improvement, all downside loss-averse agents endowed with utility function (5) unanimously increase their optimal risk exposure. This unequivocal result is a direct consequence of replacing the assumption of global risk aversion by risk neutrality for w > t. An illustrative numerical example can be found in the Appendix.

It should be noticed that, under loss-averse preferences (5), the exogenous target wealth t is induced by the agent’s own level of risk aversion and is not related to probabilities. It is therefore reasonable to presume that this target will not be altered by a change in risk of the type considered in Proposition 4.1. As pointed out by a referee, it might be interesting in future research to study the impact of a possible relationship between the target level and stochastic changes in the distribution of risky returns, assuming that a more favourable distribution might induce a loss-averse investor to increase his target

                     .

Although the results of Proposition 4.1 are expressed in terms of classical stochastic dominance relationships between random variables, they can be easily adapted to cover special cases that involve some moment equalities between the two risks.

Suppose that the risky asset undergoes an increase in risk (IR) in the sense of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970). This can be modelled either by adding a zero mean lottery (noise) to any outcome of the initial random variable X, or by performing a sequence of mean-preserving spreads

                        5
                        A mean-preserving spread (MPS) is obtained by moving some probability mass of the distribution toward the tails, leaving the mean unchanged. For a formal definition see Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970).
                     . A vast literature has shown that the effect of the IR on the optimal investment mix of a globally risk averse agent cannot be predicted unequivocally without further restrictions either (a) on the utility function (see Proposition 3.2 above), or (b) on the change in risk. As shown by Eeckhoudt and Gollier (2013) in a survey paper on these topics, it is not difficult to construct examples in which an increase in risk induces some globally risk averse agents to increase the optimal size of their exposure to it. Under downside loss-averse preferences, such a counterintuitive result does not emerge if one assumes besides that the decision maker is prudent (

                     ) for all w < t. Indeed, because increases in risk in the sense of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) are a special case of second order stochastic dominance, the results of Proposition 4.1(2) fully apply to this problem. As a consequence, under loss-averse preferences prudence – that for a long time was associated exclusively with precautionary savings (Kimball, 1990) – also appears to play an important role in the composition of a risky portfolio.

The observation we have made at the second order also extends to higher orders. For instance, according to Menezes et al. (1980), a distribution F has more downside risk than G if F ⪯3 
                     G and the two distributions have equal means and variances. This definition is equivalent to F having more dispersion than G below any specific target:

Since this definition is a special case of third order stochastic dominance, it appears from Proposition 4.1(3) that a loss-averse decision maker who is prudent (

                        It should be kept in mind that risk aversion, prudence and temperance are not independent notions (see, e.g., Menegatti, 2014, and the literature therein).

                     . Therefore, downside loss-averse agents increase their holding of the risky asset in response to this particular type of increase in right skewness, with a constant mean and variance. This is consistent with widely documented evidence from financial markets (see, e.g., Bourachnikova and Burger-Helmchen, 2012, and the references therein).

The essence of stochastic dominance rules is to summarize the choice process of a rational decision maker who behaves according to some specific classes of utility functions (Bawa, 1978). In the banking and finance industry, however, portfolio choices are practically evaluated on the basis of risk exposure rather than stochastic dominance comparisons. While apparently unrelated, these two investment criteria share a unifying connection with some prominent measures of downside risk, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) (see Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath, 1999; Föllmer and Schied, 2004; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2002, for details). Graphical representations that clarify the meaning of these risk measures may be found, e.g., in Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002) 
                     Szegö (2002).

As recently shown by Ma and Wong (2010), a decision-theoretic foundation for VaR and CVaR can be established by stochastic dominance rules of degree 1 and 2, respectively.

                        For random variables with discrete supports, Ma and Wong (2010) prove that the relationship between VaR and first order stochastic dominance holds unchanged and they modify the definition of CVaR in such a way that the relationship with second order stochastic dominance is preserved.
                      For ease of exposition, in the following we assume that the distribution of returns X on the risky asset is continuous on

Combining the results of Ma and Wong (2010) with those of Proposition 4.1 above, we observe that the connection among VaR, CVaR, stochastic dominance and expected utility maximisation is reinforced by the assumption of downside loss-averse preferences. When a financial asset undergoes a first degree stochastic improvement, it becomes less risky in terms of VaR at all levels of risk tolerance. What is the reaction of loss-averse investors who make their decisions according to the utility model (5)? As long as their target wealth t is below wi
                     , they will unanimously increase their exposure to risk (Proposition 4.1, item 1). A second degree stochastic improvement in the risky asset distribution is equivalent to a CVaR reduction at all levels of risk tolerance. Downside loss-averse investors who exhibit a prudent behaviour for w < t ≤ wi
                      will accordingly increase their exposure to risk (Proposition 4.1, item 2). The unanimous portfolio choices implied by loss-averse preferences (see (5)) provide a new behavioural foundation for VaR and CVaR in connection with asset management problems. Under loss aversion, the notion of temperance is likely to be related to more advanced risk measures than VaR and CVaR, taking into account different aspects of the risk distribution.

Based on these unambiguous and intuitive comparative statics results, we believe that the utility function proposed in (5) could be assumed as starting point for an integrated approach to risk measurement and portfolio selection within the Expected Utility framework.

When the optimal composition of a portfolio is analysed inside the expected utility model some partially counterintuitive results emerge. For instance, if the return on the risky asset benefits from a second order stochastic improvement it is not true that all risk averse decision makers will increase their holding of the risky asset. This observation has led to an extensive literature inside the general E-U model.

In this paper we have adopted a different approach, since we refer to a subset of expected utility models that characterize loss-averse preferences. In this context we have first extended the existing models of Fishburn and Porter (1976) 
                     Jarrow and Zhao (2006) that used a specific concave power utility below the target to characterise loss aversion and we have replaced this power function with a general concave utility.

Under such an environment some new and intuitively appealing results emerge. For instance, if the risky asset benefits from a mean preserving reduction in risk all loss averse and prudent investors increase their demand for it.

Finally, thanks to results recently established by Ma and Wong (2010), it turns out that our extended analysis of loss-averse preferences reinforces the idea that VaR and CVaR are valuable tools to measure the intensity of risk.

                        For better properties of CVaR over VaR we refer to Artzner et al. (1999) and Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002).
                     
                  

While the extended model of loss-averse preferences has been applied here to the optimal composition of a portfolio, it can also be seen as a first step for a more general research project. Indeed one might wonder how other risk management tools such as, e.g., insurance, prevention and saving which have been analysed so far in the framework of expected utility are perceived by loss-averse decision makers.

For a numerical example, let us examine the standard case of a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function:
