                  This paper evaluates the resurrection event regarding defaulted firms and incorporates observable cure events in the default prediction of SME. Due to the additional cure-related observable data, a completely new information set is applied to predict individual default and cure events. This is a new approach in credit risk that, to our knowledge, has not been followed yet. Different firm-specific and macroeconomic default and cure-event-influencing risk drivers are identified. The significant variables allow a firm-specific default risk evaluation combined with an individual risk reducing cure probability. The identification and incorporation of cure-relevant factors in the default risk framework enable lenders to support the complete resurrection of a firm in the case of its default and hence reduce the default risk itself. The estimations are developed with a database that contains 5930 mostly small and medium-sized German firms and a total of more than 23000 financial statements over a time horizon from January 2002 to December 2007. Due to the significant influence on the default risk probability as well as the bank’s possible profit prospects concerning a cured firm, it seems essential for risk management to incorporate the additional cure information into credit risk evaluation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

In credit risk evaluation the influence of cure events is gaining more and more attention. Recent literature stated that survival models, which incorporate cure events, are used to improve the prediction of default events. In these models a fraction of cured or immune borrowers is identified in order to deal with heavy censoring due to rare default events. With this approach, one cannot only predict when a borrower defaults but also if he defaults at all. This is a big benefit to the existing ordinary survival analysis. These methods were, for example, used by Mo and Yau (2010) and Tong, Mues, and Thomas (2012) to predict defaults among personal loan portfolios. Cure models are also used to predict the default of corporate bonds or the bankruptcy of the firms itself, see (Topaloglu & Yildirim, 2009; Yildirim, 2008). One significant element in these models is that the cure events are unobserved and thus depend on different definitions of long-term survivorship. Differing definitions of cure events might reduce the comparability of these models and the findings most likely depend on the number of cure events created on the basis of these definitions.

An alternative way to evaluate the cure event occurrence is the use of observable cure events. Those events are observed among credit defaults when a default is triggered which does not generate a loss for a lender due to a successful resurrection. The use of observable cure events in the default prediction is a new approach in credit risk that, to our knowledge, has not been followed yet.

Usually observable cure events are treated indirectly as a 100% recovery, see (Calabrese & Zenga, 2010). Nevertheless, there are several reasons to evaluate observable cure events separately and introduce them in the default prediction rather than in the recovery estimation: an observable cure event has a significant impact on the defaulted firms in a credit portfolio because cured firms are no longer defaulted and are treated as “living” firms. Hence, the influence of this cure event is essential within the evaluation of default risk and is consequently an event that, if identified, should rather be explicitly incorporated in the default prediction than only indirectly measured by the estimation of the recovery rate. Default prediction models that incorporate the cure event are not only capable of predicting when a borrower defaults, but also if he defaults. If a fraction of defaultable firms in a bank’s credit portfolio can be linked with a high cure probability this should reduce the equity costs of the expected portfolio loss.

If one could identify the risk drivers concerning the default and the resurrection of a firm, it could be possible to identify the probability of a firm being cured. If we know a firm’s cure probability as well as its default probability it is possible to estimate the probability of the firm of being “immune” for a certain time period. With this additional information, it might be possible to make more accurate loss predictions. Important information concerning the default and cure events could be recognized by these models, which might lead to lower costs or reveal, so far unseen, risk potentials.

To reach the event of being cured, a firm has to face the event of default first. The resurrection of a firm is an observable and loss-influencing but nevertheless mostly unevaluated event. Data concerning cure events is rare and predominantly only known to banks. Nevertheless, a cure event might contain a lot of borrower-specific and risk-specific information and a separate evaluation of a firm’s resurrection through a cure probability model might cover this information. Our study can make use of bank-internal information regarding 1243 default events and 333 cure events among the defaulted firms.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Earlier credit-risk-related scientific literature was written in the mid-1960s and focused on the default risk of single borrowers. Basic work was done by Beaver (1966, 1968a, 1968b). At the end of the 1960s (Altman, 1968) defined a scoring model evaluating credit risk on the basis of financial data: the Z-Score. A later generation of scoring models is the O-Score, evaluated by Ohlson (1980) based on logistic regression. An overview of the credit risk modeling on single loan basis can be found in Altman and Saunders (1997).

In the following years scientific work turned its focus from the single loan to the evaluation of credit risk regarding loan portfolios. Two main approaches in the credit risk literature are used as the basis for the evaluation of credit portfolio models: the structural model approach and the intensity model approach.

The pioneers of the structural models were (Black & Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1974, 1977). In their option-pricing approach, a firm’s assets follow a geometric Brownian motion and the default probability is only driven by the firm’s distance-to-default. The portfolio model used in Basel II as well as the Portfolio Manager™ model from Moodys and the Credit Metrics™ from JP Morgan Chase are examples of the use of the structural model approach. The intensity or reduced form models are based on the individual default intensity process of a borrower. Conditional on the realization of the intensity the number of defaults up to time t are independent Poisson-distributed events. Basic work is done by Jarrow and Turnbull (1995), Jarrow, Lando, and Turnbull (1997), Lando (1998) and Hillegeist, Keating, Cram, and Lundstedt (2004). The portfolio model Credit Risk+™ from Credit Suisse Financial Products uses this approach. Hybrid models that use a combination of both approaches can be found in Duffie and Lando (2001) and Madan and Unal (2000). On overview concerning the intensity model approach can be found in Jarrow and Turnbull (2000) and Bluhm, Overbeck, and Wagner (2003).

Regarding bank loan portfolios it is also appropriate to distinguish between bank-internal portfolio risk assessment and external risk evaluation through rating agencies, see (Lützenkirchen, Rösch, & Scheule, 2014). Bank-internal consumer loan specific risk evaluation is done, for example, by Crook, Edelman, and Thomas (2007) with a credit risk model based on logistic regression, by Bellotti and Crook (2008) with a survival analysis model or by Malik and Thomas (2009) trough a cox proportional hazard model. Chan and Kroese (2010) evaluates credit portfolios consisting of bonds and other financial assets and focuses on large portfolio losses. Regarding external risk evaluation through rating agencies see, for example, Altman and Rijken (2004), who evaluate the behavior of rating agencies regarding credit risk measuring or (Jobst & Zenios, 2005). They evaluate models based on the structural model as well as models based on the reduced form model regarding the influence of credit spreads and interest rates concerning large credit portfolios.

A quite new development in literature is the multi-period prediction with credit risk models, see (Duffie, Eckner, Horel, & Saita, 2009; Duffie, Saita, & Wang, 2007).

Besides the multi-period prediction the recent credit risk literature pays more and more attention to the cure event in default prediction. Due to the fact that a default event is a rare event, the applied survival analysis for default evaluation faces a high amount of censored observations which can distort the findings. The problem of heavy censoring among the observed subjects is well known in medicine and is routinely solved by the use of mixture cure models, where the patients are considered cured if they are immune concerning the evaluated disease, see (Farewell, 1982; Hughes, 1999; Kuk & Chen, 1992). Mixture cure models are widely used among clinical trials and separate the data generally into a cure fraction and a fraction of not-cured subjects, see (Corbière & Joly, 2007; Lai & Yau, 2009; Peng & Dear, 2000; Sy & Taylor, 2000). It is common to model both groups, the immune subjects in the cure fraction as well as the fraction of not-immune subjects, conditional on some covariate vectors in order to explain the two distributions. The covariate vectors can consist of the same covariates, but not necessarily. Some covariates may affect the possibility of being cured but may not have any influence on the timing of the event of interest and vice versa, see (Yu & Peng, 2008; Zhang & Peng, 2009). The use of mixture cure models is a quite new aspect in the credit-default-related literature. However, the cure event takes part in a wide range of credit default risk evaluation models. In several credit scoring models this approach is used in combination with personal loan data recently, see, for example, Beran and Djaidja (2007), Mo and Yau (2010) and Tong et al. (2012). In general default events are rare concerning large listed firms, but regarding the SME segment defaults are observed more often, which relieves the analysis.


                        Yildirim (2008) used the mixture cure model approach with random effects to model long-term survivorship concerning the default estimation of commercial mortgage backed securities. He considered that a reasonable contingent of the observed securities will never default during the duration and thus distorts the results of the survival analysis without cure fraction. The correlation between the securities is captured through the introduction of three independent random effects concerning region, property type and loan level. Topaloglu and Yildirim (2009) used a mixture cure model in order to predict the default of publicly traded US firms.

The introduction of cure events in credit risk modeling generates a wide range of additional options for superior models. The latest work in the credit literature, e.g., (Tong et al., 2012), used mixture cure models to enhance the performance of survival analysis concerning default risk modeling. This approach uses the unobserved cure event to deal with heavy censoring in the default data. We follow an alternative way to evaluate the cure event with the utilization of observable cure events. The idea that a cure event can be reached after the default is observed can be found in Ambrose and Capone (1996) where different foreclosure alternatives are modeled concerning mortgage obligations. But in this model the cure probability is given exogenously without further evaluation. In our paper the cure probability is not given exogenously. A main focus is due to the evaluation of the cure-specific influence factors and the estimation of individual firm-specific cure probabilities.

Predominantly, if a cure event is observed by a bank then the firm is treated as not-defaulted, see (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2005). An indirect influence of a cure event is usually recognized by the estimation of the recovery rate as 100% recovery, see (Calabrese & Zenga, 2010; Renault & Scaillet, 2004). Recent literature indicated that the recovery rate is strong related to the default risk, see (Bade, Rösch, & Scheule, 2011; Pykthin, 2003; Qi & Yang, 2009). Nevertheless, a cure event is much more than a recovery of 100% regarding the outstanding loans, it is an indicator for reduced credit portfolio risk and enhanced short- as well as long-term profit prospects. Hence, the cure event should be recognized by the default prediction. We develop a default risk model that applies this approach in order to be capable not only of predicting when a default occurs but also whether it occurs or not.

A cure event is only observable among defaulted firms; therefore, the influence of not-defaulted firms on a firm’s probability of being cured is ignored without further modifications. The estimation of resurrection influencing risk drivers might lead to biased findings because non-randomly selected samples are used, see (Heckman, 1976, 1979). We use a bivariate Probit sample selection estimator to estimate the cure-related drivers and avoid a sample selection bias, see (Boyes, Hoffman, & Low, 1989; Greene, 1998; Lee, Eastwood, & Lee, 2004).

The models, which are predominantly discussed in the literature, are nearly all developed based on bond issues or personal loan data, while the developed model in this paper is based on firm-specific information. Our database contains a lot of information over a representative sample of the cross-section concerning German SMEs.

In this section different credit risk approaches are developed followed by the description of the applied estimation methods. The first described model, the DDM, treats the cured firms as not-defaulted and excludes them from the fraction of defaulted firms. Cure-specific information is not incorporated by risk drivers and the default risk is evaluated based on the remaining “definitive” default events.

After that the mixture cure model, a survival model which incorporates long-term survivorship, will be elucidated. It can be seen as a combination of a cure probability model and the DDM.

Then the cure event evaluation in the mixture cure model is modified, so that it can be applied regarding an SME-specific credit portfolio including observed cure events after the default event. A cure model is constructed, which allows cure-relevant risk drivers and their influence to be identified. Following this, the cure model is combined with a default model in order to allow cure events among the defaulted firms. The parameters of the default model and the cure model are estimated simultaneously via a bivariate Probit sample selection model. The combination of the cure model and the default model is called the Cure After Default Model.

It is common in credit risk evaluation that cured firms are no longer treated as defaulted firms, see (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2005). Hence the cure event is indirectly recognized, but it is not separately modeled and evaluated. In order to construct a plain model that uses this approach, the DDM is derived. In the DDM the cured firms are treated as not-defaulted. The DDM is used in the following to compare the CADM with a standard credit risk approach.

A default model is estimated, which uses only the definitely defaulted firms as observed default events. Through this model different firm-specific and macroeconomic risk drivers are identified. The risk drivers are based on known financial data of the previous time period. The default intensity

                         Based on these probabilities the individual defaults can be predicted. The approach is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . It should be noted that the applied exponential default intensity models do not cover possible jump processes or contagious influences within the default behavior and/or the cure behavior regarding the firms in the sample. In our developed models clustering effects are partially covered and explained via macroeconomic variables. In principle, those influences are not discussed in this paper and are left for future research. For example, Duffie et al. (2009) recently covered this research area.

Mixture cure models (MCM) are applied in order to deal with heavy censoring in the survival analysis. These models were recently used in the credit risk framework in order to enhance credit scoring models as well as for models used to evaluate defaultable bonds or the bankruptcy of firms. MCM themselves are not a new statistical scope; they are common in medical science. These models are a mixture of the normal group of subjects at risk, which either experiences death or is censored, and a group of cured long-term survivors. This analysis method allows both modeling of timing and modeling of the probability of the event of interest at the same time. Furthermore, it is possible to explain timing and probability through different risk drivers and to estimate them separately via parametric, semi-parametric or non-parametric models. An implicit condition of this model type is a sufficient long data history because a cured person can normally not be identified in the short run, see (Yu & Peng, 2008).

The MCM consists of a cure fraction and a latency survival model. The probability that a subject i

                         but they do not have to be. In order to separate this model from a model without a cure fraction as well as from the cure probability model generated through logistic regression, it is called the latency model. Without a cure fraction the model is reduced to a standard survival model, see (Corbière & Joly, 2007; Yu & Peng, 2008). Fig. 2
                         shows the relation between the different fractions.

If one extends the mixture cure approach so that it fits in a default prediction environment with observed cure events after the default event, several modifications have to be made.

Firstly, the assumption that there is a fraction of borrowers in a credit portfolio, which is not connected with any default risk and will never default is dropped. In the CADM every firm has a certain default probability and the possibility of being cured is only relevant for those firms, which triggered a default event. This is due to the fact that only after an observed default event can a firm be cured. This assumption seems to be more intuitive and is also underlined by the empirical observations concerning the recent financial crisis of 2008 as well as the ongoing crisis in 2011/2012. There seems to be no group of borrowers that are not under risk. Every credit agreement is currently at risk, even if it is a very unlikely one.

Secondly, from an empirical point of view only defaulted firms are able to become cured. In order to incorporate this fact in the model, the two steps of the MCM are changed: in a first step, a default model is used to calculate the firm’s individual default probability in order to predict the default events. In a second step, a cure probability model is used to calculate the firm’s individual cure probability in order to predict the cure events among the predicted defaults. The order of the two steps in the CADM now displays the empirical circumstances of resurrection in the credit-default environment.

Thirdly, the change of the order of the two steps has major implications on the default probability as well as on the cure probability model: if the cure event was not separated previously, one has to apply a default probability model that recognizes all default events, even if the firms might be cured afterward. Hence, the DDM is not appropriate and a new default probability has to be estimated that counts every default event as a default, independent of its further deployment. In the new default model of the CADM, similar to the DDM, different firm-specific and macroeconomic risk drivers are identified. The risk drivers are based on known financial data of the previous time period.

Fourthly, the logistic regression used in the MCM concerning the cure probability model incorporates only the narrow sample of defaulted firms and ignores the rest of the firms in the credit portfolio, because the cure event is only observable when the default event is observed. Nevertheless, the not-defaulted firms have a certain default probability. The exclusion of the not-defaulted firms would neglect this influence and might generate a sample selection bias, see (Heckman, 1976, 1979). A bivariate Probit sample selection model is used to omit a possible bias, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Greene, 1998; Lee et al., 2004). The model is used to predict individual cure probabilities

                                    i
                                 
                              
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         for the firms, whereas different one-year time-lagged firm-specific and macroeconomic influence factors are evaluated as influence factors.

After considering the described modifications a new credit default model that includes cure-specific risk drivers besides the default influencing ones is created: The CADM. It is visualized in Fig. 3
                        .

The default model in the CADM incorporates all observed default events, independent of the further deployment, because the cure event is introduced after the default model. The definition of the default event is the only difference concerning the default model of the DDM, which reduces the number of default events by the fraction of cured firms.

The firm’s cure probability is relevant for the second step and is used to identify significant variables that influence a firm’s probability of being cured. With the cure-related risk drivers it is possible to calculate a firm’s individual cure probabilities in order to predict cure events among the predicted default events in the credit portfolio. This model introduces all resurrection-related information concerning the individual borrowers.

The probability distribution of firm-specific defaults, that are needed for the distribution of portfolio loss, are based on individual firm-specific default probabilities. The default probabilities are calculated by a model with observable firm-specific and macroeconomic risk drivers. The correlation is induced by the macroeconomic variables, see (Duffie et al., 2007; Yamaguchi, Ohashi, & Matsuyama, 2002).

An accelerated-failure-time model is used. The estimated findings, therefore, have to be interpreted as follows: covariables with a positive parameter delay the time until a default occurs. They protect the firm against a possible default. Covariables with a negative value accelerate the time until a default occurs. In order to receive the findings of a proportional hazard model, one can simply change the algebraic sign of the estimated parameters, see (Cleves et al., 2004).

The observable firm-specific and macroeconomic variables of the years 2002–2006 are the input data of the default model. The variables are one-year time-lagged.

The financial data of the year 2007 is not applied, because defaults are not available for the year 2008. The covariables are assumed to be constant within the different time periods, they change only from year to year. The time homogenous description refers only to the respective time period. Over the different time periods the variables change and become time dependent.

Annual financial statements and accordingly subsequent derived ratings have always been in the main focus when default probabilities for individual firms are calculated, see (Altman, 1968; Beaver, 1966, 1968a, 1968b; Ohlson, 1980). Duffie et al. (2007) used for the evaluation of a default model based on US American industrial firm’s three-month treasury interest rates as macroeconomic influence factors. Also the GDP is evaluated as a potential influence factor. In our paper we use different quotes derived from the annual financial statements of the firms in the credit portfolio as well as the sales and total capital as proxy for the firm size. We use two different proxies for the firm size in order to cover the whole spectrum of industries. The 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread and the German annual GDP growth rate are used to capture macroeconomic influences. The 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread is the spread between the unsecured 12-month EURIBOR and the secured 12-month EUREPO, hence a measure regarding the amount of uncertainty in the financial system, see (Halberstadt & Stapf, 2012).

The logarithmized firm-specific covariates ln(Sales) and ln(Total Capital) are mentioned in units of a thousand euros. The evaluated variables measured in quotes are Gross Profit, Long-term Liabilities, Current Liabilities, Long-term Provisions and Equity in relation to the Total Capital and Fixed Assets in relation to Total Assets. Also the evaluated macroeconomic variables 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread and annual growth rate of the German GDP are one-year time-lagged. In this estimation method the cured default events are mentioned as not-defaulted. The remaining default events are defined as definite default events and are captured in the estimation procedure through the dummy variable dd. The parameters are estimated through the maximum likelihood method. The likelihood function is applied to the individual firm i

                            as well as (Yamaguchi et al., 2002). The 1243 default events are reduced to 922 observed default events due to missing data. These observed default events are further reduced to 657, because the 265 cured firms are not treated as defaults. The estimations are made with the NLMIXED procedure of the program SAS.

As in the MCM a cure fraction exists in the CADM. A substantial difference is that this cure fraction is not a fraction of subjects which will never experience the event of interest but it is a fraction of firms, related to all defaulted firms, that could recover without any loss for the bank. One main advantage compared to the MCM is the identifiability of the cured fraction because these cure events are definitely observable.

An additional challenge compared to the MCM is the possible sample selection bias due to the sample reduction from the N firms in the portfolio to the reduced sample of defaulted firms. In order to avoid a possible bias a bivariate Probit sample selection model is used, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Greene, 1998; Heckman, 1976, 1979).

                            is a binary variable, because its outcome is 1 if the defaulted firm is cured afterward and 0 if it is not-cured. The standard Heckman method is not appropriate concerning this special case, because of the fact that the outcome of the second equation is binary. In order to handle the Heckman model with two binary dependent variables, we apply a bivariate Probit sample selection model, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Lee et al., 2004).

                           The firm-specific data was provided by Dresdner Bank AG in spring 2008. Dresdner Bank AG was taken over by the Commerzbank AG in summer 2008.
                        
                        
                           6
                         The database contains multi-year data from balance sheets and profit and loss statements concerning a total number of 5930 German firms as well as 1243 observed default events. Triggers for a default event are, for example, 90-day-delayed-payment, notice of relationship-cancelation through the bank and bankruptcy. Concerning the defaulted firms information regarding the deployment in the bank is available, for example, if the exposure is written off, if the credit was sold with discount or if the default could be handled without loss for the bank. In total 23,894 financial statements over a period from 01.01.2002 to 31.12.2007 were evaluated.

The database concerning the financial statements include: branch, sales, EBITDA,
                           7
                           Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
                        
                        
                           7
                         EBITA,
                           8
                           Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization.
                        
                        
                           8
                         gross profit, net profit, current liabilities, long-term liabilities, long-term provisions, equity, fixed assets as well as current assets.

The following units are applied concerning the firm-specific information: the quotes of gross profit to total capital, current liabilities to total capital, long-term liabilities to total capital, long-term provisions to total capital, equity to total capital and fixed assets to total assets as well as current assets to total assets. In addition, the logarithmized total capital and the logarithmized sales are used. The logarithmized values are based on units of a thousand euros. The logarithmization is done in order to smooth the data and hence generate more comparable findings with the estimated quotes. In Table 1
                         the default event frequencies and cure event frequencies regarding the firms’ industries are displayed in percent of the total number. The data is sorted in descending order regarding the defaulted and cured firms and shows the top 15 industries.
                           9
                           The industry classification was applied by Dresdner Bank and corresponds to the classification pattern of the German census bureau.
                        
                        
                           9
                         The highest percentages of the defaulted and cured firms as well as the defaulted and not cured firms can be found concerning the industry sectors trade intermediation, wholesale trade, provision of economical services and property and habitations whereas the second an the third industry have changed ranks regarding the definite defaulted firms. 41% of the cured and 37% of the not cured firms operate in these three sectors. The default event frequencies as well as the cure event frequencies regarding the firms’ size are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . The size of the firms is measured through nine different sales volumes. The categories are defined in million Euro with: lower 2.5 in category 1, above 2.5 to 5.0 in category 2, above 5 to 10 in category 3, above 10 to 25 in category 4, above 25 to 50 in category 5, above 50 to 100 category 6, above 100 to 250 in category 7, above 250 to 500 in category 8 and above 500 in category 9. It can be seen that especially regarding the very high and very low volumes the cured firms are slightly more represented.

From the total of 5930 firms in the database 1243 firms defaulted in the period from January 2002 to December 2007. For the year 2002 only not-defaulted firms are mentioned in the database and the first defaults are observed in January 2003, because the bank’s risk and accounting system was activated in the turn of the year 2002/2003. A total of 2779years of balance sheet data are counted among these defaulted firms. That means that on average 2.2years per firm are known. Regarding the 4687 not-defaulted firms on average 4.5years per firm are known. The further deployment in the bank after the default of the firms is also part of the data. Five possible occurrences are mentioned: Cured means that the problem with the firm could be removed without any loss for the bank, Write-off means that some part or all of the exposure had to be expensed, Worked-out means that the loan agreement is canceled and the securities had to be disposed to cover the outstanding liabilities, Distressed-sold means that the loans had been sold with loss. The fifth calibration is Unknown, which means that the further development after the default event is not definitely known. Concerning the calibration of the defaulted firms in the database 333 firms are Cured, 269 are Write-off, 244 are Unknown, 239 are Worked-out and 158 are mentioned as Distressed-sold.

In Table 2
                         the findings concerning the parameter estimation of the DDM are shown. Three different variants are distinguished; the first contains only a constant and the macroeconomic variables, the second variant includes all evaluated variables, and the third variant is the final default model of the DDM. In addition, the hazard rate is mentioned. It indicates a covariable’s influence on the default intensity if its value is changed by one unit, given that all other variables remain unchanged, see (Cleves et al., 2004).

One should keep in mind that the coefficients are depending on their units. For example, the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread is mentioned in percent while the ln(Sales) is mentioned in logarithmized units of a thousand euros. The quotes are mentioned as ratios, for example, 0.23. A change by one unit could be seen, for example, as a change from 0 to 1. If one would like to interpret the quote’s influence in percent points, one needs to divide the parameter and the standard error by 100. The significance would remain unchanged, see (Cleves et al., 2004).

Furthermore, it should be noted that the estimated models are not separately estimated by industry sector due to the not sufficient number of observed default events by industry. We also tested regarding non-operative parental holding companies. We identified 20 firms without any own operative sales and excluded them in order to test the robustness of the models. The modified findings were nearly unchanged and robust.

Variant 1 contains only a constant and the macroeconomic variables. All estimated parameters are significant at the 1% level. The second variant of the DDM includes all reviewed covariates in the database. The estimated parameters for the variables Fixed Assets to Total Assets and Long-term Provisions to Total Assets are not significant. All other parameters are significant at the 1% level. A negative algebraic sign can be seen concerning Current Liabilities to Total Capital, Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital, Long-term Provisions to Total Capital, Fixed Assets to Total Capital, ln(Total Capital) and the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread.

The third variant is derived from the second one and is the applied default model in the DDM. The remaining significant parameters are unchanged in significance and influence direction.

The negative influence of the Current and Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital indicates that firms within the observed portfolio with a quite high value concerning the liability quotes have to pay a relative high amount of interest on average, are less flexible concerning an expansion of the credit lines for necessary investments or an spontaneous recognition of market chances.

The positive influence of the Gross Profit to Total Capital underlines the intuitive assumption that a high profit means a high financial strength, flexibility and it is an indicator for a well-working market strategy. The positive influence of the Equity to Total Capital might be due to a higher financial flexibility and stability of firms with a high amount of equity.

The variables ln(Sales) and ln(Total Capital) can both be seen as proxies for the size of a firm. Hence, the opposing influence of these parameters is somewhat surprising at first glance. Taking the influence direction into account one can say that firms, which are bigger concerning their sales, have a lower default probability because of their market influence and have a higher bargaining power, whereas firms which are bigger concerning their assets might have a lower flexibility, cannot react in time if changes in important markets are developing and thus fail in these situations more often. Additionally, one could say that firms with more assets have higher positions of liabilities and are therefore more likely to default.

The positive influence of the GDP can be explained by the fact that in economic upturns a lower number of firms fails due to the high market demand.

The extreme high negative influence of the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread indicates that higher uncertainty and pressure in the financial market has an high negative effect on the firms default probability.

The findings concerning the parameter estimation of the covariates regarding the bivariate Probit sample selection model are shown in Table 3
                        . Variant 1 contains the default model for the probability of selection among all N firms as well as the cure model with sample correction concerning the defaulted firms. Hence the selection part of variant 1 is the default model of the CADM and the cure part of Variant 1 is the cure model of the CADM. Variant 2 is the cure model without sample correction concerning the defaulted firms. In order to compare the findings of the sample selection part of the CADM with the default model of the DDM, the algebraic sign of the parameters has to be switched. In the default model of the DDM an accelerated failure time model is used. Hence, a default probability enhancing variable is indicated by a negative algebraic sign of its estimated parameter because it reduces the time to the default event. In the sample selection part the parameters of the regression are estimated by Probit. 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                                 
                                    it
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                         indicates a default event, hence a positive-valued parameter indicates a default event supporting variable. The selection part of the CADM and the default model of the DDM evaluate similar things: default event influencing variables. All estimated firm-specific and macroeconomic parameters in the selection part are identical in their significance and influence direction with the respective parameters in the default model of the DDM. This fact underlines the robustness of the identified risk-driving variables in the selection part of the CADM.

Concerning the selection part of the model in variant 1, the constant as well as the estimated parameters of the macroeconomic and firm-specific risk drivers are significant at the 1% level. The estimated parameters have a negative value concerning the constant and the firm-specific covariables ln(Sales), Gross Profit to Total Capital and Equity to Total Capital as well as the macroeconomic covariable growth rate of the German GDP. The estimated parameters regarding the Current Liabilities to Total Capital, Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital, ln(Total Capital) and the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread have a positive algebraic sign. A relative high value concerning the variables Gross Profit to Total Capital, Equity to Total Capital, ln(Sales) and growth rate of the German GDP has a positive effect on a firms survival probability. A high value concerning the variables Current Liabilities to Total Capital, Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital and ln(Total Capital) and 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread has a negative impact. A higher Gross Profit to Total Capital is an indicator for financial strength and a sustainable business model with high margins. Firms with a quite high Equity to Total Capital can face short-term-loss situations without much effort, they have a better standing in loan negotiations and have a higher financial stability. For firms with relatively high short- and long-term liability positions, it might be more difficult to get more liabilities form their borrowers. Hence, possible short-term opportunities cannot be realized with further credit. In addition, there is a higher dependence concerning their borrowers and a loss situation can soon end up in bankruptcy. As discussed concerning the findings of the default model regarding the DDM, the variables ln(Sales) and ln(Total Capital) can both be seen as proxies for the size of a firm. The findings suggest that firms with relative more sales have a lower default probability because of their market influence and a higher bargaining power. Whereas firms which are bigger concerning their assets might have a lower flexibility and cannot react in time in situations of important market developments and thus more often fail in these situations. The GDP has a significant positive influence on a firms survival probability. The positive influence of the GDP can be explained by the fact, that in a prosperous economic environment a lower number of firms fails because inefficiencies regarding the business model are not punished instantly by the market. The negative influence of the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread indicates that in situation with high uncertainty and stress in the financial market firms tend to default more often.

Comparing the cure part of variant 1 with variant 2 one can see that the cure model without sample correction would miss to identify the cure-relevant variable Long-term Liabilities related to Total Capital. Furthermore, the constant and the estimated parameters concerning the variables ln(Sales), Current Liabilities to Total Capital and Long-term Provisions to Total Capital have a much lower significance. Therefore, the sample selection in the model would miss to identify a cure-relevant variable and lead to a weaker model, if not corrected through the applied Heckman sample selection method. This is due to the fact that the cure part of the model contains only observable information regarding a smaller fraction of the evaluated firms in the data, because only defaulted firms can become cured. The estimation of variant 2 is only based on the non-randomly selected small sample of defaulted firms. Hence, the influence of the not-defaulted firms, which indeed have a certain probability of default, is completely missed by the logistic regression in variant 2. The applied bivariate Probit sample selection method of variant 1 includes also the influence of the not-defaulted firms in order to omit a sample selection bias, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Heckman, 1976, 1979).

The probability of being cured in the evaluated model is solely depending on firm-specific influence factors since the GDP and the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread are only significant in the selection part. The constant and the estimated parameters for the variable ln(Total Capital) and Current Liabilities to Total Capital are significant on the 1% level and the parameters for the ln(Sales), the Long-term Provisions and Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital are significant on the 5% level. The ln(Total Capital) and the parameters regarding the variables Current Liabilities, Long-term Liabilities and Long-term Provisions to Total Capital have a negative influence on the probability of being cured, while the ln(Sales) support a cure event. A relatively low debt position may enhance the flexibility and be helpful for the restructuring of the credit agreements and thus enhances the probability to cure a firm. This could be the reason for the negative influence of the variables Current and Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital. Furthermore, one can assume that there was a good reason to undertake the provisions concerning uncertain risks although not all risks are covered. If a firm has a high financial risk potential due to court proceedings or charges then the probability of being cured after a default event is very low. The restructuring of bigger firms might be more complex. Usually, multiple lenders have to find common agreements. The financial analysis as well as the implementation of a new strategy needs preparation and time. Hence, cure attempts fail more often, which is indicated by the negative influence of the ln(Total Capital), and this can be seen as a proxy for a firm’s size. Another proxy for a firm’s size can be the ln(Sales). Concerning this variable bigger firms tend to have a higher cure probability. This might be due to the fact that a firm that is bigger than others concerning its sales might be an important player in the market with some significant influence. Furthermore, firms with higher sales might have a higher probability of being cured because even a slight cost reduction during the restructuring phase would enhance instantly the margins and, therefore, the profitability.

The individual default probabilities for two firms regarding the CADM and the DDM are shown in Figs. 6 and 7
                           
                            for two exemplary firms from the credit portfolio. Firm A has on average a relative low default probability and firm B has on average a relative high default probability. The one-year default probabilities are predicted for the years 2003–2007 based on the known data of the years 2002–2006 that are applied in the two estimation methods. The default probabilities for firm A are generally lower than those of firm B regarding all evaluated time periods. This holds for both models. The CADM predicts a higher default probability than the DDM for both firms. Firm A and B face a strong probability decrease between 2003 and 2004 regarding the CADM and the DDM. The probability of default for firm A decreases from 6.5% in 2003 to 3.0% in 2004 and for firm B from 10.5% to 4.5%, respectively. The default probability of the DDM shows the same behavior and decreases from 5.0% in 2003 to 1.5% in 2004 and for firm B from 7.5% to 1.8%, respectively. After a further significant default probability reduction regarding the year 2005 the default probability remains stable for both firms and both models in the year 2006. The default probabilities concerning the year 2007 are on a relative low level, between 0.1% and 0.3% for firm A and between 0.25% and 0.5% for firm B. The difference between the predicted default probabilities of the DDM and the CADM nearly vanishes on this low probability level. The general higher default probabilities in the CADM are due to the fact that some of the defaulted firms face a cure event and, therefore, reduce the number of defaulted firms in a further step while the DDM only predicts defaulted firms that are not-cured afterward.

The distributions of the default probabilities of the complete credit portfolio regarding the DDM and the CADM are shown in Table 4
                           . In addition, the CADM-related cure probabilities of the defaulted firms are shown over the different time periods. The predicted default and cure probabilities are based on the known data of the years 2002–2006.

The development of the portfolio-based default probabilities in Table 4 is quite similar to the already stated individual probabilities of firm A and firm B in Fig. 7. The default probabilities concerning the CADM are generally on a significant higher level than the probabilities of the DDM. From the year 2003–2004 a reduction can be stated regarding both methods. The mean of the default probability reduces from 9.47% to 3.96% regarding the CADM and from 7.09% to 1.50% regarding the DDM. In 2005 the mean reduces further to 1.76% and 0.60%, respectively. In 2006 the default probabilities are increasing slightly regarding the CADM to 1.80% and are further declining to 0.55% regarding the DDM. Finally in 2007 a sharp decrease can be stated. The mean reduces to 0.69% concerning the CADM and to 0.24% concerning the DDM.

The CADM-related cure probabilities do not show the up- and downturns of the default probabilities. The mean of the cure probabilities is at a constant range between 60% and 62% over the different time periods. This indicates that on average nearly two third of the defaulted firms can be cured. In addition, if one takes the cure probabilities into account, the relative high difference between the default probabilities concerning the two models nearly vanishes regarding the time periods from 2004 to 2007. Hence, the two models are predicting nearly the same default probability on the “net” definite default level. Regarding the year 2003 the difference between the default probabilities is not so high. The “net” definite default level is nearly 1.5% points lower in the CADM. The main advantage of the CADM is that it enables a bank to identify which firms will most likely be cured with no loss. For example, it could be better to predict ten defaulted firms which can possibly be cured and it is known that the two firms with the highest earning upside for the bank will most likely be cured than to have five definitely defaulted firms with high and low earning upsides for the bank and no option concerning the cure probabilities. The CADM generates a higher default probability but it also presents a lot of additional information concerning the defaulted firms as well as the chance of a cure event. If the predicted defaults are reduced by the predicted cured firms, the defaults are on nearly the same level. Hence, no additional loss is predicted but rather a lot of additional information. A bank could use the cure probability concerning the predicted defaults to ensure that the right ones will become cured. The bank gets the information if a defaulted borrower with high earning prospects due to cross-sell will probably become cured. This information allows “cherry picking” among the defaulted firms and thus might enhance the earning prospects. Furthermore the “intensive care” performance can be measured directly and thus it can be optimized in order to enhance the cure probabilities of all defaulted firms. The CADM ensures a more detailed risk management and might enhance the earning upsides of a bank because the cure probability of defaulted firms with high earning prospects is known and individual treatments based on that information can be managed.

The developed CADM is based on the quite new approach to apply mixture cure models in the credit default scope, see (Beran & Djaidja, 2007; Mo & Yau, 2010; Topaloglu & Yildirim, 2009; Yildirim, 2008). Recently (Tong et al., 2012) show that the MCM is a competitive and efficient approach regarding the credit risk analysis.

In this final empirical section, we want to evaluate the model fit of the CADM compared to the MCM in order to see if the CADM has some advantage over the MCM. Therefore we estimated both models and measured the in-sample-fit with the AIC, the Schwarz Criterion and the Log-Likelihood. We used the QLIM procedure of the program SAS for the parameter estimation. The findings are shown in Table 5
                        .

The CADM dominates the MCM regarding all three measures. This might be mainly because of two main advantages of the CADM. First, the sample bias is eliminated by the applied bivariate Probit sample selection model, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Lee et al., 2004). Because of that the influence of the not defaulted firms regarding the cure events is also considered in the CADM without a possible bias. In the MCM the cured firms are separated from the at risk group and hence, their influence is not incorporated in the at risk group of firms. The information regarding the generation of a cure event might be suppressed. Second, the CADM uses observable cure events and is not depending on a constructed definition of long term surviving. Through this, the CADM is more close to the empiric reality, see (Boyes et al., 1989; Corbière & Joly, 2007; Greene, 1998; Lee et al., 2004; Yu & Peng, 2008).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper the Cure After Default Model is developed in order to incorporate the possibility of a cure fraction in a credit default prediction model. It identifies different default probability and cure probability influencing variables and uses the default- and cure-related information. The findings of the CADM are compared to the Definite Default Model which treats the defaulted firms that are cured as never defaulted and ignores cure-event-influencing risk drivers.

Concerning the DDM significant parameters are estimated regarding the variables ln(Sales) and ln(Total Capital) as well as Gross Profit, Current and Long-term Liabilities and Equity to Total Capital and the German GDP growth rate as well as the 12-month EURIBOR–EUREPO spread. Concerning the influence direction of the covariates the findings are nearly equal to those of the default model of the CADM. The CADM combines a default probability model with a cure probability model. The parameter estimation concerning the cure probability is done with a bivariate Probit sample selection model. Due to the included cure probability model the firm-specific variable ln(Sales) can be identified as significant, cure probability enhancing variable. The firm-specific variables Current and Long-term Liabilities to Total Capital as well as Long-term Provisions to Total Capital and the ln(Total Capital) can be identified with a strong negative influence on the cure probability.

The findings indicate that the treatment of the possibility of being cured within a default prediction model has a significant influence on the default risk, hence it seems to be very important for the risk management to incorporate the possibility of being cured and its additional information into credit risk modeling. The findings and interpretations should sensibilize for potential future default risks through their results.
