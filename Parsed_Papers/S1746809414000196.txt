               Abstract
               
                  Detection of early-stage liver diseases is a challenge in medical field. Automated diagnostics based on machine learning therefore could be very important for liver tests of patients. This paper investigates 225 liver function test records (each record include 14 features), which is a subset from 1000 patientsâ€™ liver function test records that include the records of 25 patients with liver disease from a community hospital. We combine support vector data description (SVDD) with data visualisation techniques and the glowworm swarm optimisation (GSO) algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can achieve 96% sensitivity, 86.28% specificity, and 84.28% accuracy. The new method is thus well-suited for diagnosing early liver disease.
