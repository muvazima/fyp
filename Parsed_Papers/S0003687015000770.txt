                  Virtual User Models (VUMs) can be a valuable tool for accessibility and ergonomic evaluation of designs in simulation environments. As increasing the accessibility of a design is usually translated into additional costs and increased development time, the need for specifying the percentage of population for which the design will be accessible is crucial. This paper addresses the development of VUMs representing specific groups of people with disabilities. In order to create such VUMs, we need to know the functional limitations, i.e. disability parameters, caused by each disability and their variability over the population. Measurements were obtained from 90 subjects with motor disabilities and were analyzed using both parametric and nonparametric regression methods as well as a proposed hybrid regression method able to handle small sample sizes. Validation results showed that in most cases the proposed regression analysis can produce valid estimations on the variability of each disability parameter.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is important to realize that people with disabilities are not a tiny minority of the population. Around 640 million people worldwide live with a disability (Enable, 2008). Many strategies have been undertaken worldwide to enforce accessibility for people with disabilities. For instance, the European Commission has launched a number of initiatives (Klironomos et al., 2006; Bühler and Stephanidis, 2004), such as the eEurope 2002, the eEurope 2005, the EDeAN network and the DfA@eInclusion Coordination Action (Šimšík and Galajdová, 2008) to promote the “Design For All” (DfA) principles that will lead to more accessible services and systems. The Commission has also advocated the use of standardization to improve the effectiveness and uptake of DfA. It mandated CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to include the “Design for All” concept in relevant standardization initiatives. Digital Human Modeling (DHM) can significantly support designers and developers on staying compliant with the aforementioned strategies, as it reduces the need for physical prototypes, and also enables the incorporation of ergonomics science and human factors engineering principles earlier in the design process.

DHM and simulation has gained importance in the past few years (Phillips and Badler, 1988; van der Meulen and Seidl, 2007; Porter et al., 2004; Lind et al., 2008; Feyen et al., 2000) and allows designers to easily observe and evaluate the interaction of the designed product with a virtual user having specific needs and/or preferences. Simulation offers designers the opportunity to explore how a new system would behave before the real prototype is developed, or how an existing system would perform if altered, thus, reducing development time and costs. Moreover, there are cases where simulation is the only method of verifying that a design concept is acceptable to a prescribed population, since hardware prototypes are not available (Chaffin, 2001).

The core concept of this paper is to empower the accessibility and ergonomics of new products by introducing a novel user modeling technique for people with disabilities, based on statistical analysis. The main goal of the paper is the development of accurate Virtual User Models (VUMs) representing specific disabled population groups. Measurements were initially obtained from a total of 90 subjects having the following disabilities: Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. Statistical analysis was performed on these measurements using both parametric and nonparametric regression analysis, as well as a proposed hybrid regression method able to handle small sample sizes by using both real and virtual samples along with information found in the literature. The accuracy and validity of the final regression results were assessed using a new set of measurements coming from 72 different subjects with the same four disabilities.

In recent years, the advent of new tools for musculoskeletal simulation has increased the potential for significantly improving the ergonomic design process and ergonomic assessment of designs (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Garg and Kapellusch (2009) summarized the possibility of 2D and 3D biomechanical models for the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Musculoskeletal models consist of a set of body segments connected by joints with speciﬁed degrees-of-freedom (dof) and spanned by muscles and ligaments with speciﬁed origins, insertions and pathways (Damsgaard et al., 2006). Indicative is the work of Lee et al. (2009) that introduced a highly-detailed biomechanical model of the human upper body. Its dynamic skeleton comprises 68 bones with 147 jointed degrees of freedom while its muscle model incorporates 814 muscles, each of which is modeled as a piecewise uniaxial Hill-type force actuator. Other significant efforts on biomechanical modeling can be found in (Sifakis et al., 2005; Lee and Terzopoulos, 2006; Sueda et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2013; Pontonnier et al., 2014).

Inverse kinematics plays a key role in the simulation of articulated figures for accessibility assessment purposes and ergonomics. Often these figures contain more than a hundred degrees of freedom, making it almost infeasible for the animator to manipulate every joint to control the figure's posture. With the assistance of an inverse kinematics algorithm, the animator merely gives the desired location of certain chosen points on the body and relies on the algorithm to automatically compute a set of joint angles that satisfy the end-effector constraints (Tolani et al., 2000). Likewise, inverse-dynamics (Kuo, 1998; Blajer et al., 2007) plays also a key role in accessibility assessment of virtual prototypes through simulation, as it enables the computing of the internal joint forces and moments associated with a measured motion (Wagner et al., 2007). Inverse dynamics computes the muscle activation based on a specific task and, although this puts many restrictions on the model, it is computationally much more efficient than forward dynamics (Damsgaard et al., 2006).

Special populations of individuals, including people with disabilities and older people, may have capabilities that are quite different even from what is published in some ergonomics guides for people with functional limitations (Chaffin, 2005). Thus, there is an imperative need for research on the development of predictive and valid models providing accurate results regarding the functional limitations of people with disabilities. The two main approaches employed in statistical user modeling are content-based and collaborative (Zukerman and Albrecht, 2001). In the content-based approach, the behaviour of a user is predicted from his or her past behaviour, while in the collaborative approach, a user's behaviour is predicted from the behaviour of other “similar” people. When trying to identify how functional limitations vary over a population having a specific disability, in order to develop accurate VUMs representing people with disabilities, the collaborative approach seems most suitable.

Statistical analysis can lead to realistic assumptions about the users' functional limitations and can be a powerful tool for the identification of possible associations between disability parameters. For instance, linear regression modeling revealed that demographic and stroke pathology factors like age, sex, premorbid disability, side of stroke and stroke type as well as visuospatial neglect are not associated with balance disability after stroke, while weakness and sensation are strongly related with balance disability (Tyson et al., 2006). Langenderfer et al. (2006) tried to simulate variability in musculoskeletal parameters on glenohumeral external rotation strength in healthy normals, and in rotator cuff tear cases using a Monte Carlo model. The goal was to determine if variability in musculoskeletal parameters could quantifiably explain variability in glenohumeral external rotation strength. The model predicted measured joint torques for healthy normals, subjects with supraspinatus tears, and subjects with infraspinatus–supraspinatus tears with small error.

Moreover, regression models may also lead to forecasts about a person's health state. Khaleeli et al. (2008) used ordinal logistic regression to predict progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Regression analysis identified the following independent variables that predicted progression: male sex, shorter disease duration, slower timed walk at baseline (best overall predictor), deterioration in expanded disability status scale score and reduction in brain volume over 2 years. Vaneckova et al. (2012) used non-parametric and multiple regression models to identify the most reliable predictors of multiple sclerosis and its changes over 9 years. The results of the study revealed corpus callosum atrophy as an accurate predictor of future disability accumulation. Multivariate parametric regression models have also been developed to predict short-term disability in multiple sclerosis (MP) patients using the Expander Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and multimodal sensory EP (mEP) to optimize decisions concerning treatment (Margaritella et al., 2012).

Some research efforts focused on the variability in the capability of an individual based on the disability severity. For instance, Carpinella et al. (2007) examined the quantitative description of locomotor symptoms in subjects with mild Parkinson's Disease and results showed a tendency to bradykinetic gait, with reduction of walking speed and cadence. Steultjens et al. (2000) assessed the relationship between joint range of motion (ROM) and disability in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and even the results showed a clear relationship between joint ROM and disability, it does not apply to all actions of the knee or hip joints. Various scales have been proposed to describe the severity of each disability and be used for functional outcome prediction. In general, such a scale consists of several variables for observing the signs and symptoms, and each variable is categorized for scoring. For instance, the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS) (Chino et al., 1996) rates performance on scales of 0–5 or 0–3. SIAS total scores proved useful for stroke outcome prediction (Tsuji et al., 2000). However, a typical limitation of severity scales is that scores can be translated into a range of values, not a single value. In SIAS, for instance, when passive shoulder abduction is limited to less than 45°, a score of 0 is given. A score of 1 means that the joint can be abducted from 45° to 90°, a score of 2 indicates abduction from 90° to 150°, and a score of 3 indicates that abduction of the shoulder beyond 150° is possible.

Many efforts have been presented regarding the simulated accessibility assessment of designs using virtual humans. An indicative case is the HADRIAN tool (Marshall et al., 2010), which uses virtual user representations based on measurements of physical characteristics and capabilities of 100 real individuals (Gyi et al., 2004). However, HADRIAN uses these 100 virtual humans as personas and performs accessibility assessment for each of these virtual personas independently. A design may be found accessible or inaccessible for a specific persona. But as this persona represents a single real person and not a population group, the assessment result cannot be generalized, in order to consider the specific design as generally accessible or inaccessible.

As increasing the accessibility of a design is usually translated into additional costs and increased development time, due to modifications needed to cover user needs, the need for specifying an accessibility level is crucial for designers and developers. For instance, a car designer may want a new car interior to be accessible at least for 80% of people with Parkinson's disease. The use of VUMs representing specific disabled population groups in simulation conditions can enforce the whole accessibility assessment process, as it can offer designers the opportunity to identify the percentage of the population for which their design is accessible even before the real prototype is developed. However, in order to have realistic simulation results, VUMs representing people with disabilities have to be based on analysis of disability parameters measurements coming from real users.

When trying to simulate user interaction with a product to assess its accessibility, a VUM representing an accurate “instance” (i.e. the user's health status at a specific time) of a real corresponding user with disabilities is needed. Information regarding the progression of the disability or actions that have to be performed for the treatment of the patient is usually out of scope when the goal is the automatic simulated accessibility assessment. However, despite the fact that many different approaches have been proposed in the literature regarding statistical analysis of measurements coming from people with disabilities, most of them are focused on the progression of the disabilities and mainly aim to enable accurate predictions that will help physicians with the treatment of patients. This paper proposes a methodology based on statistical analysis that attempts to overcome the aforementioned limitations, focusing on the identification of variability of each disability parameter over the disabled population. Well-established parametric and nonparametric regression methods are used in conjunction with a novel hybrid approach that is able to handle small sample sizes by using both real and virtual samples along with information from the literature. The result of the regression process consists of the estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of each disability parameter. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach enables valid generalizations regarding the characteristics of specific population groups even when the sample size is small, and, thus, has potential to lead to the development of valid and accurate VUMs representing various population groups. More specifically, in 91% of the examined cases (total 117 disability parameters of four disabilities: stroke, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis were examined), the proposed analysis led to a valid estimation of the corresponding pdf. Moreover, in 42% of the examined cases, the proposed hybrid regression was found to have greater accuracy than the traditional parametric and nonparametric methods.

The proposed regression analysis for disability modeling focuses on the identification of variability of each disability parameter over the disabled population. Even if well-established parametric and nonparametric regression methods can be used for this purpose, the validity of the produced estimations is questionable when the sample size is small. Thus, the approach presented in the following paragraphs uses parametric and nonparametric regression in conjunction with a novel hybrid approach that is able to handle small sample sizes by using both real and virtual samples along with information from the literature. The result of the regression process consists of the estimation of the pdf of each disability parameter.

Parametric regression includes the estimation of the parameters of a pdf directly from raw measurements of a disability parameter, coming from real users with disabilities, based on the assumption that data follow a specific distribution. In our regression analysis mechanism, we support parametric regression covering the following set of common distributions: Normal (Frees, 1993), Exponential (Ross, 2009), Lévy (Fama and Roll, 1971), Uniform (Casella and Berger, 2001), Gamma (Mittlböck and Heinzl, 2002) and Gaussian Mixture (Sung, 2004). The pdf of each of the supported distributions is presented in Table 1
                        .

Depending on the preferred accuracy of the parametric regression results, an appropriate sample size of raw measurements is needed (Eng, 2003; Daniel and Wayne, 1995; Snedecor and Cohran, 1989).

While in parametric regression it is initially assumed that the pdf of a disability parameter follows one of the supported types (described in Table 1), nonparametric regression is not based on any initial assumptions regarding the form of the distribution. Instead, the pdf is constructed only from information derived from measurements coming from real people with disabilities. As in nonparametric regression the real measurements must supply both structure of the model as well as the model estimates, a larger set of measurements is needed compared with parametric regression. Noether (1987) examined the problem of determining the number of raw measurements required to conclude to accurate nonparametric regression results and also proposed a formula for calculating the appropriate sample size of these raw measurements. In our regression analysis mechanism for disability modeling, two common types of nonparametric regression are supported: a) Kernel regression (Li and Lin, 2006) and b) Local Polynomial Multiple Regression (Fox, 2002).

An issue of great importance in regression analysis is the size of the sample. In order to have valid regression analysis results, the sample size has to be as large as possible. On the other hand, the task of taking measurements from disabled people is very difficult and requires many resources, resulting in typically limited amounts of available real measurements. Estimating the pdf of a disability parameter using a limited set of subjects could result in great variance. In order to cope with this problem, we introduce the concept of hybrid regression that exploits both information found on the literature regarding the probability distributions followed by disability parameters along with real measurements and a set of virtual measurements. An approach for generating virtual measurements is proposed, and the whole set of measurements (both real and virtual) is then used in the EM algorithm (Lin, 2010) for the estimation of pdf parameters as follows:

Let 
                           y
                         be a disability parameter. According to the proposed hybrid regression method, the probability distribution followed by the disability parameter 
                           y
                         is defined using an ε-contaminated class of priors, namely Γ. The contaminated class controls the balance of the determinate priors,

                         and other possible priors, q's, through an ε-level of weight (Berger, 1985). The ε-contaminated class is formulated as:

The use of an ε-contaminated class of priors, Γ, can be a very valuable tool toward addressing the small sample regression problem, as it firstly enables data augmentation (DA).

The pseudocode that describes the proposed hybrid regression method is presented in Table 2
                        .

The normalized likelihood is used for choosing the most suitable regression analysis type (among the 
                           m
                         supported types) for a specific disability parameter. For its calculation, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method (Kohavi, 1995) is used, as described by Lian (2009). More specifically, using an initial set of

The regression type with the highest normalized likelihood is finally selected as the most suitable for the pdf estimation of the specific disability parameter.

In order to identify how step length varies over people with multiple sclerosis, 20 subjects were examined. There is available information in the literature reporting that step length of people with multiple sclerosis follows a Gaussian distribution with 
                           
                              μ
                              =
                              0.53
                           
                         (in m) and 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              0.09
                           
                         (in m) (Gutierrez et al., 2005).

By using the proposed hybrid regression method, as presented in section 2.3, a pdf of type given by Eq. (1) results. More specifically, in this case, π0 is a Gaussian with μ = 0.47737 and σ = 0.0932385, and q is also a Gaussian with μ = 0.480526 and σ = 0.104503, as Gaussian results to the smallest MSE (Table 3
                        ). Finally, ε = 0.4 and m = 4n (where n = 20), because this combination of ε and m results to the smallest MSE (Table 4
                        ).

The plot of the estimated pdf is presented in Fig. 1
                        
                        . Although the pdf resulted from hybrid regression has the form of a Gaussian mixture, the normalized likelihood (described in section 2.4) is greater than in the case of Gaussian mixture parametric regression, as it is also greater than in all other supported regression types (Table 5
                        ). This can be justified by considering that, in hybrid regression, information found in the literature is also taken into account and the sample size is larger, due to the virtual samples.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In order to develop valid and accurate VUMs based on the regression analysis described in Section 2, first of all, measurements from real people with disabilities have to be obtained. Then, parametric, nonparametric and hybrid regression has to be applied on these measurements and the most suitable regression type for each disability parameter has to be selected, as explained in Section 2.4. This will lead to the estimation of a pdf for each disability parameter, describing how the specific disability parameter varies over the population. Finally, the value of each disability parameter representing a preferred percentage of the disabled population can be calculated, based on integral properties.

In the context of the current research, data were initially obtained from total 90 subjects having one of the following disabilities: a) Parkinson's disease, b) stroke, c) multiple sclerosis and d) cerebral palsy (Table 6
                        ). Three sessions of measurements were conducted and the whole set of data taken from all sessions was used for the pdf estimation of each disability parameter. Then, in order to assess the validity of each estimated pdf, a second round of measurements was conducted with a set of total 72 different subjects of the same disabilities (Table 6).

This second round of measurements was also conducted in three sessions and the entire dataset coming from all sessions was used for validation. All subjects gave written consent for their participation in the experimental procedure, which was approved by the local ethics committee of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas. Gender, age and anthropometric information for the subjects measured (both validation and estimation groups) is provided in Table 7
                        . In order to assure full coverage of the severity spectrum of all the disabilities, the involved subject were chosen in a way that they uniformly cover the severity spectrum (i.e. 1/3 being mild, 1/3 moderate and 1/3 severe cases). The severity of each subject was determined by a group of collaborating clinicians that evaluated each subject at the time of the measurements. This ensures that the estimated distributions will be representative for the complete population having the specific disability.

The measurements were conducted using the VERITAS multisensorial platform (Kirchner et al., 2011a, 2011b; Afanasyev et al., 2012; Poláček et al., 2012a,b), which includes a large variety of complementary sensors. The different types of sensors used are reported in Table 8
                        .

Since the subjects were people with disabilities, it was necessary to optimize the measurement procedure, in order not to induce fatigue or discomfort to them. Taking into account the parameters that had to be measured and the ability to parallelize measurements, the measurements were splitted into five sets, as described in Table 9
                        . The full list of measures collected is presented in Tables 10, 13, 14, 15.

In the following paragraphs, details regarding the estimated pdf of each disability parameter for the examined disabilities are provided. The final type of each pdf is the one resulting to the highest normalized likelihood using LOOCV, as described in Section 2.4. For each estimated pdf, the MSE that shows the difference between the measurements used for the estimation and the corresponding estimated values was calculated. Additionally, by performing a chi-squared test, the p-value (Goodman, 1999) was also calculated to identify whether the estimated pdf fits well the new measurements (derived from the second round of measurements with 72 different subjects). When the p-value was found to be less than 0.05, a predetermined significance level typically used (Stigler, 2008; Dallal, 2012), the following null hypothesis had to be rejected:


                        H
                        
                           0
                        
                        : the set of new measurements is consistent with the estimated pdf
                     

In such cases, the pdf resulted from the proposed regression analysis was considered non-valid. In contrast, when p-value >0.05, the estimated pdf was considered valid, as there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

The estimated probability density functions of the motor disability parameters concerning people with stroke are reported in Table 10
                        .

The p-value for 26 of total 30 disability parameters was found to be greater than 0.05 (depicted in green in Table 10). Thus, the set of measurements coming from 20 new subjects with stroke was considered as consistent with the estimated pdf's for these 26 disability parameters.

The estimated probability density functions of the motor disability parameters concerning people with Parkinson's disease are presented in Table 13 (included in Appendix). The p-value for 24 of total 27 disability parameters concerning Parkinson's disease found to be greater than 0.05 (depicted in green in Table 13), which means that the set of measurements coming from 18 new subjects with Parkinson's disease is considered consistent with the estimated pdf's for 88.89% of the cases.

The estimated probability density functions of the motor disability parameters concerning people with cerebral palsy are presented in Table 14 (included in Appendix). Except from the cases of gait asymmetry and right knee angular velocity, all estimated pdf's for the disability parameters of cerebral palsy are considered valid, according to the resulted p-value.


                        Table 15 (included in Appendix) presents the type of the estimated pdf and the corresponding parameters for each motor disability parameter for people with multiple sclerosis. As reported in Table 15, the set of measurements coming from 18 new subjects with multiple sclerosis is considered consistent with the estimated pdf's for all disability parameters, except from the cases of fingers' extension and left wrist radial deviation.

The experimental results presented in the previous paragraphs showed that the proposed regression analysis can lead, in general, to valid results regarding modeling of people with disabilities. More specifically, after a validation phase, by examining the p-value resulted from a chi-squared test using a new set of measurements, the percentage of valid results per disability (number of valid pdf's/number of examined disability parameters) found to be: 86.7% for stroke, 88.9% for Parkinson's disease, 93.3% for cerebral palsy and 93.3% for multiple sclerosis. The cases in which the results were considered invalid (due to the low p-value), can be justified by considering that, in these cases, a relatively large number of outliers (measurements coming from people with very mild of very severe functional limitations in a specific body part) appeared either in the training or in the validation set and, given that the total number of measurements was small, these values could not be correctly identified as outliers.

The proposed hybrid regression method was found to provide more accurate results (based on the normalized likelihood) compared with the well-established parametric and non-parametric regression methods in 49 of total 117 examined disability parameters. The greater accuracy of the hybrid method can be justified by considering that information found in the literature is also taken into account and the sample size is larger, due to the virtual samples. This highlights its potential toward valid regression analysis with small sample sizes, which can be significantly valuable in virtual user modeling of people with disabilities, as the small number of available subjects is a typical limitation in surveys focusing on people with disabilities.

In order to show how the proposed regression analysis could be used for the development of VUMs, a tool called User Model Generator that can extract VUMs representing specific population groups has been developed. The tool aims to be used by the following two user categories: a) Developers/Designers and b) Virtual User Modelling experts/Statistical experts. Developers and designers can define the disability and the desired percentage of the disabled population to be covered, as depicted in Fig. 3
                     a. Then, the list of the corresponding disability parameters is shown (Fig. 3b) and more options regarding regression analysis are also available for VUM or statistical experts. Developers and designers can use the default values for these extra options.

After completion of the regression analysis following the proposed approach, the pdf of each disability parameter is estimated. Then, the value of each disability parameter representing the specified percentage of the disabled population is calculated, based on integral properties, as presented in Table 11
                     .

At this step, the estimated pdf of each disability parameter is plotted and the corresponding value representing the specified percentage of the disabled population is also presented (Fig. 4
                     ).

Finally, a VUM is generated in the UsiXML format (Table 12
                     ) proposed by Kaklanis et al. (2012), including all the estimated values for the corresponding disability parameters.

The exported VUMs aim to be used mainly in simulation platforms performing automatic accessibility and ergonomic assessment of virtual prototypes through physically-based simulation. Such cases can be found in (Kaklanis et al., 2010; Moschonas et al., 2011).

The present paper focuses on statistical analysis as a means for the development of VUMs representing specific groups of the disabled population that aim to be used in simulation platforms performing accessibility and ergonomic assessment of virtual prototypes. The proposed analysis is based in well-established parametric and nonparametric regression methods as well as in the novel hybrid regression method proposed herein, which is able to handle small sample sizes by using both real and virtual measurements along with information found in the literature. Experimental results revealed that the proposed methodology can produce, in general, valid estimations, which could be used for the development of VUMs representing users with disabilities.

The approach presented herein for developing valid VUMs can be divided into six main steps: a) obtain measurements from real people with disabilities, b) identify the most characteristic symptoms/functional limitations, in order to define a set of disability parameters for each disability, c) apply the proposed regression analysis to estimate the pdf describing the variability of each disability parameter over the population, d) statistically assess the validity of each estimated pdf using a new set of measurements coming from real people (different subjects than those measured in step a), e) calculate the value of each disability parameter representing a preferred percentage of the disabled population using integral properties, f) express the aforementioned values along with the corresponding disability parameters in UsiXML format resulting, thus, to a single VUM representing the preferred percentage of the population.

It has to be mentioned that the validity of the regression analysis results depends mainly on the sample size. Parametric and nonparametric regression methods cannot provide accurate estimations when a small sample size is used as input. Even if the proposed hybrid approach, in many cases, provides much more accurate results compared to parametric and nonparametric regression, a large sample size must always be targeted. Furthermore, it has to be considered that the accuracy level of the regression analysis is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the measurements themselves (sometimes the way of measuring some user characteristics like range of motion is not very accurate, since it depends on the procedure followed during the measurements, the equipment used, etc.).

Existing DfA strategies are typically based on the “average user”, which does not target specific disabilities and also cannot describe extreme cases. The methodology presented herein goes one step beyond by giving designers and developers the opportunity to assess the accessibility of their designs for various population groups having specific disabilities and also take into account extreme cases. The proposed statistical analysis has been already applied on measurements coming from 162 people with disabilities to create VUMs for supporting the simulated accessibility testing of new products and services in the five application domains targeted by the VERITAS project: a) automotive, b) smart living spaces, c) workplace design, d) infotainment and e) personal healthcare and wellbeing. The results of the VERITAS pilots regarding the validity of VUMs were pretty encouraging. It should be noted that the aforementioned domains are only indicative. The developed VUMs may be used also in any other domain, where virtual representation of people with disabilities is needed to support design for all.

Future work includes the fine-tuning of the resulted regression models (presented in Sections 3.2–3.5), by using more data coming from the literature and/or from real measurements taken from people with disabilities. Additionally, more disabilities of different types (motor, visual, hearing, cognitive, etc.) will be modeled according to the proposed methodology. Publicly available datasets containing measurements obtained by people with disabilities will also be used for both pdf estimation and validation purposes.
