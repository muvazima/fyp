                  One of the largest bottlenecks in iron and steel production is the steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process, which consists of steel-making, refining and continuous casting. The SCC scheduling is a complex hybrid flowshop (HFS) scheduling problem with the following features: job grouping and precedence constraints, no idle time within the same group of jobs and setup time constraints on the casters. This paper first models the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with the objective of minimizing the total weighted earliness/tardiness penalties and job waiting. Next, a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) approach relaxing the machine capacity constraints is presented to solve the MIP problem, which decomposes the relaxed problem into two tractable subproblems by separating the continuous variables from the integer ones. Additionally, two methods, i.e., the boundedness detection method and time horizon method, are explored to handle the unboundedness of the decomposed subproblems in iterations. Furthermore, an improved subgradient level algorithm with global convergence is developed to solve the Lagrangian dual (LD) problem. The computational results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed LR approach outperforms the conventional LR approaches in terms of solution quality, with a significantly shorter running time being observed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The hybrid flowshop (HFS) scheduling problem is a complex combinatorial problem encountered in many real-world applications Ruiz, Serifoglu, and Urlings (2008), Ribas, Leisten, and Framinan (2010). A wide variety of solution approaches, such as exact methods Gicquel, Hege, Minoux, and van Canneyt (2012), approximation methods Zhang and van de Velde (2012), heuristic algorithms Oguz, Ercan, Cheng, and Fung (2003) and meta-heuristic algorithms Ruiz and Maroto (2006), have been applied to HFS. An overview of research on HFS scheduling problems, including that investigating processing complexity, scheduling criteria and scheduling approaches, has been provided in a recent review Ruiz and Vazquez-Rodriguez (2010). This paper considers a realistic case of HFS arising from the SCC process, which exhibits the following features: job grouping and precedence constraints, no idle time within the same group of jobs and setup time constraints at the last stage.

Because most HFS scheduling problems are NP-hard and large-scale in practical applications, it is extremely difficult to obtain a high-quality schedule within an acceptable computation time Ruiz and Vazquez-Rodriguez (2010). Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is a decomposition and coordination approach that can yield near-optimal schedules in a reasonable computational time with a quantifiable accuracy. LR has emerged as a practical approach to complex scheduling problems, including single-machine Tang, Xuan, and Liu (2007), parallel-machine Luh, Hoitomt, Max, and Pattipati (1990), practical jobshop Hoitomt, Luh, and Pattipati (1993), Chen, Chu, and Proth (1998), Chen and Luh (2003) and HFS scheduling Tang, Luh, Liu, and Fang (2002, 2006), Xuan and Tang. (2007), Nishi, Hiranaka, and Inuiguchi (2010). In addressing these problems in previous studies, machine capacity constraints or operation precedence constraints were relaxed with Lagrangian multipliers. The relaxed problems were decomposed into a set of subproblems that could be solved by dynamic programming. The Lagrangian dual (LD) problems were often solved by subgradient optimization methods. The multipliers were iteratively adjusted at the ”high level” based on the subgradients corresponding to the degrees of constraint violation. At the end of each iteration, simple heuristics were applied to obtain a feasible schedule.

The conventional subgradient algorithm (CSA) is easy to implement and usually provides rapid improvement in early iterations. However, the CSA yields guaranteed convergence to the optimum of the dual problem only if the optimal dual function value is known a priori Bertsekas (1999). In the LR approach, the CSA usually sets a maximal iteration number as the termination criterion, which is selected experientially. To overcome this shortcoming, Goffin and Kiwiel (1999) proposed a simple subgradient level algorithm (SSLA) by applying a Brannlund’s level control strategy to estimate the optimum value Brannlund (1993). On the other hand, the CSAs for addressing LR problems only consider the nonnegativity constraints of the multipliers for primal problems with inequality constraints. However, even though all multipliers satisfy these constraints, some of them might result in unboundedness during the iterations (see Section 5.2.1). Therefore, it is necessary to consider not only the nonnegative constraints of multipliers but also the effects of multipliers on the objective function.

This paper considers the relaxation of the machine capacity constraints for the SCC scheduling problem and develops the SSLA to solve the LD problem. Compared with SSLA and CSA, the proposed algorithm, named the improved subgradient level algorithm (ISLA), has the following features: (1) the Brannlund’s level control strategy is embedded in the proposed algorithm to estimate the optimal value; (2) three fine-adjusting strategies are introduced to improve the efficiency of SSLA; (3) two efficient approaches considering the sufficient and necessary bounded condition of LR problem are presented to address the unboundedness during iteration; and (4) numerical results show that these strategies improve the efficiency of the algorithm dramatically.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we provide a description of the SCC process, along with the characterization of SCC scheduling in Section 2. Section 3 gives a brief review of the methods for planning and scheduling in SCC production and LR approaches for the HFS scheduling problem. The SCC scheduling is formulated as an MIP in Section 4. In Section 5, the relaxation approach and the ISLA are presented. Computational experiments are described and comparisons made in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes this study and discusses our future work.

The iron and steel industry provides raw materials for a number of other important industries, which is the most basic industry in the world economy. The manufacturing process is a multi-stage process that can be roughly divided into three phases: iron-making, steelmaking-continuous casting and steel rolling Kumar, Kumar, Chan, and Tiwari (2006). This paper studies the steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) phase, which is often a bottleneck in the manufacturing process. The principal processes for primary SCC consist of three stages: steelmaking, refining and continuous casting as shown in Fig. 1
                     .

In the first step, the steelmaking stage (LD process), hot molten iron arrives from a blast furnace in insulated vessels, often by rail, and is poured into converter furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces along with scrap steel. The produced molten iron in the same converter is called a charge (job), a basic unit of SCC production. In the second step, the refining stage (RH process and LF process), molten steel is poured into a ladle, which is transported by a crane to a refining furnace for refining. The operations at this stage aim to produce molten steel of the correct grade or chemistry. At the refining stage, a charge undergo several refining processes (such as the RH process and the LF process). Finally, graded liquid steel from the refining stage is poured into a ladle and transferred to a continuous caster, which can process multiple charges consecutively in the form of a cast (batch). The production process is detailed in Kumar et al. (2006), Tang et al. (2002). The salient features of the SCC process are summarized as follows.
                        
                           (1) All jobs (charges) follow the same process route and cannot skip stages. A job can be processed at most on one machine and a machine can process at most one job at a time. Job processing is nonpreemptive.

(2) Each machine (caster) of the last stage must process multiple jobs consecutively as a cast (batch). The operation sequence of the jobs in a cast is predefined. The processing machine of a cast at the last stage is known.

(3) A sequence-independent setup time is incurred between two adjacent casts on the same machine. Transportation time is separated from the processing time.

Because all jobs visit three or more stages in the same direction and each stage has multiple parallel identical machines, the SCC process can be viewed as a complex HFS problem with the following features: job grouping and precedence constraints, and a setup time constraint on the machines used in the last stage. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the total weighted earliness/tardiness and the total waiting-time between two operations. Regarding complexity, the single-machine problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of the weighted deviations of the job completion times from a given common due date is already NP-hard Hoogeveen and de Velde (1991). Because this problem is a special case of the SCC scheduling problem, we can conclude that the SCC scheduling problem is also NP-hard.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Solution methods for solving SCC scheduling problems can be broadly classified into three categories: mathematical programming, heuristics, and artificial intelligence. A previous comprehensive survey on various production planning and scheduling approaches for the steelmaking production have been presented in Tang, Liu, Rong, and Yang (2001). In this paper, we focus on recent advancements and review the relevant literature on SCC scheduling problems.

Regarding mathematical programming methods, Tang et al. (2002, 2007) considered an m-stage HFS problem, which was modeled as an integer programming problem. They integrated the LR and forward dynamic programming to solve the problem. Bellabdaoui and Teghem (2006) provided an MIP model for a three-stage HFS problem with two parallel machines at each stage, and solved it using standard software packages. Recently, Missbauer, Hauberb, and Stadler (2009) applied linear programming and heuristic methods to address a complex case of SCC in an Austrian steel plant where there were four stages and each stage had three parallel machines at most.

With respect to heuristic methods, Pacciarelli and Pranzo (2004) adopted an alternative graph formulation to describe an m-stage HFS problem and solved the problem by a beam search procedure. Kumar et al. (2006) employed a combinatorial auction-based approach to a three-stage HFS problem with four parallel machines at each stage.

With respect to artificial intelligence methods, Atighehchian, Bijari, and Tarkesh (2009) combined ant colony optimization and nonlinear optimization methods to solve a three-stage HFS problem. Similarly, Pan, Wang, Mao, Zhao, and Zhang (2013) proposed an effective artificial bee colony algorithm for a three-stage HFS problem in the steelmaking process.

In recent decades, the LR approach has emerged as a practical approach for HFS scheduling. Different relaxations or decoupling strategies have been proposed to solve these scheduling problems. Tang et al. (2002) relaxed the machine capacity constraints of the HFS problem and used dynamic programming to solve the relaxed problem. Later, the same authors developed an operation-precedence constraints relaxation method for HFS to minimize the total weighted completion time Tang et al. (2006). Similarly, Xuan and Tang. (2007) proposed a batch decoupling approach for HFS with the objective of minimizing the completion time. Recently, Nishi et al. (2010) proposed an LR approach with cut generation to improve the Lagrangian bounds for the LR problem by relaxing machine capacity constraints. It is worth noting that all LD problems addressed in the aforementioned approaches were solved by the CSA.

To ensure continuity of the production process and just-in-time delivery of final products, this paper aims to minimize a cost function consisting of the following terms.
                              
                                 (1) Job waiting penalty between adjacent operations to reduce the temperature drop for molten steel as much as possible.

(2) Earliness/tardiness penalty to ensure that blooms or billets in each charge are delivered as punctually as possible.

The objective function is formulated as follows.

In the model formulated above, only machine capacity constraints (13) couple different types of variables or different jobs on the same machine; therefore, we consider relaxing the constraints (13) to decompose the LR problem into job-level subproblems or two tractable subproblems for each type of variable. There exist other relaxation strategies such as the relaxation of the operation precedence constraints. However, for the considered problem, after relaxing the operation precedence constraints, the subproblems of the corresponding LR problem are also NP-hard Tang et al. (2006). For example, if we relax the operation precedence constraints (5), the LR problem can be decomposed into

                         parallel machine scheduling problems, each for a different stage. The subproblem is to minimize total weighted completion time on parallel identical machines, which is NP-hard for

In general, the solution of dual problem is associated with an infeasible schedule because the relaxed constraints may not be satisfied. The following heuristic, which similar to list scheduling, is used to generate a feasible schedule from the solution of the relaxed problem.

The LR function is concave (or convex) and nondifferentiable; such functions are commonly solved by bundle methods or subgradient methods. The proximal bundle method, rather than the classical bundle method, is often used to solve address nondiffierentiable problems Markela (2002). However, a quadratic programming problem must be addressed per iteration. The computational effort required for the quadratic programming increases very rapidly as the problem size increases. Hence, the bundle method is not applicable in our problem.

As mentioned in the introduction, CSA yields guaranteed convergence to the optimum value if the optimal dual function value is known a priori (which is obviously not the case in our scheduling problem). To overcome this deficiency, Goffin and Kiwiel (1999) proposed SSLA with Brannlund’s level control strategy for estimating the optimum value Brannlund (1993). A more advanced level algorithm proposed by Brannlund, Kiwiel, and Lindberg (1995) is a branch of proximal bundle method, which has to solve a quadratic programming problem per iteration. To further enhance the efficiency of SSLA, this paper improves it by introducing three fine-adjusting strategies, collectively referred to as the improved subgradient level algorithm (ISLA).

As mentioned in Section 5.2.1, one can also use the time horizon method to replace the boundedness detection (Steps 1 and 8) in the algorithm. To further improve the efficiency of the algorithm, some modifications of the projection of the multipliers (Step 7) suggested by Wang (2003) can be made as follows.

To avoid running useless iterations, Step 5 detects the weak oscillation by recording the precious function values and changing

The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed by adjusting the estimation of the dual function value (

                        ). The adjustment is realized via the weak oscillation and strong oscillation detection methods. Weak oscillation detection is a fine adjustment which improves the efficiency, whereas strong oscillation is a rough adjustment guaranteeing convergence. The details of the analysis are provided in Section 5.5.

                              Lemma 1 can be easily proved using Prop. 6.3.1 in Bertsekas (1999).□

If ISLA adopts Step 7’ to update multipliers, Lemma 1 also holds.

The next result is a classical convergence result for the conventional subgradient method of Polyak (1967).

According to the presented proof and Lemma 2, we know that SSLA and ISLA are actually two different types of step-size subgradient methods. Numerical experiments (Section 6.2.2) demonstrate that ISLA performs much better than SSLA in addressing SCC scheduling problems.

To analyze the performance of the presented algorithm in solving the SCC scheduling problem, our computational study compares three types of algorithms. For simplicity, we denote the SSLA adopting standard subgradient (Step 7 in Section 5.4) as S, the ISLA adopting standard subgradient as I, the CSA adopting standard subgradient as C, the boundedness detection method (in Section 5.2.1) as B, the time horizon method as H, and the improved projection method (Step 7’ in Section 5.4) as P,
                           
                              CB: the algorithm C adopting method B;

CBP: the algorithm C adopting methods B and P;

The abbreviations IB, IBP, IH and IHP have similar meanings. The parameters of three types of algorithms (CSAs, ISLAs and SSLAs) are set as follows.

For ISLAs (IB, IBP, IH and IHP), the parameters are set as follows:

We consider nine combinations of the stage and machine levels (Stages vs. Machines): 3 vs. 3, 3 vs. 4, 3 vs. 5, …, 5 vs. 5. There are 4×7=28 pairs of the batch and job levels in each combination of the stage and machine levels. For each pair of the batch and job levels in the aforementioned combination configurations, we randomly generate 10 instances, resulting in a total of 3×3×4×7×10=2520 test instances. For simplicity, we denote Stages as S, Machines as M, Batches as B and Jobs as J.


                           Tables 1 and 2
                           
                            present the results of applying the ISLAs and SSLAs to some SCC scheduling problems. In order to analyze the effects of the weak oscillation detection (Step 5) and h(s) on the ISLAs, the two tables also provide the results of ISLAs without Step 5, which are denoted as ISLA0s (IB0, IBP0, IH0 and IHP0). Table 1 shows that the running times of SSLAs for small-scale problems are large. The shortest average running time of SSLAs is 1138.2 s, while the longest average running time of ISLAs is only 1.3 s. Through careful examination, we find that most of the computational time of ISLAs is spent on accumulating tiny paths

                            (Step 6) during late iterations. On the other hand, Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that ISLAs perform substantially better than SSLAs; IHP in particular performs best. Furthermore, although the only difference between ISLA0s and SSLAs is h(s), ISLA0s performs much better than SSLAs. This implies that h(s) has a significant impact on the efficiency. Similarly, the comparisons between ISLAs and ISLA0s show that Step 5 improves the efficiency of ISLAs significantly. These results suggest that the efficiency can be improved dramatically by introducing the three fine-adjusting strategies in Section 5.4.

Before providing the statistical results of all instances, it is worth noting that the gaps of some algorithms for some instances are larger than 100
                              
                                 %
                              
                           . We call these algorithms failure algorithms. The five instances and corresponding failure algorithms are presented in Table 3
                           .

After careful examination, we find that the reasons for failure of different algorithms are different. For the CH, the optimal dual value may be obtained at boundaries and it is every large in iterations. The maximum iteration number 500 is not large enough to obtain a good value. For the algorithms adopting method B, when the dual function value is unbounded, the Lagrangian multipliers will be decreased until the dual function is bounded. Hence, sometimes, the Lagrangian multipliers may be very small and even close to zero. In particular, CB and CBP will fall into a local area in iterations when the Lagrangian multipliers are too small, whereas LB and IBP will be terminated early when the descent range

                            is less than the given threshold. Indeed, if L adopts method B, it will not guarantee Assumption 1, which is the precondition for convergence. However, it is remarkable that IH and IHP solve all instances successfully.

To compare the successful results, all of the following statistical results exclude the results obtained for all algorithms for the five instances in Table 3. Because the full details of the test results are quite substantial, we summarize these data in more compact tables and statistic results. Table 4
                            presents the average duality gaps, and Table 5
                            presents the average lower bounds. Table 4 shows that the average duality gaps generated by all of the algorithms are less than 6.87
                              
                                 %
                              
                           . The duality gaps of the four ISLAs are smaller than those of the four CSAs. Moreover, the gaps of the four ISLAs are less than 6.82
                              
                                 %
                              
                           , whereas those of the four CSAs are greater than 6.68
                              
                                 %
                              
                           . The gaps of CB (CBP) are slightly better than those of CH (CHP), whereas those of IB (IBP) are nearly the same as those of IH (IHP). A more careful examination of the experimental data shows that IHP yields better results than the four CSAs in 241 out of 247 instances. Similar results can also be found in Table 5. The lower bounds of the four ISLAs are larger than those of the four CSAs; in particular, the lower bounds of IBP and IHP are the largest.


                           Table 6
                            presents the average running time of the eight algorithms in different combinations of the stage and machine. Fig. 2
                            shows the average running time of the eight algorithms for various problem sizes (problem size=S×M×B×J). Pronounced difference among the eight algorithms can be observed. IHP and IBP are far superior to the four CSAs. Table 6 and Fig. 2 demonstrate that the average running times of IHP is the least. In addition, Fig. 2 shows that the improved projection of multipliers method (Step 7’) plays an important role in reducing the running time of ISLA. The running time of IH fluctuates greatly as problem size increases, whereas IHP increases smoothly and slowly with problem scale.

In summary, the algorithm IHP performs much better than the other seven algorithms in terms of robustness, duality gap and running time.

In this experiment, we considered a representative combination of the stage and machine level (i.e., S vs. M=3 vs. 3). We solved the instances using the standard MILP software (CPLEX 12.4) with the default settings and the following termination criterion: relative MIP gap tolerance: 0.01; optimizer time limit: 300 s.

As in the LR approach, we can obtain the lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) of the CPLEX solver. Table 7
                            presents the computational results of IHP and CPLEX. The table shows that the gaps of CPLEX MIP solver are less than 2
                              
                                 %
                              
                            when the problem size is less than 24 (M×B×J⩽24), wheras the gaps are larger than 10
                              
                                 %
                              
                            when the problem size is greater than 60 (M×B×J⩾60). Table 7 also shows that the differences in the lower bounds between two methods are small, wheras the best feasible solutions of IHP are clearly superior to those of CPLEX when the problem size is greater than 75. These results indicate that the relative gaps of IHP are clearly smaller than those of CPLEX when the problem size is more than 75. In addition, as shown in Table 7, the average running time of IHP is 1.6 s, while the average running time of CPLEX is 307.3 s.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper proposed a novel LR approach to a HFS scheduling problem arising from the SCC process. The LD problem was solved by an improved subgradient level algorithm, which guarantees convergence without requiring the optimal dual value in advance. Furthermore, three fine-adjusting strategies were introduced to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Other approaches based on subgradient algorithms, including CSAs and SSLAs, were also proposed to solve the dual problem. We also addressed the unboundedness problem of Lagrangian relaxation. Comparisons among all algorithms demonstrated that the algorithm IHP is the most promising one in terms of robustness, duality gap and running time. In particular, the running time of IHP is far shorter than that of other algorithms for large-scale problems. Moreover, the comparisons between IHP and the CPLEX (12.4) MIP solver demonstrated that IHP is notably effective and efficient. Further research will be focused on the development and application of the proposed approaches and other similar approaches, such as cutting plane methods.
