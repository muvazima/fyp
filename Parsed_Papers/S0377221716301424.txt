                  Market share of buyers and the influence of supply chain structure on the choice of supply contracts have received scant attention in the literature. This paper focuses on this gap and examines a network consisting of one supplier and two buyers under complete and partial decentralization. In the completely decentralized setting both buyers are independent of the supplier. In the partially decentralized setting the supplier and one of the buyers form a vertically integrated entity. Both buyers order from the single supplier and produce similar products to sell in the same market. The supplier charges the buyer through a contract. We investigate the influence of supply chain structure, market-share and asymmetry of information on supplier's choice of contracts. We demonstrate that both linear two-part tariff and quantity discount contract can coordinate the supply chain irrespective of the supply chain structure. By comparing profit levels of supply chain agents across different supply chain structures, we show that if a buyer possesses a minimum threshold market potential, the supplier has an incentive to collude with her. We calculate the cut-off policies for wholesale price and two-part tariff contracts by incorporating the reservation profit level of individual agents. The managerial implications of the analyses and the directions of future research are presented in the conclusion.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many established global brands have in recent times sub-contracted their manufacturing to firms in emerging countries in order to reduce costs, and have focused on design and marketing activities. However, some of the firms that supply to these global brands are also established brands themselves. Often such suppliers and buyers compete in the same end-product market; Acer, the Taiwanese manufacturer of computers and out-sourcing partner of Dell, is one such example in the electronics industry.

                      We have recently observed similar phenomenon in the smart-phone market where Samsung, the provider of the application processor, has overtaken Apple to become the market leader.

                     In spite of having the first mover advantage, Apple has lost her market position to a competitor who is also the supplier of one of the main components of the phone.

                      There are analogous examples in the pharmaceutical and textiles industries. Almost identical situation arises when a monopolist supplier enters a new demographic market modifying an existing product to meet local requirements; she needs to find a local retailer for selling of the product (Corbett, Zhou, & Tang, 2004; Li & Gupta, 2011; Xu, Shi, Ma, & Lai, 2010). Also when one firm markets her product through a ‘firm-owned direct online channel as well through an independent traditional retail channel’, the second independent buyer views the supplier controlled first buyer as competition (Ryan, Sun, & Zhao, 2013).

These business scenarios raise a set of questions: when one supplier is supplying to her own subsidiary and another buyer with the same raw material or end product, then how can the system be designed for achieving supply-chain coordination? Is there a possible mechanism to either reduce or eliminate conflict between the separate channels? Similar set of questions also arises if the supplier enters into a collusive agreement with an independent buyer. A buyer with smaller market share would always be interested in entering into such agreement with the supplier to improve her profit level; but can such an arrangement provide the supplier with any advantage?

In this paper we attempt to answer all these questions by investigating competition between a vertically integrated firm and another firm with similar end products targeting the same market. Specifically we examine single supplier multiple buyers supply chain structure under (i) completely and partially decentralized setting, and (ii) information symmetry and asymmetry, in order to understand how the supply chain structure and the existing market share influence the design of contracts. We discuss four contract types, namely wholesale price (WP), quantity-discount (QD), linear two-part tariff (LTT), and nonlinear two-part tariff (NTT) contracts from the supplier's perspective. We compare between channel coordinating QD and LTT contracts. We find that under channel coordinating condition the supplier can either collude with an independent buyer or get into an arrangement with her sister division firm to create a win-win situation for both the firms such that they can improve their individual profit levels. In the context of WP and LTT contracts, we discuss the cut-off policies for different supply chain agents by incorporating their reservation profit levels. Finally, we numerically show how the supplier can design a preference matrix of contracts that enables her to choose contracts under different conditions of competition and market share of buyers.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the related literature. We describe the problem settings and formulation of quantity-discount, wholesale price, linear two-part tariff and nonlinear two-part tariff contract problems in Section 3. In Section 4, we develop the solution in terms of optimal pricing and quantity decisions under the condition of symmetric and asymmetric information for completely decentralized and partially integrated supply chains respectively. We discuss the influence of supply chain structure, market share, value of information and cut-off policies in Section 5. Finally conclusions and possible future research directions are incorporated in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Research developments in supply chain coordination through contracts aim at ‘establishing business partnership and improving supply chain profits’ (Chung, Talluri, & Narasimhan, 2010). Based on supply chain structure, supply chain coordination literature can be categorized as: one supplier–one buyer (1–1) (Cachon & Lariviere, 2005; Plambeck & Taylor, 2007; Taylor, 2002; Tsay & Lovejoy, 1999; Weng, 1995), one supplier–multiple buyer (1–N) (Bernstein & Federgruen, 2005; Cachon & Lariviere, 2005; Plambeck & Taylor, 2007; Weng, 1995), multiple supplier–one buyer (N–1) (Cachon & Kök, 2010; Minner, 2003), multiple supplier–multiple buyer (N–N) (Anderson & Bao, 2010; Zhao& Atkins, 2008). Cachon (2003) provides a review of all the coordinating contract mechanisms for 1–1 and 1–N supply chain structures under full information.

In the context of supply chain coordination, many studies have come out and indicated that wholesale price (Zhao, 2008), quantity discount (Cachon & Kök, 2010; Weng, 1995), and two-part tariff (Corbett et al., 2004; Zhang, Xiong, Xiong, & Yan, 2014) contracts are efficient coordinating mechanisms. Under deterministic demand scenario, wholesale pricing mechanisms coordinates a 1–N supply chain for limiting circumstances (Tsay & Agrawal, 2000). El Ouardighi and Kim (2010) have studied wholesale price contract in the presence of horizontal competition and full information. Corbett et al. (2004) have analyzed the wholesale price contract in a dyadic relationship by incorporating reservation profit level for supply chain agents and information asymmetry. Analysis of wholesale price contract in the presence of asymmetric information as well as horizontal competition is limited. Channel coordination can be obtained between one supplier and a group of homogeneous buyers through optimal quantity discount policy and franchise fee. However, the same fails to attain joint profit maximization (Weng, 1995). Corbett and De Groote (2000) have analyzed the quantity discount contract in a dyadic relationship between supplier and buyer under asymmetric information and derive the optimal discount scheme. Competition between buyers is not considered in their work. Cachon and Kök (2010) discuss quantity discount contract in the presence of horizontal competition and full information availability. However, none of the aforementioned work analyses either wholesale price or quantity discount contract for a partially decentralized supply chain.

Two-part contracts provide us with the first-best optimal solution that can overcome the problem of double marginalization in bilateral monopoly with full information (Tirole, 1988). How two-part tariff type contracts help in coordinating a supply chain has been studied by Jeuland and Shugan (1983). Weng (1995), has extended their work in terms of determining optimal pricing policies that can coordinate the channel's activities. Corbett et al. (2004) have shown that by employing two-part tariff contract the supplier can not only coordinate the supply chain but also extract the entire profit from the buyer in presence of full information. They also show a non-linear two-part tariff helps in designing a menu of contract such that the buyer reveals her cost structure in the case of asymmetric information. However, their study is limited by the dyadic relationship. Xie, Jiang, Zhao, and Shao (2014) have analyzed two-part tariff contracts in the context of a product service system and Zhang et al. (2014) have analyzed linear and nonlinear two-part tariff contracts in the context of closed loop supply chain. The analysis of two-part tariff contracts in the presence of horizontal competition has got little or no attention.

Market share or the underlying market potential of the buyer and the influence of various supply chain structures on the choice of optimal contracts have received scant attention. Most of the single supplier multiple retailer supply chain literature focuses on the question of whether it is beneficial for a supplier to add a direct online channel (Bernstein & Federgruen, 2005; Cachon & Lariviere, 2005; Plambeck & Taylor, 2007; Zhao & Atkins, 2008). In real life, we often observe apparel industry selling the same product through own franchise network as well as through other retail stores. The channel consisting of the supplier and the independent buyer faces the classic double marginalization problem. The supplier-owned buyer faces horizontal price competition with the independent one, similar to the case described by Tsay and Agarwal (2000). The supplier further faces vertical price competition with the second buyer. Ryan et al. (2013) has looked into such aspects of supply chain coordination when manufacturer has chosen to take a dual-channel approach to distribute her product. However, they do not consider the case of asymmetric information between the supplier and the second buyer.

Since firms are increasingly adopting multiple channel approach for distribution, one supplier–multiple buyer supply chain structure has been studied extensively in recent times (Farahani, Rezapour, Drezner, & Fallah, 2014; Rezapour, 2010). In the presence of horizontal competition among buyers, market share plays an important role in the optimal pricing and quantity decisions (Coughlan, 1985; Ingene & Pappy, 2004). Anderson and Bao (2010) have explored the effect of horizontal price competition and market share on decentralized supply chain. Their work does not throw any insight into how the aspect of market share influences optimal contract decisions. The literature on the effect of market share and the change of supply chain structure in the presence of asymmetric information is also limited.

In this paper, we analyze two general contract types, namely quantity discount and nonlinear two-part tariff, and their specific forms, namely wholesale price and linear two-part tariff contracts, in the setting of one supplier–two buyers supply chain structure. We particularly choose coordinating contract types for our investigation to check whether the coordinating ability of the contract forms are retained, as the supply chain structures changes. We consider two supply chain structures: (i) completely decentralized and (ii) partially decentralized, and carry out the analysis for both full and asymmetric information. We compare our results with those of an integrated supply chain to comment on whether it is beneficial for a supplier to collude with a buyer with lower market share. From the analytically obtained results we discuss the effect of supply chain structure, market share and information asymmetry on various contract types.

We consider a supply chain network consisting of a single supplier and two buyers. The buyers procure a common raw material or component or semi-finished goods from the supplier and subsequently each of them produce one finished product. These products are partially substitutable and the buyers sell them in a common final market. The supply chain network can be either completely centralized or completely decentralized or partially decentralized. In partially decentralized setup, one buyer and the supplier form a vertically integrated entity and the other buyer is independent.

We assume that the overall potential market size of the products is constant and the buyers do not have technology advantage. The marginal production cost c is assumed to be constant for both the buyers, and it excludes the cost of supplier's part. The quantity qi
                      demanded per period in the final market from the ith buyer is a function of retail prices pi

The buyer selects either the order quantity qi
                      or the price pi
                      at which she intends to sell in the market and the other is then immediately determined. The supplier's variable cost is given by s. In a general setting, the supplier does not know the buyer's marginal production cost c but has a prior knowledge about the cost in the following way: (i) the marginal production cost c lies between a finite interval [c
                     min , c
                     max ], where 0 ≤ c
                     min  ≤ c
                     max  < ∞; (ii) the probability density function of c is given by f(c) and the corresponding cumulative distribution function is given by F(c). We further assume that all parameters except c are common knowledge.

The supplier either knows the value of c or the distribution F(c). She subsequently offers either of the four contract types: wholesale price contract, linear two-part tariff contract, nonlinear two-part tariff contract, and quantity discount contract. Quantity discount and nonlinear two-part tariff are distinctive contract types; wholesale price and linear two-part tariff contracts stem from them respectively as special cases. The buyer i then chooses an order quantity qi
                      depending upon her profit optimality condition and pays the supplier according to the relevant transfer payment function T( · ). The four types of contract that we study under full and asymmetric information for completely and partially decentralized supply structure lead to sixteen cases. All the cases are described in Table 1.

In linear two-part tariff contract, the supplier extracts per-unit price w as well as a per-period fixed fee Li
                      from buyer i; but w and Li
                      are independent of the order quantity qi
                     . In nonlinear two-part contract {w(qi
                     ), Li
                     (qi
                     )}, the per-unit price and fixed fee are both functions of the order quantity qi
                     . Transfer payment of two-part tariff contract is given by:

                      such that it maximizes her profit. Individual rationality is represented by the inequality part of condition (4). The buyers’ optimization problem and supplier's optimal contract calculations are discussed in the following section.

In this section we present the optimal ordering quantity and pricing decisions of individual buyers under different supply chain structures, as presented by cases DF, DA, PF and PA. We use these results to analyze the aforementioned four contract types from the supplier's perspective. In the subsequent section we compare between different contracts to highlight how the underlying market potential (ki
                     ), competition (γ), and supply chain structure influences the supplier's optimal decisions. For the purpose of expositional simplicity, we assume

                     . However, we complete the calculations with different δi
                      values and they are shown in the Appendix. The notations that we adopt for the paper are presented in Table 2
                     . The optimal price, order quantity and contract calculations are presented in the supplementary Appendix, which appears as an online companion of the paper.

The optimal order quantities and retail prices for a completely centralized supply chain structure provides the benchmark solution. In this section we briefly review the same. In this case the supplier and the buyers are vertically integrated and a central planner decides the optimal prices and order quantities for the entire chain. The central planner's problem is as follows:

From (6) we can observe that, both the retail price and order quantity are increasing in their underlying market potential (ki
                        ). The benchmark order quantity is independent of the cross-price sensitivity (γ). In other words the level of competition between the products does not impact the order quantities in the centralized case. Both

                        . We can observe here that the minimum profit level is independent of the cross-price sensitivity (γ). Therefore competition between the substitutable products does not influence the minimum profit that the centralized supply chain can make.

In the case DF, the supplier offers identical per-unit price w and an exogenously decided discount policy v to both the buyers while offering quantity discount contract. Both the buyers try to optimize their corresponding profit function

In linear two-part contract, the side payment Li
                         is independent of qi
                        . Thus, it does not affect the ith buyer's optimal order quantity. Therefore contract design will take

                         as optimal decisions of each buyer in the case DA.

In the case DF, we can further observe here that linear and nonlinear two-part tariff contracts are equivalent in nature as all information is common knowledge. The optimal order quantities, retail prices, and supply contracts corresponding to quantity discount, wholesale price, and linear two-part tariff contracts for completely decentralized supply chain (Cases DF and DA) are presented in Table 1 of Appendix.

When information asymmetry exists, with nonlinear two-part tariff contract the supplier offers a menu of contracts {w(qi
                        ), Li
                        (qi
                        )} to every buyer. As qi
                         is a function of c, therefore the menu can be represented as {w(c), Li
                        (c)}. We can observe here that, as both the buyers have identical cost structure therefore per unit price w(c) is identical for both of them. However the franchise fee Li
                        (c) is different for different buyers as their reservation profit levels are different. As ith buyer reveals her choice of order quantity qi
                        , according to revelation principle (Baron & Myerson, 1982) there exists an optimal contract under which the supplier can infer buyer's true cost c. The optimal contract for completely decentralized supply chain under information asymmetry is given by Proposition 1.

                         as γ → 0. This behavior of per unit price corresponds to the one that we can observe in a dyadic supply chain structure comprising of one supplier and one buyer.

In the partially decentralized supply chain structure (Cases PF and PA), the supplier and buyer 1 form a ‘loosely coupled’ vertically integrated entity and buyer 2 operates independently, though she relies on the same supplier for her raw material. This structural change in the supply chain would influence the optimal contract offered to buyer 2. In order to exploit the advantages of integration the supplier transfers the optimal order quantity q
                        1 to buyer 1 at her marginal production cost s and charges a fixed fee of 
                           
                              
                                 π
                                 ¯
                              
                              
                                 S
                                 −
                                 B
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . This additional fee can be viewed as the minimum reservation profit that the supplier intended to make from her transaction with an independent buyer. The supplier charges buyer 2 through any of the aforementioned four contracts. In this new game, the supplier sets the transfer payment terms so that she maximizes her profit from buyer 2, as her profit component from buyer 1 is fixed. Due to structural change of the supply chain, the optimal order quantity for both the buyers differs in this case as we will subsequently see in Table A2 of Appendix.

                         are used for the purpose of linear two-part tariff analysis under the setting of full and asymmetric information (Cases PF and PA). Expressions of the optimal order quantities, retail prices, and supply contracts for quantity discount, wholesale price, and linear two-part tariff contracts are presented in Table A2 of Appendix.

Like the case of DF, we can further observe here that linear and nonlinear two-part tariff contracts are equivalent in nature in the case of PF as well, since all information is common knowledge. In the case of PA, with nonlinear two-part tariff contract the supplier offers a menu of contracts {w(q
                        2), L(q
                        2)} to buyer 2. Using revelation principle we can calculate an optimal contract for the supplier where she is able to infer the buyer's true cost c and it is presented below in Proposition 2.

This section discusses implications of the results derived in the previous section. We have analyzed two main contract types and their special cases. The equilibrium prices, order quantities, and contract forms for cases DF, DA, PF and PA are compared. The comparison of results helps us to understand how the supply chain structure, cross-price sensitivity, and market potential affect various supply chain parameters. To facilitate the discussion we also present a numerical analysis at the end of the section.

In this section is organized as follows. We first discuss how supply chain structure, underlying market potential, and cross-price sensitivity influence different contract types. We also indicate the insights that practitioners can draw from these findings. We propose a two-part tariff mechanism to coordinate the supply chain across different structures. We analytically establish how the underlying market potential of a buyer plays an influencing role in the optimal contract design. Subsequently we discuss the importance of cut-off policies in the context of wholesale price contract. In the end, with the help of a numerical example we investigate how the profit levels of individual entities get affected as the supply chain structure changes. We also propose a preference matrix of contracts from the perspective of the supplier.

In this section we compare the optimal values of per unit prices, and supplier's per unit margins for different contract types under various cases.

In the case of completely decentralized supply chain, the supplier's optimal contact form is not influenced by the underlying market potential (ki
                        ) of individual buyers. Though the optimal retail price and order quantity of individual buyer is dependent on her market potential, it does not influence the supplier's choice of optimal per unit price irrespective of the chosen contract form (QD, WP, LTT and NTT). Except the wholesale price contract, all the other contracts are influenced by the level of competition between the buyers, as captured by the cross-price sensitivity (γ). All the optimal per unit prices are increasing in c and decreasing in s.

In the case of partially decentralized supply chain, the supplier's chooses her optimal contact form to maximize her profit from the transaction with buyer 2. Therefore we can intuitively understand that, the supplier's optimal contract choice would be influenced by the underlying market potential of the second buyer (k
                        2). Behavior of per unit prices against the cost parameters c and s are identical to those observed in the cases of DF and DA. In PF and PA, the optimal wholesale prices (

The supplier's per unit margins are decreasing in her own marginal cost (s), buyer's marginal cost or expected marginal cost (c or E(c)), and increasing in the overall market potential (θ). In the case of LTT contract, we can observe that the supplier retains a margin in the case of full information availability. The supplier's margin in case of LTT contract is a fraction of her margin in the case of WP contract and it is increasing in the cross-price sensitivity parameter. This result is different than what is observed in the case of a dyadic supply chain structure. In dyadic supply chain structure, the supplier sells the product to the buyer at her own marginal cost and extracts the complete from the buyers through the franchise fee component (Corbett et al., 2004). Therefore in the dyadic supply chain, the supplier's profit margin is zero. However from Proposition 5 it is clear that, when the supplier sells to multiple downstream buyers, she keeps a margin with LTT contract form as well. In the case of asymmetric information, the supplier's margin is dependent on the difference between the maximum marginal cost and the estimated marginal cost of the buyer.

From Proposition 6 we can observe that, with full information availability, LTT contract can coordinate the supply chain for both Cases DF and PF. In asymmetric information case, with LTT contract supplier can coordinate the entire chain if and only if the buyer truthfully reveals her private information about marginal cost. In the next sub-section, we are going to look into channel coordinating contracts in detail.

With low substitution effect, the supplier can use identical NTT contracts irrespective of the supply chain structure. We can also observe that for Cases PF and PA, the optimal LTT and NTT contract form does not depend on the market potential of the second buyer.

In the case of WP contract, if buyer 2 has more than 50 percent underlying market potential, that is

                        . Thus in the case of WP contract, buyer 2 gets adversely affected by the change of supply chain structure as she is the larger customer. This result is counter-intuitive in nature. The expression for difference in wholesale price due to structural change holds for the case of asymmetric information as well. A buyer with larger market share can be adversely affected if the supplier acquires the smaller buyer, or gets into a collusive arrangement. Therefore, we can conclude that when one supplier is supplying to her own subsidiary and another buyer with the same raw material or end product, then the vertical competition works in favor of the subsidiary and against the independent buyer.


                        Propositions 3–6 present the behavioral pattern of the optimal per unit prices for all four types of contracts (QD, WP, LTT, and NTT) for the four cases (DF, DA, PF, and PA). From Table A1 and A2 we can further observe that the optimal price and order quantity decisions for each case are dependent on the respective optimal per unit prices. Through Table 3
                         below we summarize the nature of the optimal per unit prices in terms of different cases as presented in Table 1, for the purpose of better readability.

                        . As a result the calculated channel coordinating QD contract is not implementable. We can further note here, as the design of QD contract does not explicitly incorporate the reservation profit level for the buyers, thus the channel coordinating contract results in zero profit for the buyers and the supplier accumulates the entire channel profit.

Next, we look in details at the profit sharing among the supply chain agents in the case of LTT contract, as LTT contract design incorporates the reservation profit level of all the supply chain agents. In case DF, the profits of the buyers and the supplier are as follows:

This result provides us with two interesting perspectives. Firstly, it shows that not only a buyer with less market potential has an incentive to collude, but also the supplier has an incentive to collude with such a buyer as well. Secondly, the collusion would be beneficial for both the supplier as well as the buyer only if the buyer possesses a minimum threshold market potential. An independent buyer with larger market share (e.g. Apple) may possess more or comparable negotiating power to that of the supplier (e.g. Samsung), therefore the supplier can enter into a collusive agreement with another smaller buyer to compete in the same final demand market, provided the smaller buyer has the aforementioned minimum market potential. Such a scenario presents both the supplier and the smaller buyer with an opportunity to increase their individual profit levels.

In this section we look at WP contracts in detail. Though WP contract cannot coordinate the supply chain, it enjoys huge popularity across industries for its easy implement-ability. Here we analyze WP contract by incorporating reservation profit level of the supply chain agents in the following way: the individual rationality constraint of the expected profit maximization problem that we have adopted for analysis is that, a supply chain agent agrees to contract terms if and only if she can make profit more than or equal to a stipulated reservation profit level. From the optimal contract structure we can infer that the supplier's profit is always decreasing in buyer's cost c. In this context it is possible to design cut-off policies for buyers as well as the supplier; a cut-off policy denotes the condition(s) where any one of the players (supplier or buyer) will refuse to trade. This policy refers the to the maximum marginal cost of a supply chain agent (supplier or buyer) up to which one agent is willing to participate in a contractual agreement with the other. Beyond this particular value of marginal cost one agent would not agree to get into contract terms with the other, as she would make less profit than her reservation profit level. This concept of cut-off policy is adopted from Corbett et al. (2004).

The cut-off cost point can be understood from the following argument. A cut-off cost point (α) divides the buyer's cost structure [c
                        min , c
                        max ] into two components: (i) [c
                        min , α] the range in which the agent (supplier or buyer) is willing to enter into a contract term, as her profit level is more than or equal to her reservation profit level, and (ii) (α, c
                        max ] the range in which she is not willing to enter into a contract term, as her profit level is less than her reservation profit level. Similarly the cut-off cost point for supplier (β) can also be designed on buyer's cost range.

In this section, we analytically show that the supplier cannot offer a WP contract term that covers the entire cost range of the buyer(s). We discuss the cut-off policies for WP contract under full and asymmetric information for cases DF, DA, PF and PA. All the supplier's cut-off points are presented in Table 4
                        
                        . The calculation pertaining to Table 4 is presented in the supplementary Appendix.

From Table 4 we can observe that the supplier's cut-off points follow certain common properties. They are discussed in Proposition 8.

Here the interesting observation is that the supplier's cut-off levels are dependent on the buyers’ cost component (c) and independent of her own cost structure (s). We can also see from Table 4 that the supplier's cut-off points are dependent not only on the reservation profit level but also on the intensity of competition, as captured by the cross-price sensitivity (γ). In order to complete the discussion on cut-off policies, we further calculate the buyer's cut-off points. For the purpose of expositional simplicity, we calculate the buyer's cut-off points for full information cases only. They are as follows: in case DF, the ith buyer's cut-off point is:

                        . Thus any supply chain agent can identify the exact cost point till which she or an individual buyer would be willing to enter into a wholesale price contract. Wholesale price contract can address the issue of horizontal competition only when the supplier and both the buyers operate within their respective cut-off limits, as individual cut-off limits ensure the individual reservation profit level.

The argument of cut-off policy holds for channel coordinating LTT contracts as well. In the case of LTT contracts, we can note that as the contract design allows the buyer(s) to extract only their reservation profits; therefore they are indifferent to their own cut-off levels. On the other hand the supplier has an interest to calculate her own cut-off levels in order to ensure her own incentive compatibility.

This discussion helps us understand how the incentive compatibility constraints for WP and LTT contracts are linked with the reservation profit level of individual supply chain agents, underlying market potential, supplier's marginal cost, and the effect of competition. We also show how an agent can verify whether an offered contract is incentive compatible or not.

We explore the effect of supply chain structure and market share on the profit level of individual players and overall supply chain. We set the following parameter values,

Under different contract types, we calculate individual profit levels of different supply chain agents as a function of competition intensity, represented by the cross-price sensitivity (γ) and the overall supply chain profit as a function of market share of buyer 1(k
                        1). Depending on the cross-price sensitivity and market share, a buyer may prefer one contract over another. Thus a preference matrix (Fig. 1) of contract choice can be designed from the perspective of a buyer. As shown in the figure, in the presence of an exogenous reservation profit level, the interaction between the cross-price sensitivity and market share of individual buyer determines whether a buyer prefers wholesale price contract to two-part tariff contract.

The numerical analysis establishes that, as the competition among the buyers increases, the profitability of the supplier also increases. In partially integrated chain, if the independent buyer captures the majority of the market share the overall supply chain profit decreases for wholesale price contract; the overall supply chain behaves inefficiently compared to its decentralized counterpart. These observations are consistent with the conclusion drawn by McGuire and Staelin (1983) that supplier is better off in a decentralized supply chain when products are highly substitutable.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have presented the choice of contract under different types of supply chain structure, market share of buyer and asymmetry of information. We have examined the problem from the perspective of the supplier and have analyzed the supply chain performance by measuring the total profit. Focusing on a single supplier two-buyer supply chain, we have shown two-part tariff contract can extract more profit from the buyers. We have further demonstrated how market share distributions among different buyers influence the optimal contract structure. We have compared among different contracts in terms of profit allocation. The results would help the managers in strategizing procurement policy under different supply chain structures.

A major contribution of this paper is that it provides simultaneously treatment of contracts with the reservation profit level of individual players, market share of buyers and the effect of competition. In the case of linear and nonlinear two-part tariff contract we have critically examined the influence of reservation profit level on the contract structures. For wholesale price contract, we have incorporated the concept of supplier reservation profit to design the cutoff policies for the supplier. We have further shown how market share influences the wholesale price as the supply chain structure shifts from a complete decentralization to a partially integrated one. This result indicates that a buyer with larger market share can be adversely affected if the supplier acquires the smaller buyer or gets into a collusive arrangement. Finally, throughout this paper we have assumed deterministic linear demand function. The same may be relaxed and the problem may be examined in a multi-period setting and probabilistic non-linear demand function.
