                  For an arbitrary degree Bézier curve 
                        B
                     , we first establish sufficient conditions for its control polygon to become homeomorphic to 
                        B
                      via subdivision. This is extended to show a subdivided control polygon that is ambient isotopic to 
                        B
                     . We provide closed-form formulas to compute the corresponding number of iterations for equivalence under homeomorphism and ambient isotopy. The development of these a priori values was motivated by application to high performance computing (HPC), where providing estimates of total run time is important for scheduling.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Preserving ambient isotopic equivalence between an initial geometric model and its approximation is of contemporary interest in geometric modeling (Amenta et al., 2003; Andersson et al., 1995, 2000; Miller, 2009; Moore et al., 2007), with the focus here being on Bézier curves.

A Bézier curve is characterized by an indexed set of points, which form a piecewise linear (PL) approximation of the curve, called a control polygon (Definition 2.1). We consider the special class of simple
                     
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        A curve is said to be simple if it is non-self-intersecting, exclusive of common end points of a closed curve and junction points in composite Bézier curves.
                      Bézier curves, because we are interested in knots.

                        A knot is a simple closed curve.
                     
                  

The motivation for this theory was the scaling of dynamic visualization to HPC applications. For models of complex molecules (Jordan et al., 2008), as found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), Bézier curve models of these molecular backbones could be of arbitrarily high degree, but the existing literature on relevant ambient isotopic approximation was limited to degree 3 (Moore et al., 2007). A formally proven guarantee that the graphics be ambient isotopic to the Bézier curve is essential. A simulation of molecular writhing is run on a high performance computing architecture, generating terabytes of floating point data. The output of all this data is the significant bottleneck. However, small portions of the data, covering seconds to minutes of the simulation can be offloaded within an acceptably minimal time lag to enable nearly synchronous dynamic visualization for informed decisions in computational steering. The appropriately high threshold here is that the dynamic visualization should not lead to inappropriate abortion of a simulation, based upon a misrepresentation of the isotopic type of the molecule.

There may be substantial topological differences between Bézier curves and their control polygons. It has long been known that Bézier curves and their control polygons are not necessarily homeomorphic. There are examples in the literature showing self-intersecting Bézier curves with simple control polygons or simple Bézier curves with self-intersecting control polygons (Li et al., 2012; Neagu et al., 2000; Piegl and Tiller, 1997). Bézier curves and their control polygons are not necessarily ambient isotopic. There is an example showing an unknotted Bézier curve with a knotted control polygon (Bisceglio et al., 2011; Moore, 2006). Examples of a knotted Bézier curve with an unknotted control polygon have also been given (Li et al., 2012; Sequin, 2009).

The de Casteljau algorithm (Farin, 1996) is a subdivision algorithm associated to Bézier curves which recursively generates control polygons more closely approximating the curve under Hausdorff distance (Munkres, 1999). It is known that the convergence of the subdivided control polygon to its Bézier curve is exponential under Hausdorff distance (Lane and Riesenfeld, 1980; Nairn et al., 1999). As a fundamental lemma, we show that the convergence of the exterior angles of the subdivided control polygon to 0 is also exponential for simple, regular,

                                 R
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        . Furthermore, we derive closed-form formulas to compute sufficient numbers of subdivision iterations to achieve homeomorphism and ambient isotopy, respectively.

A brief overview of the relevant computational science issues follows. Prior knowledge of the run time of any job is important to estimate HPC time allocation and the sufficient number of iterations presented here will permit computational scientists to produce reliable estimates. With often more than 100,000 processors available, there are many creative, ad hoc parallelization techniques to achieve acceptable performance for subdivision. The initial ambient isotopic approximation can be done on a static geometric model, before the simulation begins. The next crucial experimental question is, “As the spline perturbs, how long can the original PL approximation be perturbed to maintain ambient isotopic equivalence?” Recently published work (Cassidy et al., 2014) provides some initial insight. If these time periods are sufficient for the amount of data initially output, then the cycle would begin again, but this remains to be verified experimentally. The emphasis here is that the theory proven provides a strong foundation to pursue these experiments with confidence that subdivision will not become a time sink. As a contrast, in absence of this theory, the subdivision might be run recursively, with no prior knowledge of time to completion. The classical pipe surface was invoked as the boundary of a tubular neighborhood as an algorithmic constraint for a PL ambient isotopic approximation of a static spline curve (Maekawa et al., 1998). That static view has been extended so that many perturbations of the PL approximant within the pipe surface continue to maintain ambient isotopic equivalence (Jordan et al., 2008) and is applied here. Once the dynamic visualization begins, the containment of the PL graphics within a pipe surface of constant radius enables run time warning messages, as the geometry approaches the boundary of this tubular neighborhood, increasing the prospect for a significant topological change. This is far superior to prevailing animation techniques that concentrate on self-intersection analysis on a per frame basis, which are known to be error prone (Jordan et al., 2008; Lasseter, 1987).

The availability of hundreds of thousands of processors noted in the preceding paragraph is common today. The number of processors is rapidly growing to millions, so moving simulation data results will become an issue of increasing greater concern. Computational steering and in-situ visualization will become ever more important. The theoretical results presented here provide the foundation to ensure that the perturbed PL graphics faithfully represent the underlying molecular science. The resultant algorithms are expected to scale gracefully. In the absence of this theory, an inappropriate steering decision – based upon a flawed visual analysis, could lead to lost results. These flawed decisions are expensive, motivating this theory as the primary basis for properly informed decisions.

In order to avoid technical considerations and to simplify the exposition, the class of Bézier curves considered will be restricted to those where the first derivative never vanishes. 
                        Definition 2.2
                        A differentiable curve is said to be regular if its first derivative never vanishes.

The Bézier curve of Definition 2.1 is typically called a single segment Bézier curve, while a composite Bézier curve is created by joining a sequence of two or more single segment open Bézier curves at their common end points.

Throughout the paper, we use

                      condition was previously implicitly used in establishing a non-singular pipe surface (Maekawa et al., 1998) as the boundary of a tubular neighborhood. This dependency continues for other results which use this non-singular pipe. This non-singular pipe surface is merely a convenience to ease the exposition. There are many cases where the 
                        
                           
                              C

                      assumption will suffice for an alternative tubular neighborhood to replace that created with the indicated pipe surface as its boundary. Some creative alternatives could rely upon previous ‘snow cone’ constructions (Jordan et al., 2011), but this is left as a subject of future work. We note that our use of Fenchel's Theorem 4.1 in the proof of Lemma 6.2 relies only on the PL case.

Exponential convergence in Hausdorff distance of the subdivided control polygon to its Bézier curve under subdivision has previously been established (Lane and Riesenfeld, 1980; Nairn et al., 1999). The discrete derivatives of the control polygons were proven to converge exponentially to the derivatives of the Bézier curve by showing that discrete differentiation commutes with subdivision (Morin and Goldman, 2001). The convergence of the exterior angles of the subdivided control polygons to 0 has been widely assumed, both in the literature (Lasser, 1989) and informally, but we were unable to find any proof in the literature. We prove this angular convergence, using derivatives.

The existence of homeomorphic equivalence between a sufficiently fine subdivided control polygon and its Bézier curve was given (Neagu et al., 2000) by invoking the hodograph,
                        5
                     
                     
                        5
                        The derivative of a Bézier curve is also expressed as a Bézier curve, known as the hodograph (Farin, 1996).
                      but that proof provided no expression for the number of subdivision iterations. We provide a constructive geometric proof for specified numbers of subdivision iterations to produce a control polygon homeomorphic to a given Bézier curve. We then extend to a similar result for ambient isotopy.

The a priori determination of the number of iterations was motivated by experimental performance studies for dynamic visualization in molecular simulations, where the molecules are modeled as knots. Homeomorphic approximation of composite Bézier curves was established (Cho et al., 1996) by algorithmic techniques that do not directly rely upon the de Casteljau algorithm, but include techniques related to “significant points”. The self-intersection of curves and surfaces is fundamental within geometric modeling (Andersson et al., 1998; Patrikalakis and Maekawa, 2002). Preservation of topology was established when the control points of parametric patches are perturbed, by designating conditions under which perturbations yield no self-intersections of patches (Andersson et al., 2000).

Our techniques rely upon a tubular neighborhood for a Bézier curve, with the boundary of the tubular neighborhood being a non-singular pipe surface. Pipe surfaces have been studied since the 19th century (Monge, 1850), but the presentation here follows a contemporary source (Maekawa et al., 1998). These authors perform a thorough analysis and description of the end conditions of open spline curves. The junction points of a Bézier curve are merely a special case of that analysis.

Ambient isotopy is a stronger notion of equivalence than homeomorphism. An earlier algorithm (Jordan et al., 2011) establishes an isotopic approximation over a broad class of parametric geometry, without establishing the number of iterations needed. Other recent papers (Burr et al., 2012; Lin and Yap, 2011) present algorithms to compute isotopic PL approximation for 2D algebraic curves. Computational techniques for establishing isotopy and homotopy have been established regarding algorithms for point-clouds by “distance-like functions” (Chazal and Cohen-Steiner, 2005).

Ambient isotopy under subdivision was previously established (Moore et al., 2007) for 3D Bézier curves of low degree (less than 4), where a crucial unknotting condition was trivially established for these low degrees. The results presented here extend to Bézier curves of arbitrary degree, by a more refined analysis of avoiding knots locally within the PL approximation generated. The focus on higher degree versions was motivated by applications in molecular simulation.

It was proved that for homeomorphic curves, if their distance and angles between first derivatives are within given bounds, then these curves are ambient isotopic (Denne and Sullivan, 2008). We invoke this previous result.

Subdivision algorithms are fundamental for Bézier curves and a brief overview is given here. Fig. 1
                      shows the first step of the de Casteljau algorithm with an input value of 
                        
                           1
                           2
                        
                      on a single Bézier curve. For ease of exposition, the de Casteljau algorithm with this value of 
                        
                           1
                           2
                        
                      is assumed, but other fractional values can be used with appropriate minor modifications to the analyses presented. The initial control polygon P is used as input to generate local PL approximations, 
                        
                           
                              P
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              P
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , as Fig. 1(b) shows. They together form a new PL curve whose Hausdorff distance is closer to the curve than that of P (Farin, 1996).

A summary is that subdivision proceeds by selecting the midpoint of each edge of P and these midpoints are connected to create new edges, as Fig. 1(a) shows. Recursive creation and connection of midpoints continues until a single edge is created, which is, in fact, tangent to the Bézier curve (Farin, 1996). The union of the edges from the final step then forms a new PL curve. Termination is guaranteed since P has only finitely many edges.

For a single segment curve, after i iterations,

                        6
                        An iteration is a whole subdivision process that produces a new control polygon.
                      the subdivision process generates

                              i
                           
                        
                      PL sub-curves, each being a control polygon for part of the original curve (Farin, 1996), which is a sub-control polygon

                        Note that by the subdivision process, each sub-control polygon of a simple Bézier curve is open.

We present sufficient conditions for a homeomorphism between a subdivided control polygon and 
                        B
                     . We first establish a local homeomorphism between a sub-polygon and the corresponding sub-curve of 
                        B
                     , and then establish a global homeomorphism between the control polygon and 
                        B

Perform sufficiently many subdivisions so that the control polygon ending at w, denoted by P, and the control polygon beginning at w, denoted by Q, each has total curvature less than

                            (Theorem 5.1). Therefore, by Lemma 6.2 the only point where P or Q intersects Π is at w.  □

Ambient isotopy is an equivalence relation for knots. Knots can be modeled by simple closed Bézier curves. In this section, we consider a closed Bézier curve 
                        B
                     , and derive the ambient isotopy following Denne and Sullivan (2008, Proposition 3.1). We note that

                           , then sufficiently many subdivisions will yield a simple control polygon that is ambient isotopic to

In this section, we shall establish closed-form formulas to compute sufficient numbers of subdivisions for small exterior angles, homeomorphism and ambient isotopy respectively.

From the previous sections we know that the homeomorphism is obtained by subdivision based on two criteria:
                        
                           (1)
                           angular convergence; and

convergence in distance.

While Theorem 8.2 addresses each sub-polygon, it is of interest to ensure that the union of all these sub-polygons is also simple. In Theorem 8.3, that union is the ‘control polygon’, as the result of multiple subdivisions.

@&#FUTURE WORK@&#

The results here are restricted to uniform subdivision. Adaptive subdivision may well be appropriate and the methods presented here would form the basis for extension to adaptive methods, where different tubular neighborhoods would be considered. Similarly, as expressed in Section 2, more aggressive tubular neighborhoods may suffice for curves that are not

                     . It appears premature to pursue these enhancements for this application, as there will be additional local geometric information available indicating a likely impending topological change which may lead to more direct and efficient options to zoom into that area for a purely local analysis.

The question of tightness
                        13
                     
                     
                        13
                        This was constructively raised by one of the reviewers.
                      is one of significant theoretical and practical interest. These authors see that investigation as beyond the scope of the present work, particularly as they conjecture that proving rigorous tightness bounds could be difficult. Support for that conjecture is based upon the subtlety of published constructions regarding topological properties of knotted splines (Bisceglio et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Sequin, 2009).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We first proved the exterior angles of control polygons converge exponentially to zero under subdivision. We establish sufficient conditions for subdivision to produce a control polygon ambient isotopic to a Bézier curve, with a priori determination of a sufficient number of subdivision iterations. These results are being applied in computer animation, particularly for dynamic visualization of molecular simulations. The theorems given provide consistency and rigor to replace previously ad hoc animation techniques that were error prone by focusing only on one frame at a time. This examination is necessarily at a discrete point in time, whereas the analysis here is over the continuum of a time interval.

@&#ACKNOWLEDGEMENT@&#

We very much appreciate the helpful, constructive comments of multiple referees. One of the reports was particularly comprehensive, well beyond typical expectations, for which we express additional thanks. Early discussions with Jorg Peters regarding the convergence of exterior angles to 0 under subdivision, are also acknowledged, with appreciation.
