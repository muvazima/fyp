                  Plastic changes in the brain required for memory formation and long-term learning are dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling. Nefiracetam reportedly boosts NMDA receptor functions as a basis for its nootropic properties. Previous studies suggest that nefiracetam potentiates the NMDA receptor activation, as a more potent co-agonist for glycine binding site than glycine, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using BSP-SLIM method, a novel binding site within the core of spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 has been predicted in glycine-bound GLUN1 conformation in addition to the glycine pocket in Apo-GLUN1. Within the core of spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 pocket, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation revealed that nefiracetam disrupts Arg523-glycine-Asp732 interaction resulting in open GLUN1 conformation and ultimate diffusion of glycine out of the clamshell cleft. Open GLUN1 conformation coerces other intra-chain domains and proximal inter-chain domains to sample inactivate conformations resulting in closure of the transmembrane gate via a novel gauche trap on threonine 647 (chi-1 dihedral (χ
                     1)=−45° instead of +45°). Docking of nefiracetam into the glycine pocket reversed the gauche trap and meditates partial opening of the TMD gate within a time-scale of 100ns as observed in glycine-only state. All these results suggest that nefiracetam can favorably complete with glycine for GLUN1-LBD in a two-step process, first by binding to a novel site of GLUN1-LBD-NMDA receptor followed by disruption of glycine-binding dynamics then replacing glycine in the GLUN1-LBD cleft.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The biochemical interplay between the nervous tissues and nefiracetam has continued to receive considerable research attention. Some of the key findings include: inhibition of neuronal death modes via interference with cellular Ca2+ dynamics (Ueda et al., 2004; Fujita et al., 2002), analgesic actions through stimulation of (supra)-spinal nicotinic cholinergic system (Rashid and Ueda, 2002), and nootropic actions through direct interaction with dentate polysialylated neurons circuitry (Murphy et al., 2005). Indeed, nootropic action of nefiracetam has been most frequently studied, while the underlying mechanisms have been under intense debate. The notion that N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor may be one of the key cellular targets for nefiracetam nootropic actions was conceived from two observation: low NMDA receptor expression is a key feature in Alzheimer’s disease (Rison and Stanton, 1996; Newcomer et al., 2000) and that drugs such as glycine, d-cycloserine and milacemide have successfully been used in animals as memory enhancer (Hanndelmann et al., 1989) via NMDA receptor-mediated memory formation and long-term potentiation. Likewise, nefiracetam is now recognized as a nootropic agent acting partly as NMDA receptor ligand (Newcomer et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 2005). Indeed, Moriguchi et al. (2003) presented strong evidence in support of NMDA receptor-nefiracetam interaction via NMDA receptor-GLUN1-LBD (ligand-binding domain). First, 3μM glycine-mediated NMDA receptor current was abolished at 100nM nefiracetam (Moriguchi et al., 2003), but 10nM nefiracetam-induced NMDA receptor current was not reversible by high concentration of glycine. Similarly, 7-chlorokynurenic acid a known NMDA-receptor-GLUN1-LBD glycine-site antagonist abolished nefiracetam-induced current. The authors concluded that nefiracetam is a high-affinity NMDA-GLUN1-LBD agonist. From the study of Moriguchi et al. (2003) the mechanism of nefiracetam-induced glycine-LBD dissociation, and replacement is still unanswered.

Here, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, we have provided further insight into NMDA receptor-nefiracetam interacting. Our findings strongly support a multi-step NMDA receptor potentiation mechanism by nefiracetam; first, nefiracetam binds to spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 in glycine-bound state and weakens critical interaction network causing an opening of the closed clamshell LBD, resulting in diffusion of glycine out of the cleft, and paving a way for replacement by nefiracetam.

@&#METHODS@&#

The starting structures (PDB ID: PB7 (Furukawa et al., 2003), PDB ID: 1PBQ (Furukawa et al., 2003), PDB ID: 4KCC (Yao et al., 2013), and PDB ID: 2A5S (Vance et al., 2011)) required for docking were retrieved from the protein data bank repository. Prior to BSP-SLIM docking (Lee and Zhang, 2012), water and ligand coordinates were deleted. Full NMDA receptor (mouse) for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was rebuilt using Swiss-PdbViewer (Guex et al., 2009) software based on heterotetrameric NMDA receptor (GluN1a/GluN2B, PDB ID: 4PE5) template resolved at 3.96Å (Karakas et al., 2009). Prior to use in MD simulation, the model was subjected to fragment-guided molecular dynamics simulation (FGMD, http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/FG-MD/) (Zhang et al., 2011) to resolve atomic clashes and bad contacts. For MD simulation, the coordinates of the glycine and glutamate were added to the refined structure through superimposition of the initial structure template structure. The structure of nefiracetam was also added to GLUN1-LBD chain C (details of the complex is given in the results section). Due to ifenprodil co-crystallized with our template structure, we assumed that our starting structure represented allosterically inhibited state (Karakas et al., 2009).

Similar method for assembling NMDA receptor biosystem for successful molecular dynamics (MD) simulation previously published by Dai and Zhou (2013) was adapted for use in this study. Briefly, the biosystem (NMDA receptor, chain-A-Gly (GLUN1), chain-B-Glu (GLUN2B), chain-C-Gly-Nef (GLUN1) and chain-D-Glu (GLUN2B)) was inserted into a pre-equilibrated POPC bilayer model (208 lipids/leaflet) (Bennett and Tieleman, 2013) using editconf module inbuilt in GROMACS (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005). The receptor/POPC complex was inserted into a virtual box at 2.0nm from all sides of the wall using the editconf module (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005). The system was solvated in SPC water model (Dyer et al., 2009) using GROMACS genbox module and neutralized in Na+/Cl− at 0.15M concentration. Prior to minimization, cell plugin in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4) was used to visualize the system . Atomic interactions within the biosystem were treated using the GROMOS96 forcefield (Schuler et al., 2001).

A 20ns equilibration simulation was conducted on the biosystem with positional restraints on the receptor backbone atoms and the ligands with a force constant 20kcalmol−1
                        Å−2 as previously described (Dai and Zhou, 2013). Thereafter, a 30ns unrestrained simulation was performed to harvest structures sampling the closed-state ligand-binding domain (LBD) conformation as interpreted by low root-mean square deviation from PDB IDs: 1PB7, 2A5S (Furukawa et al., 2003; Vance et al., 2011 
                        Vance et al., 2011) representing GLUN1 and GLUN2 sites respectively. Two seed conformations harvested following the unrestrained simulation (representing the agonist-bound closed state LBD conformation) were subjected to the final equilibration simulation (50ns) with a force constant 20kcalmol−1
                        Å−2. Finally, the well-equilibrated systems were subjected to 250ns production simulation using GROMACS mdrun module at constant NPT; pressure was maintained at 1.0atm (Parrinello and Rahman, 1981), while 310K temperature was maintained using Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984). Equation of atomic motions were integrated using the leapfrog method (Skeel, 1993) at 2fs timestep. Electrostatic interactions were numerically estimated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm (Darden et al., 1999) while non-bonded interactions was treated using Lennard-Jones approximations (Jones, 1924).

All data represent the mean of the two production phase simulations (except the simulations on the structure retrieved at 90ns of production phase, and subjected to two variants of simulation. The plots from these simulations represent values from single runs; see results for details) The root mean square deviation of structural conformations sampled by the biosystem along the trajectories from the starting structure or other structures (see results) were calculated based on Eq. (1) below using the g_rms module in GROMACS (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005).

In this analysis, the three energetic terms (change in potential energy (bond, angle, torsion, van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies) under vacuum condition, desolvation energy (implicit solvation model with non-polar and polar solvation components), and configurational energy terms) stated in Eq. (5) above were computed on each of the 250 snapshot duplicate saved at 1ns time interval during the atomistic simulation. Detailed equations for this module and its implementation protocol in GROMACS has been reported elsewhere Kumari et al. (2014).

Although, NMDA receptor has been generally accepted as one of the key targets in nefiracetam-induced long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (Aihara et al., 2001; Moriguchi et al., 2003, 2007), the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. Data from 7-chlorokynurenic acid indicated GLUN1-glycine site might be a plausible site of action (Moriguchi et al., 2003). Based on this lead, GLUN1 co-crystallized with glycine (PDB ID: 1PB7) (Furukawa et al., 2003), co-crystallized with 5,7-chlorokynurenic acid (DCKA, PDB ID: 1PBQ) resolved at 1.90Å (Furukawa et al., 2003) and ligand free state (PDB ID: 4KCC) (Yao et al., 2013) were prepared for BSP-SLIM docking with nefiracetam to identify the most probable nefiracetam-binding region of GLUN1 since the three structures capture the predominant physiological conformations of GLUN1. More importantly, we sought to examine nefiracetam interaction in a physiological condition, which favors glycine-occupancy of GLUN1-LBD, justifiably, glycine concentration in the brain is 600-fold higher (Choi et al., 2011) than the lower limit of nefiracetam concentration (1nM) required for NMDA receptor interaction. With such condition in place, equilibrium may favor glycine, and glycine traps GLUN1-subunit of NMDA receptor into a closed conformation (Furukawa et al., 2003), inaccessible to nefiracetam.

Serendipitously, when output structures of BSP-SLIM were aligned with PDB ID: 1PBQ (open structure), all output structures (5 in 5 output, 100%) generated by BSP-SLIM method showed that nefiracetam (yellow stick) docks slightly below DCKA (Fig. 1
                        A, green stick) site. When the glycine-bound structure is aligned with these outputs, this site also overlaps with glycine-binding site (red sphere) (Fig. 1A); DCKA is glycine-site inhibitor (Kemp et al., 1988).

In glycine bound GLUN1 structure, nefiracetam exclusively (100%) docks at the spiral β-strands-1-5 of GLUN1 (Fig. 1B and C). This finding provides indications that in a closed state, nefiracetam may find the GLUN1-LBD inaccessible which then justifies an intensive investigation of the like structural and dynamics mechanism for glycine replacement.

In apo-GLUN1 (Murphy et al., 2005), the occupancy observed is 40% (2 out of 5 structures) glycine-site and 60% ((3 out of 5 structures)) spiral β-strands-1-5 of GLUN1-LBD site. This data therefore confirmed that the two predominant sites for nefiracetam binding are the glycine-site and the spiral β-strands-1-5 of GLUN1.

The applicability of BSP-SLIM to identify the binding site of a ligand within a protein has been robustly tested (Lee and Zhang, 2012), here, further validation was performed using several protein-ligand complexes from the protein data bank repository. The ligands coordinates were removed and blind-docked into the protein coordinate using the BSP-SLIM method. Indeed, the first three output complexes from BSP-SLIM have root mean square deviation (rmsd) <0.4nm from the crystal structures (Supplementary Fig. 1A, i–iv, DCKA, cyloserine, glutamate and cyclo-leucine, yellow stick represents BSP-SLIM output, green stick represents the crystal structure). Indicating the suitability of the method for the purpose of predicting putative nefiracetam-site on GLUN1-LBD.

For the purpose of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we assumed that under physiological conditions, glycine occupies glycine-site, prior to nefiracetam treatment. Therefore, in this study, glutamate was docked to GLUN2-LBD (chains B, D), only glycine was docked into GLUN1-LBD chain-A subunit while glycine and nefiracetam were docked into GLUN1-LBD chain-C. Nefiracetam was docked into the β-strands-1-5 position (yellow stick Fig. 1B(i)), relative to glycine (red stick, annotated) bound to glycine-binding site, β-strands-1-5 position is shown (magenta Fig. 1B(ii)). NMDA receptor-bound to the five ligands (green cartoon) is displayed (Fig. 1C).

Glycine binds into a cleft located between two lobes (clamshell, referred to here as D1 and D2 representing lobe1 and lobe2 respectively) of GLUN1 (Furukawa et al., 2003). As early as 20ns of the simulation, the radius of gyration of glycine-bound GLUN1 (chain A) has decreased from its starting value of 1.85nm to 1.82nm that was fairly maintained till the end of the simulation (250ns). In contrast, nefiracetam-bound GLUN1 (chain C) began to open after 20ns and failed to close till 60ns. The attempted close conformation was rapidly reversed in less than 5ns (64ns, purple arrow) resulting in large shift in the radius of gyration value in favor of open conformation (purple arrow). A similar attempt at closing up at ∼90ns also resulted in a large increase in the radius of gyration value at similarly short time interval (Fig. 2
                        B), similar plot showing the deviation of each data point from the mean of the two simulations is also shown (Supplementary Fig. 2A).

Nefiracetam interaction promotes GLUN1-ligand-binding domain (LBD) opening. Excluding the amino acid residues covalently connecting β2 and β3 strands, the free energy of interaction between the two lobes was calculated using Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) (Sun et al., 2014; Kumari et al., 2014) method for nefiracetam bound and free LBDs. Interestingly, the major energy difference between the two setup is the contribution of Arg523 (D1 residue) and Asp732 (D2 residue) binding energy values (Fig. 2C(i)). Nefiracetam binding tends to abolish the contribution of Arg523. Previous studies have established that Arg523 is essential for ligand retention within the LBD cleft as the α-carboxy group of glycine interacts with its guanidinium (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000; Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000).

When Arg523-glycine complex orients the amino group of glycine towards the carboxylate side chain of Asp732 (D2), a bridge-like structure is formed between D1 and D2 (yellow bracket, Fig. 2C(ii)), this may explain the closure of the cleft upon glycine binding and its opening in nefiracetam-bound or Apo-state. Interestingly, within 30ns of simulation, the glycine within nefiracetam-bound GLUN1-LBD diffused out of the cleft into the surrounding water (Fig. 2C(iii), Supplementary Fig. 2B (plot of mean±SEM)), which further establishes the importance of the two resides to GLUN1 closure upon glycine binding. When these results are interpreted based on the BSP-SLIM docking, it is logical to hypothesize that an open conformation may favor nefiracetam binding into the glycine site as observed in the PDB IDs: 1PBQ and 4KCC BSP-SLIM results. This is also consistent with previous findings that incremental addition of nefiracetam (1– 10,000nM) into a bath containing glycine and NMDA resulted in dose-dependent decrease of glycine potentiation and total abrogation at 100nM nefiracetam concentration (Moriguchi et al., 2003). The authors have opined that nefiracetam binds the glycine site with higher affinity but lesser efficacy compared with glycine. Here, the MD simulation results has strongly suggested that the observed reduction in efficacy may be due to a multi-step requirement, first binding to a less-affinity β-strands-1-5 of LBD-GLUN1 site, disrupting Arg523-glycine-Asp732 complex formation, opening the glycine-LBD for glycine to diffuse into the exta-receptor solution and finally replacing the glycine.

Upon the dissociation of glycine from GLUN1, we sought to examine and compare the conformations sampled during the simulation with previously captured conformations. Here, starting with glycine-bound GLUN1 (PDB ID: 1PB7) (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003), the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of was calculated for the structures (Fig. 3
                        ) generated with time. Interestingly, starting at 20ns, a similar time-period when the GLUN1 radius of gyration was reduced, the site lacking nefiracetam began to show structural similarity to the glycine-bound form at rmsd value of <2.2nm, box-and-whisker plot of the rmsd of GLUN1 chains from glycine-bound GLUN1 (Gly-GLUN1) showed nefiracetam binding coerced chain-C to deviate from sampling glycine-bound conformation (Fig. 3A(i)). Similar observations were made for GLUN1-co-crystallized with d-cyloserine (DcX-GLUN1) (PDB ID: 1PB9) (Furukawa et al., 2003) resolved at 1.60Å (Fig. 3A(ii)). This is not surprising as the conformations of glycine- and d-cyloserine- bound GLUN1 are isomorphous (Furukawa et al., 2003), thus, allowing repeated conformational jump 185ns as observed previously (data not shown). Consistent with the reported conformational antagonist behavior of cycloleucine (Inanobe et al., 2005) i.e., stabilization of an partially open-cleft GLUN1 conformation, cyclo-leucine-bound GLUN1 (PDB ID 1Y1M) (Inanobe et al., 2005), did not differ from significantly from nefiracetam-bound open-cleft GLUN1 conformation as indicated by closely matched mean and upper boundary patterns of the box-and-whiskers plot (Fig. 3A(iii)). Time-dependent rmsd values from DCKA-bound GLUN1 finally established that nefiracetam traps GLUN1 into in an inactive conformation (Fig. 3A(iv)) (Furukawa et al., 2003), which explains how low concentration of nefiracetam rapidly inactivates NMDA receptor (Aihara et al., 2001; Aihara et al., 2001
                        Aihara et al., 2001; Morigochi et al., 2003, 2007). When the structures are compared with the apo-GLUN1 (Yao et al., 2013), nefiracetam-bound subunit showed lower mean rmsd value (rmsd=2.7nm) compared to only glycine site (rmsd=3.1nm) (Fig. 3A(v)). To establish that the rmsd changes observed during the simulation did not result from non-convergence of simulation, the alpha-carbon rmsd values of the structures generated along the simulation were compared with the starting structure (Fig. 3B), the result indicated that the simulation converged as early as 15ns. The early convergence of a bulky biosystem such as NMDA receptor-membrane-ligand complex may be due to a long equilibration step (see Section 2) prior to the unrestrained simulation.

NMDA receptor-N terminal domain (NTD) (Fig. 4
                        A) is functional and cooperates with the LBD in modulating NMDA receptor-transmembrane domain (TMD) gating property via a multistate kinetic mechanism (Amico-Ruvio et al., 2011). NTD relative position within NMDA receptor requires an obligatory communication with the LBD since the domain separates the NTD from the transmembrane domain (TMD) where ion-gating activities occur in NMDA receptor. First, the center of mass (COM) distance between NTD and LBD of GLUN1 were calculated for nefiracetam bound and unbound subunits during the simulation (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 2C (plot of mean±SEM). The data strongly suggested that nefiracetam traps GLUN1-LBD into a conformation which looses communication with the NTD. Similarly, excluding the short covalent loops joining these domains (NTD and LBD), the free energy of interaction was calculated using MMPBSA method. Surprisingly, interface residues in nefiracetam-bound conformation were rather repulsive (blue spheres, represent positive free energy values) in contrast to nefiracetam-free site, which showed attraction as indicated by the population of residues with negative free energy values (Fig. 4C). Clearly, inactivated GLUN1-LBD does not communicate with its NTD, which may explain the loss of calcium influx in nefiracetam treated cells within 10min (Aihara et al., 2001). In addition to NTD-LBD communication, the GLUN1-LBD also forms inter-subunit complex with a proximal glutamate/NMDA-binding domain of GLUN2 subunit. This heterodimeric LBD assembly was reported as the functional unit in tetrameric NMDA receptors (Newcomer et al., 2000; Regalado et al., 2001; Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003 Fukuwara et al., 2005). In fact, GLUN1-NTD-LBD intra-subunit interface tyrosine 535 has been identified as a key modulator of NMDA receptor channel deactivation (Furukawa et al., 2005). Consistent with these previous submissions, GLUN2-LBD proximal to nefiracetam-bound GLUN1 also became inactivated as it shared closer conformation (deduced from rmsd values with time along the trajectory, Fig. 4D lower panel) with Zn-bound GLUN2-NTD (PDB ID: 3JPY) (Karakas et al., 2009) while its LBD previously closer to the glutamate-bound (PDB ID: 2A5S) (Vance et al., 2011) at 30ns rapidly reversed to the inactive conformation (Fig. 4D lower panel). Thus, establishing the early submissions of the role of inter-domain communication between LBDs of GLUN1 and GLUN2 of NMDA receptor (Atlason et al., 2007; Gielen et al., 2008).

Agonist-induced topological dynamics occurring at the LBDs are transduced to the transmembrane (TM) region through the short linker joining the two domains (Jones et al., 2002; Talukder and Wollmuth, 2011). A more detailed study by Kazi et al. (2014) revealed that in an intact glutamate receptor, GLUN2-LBD exerts a mechanical pull on the linker (M3-S2), which in turn forces pore opening via M3. The authors also suggested that increasing the length of the linker through insertion of amino acid has a dampening effect on the gating properties of the receptor. This data has been reproduced using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation technique on a time-scale of 120ns by Dai and Zhou (2013). Here, from 250ns atomistic simulation, the effect of nefiracetam binding on the gating properties of NMDA receptor has been critically studied. The method for predicting pore opening and closure in this study is based on the radius of gyration of the conserved threonine residues; T648 and T647 in GLUN1 and GLUN2 subunits respectively (Fig. 5
                        A, dashed black rectangle). Surprisingly, we observed that in nefiracetam bound state, the observed opening of the glycine-LBD (≈20ns) which transduced inactivation to its proximal glutamate-LBD is now results in rapid closure of the channel as recorded by drastic tightening of the radius of gyration from 0.42nm to ≤3nm values from ≈35ns to the end of the simulation. Two transient re-opening of the channel at ≈90 and ≈125ns were however observed. To establish that nefiracetam binding is responsible for these dynamic gating events, an open conformation was retrieved at 90ns, and subjected to two variants of simulations. In the first sub-system, nefiracetam coordinate was removed and glycine was re-docked into its GLUN1 site followed by 50ns re-equilibration with restraints (20kcalmol−1
                        Å−2) on only the heavy atoms of the protein in order to keep LBD in the closed conformation while keeping the TMD in open state. In the second variant, glycine was removed from the GLUN1-LBD of chains A and C and replaced with nefiracetam (to test of nefiracetam can maintain NMDA receptor in an active state, thus acting as a co-agonist with glutamate), positional constraints and equilibration was done as described for the first variant. Both systems were then subjected to 150ns unrestrained simulation. In agreement with the report of Dai and Zhou (2013), the presence of glycine, a nefiracetam-free NMDA receptor TMD exists essentially in an open state. This contrasts with the maintenance of partially opened state in nefiracetam-bound state for the first 30ns of the production phase; this is rapidly followed by gate closure, then another phase of partial opening of the gate till the end of the simulation. First, these experiments confirmed that nefiracetam is the chemical entity that modulated the closure of the channel in the original simulation (Fig. 5B) and that it may be due to the loss of the glycine in the LBD, this is required for nefiracetam entry into the LBD as a replacement for glycine. Two snapshots were generated which depict the open and closed (Fig. 5C(i), (ii)). Clearly, the conserved threonine residues have provided a significant insight into the gating property of NMDA receptor. Finally, we sought to study the chi-1 dihedral (χ
                        1) changes in the conserved threonine residues in relation with gating properties using the original simulation. Interestingly, it seems 45° dihedral value was observed as optimum for gate opening while nefiracetam-bound GLUN1 seem to restrain threonine 647 (T647) to χ
                        1
                        =−45° value (Fig. 5D). Understandably, χ
                        1 value of 45° for threonine places its side chain hydroxyl group proximal to the acyl oxygen atom for possible hydrogen bond formation, thus making the hydroxyl group unavailable for interaction with ion or water passing through the channel. Nefiracetam in GLUN1-LBD-β-strands-1-5 position may induce intra-chain topologies in favor of channel closure via gauche effect on the conserved threonine residues (Bretscher et al., 2001).

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

Pyrrolidone nucleus-containing nefiracetam is a nootropic antidementia drug as deducible from data obtained from animal studies which strongly suggested that chronic nefiracetam increases the basal frequency of dentate polysialylated neurons and improved spatial learning ability (Murphy et al., 2005), details of the underlying mechanisms are now emerging (Nishizaki et al., 1999; Moriguchi et al., 2003, 2007). One of the earliest identified targets of nefiracetam is N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (Moriguchi et al., 2003, 2007). Indeed, the role of NMDA receptor in learning, memory and neuronal plasticity (Hanndelmann et al., 1989; Newcomer et al., 2000) are consistent with the phenotypes observable in animal undergoing chronic nefiracetam treatment (Murphy et al., 2005). From literature, the first two reports on physical interaction between nefiracetam and NMDA receptor interaction was published by Moriguchi et al. (2003, 2007),). In their first report, three key observations were made: NMDA currents potentiated by glycine (3μM) was attenuated by nefiracetam in concentration dependent manner, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (glycine site NMDA receptor inhibitor) dampened NMDA currents potentiated by nefiracetam and NMDA-evoked currents was reversibly potentiated by bath application of nefiracetam resulting in a bell-shaped dose-response curve in the absence of glycine. When taken together, the bell-shaped dose-response curve suggests multi-step or multiple-binding sites while the inhibition by 7-chlorokynurenic acid suggests that glycine site is one of the nefiracetam binding sites. BSP-SLIM method (Lee and Zhang, 2012) has identified two potential pockets for nefiracetam; the core of Spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-S1 is a theoretical nefiracetam binding pocket in closed GLUN1 state and the glycine site in GLUN1-LBD open conformation. Because the brain concentration of glycine is approximately 600-fold higher (Choi et al., 2011) than 1nM nefiracetam required for NMDA receptor current potentiation, we assumed glycine is bound to the receptor and the core of Spiral β-strands-1-5 of LBD-S1 represents the only free pocket on GLUN1 for nefiracetam.

Starting from this conformation, we observed that early in the simulation, the LBD of GLUN1-C subunit where nefiracetam was bound began to open as early as 20ns into the simulation, two attempts made to re-close the domain were reversed rapidly. Further analysis showed that loss of Arg523-Asp732 interaction across the two lobes of the domain might explain the opening of the domain. Consequent to opening LBD of GLUN1-C subunit, glycine diffused into the simulation solution. This is not surprisingly as Arg523 was previously identified as essential for amino-acid ligands retention within the LBD cleft via interactions between α-carboxy group of ligand and the guanidinium group of Arg523 (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000; Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000). Another key implication for the loss of glycine within the pocket is rapid inactivation of the subunit as observed by the low-rmsd values from DCKA bound-GLUN1 previously crystallized (Furukawa et al., 2003) in contrast to the other subunits which shows low-rmsd values from agonist bound GLUN1 structures. In addition to the local events at the LBD, starting from 50ns, we also observed that communication between the LBD and NTD was also abrogated in nefiracetam-bound GLUN1 subunit, which was traceable to the repulsion within the residues interfacing the two subdomains, and the ultimate effect observable was trapping its proximal GLUN2-NTD in Zn-bound inactive conformation (Karakas et al., 2009). Finally, we examined the effect of glycine replacement by nefiracetam on the gating property of NMDA receptor. Interestingly, nefiracetam acts as a partial agonist allowing a near-closed GLUN1-LBD and opened TMD.

In addition to NMDA receptor, nefiracetam may also have other cellular targets such an unidentified G protein coupled receptor (Huang et al. 1996) transducing intracellular signaling via/Gi/o coupling/protein kinase A (PKA)/cascades, this mechanism has been under scrutiny (Nishizaki et al., 1999, 2000; Zhao et al., 2001). Other investigators also reported neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nnAChRs) via protein kinase C (PKC) mechanisms (Nishizaki et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2001) as another plausible nefiracetam target.

In conclusion, extracellular nefiracetam may interact with NMDA receptor in a multi-stage process, first mediating glycine removal via GLUN1-LBD opening and replacement of glycine within the cleft. Secondly, nefiracetam may be co-agonist when occupying the GLUN1-LBD. These properties well explains nefiracetam-induced abrogation of glycine-mediated NMDA receptor current. The nature of nefiracetam-NMDA receptor interaction as studied here is also consistent with the bell-shaped dose-response curve, which is suggestive of multi-step or multiple-binding sites. In terms of physiology, longer simulation time-scale may be required to fully understand the comparative gating kinetics of glycine and nefiracetam and further experiments are required to validate the accuracy of the predicted binding domain of nefiracetam within the GLUN1-LBD.
