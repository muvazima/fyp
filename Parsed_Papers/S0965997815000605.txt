                  To join a medium or thick plate weldment with a full penetration, a groove is usually prepared in the space between two sections of metal. Because weld metal needs to be deposited within the groove to form the joint, it is expected that different groove type will require different heat input, which may consequently have influence on welding residual stress and deformation. Generally, different groove corresponds to different bead layout, so it can be foreseen that the groove type has a significant effect on temperature history, shape and size of heat affected zone, and region of sensitization in certain alloys such as austenitic stainless steel. The influences of groove type on residual stress, angular distortion and width of sensitization region in a SUS304 butt-welded joint were investigated by means of numerical simulation and experiment. Based on ABAQUS code, a computational approach with considering thermo-mechanical coupling behaviors, moving heat source, strain hardening and annealing effect was developed to simulate temperature profile, stress field and deformation in multi-pass joint. Welding temperature cycles, residual stress distributions and deformations in V, K and X groove joints were calculated through using the proposed computational procedure. Meanwhile, experiments were carried out to obtain residual stress distributions and angular distortions. Through comparing the numerical results and the measured data, the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed computational approach were verified. The simulation results show that groove type has a significant influence on welding residual stress distribution, angular distortion and width of sensitization region.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Austenitic stainless steels have been widely used in nuclear power plants as in-core and surrounding structural materials. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is still a problem found in austenitic stainless steel weldments [1,2] even though it has a comprehensive advantage in strength and corrosion resistance. The mechanism of SCC in austenitic stainless steel has not been completely clarified yet, however, a number of investigations on weldments used in nuclear power equipment indicated that SCC is the primary damage owing to the confluence of stress, material and environment factors [3,4]. Since welding residual stress is often inevitably produced in welded joints and its peak value tends to be equal or larger than the yield strengths of the base metal and the weld metal, it has been regarded as one of the most significant factors leading to SCC [5].

A variety of experimental methods [6,7] to measure welding residual stresses have been proposed in the past years. However, these methods are either too expensive or very difficult to obtain satisfactory results especially in engineering structures. In recent years, a number of finite element models [8–10] have been proposed to predict welding residual stresses in multi-pass welded joints. With the development of computer technology and the maturity of computational welding mechanics, numerical simulation technology has been regarded as one of the most promising methods to obtain welding residual stress and deformation [11].

Besides the tensile residual stress induced by welding process, another important issue is the sensitization in an austenitic stainless steel or a nickel alloy joint. Sensitization resulting from grain boundary chromium (Cr) depletion occurs in stainless steels and nickel alloys because various types of Cr carbides form in the temperature range of 500–750°C [12,13]. Chromium carbide formation ties up significant amounts of Cr in and near the grain boundaries, thus rendering the matrix in the boundary poor in Cr, relative to the bulk composition, and susceptible to corrosion and SCC. Therefore, if the welding residual stress distribution and the location of sensitized region in austenitic stainless steel welded joints can be determined, it will be beneficial to the evaluation of SCC tendency for a welded joint.

To ensure a full penetration a medium or thick plate joint, a groove is usually needed in the space between two sections of metal. Generally, different groove type requires different number of weld pass and heat input. In the past, the effects of welding method, welding parameters and mechanical boundary conditions on welding residual stress and distortion have been extensively investigated [14–17]. However, the researches on the influences of groove type on welding residual stress and deformation in multi-pass joints are very limited. Therefore, a three-dimensional (3-D) thermal elastic plastic finite element method based on ABAQUS code was developed to simulate temperature field, residual stress distribution and deformation in a SUS304 stainless steel multi-pass joint. Meanwhile, experiments were carried out to measure welding residual stress distribution and deformation. The measurements were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed computational approach. In addition, the influences of groove type on welding residual stress, deformation and width of sensitization region were clarified using the developed numerical simulation technology.

Three mock-ups with different groove types (i.e. V-groove, K-groove and X-groove) as shown in Fig. 1
                      were fabricated in this study. The dimensions of each joint is 300mm×300mm×10mm. The base metal is SUS304 austenitic stainless steel, and the filler wire is GMS-309L with 1.2mm diameter. The welding was performed by a Panasonic KR600 welding machine, and the shielding gas is pure Ar. During welding, the specimens were joined without any external mechanical restraint. Fig. 2
                      shows the three joints with different groove types. There are four weld passes in each joint, and the pass sequences and their arrangements used in those three joints are shown in Fig. 3
                     . The inter-pass temperature was strictly controlled below 100°C. The welding parameters for each pass used in three joints are summarized in Tables 1–3
                     
                     
                     , respectively.

After welding, the hole drilling strain gauge method [18,19] was used to measure the residual stresses on the surface of the welded joints. In the present work, the residual stresses including longitudinal stress and transverse stress at seven locations were measured, and the measurement locations are shown in Fig. 1 by the black dots. A device named Sigmar-ASM made by Ji-Nan Sigmar Sci-tech Co., Ltd. was used to measure the released elastic strains. The measuring of residual stress was performed according to ASTM: E837-08e2 standard [20]. After setting Young’s modulus and Possion’s ratio of the material at room temperature, the measured results (residual stresses) can be automatically read from the screen of Sigmar-ASM device. In addition, a three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate measuring system named ROMER INFINITE 2.0 was used to obtain the welding deformation [21]. The measuring accuracy of the system is 0.03mm. Three dimensional coordinates at 49 points of each welded specimen were measured to obtain the contour of welding deformation. In the present study, we plotted the profile of out-of-deformation for each specimen through using MATLAB software [21]. Both the residual stresses and the profiles of welding deformation were used to verify the corresponding numerical results.

Based on ABAQUS code, a sequentially coupled thermo-elastic-plastic finite element method was developed to simulate welding temperature field, residual stress distribution and distortion in SUS304 austenitic stainless steel multi-pass butt joints. In the developed computational approach, the thermo-elastic-plastic constitutive relations, moving heat source, and thermal boundary conditions were carefully considered. Also, strain hardening and annealing effect [22] were taken into account in the finite element models.

The dimensions of the finite element models are the same as those of the corresponding experimental specimens. To balance the computing time and calculation accuracy, finer grids were designed at the weld zone and its vicinity, while relatively coarser grids were used for the ranges far away from the weld bead. The length of each element in the welding direction is 3mm, so the number of division in longitudinal direction is 100. The smallest element in the finite element models is 1mm×1mm×3mm. In each 3-D finite element model, the total numbers of element and node are 32,000 and 36,865, respectively. It should be pointed out that even though the numbers of element and node in those three models are the same, the sizes and the shapes of elements at fusion zones and their vicinities among three models are slightly different. The element type used in thermal analysis is DC3D8 [23,24]. During the thermal analysis, the “Model Change” option was used to simulate the deposition of weld metal. When the first pass was welded, all elements involved in this whole pass were added to the finite element model, while the other passes were removed from the finite element model. A moving heat source was used to simulate the heat input. After the first pass was performed, the elements involved in the second weld pass were added to the groove. Similarly, the second pass was performed with a moving heat source. With using the similar manner, the rest weld passes were welded till the groove was filled completely.

During the welding, the governing equation for transient heat transfer analysis is given by the following equation.

                        where x′, y′ and z′ are the local coordinates of the double ellipsoid model aligned with the welded plate; f
                        1 and f
                        2 are parameters representing the fraction of the heat deposited in the front and the rear parts respectively. Note that f
                        1
                        +

                        1 is assumed to be 1.4 and f
                        2 to be 0.6 respectively because the temperature gradient in the front leading part is steeper than that in the tailing edge [26].

In the above two equations, Q is the power of the welding heat source. It can be calculated according to the welding current, the arc voltage and the arc efficiency [24]. The arc efficiency (η) is assumed to be 70% for the MIG welding process. The parameters a
                        1, a
                        2, b and c are related to the characteristics of the welding heat source. The parameters of the heat source can be adjusted to create a desired melted zone according to the welding conditions. The moving heat source was modeled by a user subroutine in ABAQUS code [24].

Considering the welding speed and welding direction (along x-coordinate), the coordinates at the center of heat source model can be expressed as follows:

Besides considering the moving heat source, heat losses due to convention and radiation were also taken into account in the finite element models. In the thermal analysis, all surfaces of the finite element model were assumed to lose heat by convention to the surrounding air. Heat loss due to convection (qc
                        ) was taken into account using Newton’s law:

The temperature-dependent thermal properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat and density of base metal (SUS304) used in the finite element model are shown in Fig. 4
                         
                        [27]. Since the chemical components of weld metal are much similar to those of base metal, the temperature-dependent thermal physical properties of the former were assumed to be the same as those of the latter.

The mechanical analyses were conducted using the temperature histories computed by the thermal analysis as thermal loads. The same finite element mesh used in the thermal analysis was employed in the mechanical analysis except for the element type and the boundary conditions. The element type in the mechanical analysis is C3D8I [23,24]. Since the experimental mock-ups were performed without external constraint in the experiments, the mechanical boundary conditions of the finite element model were just used to prevent the rigid motion. The mechanical boundary conditions are shown by the arrows in Fig. 3.

Solid-state phase transformation does not take place in the austenitic stainless base metal and the weld metal and the creep strain can be neglected, so the total strain increment in each element can be decomposed into three main components as follows:

In the mechanical analysis, the elastic strain was modeled using the isotropic Hook’s law with temperature-dependent Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio as shown in Fig. 5
                        . The thermal strain was computed by using the temperature-dependent coefficient of thermal expansion. For the plastic strain, a rate-independent plastic model was employed with the following features: Von Mises yield, temperature-dependent mechanical properties, and isotropic strain hardening model. In addition, annealing effect was also taken into account in the present model, and the annealing temperature was assumed to be 1000°C [22,27].

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In theory, obtaining accurate results of welding temperature field is the prerequisite to achieve reasonable results of welding residual stress and distortion. Methodologically, reasonable fusion zone and temperature profile in each weld pass can be obtained through adjusting the parameters of heat source in the thermal analyses. Figs. 6–8
                        
                        
                         show the cross-sections of weld pools in V-groove, K-groove and X-groove joints, respectively. These figures tell us that the peak temperatures of three joints are much similar, and their values are approximately 1800°C. The peak temperatures generally match the experimental results obtained by Okagaito and his co-authors [28].

In the current study, only the residual stresses in V-groove joints were measured. Here, V-groove joint is taken as an example to verify the corresponding simulated results. Fig. 9
                            compares longitudinal residual stress distributions along Line 1 (defined in Fig. 3) predicted by FEM and the measurements obtained by experiment. From this figure, it can be seen that the predictions are in a good agreement with the measurements within the range from X
                           =120mm to X
                           =180mm. It should be pointed out that the X-coordinate of the center of V-groove on the top surface is X
                           =150mm. Because the peak temperature is high enough within this range (120mm<
                           X
                           <180mm), the residual stresses completely resulted from welding heat input. In the same figure, it is notable that there are some differences between the simulated results and the measured data within the range X
                           <120mm and the range X
                           >180mm. Within these ranges, the distances from the weld bead are relatively large, so the peak temperature is not high enough to soften the base metal. Hence, the initial stresses produced before welding [11] cannot completely eliminated, thereby they remained in the welded joint. A feasible method to remove the initial stress is to anneal the weld specimens at a high temperature (e.g. 1000°C). Unfortunately, the base metal used in the present study was not annealed before welding. On the other hand, only welding process was considered in the finite element model, but the other manufacturing processes before welding were neglected. The simulated results only reflect the residual stresses produced by welding itself. This is the reason why there are differences between FEM and experiment within the ranges away from fusion zone.

The profiles of longitudinal residual stress distribution of the mid-section in three different cases are shown in Fig. 10
                           . It can be seen that the region with high tensile residual stresses in V-groove joint is obviously wider than those in K-groove and X-groove joints. The opening of V-groove on the top surface is larger than those of X-groove and K-groove, so it requires more deposition metal when the last pass is performed. Hence, the heat input used in the last weld pass is larger than those used in K-groove and X-groove. Generally, the width with high longitudinal residual stress on the top surface in a multi-pass joint is mainly determined by the heat input used in the last weld pass and the breadth of last weld bead. From Tables 1–3 and Fig. 10, it can be seen that both the heat input and the breadth of last weld bead in V-groove joint are larger than those in the other two joints, so it is not strange that the width with high tensile longitudinal stress in V-groove is the largest one among these three joints. Carefully comparing K-groove and X-groove joints, it can be found that there are some local discrepancies between these two joints, but these differences are limited on the whole.


                           Fig. 11
                            compares the longitudinal residual stress distributions along Line 1 among three joints. It seems that the peak value of longitudinal residual stress is not sensitive to groove type. This figure shows that the peak values of Line 1 in all three joints are approximately 450MPa. This value is significantly larger than the yield strength of the base metal at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 9, the peak value measured by experiment is also 450MPa or so. Both the numerical model and the experiment show that strain hardening has a large contribution to the final residual stresses.

Even through the peak value of longitudinal residual stress among the three joints is similar, however, the width with tensile longitudinal residual stress in V-groove joint is significantly larger than those in K-groove and X-groove joints. The reason have been explained in the above paragraph. Comparing K-groove and X-groove, we can observe that the width with tensile stress of the former is slightly larger than that of the latter.


                           Fig. 12
                            compares transverse residual stress distributions along Line 1 (defined in Fig. 3) predicted by FEM and the measurements obtained by experiment in V-groove joint. This figure tells us that the predictions are generally in a good agreement with the measurements even though the latter are slightly lower than the former. When using strain gauge to measure residual stress, the accuracy is influenced by the size of strain gauge because the result is the average value of the strain gauge’s scope. In Fig. 12, the numerical results show that the gradients of transverse residual stress around the fusion zone are very large. The size of strain gauge used in the present study is relatively large, so this naturally resulted in some discrepancies between finite element model and experiment.

In Fig. 12, the numerical results also tell us that the transverse residual stress distribution along Line 1 has “M” shape, and its peak value is about 200MPa which is lower than the yield strength of base metal.

The distribution of transverse residual stress in V-groove joint is different from those in the other two joints, while the difference between K-groove joint and X-groove joint is small. The distributions of transverse residual stresses along Line 1 predicted by numerical models are shown in Fig. 14
                           . It can be seen that both the magnitude and the distribution pattern of transverse residual stress in V-groove joint are different from those in K-groove and X-groove joints. Fig. 14 also shows that the magnitudes of transverse residual stress within the region around the fusion zone in V-groove joint are significantly higher than those in the other two joints. The peak value of transverse residual stress of Line 1 in the V-groove joint is about 200MPa, while the maximum values in the other two joints are 150MPa or so.

                            compares the deflection distributions along Line 1 among V, K and X-groove joints. In this figure, both the measurements and the predictions are plotted. It is clear that the simulated results of these three cases match the corresponding measured data well. Fig. 15 also indicates that V-groove joint has the largest angular distortion among these three joints, while X-groove joint has the smallest one. It can be concluded that groove type has a significant influence on the angular distortion. From the viewpoint of distortion prevention, X-groove is the best choice among three groove types.

As mentioned in Introduction, sensitization resulting from grain boundary chromium depletion occurs in stainless steels because various types of chromium carbides such as Cr23C6 and Cr7C3 form in the temperature range of 500–750°C [12,13]. It is well known that the chromium depleted zone is susceptible to corrosion and SCC. During welding, because the heating speed is very fast, the temperature range of sensitization usually can be regarded as 600°C–1000°C [29].

In this section, five points, namely points M, N, O, P and Q as shown in Fig. 16
                         are taken as examples to examine their temperature cycles during the last pass welding of V-groove joint. The distances from each point to the weld centerline are 0mm, 7.0mm, 10.0mm, 11.0mm and 14.0mm respectively. Thermal cycle curves of these points are plotted in Fig. 16. From this figure we can know that the peak temperatures of points M and N are 1700°C and 1550°C, respectively. The peak value of temperatures at points P and Q are between 600 and 1000°C, so these two points are within the sensitization region. However, points M, N and O do not belong to sensitization region because their peak values are higher than 1000°C.

During multi-pass welding process, the thermal cycle at each material point is more complicated than that induced by single pass welding. Fig. 17
                         schematically shows the sensitization regions on the top surface of V-groove joint. Considering the characteristics of thermal cycle during multi-pass welding, we can judge a material point belongs to sensitization region or not using the following rules. (1) If the peak temperatures in all sub-cycles during the entire thermal cycle are lower than 600°C, this point does not belong to sensitization region. The image of this kind thermal cycle is shown in Fig. 18
                        (a). In Fig. 17, the thermal cycles of Zone A and Zone B are similar to that shown in Fig. 18(a). (2) If the peak temperature in each sub-cycle or in the last sub-cycle is higher than 1000°C, the corresponding point does not belong to sensitization region because the material point experienced solution heat treatment in each sub-cycle or in the last sub-cycle. The image of thermal cycle is shown in Fig. 18(b). In Fig. 17, the thermal cycle of Zone C is similar to that shown in Fig. 18(b). It is clear that the fusion zone of the last pass does not belong to sensitization region, either. (3) If the peak temperatures in some or all sub-cycles are between 600°C and 1000°C this point belongs to sensitization region. One typical image of thermal cycle is shown in Fig. 18(c). In Fig. 17, Zone D and Zone E belong to sensitization region. (4) As shown in Fig. 18(d), the peak temperatures of some sub-cycles are high than 1000°C, while some are between 600°C and 1000°C. Because the peak temperature in the last sub-cycle is between 600°C and 1000°C, this point also belongs to sensitization region. In Fig. 17, Zone F belongs to sensitization region. (5) As shown in Fig. 18(e), even though the peak temperature in one sub-cycle is between 600 and 1000°C, however, this points does not belong to sensitization zone because the peak temperature of the last second sub-cycle is over 1000°C and that in the last sub-cycle is lower than 600°C. In Fig. 17, the thermal cycle of Zone G is similar to that shown in Fig. 18(e).

In summary, the sensitization regions on the top surface of V-groove joints are D, E and F zones, while the others zones do not belong to sensitization region. The total width of these sensitization region in V-groove joint is 11.0mm. Similarly, the widths of sensitization region on the top surface in K-groove and X-groove joints can also be obtained based on the thermal cycles, and their values are 5.8mm and 5.0mm, respectively. Among the three joints, V-groove joint has the widest sensitization region on the top surface.

In this study, only a simply method was used to roughly determine sensitization region according to the thermal cycles calculated by FEM. In the future work, a more reasonable model will be developed to assess the possibility of sensitization based on TTS (Time-temperature sensitization) diagram [12,29] of the materials. This will be more helpful in judging the tendency of SSC occurrence in a welded joint.

                        Fig. 19
                         comprehensively compares the peak value of longitudinal residual stress, the peak value of transverse residual stress, the maximum value of out-of-plane displacement and the total width of sensitization region on the top surface among V-groove, K-groove, and X-groove joints. This figure shows that there difference of peak values of longitudinal residual stress among three joints is very small. This means that the peak value of longitudinal residual stress is not sensitive to groove type. However, the peak value of transverse residual stress, the angular distortion and the width of sensitization region in V-groove joint are significantly larger than those in K-groove and X-groove joints. The peak value of transverse residual stress in V-groove joint is 40% larger than that in K-groove or X-groove joint, and the angular distortion of V-groove joint is 66% and 35% larger than that of X-groove joint and that of K-groove joint, respectively. Fig. 19 also tells us that that the total width of sensitization region in V-groove is 86% bigger than that in X-groove joint, while the difference between K-groove joint and X-groove joint is small. Thus, no matter from the viewpoint of preventing deformation or from the perspective of preventing stress corrosion, X-groove and K-groove joints are superior to V-groove joint.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A thermal elastic plastic finite element method was developed for analyzing the temperature field, welding residual stress distribution and distortion in multi-pass SUS304 steel joints. Using the developed computational approach, the influence of groove type on welding residual stress, angular distortion and sensitization region was examined. The conclusions can be drawn as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           The welding residual stresses and angular distortion in V-groove joint predicted by finite element model are in a good agreement with the measured data. It has been proved that the developed computational approach can be used to accurately simulate welding residual stress and deformation for multi-pass joints.

The numerical simulation results show that the region with longitudinal tensile stress in V-groove joint is slightly wider than those of the other two joints. The region with transverse tensile stress in V-groove joint is significantly wider than that in K-groove or X-groove joint. In addition, the peak value of transverse tensile stress of V-groove joint is much higher than those of the other two joints.

Both the measured data and the simulated results indicate that the angular distortion of the butt joint is significantly affected by groove type.

The numerical results show that the total sensitization region on the top surface in V-groove joint is significantly larger than those in K-groove and X-groove joints.

From the viewpoint of SCC prevention in austenitic steel butt welded joint, the simulation results suggest that X-groove and K-groove are superior to V-groove.
