                  Most real-life decision-making activities require more than one objective to be considered. Therefore, several studies have been presented in the literature that use multiple objectives in decision models. In a mathematical programming context, the majority of these studies deal with two objective functions known as bicriteria optimization, while few of them consider more than two objective functions. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed to generate all nondominated solutions for multiobjective discrete optimization problems with any number of objective functions. In this algorithm, the search is managed over (p
                     −1)-dimensional rectangles where p represents the number of objectives in the problem and for each rectangle two-stage optimization problems are solved. The algorithm is motivated by the well-known ε-constraint scalarization and its contribution lies in the way rectangles are defined and tracked. The algorithm is compared with former studies on multiobjective knapsack and multiobjective assignment problem instances. The method is highly competitive in terms of solution time and the number of optimization models solved.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Optimization algorithms are typically developed with the purpose of optimizing a single objective. However, in many real-world applications two or more criteria are relevant. Any discrete optimization problem in which two or more objectives are considered is called multiobjective discrete optimization problem (MODO). In MODO, the main issue is to develop effective procedures to generate efficient solutions that have the property that no improvement in any objective is possible without sacrificing in at least one other objective. Many studies have been presented for MODO, including several specialized algorithms targeting specific problems. However, the majority of them solve bicriteria discrete problems, while only a few of them deal with more than two objective functions, see for instance, Ulungu and Teghem (1994), Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2000), Ehrgott (2006).

As most discrete optimization problems are computationally difficult to solve with a single objective function, solving MODO problems is also difficult (Ehrgott & Gandibleux, 2000). One straightforward way of solving a MODO problem is by reducing it to a single objective discrete optimization problem using a weighted sum formulation that combines multiple objectives (Zadeh, 1963). The resulting solution will be an efficient one if positive weights are used. However, it is also known that some efficient solutions cannot be obtained by using weighted sum scalarization (Ehrgott, 2005). The efficient solutions that are not reachable as optimal solutions to the weighted sum formulation are called unsupported efficient solutions, whereas the ones that can be found as optimal solutions to such problems are called supported efficient solutions.

Several general methods were proposed to deal with unsupported efficient solutions. One of the most well-known techniques is based on Tchebycheff scalarization that was introduced by Bowman (1976). Bowman demonstrated that the entire set of efficient solutions can be obtained by parameterizing the objective functions using the Tchebycheff norm. Eswaran, Ravindran, and Moskowitz (1989) proposed an algorithm based on these findings for bicriteria problems. Their algorithm finds the entire efficient set under a slightly restrictive assumption referred to as uniform dominance. A variant of this method is referred to as the augmented weighted Tchebycheff method which finds efficient solutions without uniform dominance assumption (Steuer & Choo, 1983). Similar to the Tchebycheff approach, Sayin and Kouvelis propose min–max type subproblems (Sayın & Kouvelis, 2005). Their algorithm utilizes two-stage optimization problems and generates the entire efficient set for any bicriteria discrete problem via a weight space search.

Another well-known technique to obtain efficient solutions for MODO problems is the ε-constraint method, introduced by Haimes, Lasdon, and Wismer (1971). In this method, one of the objectives is chosen as the objective function and the others are transformed into constraints. The right-hand sides of these constraints are quantities in the objective space. In theory, all efficient solutions of a problem can be found by using the ε-constraint method and convexity is not required (Chankong & Haimes, 1982). In practice, the ε-constraint method requires a parametric search on the right-hand-side values. As the parametric search is easy to perform for bicriteria problems, most of the bicriteria discrete optimization problems are solved by using this method, for instance as in Bérubé, Gendreau, and Potvin (2009).

The earliest study that reports computational arguments on solving MODO with more than two objectives is presented by Sylva and Crema (2004). The main idea of this method is to obtain a new efficient solution by removing the dominated space by the previously obtained efficient solutions. However, removing some portion of the feasible set requires inclusion of additional constraints and binary variables. Therefore, the size of the single-objective model increases with respect to the increasing number of efficient solutions. Laumanns, Thiele, and Zitzler (2006) proposed a method in which an adaptive scheme for the ε-constraint method is utilized to obtain the entire efficient set. They search for efficient solutions inside the (p
                     −1)-dimensional grid which partitions a (p
                     −1)-dimensional projection of the objective space. For each grid an ε-constraint subproblem is solved. Unlike the original ε-constraint scalarization, the formulation for the minimization problem incorporates not only upper bounds but also lower bounds for the p
                     −1 objective functions converted into constraints, and solves lexicographic optimization problems to deal with weak efficiency. In addition to the challenges introduced by the two-sided bounding of objective functions, another drawback of this method is the number of subproblems solved. The number of grid points may become unmanageable, especially in large-size problems. A recursive algorithm that precedes both studies is presented by Tenfelde-Podehl (2003). This method deals with MODO with p-objectives by converting it into several (p
                     −1)-objective problems. Tenfelde-Podehl (2003) manages the search in p-dimensional space by using boxes (Tenfelde-Podehl, 2003). Dhaenens, Lemesre, and Talbi (2010) use a similar idea in a three-phase solution method with box splitting improvements and parallelization. The first phase consists of determining the ideal and nadir points. The second phase generates well dispersed nondominated solutions, and the third phase explores the whole search space to enumerate all nondominated solutions. Another recursive algorithm is given by Özlen and Azizoğlu (2009). The authors use the augmented form for the ε-constraint formulation. In this method, ranges for the nondominated set in the objective space are obtained by minimizing and maximizing each objective function over the feasible set. Then, by applying the range information in the constrained problems the authors generate all nondominated solutions.

In this study, a new method is proposed to solve MODO problems. The method is designed to work for any number of objective functions. The algorithm relies on the ε-constraint method and introduces a simple second stage model to deal with weakly efficient solutions. The method conducts a search over all relevant right-hand-side values by defining (p
                     −1)-dimensional rectangles similar to the grid definition of Laumanns et al. (2006). In the following section, we present the background. In Section 3, the algorithm and associated theoretical results are given. In Section 4, computational results and comparison with previous algorithms are presented on multiobjective knapsack and multiobjective assignment problem instances. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.

Due to the conflicting objectives, MODO is expected to have more than one solution. These solutions are called efficient solutions.

                      for MODO problems. We use the ε-constraint method to obtain efficient solutions. The method retains one of the p objective functions as the objective function, while the remaining p
                     −1 are turned into constraints (Haimes et al., 1971). The optimal solution of the ε-constraint formulation is weakly efficient (Ehrgott, 2005). Weak efficiency can be avoided by using augmented formulations (Steuer, 1986). In this work, we use two-stage formulations to avoid weakly efficient solutions as opposed to lexicographic optimization (Ben-Tal, 1980) employed by Laumanns et al. (2006).

                        j
                      values in the projected space

                      suffices to parameterize the subproblems. By changing ε systematically, the entire nondominated set can be obtained. For p
                     =3, however, the parametric space consists of

The search is initialized with a single rectangle that covers (p
                     −1)-dimensional space. Indeed, if the problem is bounded, then it is possible to define the boundaries of the search space for each dimension by first solving small subproblems. Lower bounds for each dimension can be obtained by minimizing each objective function over the feasible set

Instead of finite bounds for the initial rectangle, our algorithm can be adjusted to allow for 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 p
                                 -
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      itself. However, as we implement a selection procedure based on a volume measure as described below, we introduce finite bounds.

Throughout the procedure, rectangles are partitioned into smaller disjoint rectangles. When a rectangle is picked, the two-stage formulation is always solved using its upper vertex as ε. Therefore some of the feasible regions in P
                     1(u
                     
                        i
                     ) with different rectangles may overlap. In order to facilitate selection of rectangles that lead to larger feasible sets in P

                        i
                     ), we define a volume measure associated with rectangle R

                     . In the rest of the paper, when we refer to the volume of a rectangle, measure V
                     
                        i
                      is implied.

We expect that selecting a rectangle with larger V
                     
                        i
                      before a rectangle with a smaller V
                     
                        i
                      would improve total processing time. This expectation has been verified in a limited number of computational experiments. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm does not fundamentally depend on such a prioritization rule. In principle, rectangles can be chosen from the list L according to other rules or simply arbitrarily.

The pseudocode for the proposed method is given in Algorithm 1. The algorithm starts with a single (p
                     −1)-dimensional rectangle where the lower and upper vertices of the rectangle are

                     , respectively. In each iteration, the algorithm picks a rectangle R

                           (
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 ∗

                      as inputs and returns the updated list L.

After updating the list, some of the rectangles can be removed because the volume between the upper vertex of the rectangle and

                                 ∗

                      does not need to be searched (see Lemma 1). Therefore, all such rectangles are removed by using Procedure removeRect. After getting the list of the rectangles and the bounds of the volume to be removed as inputs, this procedure generates the updated list L.
                        
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

The second possible case after solving a set of two-stage programs in Algorithm 1 is that an optimal solution x
                     ∗ is obtained, but f(x
                     ∗) has already been found at an earlier iteration

                      values may return the same nondominated solution when problems P
                     1(ε) and Q
                     1(ε) are solved as seen in Fig. 1. As in the previous case, rectangles that lie in between

                      and current rectangle’s upper vertex u
                     
                        i
                      are removed by using Procedure removeRect.

The third possible case is the infeasibility of the two-stage programs with u
                     
                        i
                     . Since every

                      would lead to an infeasible P
                     1(ε) formulation (see Lemma 2), all such rectangles are removed. The algorithm terminates when the list of rectangles is empty. At termination all nondominated solutions 
                        
                           (

                      are obtained (see Theorem 3).

The steps of the algorithm have been presented so far. Now, we need to show that the proposed algorithm generates all nondominated solutions in a finite number of iterations. Below, we first show that no nondominated solution maps into removed rectangles.

The resulting nondominated solution and new rectangles are shown in Fig. 2b. The shaded volume corresponds to removed rectangles in the former iterations. In the third iteration, a new nondominated solution is obtained as seen in Fig. 2c. Unlike previous iterations, the new nondominated solution labeled with 3 is outside the chosen rectangle.

Algorithm 1 is compared with three different methods which are proposed by Sylva and Crema (2004), Laumanns et al. (2006) and Özlen and Azizoğlu (2009). The common property of these methods is that all can obtain the entire nondominated set for MODO problems with any number of objective functions. All algorithms except for the adaptive ε-constraint method have been implemented in C++. Laumanns et al. (2006) provide the source code of their algorithm which is implemented in C. However, their implementation is slightly different from the description presented in the paper as also noted by Przybylski, Xavier, and Ehrgott (2009). Laumanns et al. (2006) describe two-sided bounds for the ε-constraint formulation, but they use single sided bounds in the implementation. The comparison here is based on the version presented in their implementation. Subproblems are solved by using IBM CPLEX 12.4 (Cplex, 2012). All tests were conducted on a shared cluster with Intel Xeon 2.3GHz CPU and 4GB memory limit with Linux operating system. These algorithms are tested on the multiobjective knapsack problem and multiobjective assignment problem instances. Different problem categories are generated based on problem size. There are 10 instances in each category. Tables 1–3
                     
                     
                      summarize computational results. In these tables, the first row for each category reports averages. The numbers in the second row correspond to the minimum and maximum for each category. Computation of each instance is interrupted after 25,000 CPU seconds. If a blank cell appears in a table, it indicates that none of the 10 instances could be completed within the time limit.

Along with CPU time, we report number of models solved by each method. Among the four methods tested, Sylva and Crema (2004) and Özlen and Azizoğlu (2009) use single stage subproblems, Laumanns et al. (2006) use p-stage subproblems, and Algorithm 1 uses two-stage subproblems. When we report statistics for “number of models solved,” a model refers to a set of p-optimization problems for Laumanns et al. (2006) (i.e. one lexicographic optimization problem) and two optimization problems for Algorithm 1 (i.e. a pair of problems P

The multiobjective knapsack problem consists of an integer capacity W

                        =3 case, we have generated 10 instances with a size varying from 10 to 100 with increments of 10. The number of models solved by each method is given in Table 1 along with other results.

As seen in Table 1, the number of nondominated solutions grows with the size of the problems. The difference in the number of solved models and the computation time is considerable among different methods. In particular, Algorithm 1 outperforms other methods in both comparison criteria. The difference between the performance of Algorithm 1 and other methods increases with increasing size of the problem. For example, when n
                        =100, Algorithm 1 is the only method that solves all 10 instances successfully. Another effectiveness criterion for the methods is the number of mathematical models solved to obtain one nondominated solution. For Algorithm 1, the ratio of number of models solved to number of nondominated solutions is 1.97 on average. Besides, in none of the instances does this ratio exceed 1.99.

We test Algorithm 1 for p
                        =4 and p
                        =5 to see how it behaves for larger p. Since methods of Sylva and Crema (2004) and Laumanns et al. (2006) have some difficulty in solving larger problem instances with p
                        =3, we solve p
                        =4 instances by using Özlen and Azizoğlu (2009)’s recursive algorithm and Algorithm 1. The four-objective knapsack problem results are given in Table 2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that generates both supported and unsupported nondominated solutions for four-objective knapsack problems up to n
                        =40.

For p
                        =4, the number of nondominated solutions more than doubles compared to the p
                        =3 case. Moreover, the gap between the CPU times of the recursive algorithm and Algorithm 1 widens. The number of models solved increases drastically for the recursive algorithm and none of the n
                        =40 instances can be solved.

Algorithm 1 is the only candidate for solving five-objective knapsack problem instances. For n
                        =10, the average number of nondominated solutions is 16.2, and the average CPU time is 1.0s. For n
                        =20, the average number of nondominated solutions is 161.2, and the average CPU time is 5084.1s while the maximum is 21304.4 s. We observe that instances with n
                        =20 can be solved using complete enumeration in 60.3 CPU seconds on average. Neither Algorithm 1 nor complete enumeration can solve instances with n
                        =30.

Unlike generic multiobjective methods that have been referred to so far, there are some studies presented to solve only multiobjective knapsack problems. In one recent study, Bazgan, Hugot, and Vanderpooten (2009) proposed an approach based on dynamic programming. In another one, a labeling algorithm was used to find all nondominated outcomes by Figueira, Tavares, and Wiecek (2010). Although these two studies are problem specific algorithms, we make an informal comparison with respect to CPU time. Since their computational environment is different from ours, we scale the reported CPU times to our computation setting by using SPEC benchmark results (Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation, 2012). Additionally, both studies generate their instances similar to our random generation setting with same sizes. In small-sized instances the performance of Bazgan et al. (2009)’s algorithm is better than our approach. The difference between CPU times decreases with the increase in instance size. When n
                        =110, Algorithm 1 outperforms Bazgan et al. (2009)’s algorithm. Figueira et al. (2010) solve knapsack instances up to 20 with p
                        =3–7. For p
                        =3 and p
                        =4 Algorithm 1 outperforms Figueira et al. (2010)’s algorithm. However, for large values of p, their algorithm performs better.

The formulation consists of p objective functions where all objective coefficients are nonnegative integers. The decision variable x
                        
                           rl
                         takes a value of one if agent r is assigned to task l. Eq. (7) represents the set of objective functions where each minimizes total assignment cost with different cost coefficients. Eq. (8) ensures that each agent is assigned to exactly one task, and similarly Eq. (9) guarantees that each task is assigned to exactly one agent. Eq. (10) is the binary integrality constraints.

Test problem instances for the multiobjective assignment problem are formed in sizes varying from 5 to 50 with increments of 5 and p is set equal to 3. The objective function coefficients are randomly generated integers in the interval [1, 20]. The test problems are generated with the same parameters given in Przybylski, Gandibleux, and Ehrgott (2010), and this is the only study that considers the multiobjective assignment problem for more than two objective functions. Przybylski et al. (2010) generalize the two-phase method presented by Ulungu and Teghem (1995) for the p
                        >2 case. The number of models solved and CPU times of each method for the multiobjective assignment problem instances are given in Table 3.

As seen in Table 3, the number of nondominated solutions is increasing more rapidly compared to knapsack instances. The performance difference between Özlen and Azizoglu’s algorithm and Algorithm 1 is not as much as it is for the knapsack problem. Nevertheless, the proposed method is almost twice as fast as Özlen and Azizoglu’s algorithm in all instances. The number of models solved per nondominated solution is 1.45 on average while the maximum is 1.79.

As a side remark, we note that the performance of Özlen and Azizoglu’s algorithm is highly affected by the distance between y
                        
                           I
                         and y
                        
                           U
                         due to its search mechanism. This distance is smaller in assignment instances compared to knapsack instances. Therefore, their algorithm has a poorer performance in knapsack instances, but Algorithm 1 is not affected by the variations in objective function value ranges. Another observation is that their algorithm may sometimes deliver weakly efficient solutions. We believe this might be due numerical issues associated with the “near zero” objective function coefficients that can be observed in the augmented part when the objective function value ranges are large because these coefficients are inversely proportional to the product of the ranges. In one knapsack instance, the total number of such points is found to be 91. No such assignment problem instances were encountered.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have proposed an algorithm to solve multiobjective discrete optimization problems with any number of objective functions. We showed that the algorithm can generate the entire nondominated set in a finite number of steps. Our method uses the well-established ε-constraint scalarization and is based on a partitioning mechanism that searches the (p
                     −1)-dimensional constraint space exhaustively. The proposed method is compared with previous algorithms, and is seen to outperform all of them on the experimented problem instances. The number of models solved per nondominated solution may be a better comparison criterion for the scalarization methods than the computation time statistics. The proposed algorithm solved at most 1.99 subproblems per nondominated solution on the test problems. This ratio is highly competitive compared to previous studies. Nevertheless, as problem size increases and the number of nondominated solutions grows, the requirements of the approach become unrealistically high. To be able to solve such instances, heuristic modifications can be explored. More specifically, modifications that can generate representations of the nondominated set with desired quality guarantees remain as future work.
