@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Quantitative assessment of the tissue relaxation time has several applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [1], including the detection of superparamagnetic iron oxides [2] and the characterization of myocardial tissue in several pathologic conditions such as myocardial edema [3]. Inverse correlation between T2 and T2⁎ values and the iron content was fully demonstrated [4,5], and T2⁎ relaxometry represents the only widely available, non-invasive methodology for cardiac, hepatic, and pancreatic iron overload (IO) assessment in patients with primary or secondary hemochromatosis [6–8]. To calculate the relaxation time, the MRI signal is monitored by acquiring images at several echo times (TEs) and the measured signal decay is fitted to a mathematic model.

Two main approaches have been proposed to fit the signal decay to the model: region-of-interest (ROI) approach and pixel-wise approach. In the ROI-based fit, the signal values of all the pixels within a ROI are averaged for each TE and the fitting is performed on the averaged decay curve, leading to a single relaxation time value taken as representative of the whole ROI. The procedure can be iterated among several ROIs to assess the spatial distribution of the T2/T2⁎ values, such as in the eight liver segments [9] or in the 16 left ventricle (LV) wall segments to obtain standardized LV segmentation [10,11]. The main advantage of the ROI-based approach is the increase of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the decay curve that improves the fitting quality. Moreover, as one or few fitting operations are performed, the processing time is low and the fitting quality can be visually assessed by plotting the decay curve together with the model.

In the pixel-wise approach, the fitting is performed on the signal decay curves extracted from each pixel, yielding a complete relaxation time map. The obtained map allows for the visualization of the T2/T2⁎ distribution with the same spatial resolution of the acquired images. To obtain a relaxation time measurement from a defined district, a ROI is defined on the map and the T2/T2⁎ value of the ROI is obtained by computing the mean or the median of the T2⁎ values inside the ROI. In the pixel-wise approach, the T2/T2⁎ variations can be assessed with pixel-size resolution, exposing focal areas of artifact or pathology that might be missed using a ROI-based approach. The primary drawbacks of the pixel-wise approach are that it is computationally intensive, as the fitting operation must be performed for each pixel, and that the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio for each individual decay curve is relatively poor. The difference in measurements performed by the ROI-based and pixel-wise approaches was demonstrated to be clinically irrelevant if the same signal decay model is adopted [12–14].

The simplest decay model adopted in the relaxation time computation is a pure exponential decay. The adoption of this model overcomes some of the drawbacks of the pixel-wise approach, allowing for the direct computation of the relaxation time value by a linear fitting of the logarithm of the signal [15]. The use of a simple two-parameter model also improves the convergence of the fitting algorithm in presence of a low SNR. However, the single exponential decay model is adequate only if the SNR is high enough at all TEs to neglect the background signal associated with the MR noise [16]. This condition is generally satisfied in quantitative T2 studies, as the T2 value in tissues is typically large. In T2⁎ relaxometry, at low T2⁎ relaxation times the signal at later TEs may collapse on the background MR signal, leading to a large T2⁎ overestimation error [12,13]. Two main approaches were proposed in the literature to address this issue. The first approach (truncation model) consists of manually limiting the mono-exponential equation to few echo times [17]. The second approach consists of a non-linear fitting of the signal to an exponential plus a constant offset model that compensates for the noise plateau [12]. A more recent study includes the Rician distribution of the MRI noise in the fitting model. The method could improve the fitting procedure performance when the noise component is dominant, as in liver images of patients with severe iron overload [18]. Truncation and offset models were well validated in ROI-based analysis, but they present important issues in T2⁎ map generation as the manual truncation of the pixel-related decay curves is impractical due to the number of curves to be processed and the need for the non-linear fitting of the pixel-wise decay curves will dramatically increase the processing time. In this study we propose a method for T2⁎ map generation that exploits a linear fitting algorithm with automatic truncation of later TEs for low T2⁎ values. The method was validated on a generated synthetic phantom mimicking real MR data and on thalassemia major patients with different levels of iron overload.

Images from 60 patients (34 males, age 29.4±6.8 yrs) enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia (MIOT) network [6,19] were retrospectively analyzed. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All patients involved gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.

Cardiac MR acquisition followed a previously published protocol [6]. Briefly, multislice multiecho T2⁎ MR was performed using a 1.5-T MR scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) at the MIOT network core-lab. An eight-element cardiac phased-array receiver surface coil was used for signal reception. Three parallel short-axis views (basal, middle, and apical) of the left ventricle were obtained by a T2⁎ GRE, ECG triggered, multiecho sequence [10]. Each single short-axis view was acquired at ten echo times (2.0–22ms, with an echo spacing of 2.26ms) in a single end-expiratory breath hold to ensure image alignment. The acquisition time covered the end-diastolic phase, which was when the heart motion can be negligible. The image analysis procedure employed in the MIOT network (HIPPO MIOT software) [10] involved the calculation of segmental T2⁎ values in the left ventricle wall following the AHA 16-segments standardization [20]. The global heart T2⁎ value was obtained by averaging all segmental T2⁎ values and the T2⁎ value in the mid-ventricular septum was obtained by averaging T2⁎ values in the mid-anterior septum and the mid-inferior septum. Segmental T2⁎ values were calculated by ROI-based analysis and fitted to a pure exponential model with manual truncation. On the basing of the global T2⁎ value, three groups of 20 thalassemia major patients each were identified using the T2⁎ value thresholds adopted in clinical practice [21]: patients with no myocardial iron overload (MIO) (global T2⁎ value >20ms), patients with mild to moderate MIO (global T2⁎ value between 20 and 10ms), and patients with severe MIO (global T2⁎ value <10ms).

As the true relaxivity value in tissues is generally unknown, a synthetic phantom was developed in order to assess the accuracy of the algorithm examined in this study. The synthetic phantom was composed by a sequence of images mimicking real signal intensities of myocardial tissue at different TEs using the patients’ data set involved in the study as base of knowledge for the realization of the model. To generate the sequence, each pixel in the image was characterized by its T2⁎ value and S0 value, where S0 was defined as the theoretical MR signal value at TE=0. The S0 value was randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation (SD) inferred from measurements on real MR images of the patients. Signal decay in tissues was modeled by a pure exponential: S=S0 exp (–TE/T2⁎) and sampled at N echo times. Generalized Rician noise was simulated for an 8-channel coil, with noise statistics inferred from measurements in the background of MR images of the patients [22]. The resulting signals were approximated to the nearest integer value to meet the DICOM format specifications used in real MR images. Hence, the developed phantom was able to simulate realistic decay curves dependent upon imposed T2⁎ and image background SD values.

The process for T2⁎ map computation is schematized in 
                        Fig. 1. The relaxation time map computation follows an iterative process and includes three main steps. At the beginning of the procedure, each image pixel is classified as “in process” and the related signal decay curve is extracted (Fig. 1a). In the first step (background filtering, Fig. 1b), a procedure described in the following tests if the pixel should be classified as a background pixel (i.e., a pixel without a significant MR signal) or not. The background pixels are marked as “background pixels”, a conventional T2⁎ value (e.g., 0) is written in the T2⁎ map, and are no further processing occurred. If the pixel is not classified as background, then step 2 is executed (Fig. 1c). The relaxivity value of the pixel is then computed, exploiting the whole range of the TE samples, by fitting the decay curve extracted from the pixel with an appropriate model and by computing the fitting error (Fig. 1d). A threshold (E
                        
                           max
                        ) for the fitting error is defined and, based upon the fitting error, the pixel is classified as “processed” (if the fitting error is below E
                        
                           max
                        ) or it then remains in the “in process” state (if the fitting quality is unacceptable). If the “processed” state is reached, the T2⁎ value of the pixel is written in the T2⁎ map (Fig. 1e). If the pixel is still “in process”, the last TE sample is excluded and the relaxivity value computation is performed again (Fig. 1f). The procedure is iterated until the fitting error becomes lower than the E
                        
                           max
                         value (the pixel state moves to “processed” and the T2⁎ value is added to the map) or the number of used TEs is equal to three. If the pixel is still in the “in process” state at the end of step 2, then step 3 is executed (Fig. 1g) to assign a relaxivity value at the pixel (i.e., the “best” T2⁎ value depending upon the fitting error that will explained in the following).

After the step 1, the “in process” pixel set will correspond to the “non-background” pixels. At the end of the iterative procedure, all non-background pixels will have a relaxivity value assigned.

The objective of the first step is to exclude background pixels from the computation of the relaxivity map. The signal of the background pixel is dominated by noise, so it would be expected to be low and piecewise linear among the TEs. In these pixels, the fitting operation would fail, as the signal does not follow the decay model, and unpredictable values would be generated. Hence, background pixels should be excluded from the computation of the relaxivity map to save computation time and to improve the final map appearance. A conventional value (e.g., 0) is assigned to the background pixel depending upon the color map used in the visualization. To exclude background pixels, an appropriate threshold

                        2) where N is the number of TEs.

After T2⁎ estimation by the WLSL algorithm, pixels are marked as “processed” or not based upon the fitting error that was computed as the normalized mean root square error (MRSQ) between the decay curve related to the current pixel and the optimal model found by the WLSL algorithm. If the fitting error is less than the E
                        
                           max
                         threshold, the pixel is classified as “processed”; if not, the pixel remains in the “to process” state, and its relaxivity value is recomputed in the next iteration. In the next iteration, the range of used TEs is modified excluding the last TE from computation. A minimum number of three TEs is preserved during the process, as the use of two TEs would always lead to a null fitting error. Hence, the maximum number of iterative steps is N−2.

At the end of the step 2, the “to process” pixel set may be not empty if any tried combination of TEs led to a fitting error greater than E
                        
                           max
                        . The relaxivity value of these pixels is set to the one corresponding to the TEs combination associated with the lower fitting error. To perform this task, the “optimal” relaxivity value for each pixel was recorded during the process when the fitting error reached its minimum on the specific pixel, even if the fitting error was higher than E

                        . This approach allows for the “best” relaxivity value to be stored at the end of the iterative process with no further fitting operations needed. Hence, the computational complexity of step 3 is negligible.

The maximum computational complexity of the proposed algorithm can be evaluated as:

                         is the number of image pixels and N the number of TEs. In fact in the worst case, if all of the pixels had proceeded to step 3, the WLSL algorithm is applied N−2 times to a decay curve of decreasing dimension for each pixel.

A simplified version of the previously described process can be applied to the analysis of decay curves extracted from a ROI by averaging the MR signal value in the ROI for each TE sample. As the selection of the ROI is typically done manually, a test for the background signal can be avoided and only step 2 and step 3 (if needed) have to be performed.


                        
                        Fig. 2 depicts the progression of the developed procedure applied to an image set from a patient with severe cardiac IO (myocardial T2⁎ value approximately 4.5ms). The first row (#TEs=10) reports the results of the procedure at the first iteration of the second step, where the background region is identified and the T2⁎ is computed by the WLSL algorithm exploiting all TEs. The T2⁎ values in the myocardium appear greatly overestimated (see the T2⁎ map with the rainbow color map) and the fitting error in the myocardium is high (more than 20%, see the fitting error map). The fitting error is instead acceptable in regions with high T2⁎ values, as blood pools. For comparison, the last column shows segmental T2⁎ values in the six cardiac segments and the logarithm of the decay curve related to the antero-septal segment as obtained by the HIPPO MIOT software used in clinical assessment of IO in the patient.

Clearly, the decay curve collapses early on the background noise, diverging from the mono-exponential decay. The linear fitting of the logarithm of the signal failed leading to a high fitting error. Note that the fitting error in the liver instead is low and the evaluation of the hepatic T2⁎ value (higher than the cardiac T2⁎ value in this patient) is correct at this point. The algorithm progress by decreasing the number of used TEs in the pixels with a high associated fitting error (#TEs=8, #TEs=6, #TEs=4 are shown). The corresponding ROI-based curves are shown in the last column. At the final step (#TEs=3), the fitting error in the inner myocardium is low and the T2⁎ value was correctly evaluated.

The proposed algorithm was implemented in the IDL 8.2 environment (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA). Experiments were conducted on an iMac 1.3GHz dual-core Intel i5.

All data were analyzed using the Medcalc 12.7 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) statistical package. All continuous variables are expressed as the mean and standard deviation. The reproducibility of the measurements was calculated by the coefficient of variation (CoV), defined as the standard deviation of the differences divided by the mean and expressed as percentage. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman’s test. A two-tailed P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The effectiveness of the proposed method on providing the correct estimation of T2⁎ relaxation times was evaluated for four different noise values (σ=3, 5, 7.5, 10) and different fitting error thresholds E
                        
                           max
                         on the spectra of T2⁎ values of clinical interest (T2⁎ from 1ms to 60ms). TEs were imposed equal to the ones used in the clinical sequence for the assessment of hepatic and cardiac iron overload [6,24]. For each T2⁎ and σ values, 1000 realizations of the synthetic phantom were generated. The mean percent error in the T2⁎ assessment, the mean fitting error, the mean number of TEs used for the generation of the T2⁎ value, and the mean number of fitting operations executed were recorded among the realizations. 
                        Fig. 3 summarizes the simulation results. Fig. 3a shows the influence of the fitting error threshold E
                        
                           max
                         on the algorithm accuracy for a noise value of σ=3.0, which is similar to the value measured on patients’ images. The percent error in the T2⁎ computation is shown for different values of E
                        
                           max
                         (i.e., 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%). Fig. 3b reports the mean fitting error obtained for different E
                        
                           max
                         values. The mean SNR values of the myocardial tissue at the last TE ranged from 2.11±0.03 for T2⁎=2ms to 28.48±0.66 for T2⁎=60ms.

The imposed fitting error threshold E
                        
                           max
                         was obtained in almost all realizations, as the obtained fitting error was well below E
                        
                           max
                         for any threshold. Fig. 3c shows the mean number of TEs used to obtain the best fitting. Finally, Fig. 3d shows the processing time expressed as the mean number of fitting operations performed on a decay curve.


                        
                        Fig. 4 reports the influence of imposed noise on the performance of the proposed algorithm with two different values of E
                        
                           max
                        . In Fig. 4a and b, the precision of the T2⁎ value assessment and the processing time were reported at different noise and fitting threshold error values. The E
                        
                           max
                        =5% threshold appeared as being more robust in respect to the noise value and was used in the experiments with the patient images. Mean SNR values of the myocardial tissue at the last TE for the lowest (1ms) and a higher (60ms) T2⁎ values were 2.11±0.03 and 28.48±0.66, 2.04±0.02 and 17.27±0.45, 2.01±0.02 and 11.57±0.41, 1.97±0.03 and 8.65±0.66 for imposed noise SDs of 3.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, respectively.

The WLSL method is inherently suboptimal with respect to nonlinear least squares methods, as the logarithm transformation changes the distribution of the noise [15]. The WLSL was compared to LSL (weighted least square fitting of the signal logarithm) and NLLS (nonlinear least square fitting of the signal to the pure exponential decay model). Simulation results for imposed noise SD=5 and E
                        
                           max
                        =5% are reported in 
                        Fig. 5. Mean processing times for a phantom size of 256×256 were 2.53±0.21s, 3.15±0.24s, and 137.11±5.22s for WLSL, LSL and NLLS, respectively. Simulation results suggest that the WLSL algorithm can be safely used with an important reduction of the processing time.

As the true value of T2⁎ in patients is unknown, the validation on the patients’ data was conducted by comparing the measurement done with the proposed methodology with the ones performed by a validated software (HIPPO MIOT) [6,21] that integrated the T2⁎ map generation algorithm. As the HIPPO MIOT software adopts a ROI-based approach for the T2⁎ value estimation, the value provided by HIPPO MIOT in a ROI with manual truncation of the decay curves was compared with the mean and median of the T2⁎ values included in the same ROI in the T2⁎ map obtained with the proposed methodology. The median was used to exclude outliers, as suggested by several studies [5,14,25]. In the proposed mapping algorithm, the fitting error threshold E
                        
                           max
                         was fixed to 5% as suggested by phantom experiments. Compensation of the susceptibility artefact implemented in HIPPO MIOT software [10] was switched off during the comparison experiments.

The mean global T2⁎ values in the three patient groups were 6.96±2.39ms, 15.75±2.44ms, and 34.31±4.95ms for severe MIO, moderate to middle MIO, and no MIO groups, respectively. 
                        
                        Tables 1 and 2 summarize the T2⁎ measurement bias and the CoV and correlation values for different patient groups by using the median and mean of the pixel-wise T2⁎ values, respectively. The mean pixel-wise approach is associated with a greater bias and CoV with respect to the median pixel-wise approach. The CoV among the segments was always less than 10.0% (maximum 8.49% in patients with severe MIO, segment 15) if the median pixel-wise approach was used. Fig. 6 shows the Bland and Altman plots for global (Fig. 6a) and mid-septum (Fig. 6b) T2⁎ values by using the median pixel-wise approach.

The mean processing time for the map generation from patient images (256×256) was 2.58±0.02s. For comparison, map generation time by MRmap software [26] that implements a nonlinear fitting T2⁎ mapping was 56.47±0.11s on the same platform.

In the ROI-based analysis, the mid-septum, global and segmental T2⁎ values obtained by the HIPPO MIOT software with manual truncation of the decay curves were compared with corresponding T2⁎ values obtained by the proposed automatic procedure. 
                        Table 3 summarizes the results of the comparison. The CoV among the segments was always less than 10.0% (maximum 7.83% in patients with severe IO, segment 13).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Generation of the relaxation time maps is straightforward if the T2/T2⁎ values of interest are high enough with respect to the last TE used, leading to a high SNR at each TE sample. In this case, the signal decay can be correctly modeled with a pure exponential decay and the map elements can be directly calculated by the weighted least square fitting of the signal logarithm (WLSL) [15] with a good degree of precision and a short processing time [3,27]. Despite the fact that the WLSL is inherently suboptimal, simulation results confirmed that the performance of WLSL and nonlinear LS algorithms are comparable (Fig. 5) with an important reduction in processing time (approximately 50 times). If the SNR at some samples (typically the later ones) is low, the MR signal collapses in a signal plateau dependent upon a Rician distribution of MR noise [16]. Hence, the pure exponential decay assumption does not hold anymore and the WLSL method would produce incorrect results [28]. This problem is not common in T2 mapping where T2 values are generally high, but becomes relevant in T2⁎ mapping, especially in iron overload studies where the expected T2⁎ values in patients may reach few ms. As the overestimation of T2⁎ values using a pure exponential decay model is clinically relevant [17], correction strategies should be adopted in the generation of T2⁎ maps to cover the entire clinical range of T2⁎ values.

A possible solution is to adopt a more complete decay model including a constant that takes into account the signal plateau at later echoes [12]. With this approach, the T2⁎ value cannot be directly calculated by the WLSL method, but must be obtained by a nonlinear fitting algorithm, requiring a much higher processing time. As shown in this study, the processing time of a 256×256 cardiac image was approximately 60s using this approach as implemented in the MRmap software [26]. This processing time would be not acceptable in clinical practice, especially if a real-time generation of the T2⁎ map is needed. Heiberg et al. proposed a hybrid curve fitting method where, for low T2⁎ values, the residuals were weighted with the signal intensity, and, for high T2⁎ values, standard exponential fitting was used [29]. Meloni et al. proposed a “pseudo-pixelwise mapping” algorithm that divides a region of the image into non-contiguous groups of pixels sorted by rapid relative relaxivity estimates. Pixels within each group of like-relaxivity values were binned and fit using a Levenberg–Marquadt algorithm [30]. The algorithm was allowed to obtain a 30-folds reduction in the processing time with respect to the standard approach; however the processing time remains quite high (authors report less than 4s for a 6355pixel ROI, about ten times smaller with respect to the 256×256 image used in the present study).

In this study, we proposed to extend the truncation approach, which is widely used in ROI-based analysis of iron overload tissues in thalassemia patients [6,17] in the generation of T2⁎ maps. In the truncation approach, signal samples at later TEs are manually excluded from the analysis to reach a correct fit with the pure exponential model [17]. The use of a manual approach is reasonable on measurements performed on a single ROI [17] or in few ROIs [10], but need to be automatized in the generation of T2⁎ maps that involve thousands of fitting operations. In the developed method, background pixels are automatically excluded by the definition of an appropriate threshold from the image noise statistics, saving processing time and improving map appearance. The decay curves extracted from non-background pixels are fitted to a pure exponential model by the WLSL method exploiting the whole TE range. If the fitting error is below a defined threshold, the calculated T2⁎ value is written in the map; conversely the fitting procedure is iterated truncating the decay curve until an acceptable fitting is reached. If a fitting error below the threshold is not reached for any combination of TEs, the T2⁎ value associated with the lower error is written in the map. The proposed method is similar in principle to the automatic decay curve truncation method proposed by He et al. [31] that adopted a threshold of 0.995 for the R
                     2 value obtained by a nonlinear LS fitting. The He et al. approach was successfully validated in ROI-based T2⁎ measurements in the mid-ventricular septum in thalassemia patients. Our method extends the automatic truncation to full T2⁎ map generation thanks to the adoption of the WLSL method that is much faster with respect to the nonlinear fitting used in the He et al. study. Moreover, in the He et al. method, the automatic truncation procedure is performed only below a fixed T2⁎ value (20ms) in order to avoid the erroneous truncation of well-defined curves corrupted by artefacts or noise. This assumption depends on the collection of TEs used in the acquisition (maximum TE of approximately 20m), so the method may be not extendable to different TE ranges. In our method, the only critical parameter to define is the fitting error threshold that is adopted in the procedure. A too low threshold would lead to iterations in the fitting procedure, even in pixels where signal truncation is not needed. A too high threshold would lead to the accepting of incorrect T2⁎ values. To assess the correct threshold value, the precision of the proposed algorithm with respect to the fitting error threshold was assessed by synthetic phantom experiments (Fig. 3a). The error was generally very low (less than 3%) with the exception of very low T2⁎ values, where the used TE collection was inadequate in capturing the fast decay of the signal [12,32]. In fact, if the first two TEs are too long, most of the MRI signal will have irreversibly disappeared and the T2⁎ measurement becomes inconsistent. The simulation results were in agreement with the “rule of thumb” where the shortest measurable T2⁎ is approximately 1.4 times lower than the shortest TE 
                     [32]. As expected, the minimum of the error was reached at approximately 20m, while for higher T2⁎ values the error increased due to the incomplete coverage of the signal decay by the used TEs [32]. In fact, in cardiac imaging, the maximum practical TE is approximately 20m to avoid motion artefacts, while the longest TE should ideally be approximately 2-times longer than the T2⁎ value to be measured. A different behavior was noticed in the 1% threshold experiment, where a larger error at high T2⁎ values was measured. This finding can be explained by looking at Fig. 3c, which reports the mean number of TEs used to obtain the best fit for different thresholds. The whole TE range (i.e., 10 TEs) was exploited in the computation of relatively high T2⁎ values (T2⁎>10ms) in all cases, with the exception of the 1% threshold experiment. If the fitting error threshold is too low, the imposed threshold may force the algorithm to explore the whole range of TEs in many cases, as confirmed by Fig. 3d. In some of these cases, the algorithm may be “trapped” in a local minimum in a 3-TE combination, where the first three signal values were almost aligned and the fitting error was very low but the resulting T2⁎ value was dramatically wrong. Fig. 3d also suggests that the use of a too low fitting error threshold will be associated with a noticeable increase in processing time. As shown in Fig. 4a, the precision of the algorithm depends upon the noise value, as the 3% threshold test outperformed the 5% threshold test at low noise values while the opposite held at high noise values. The “overfitting” phenomena seen for the 1% threshold algorithm at σ=3 becomes evident for the 3% threshold algorithm at σ=7.5 and led to a relevant T2⁎ measurement error at σ=10. The processing time measurement reflected the same behavior (Fig. 4b). The 5% threshold algorithm appeared to be the more robust with respect to noise, providing an acceptable precision over the whole range of expected noise values, also assuring a lower processing time. The optimal threshold was evaluated for the established imaging technique widely used in the clinical practice that employed an 8-channel phased array coil [6,7]. If a different coil and/or parallel imaging are used in the acquisition, the image noise would change [33], modifying the optimal threshold. The measured processing time on a standard PC was approximately 2.5s for a 256×256 image, approximately 25 times lower than the standard non-linear fitting approach.

Comparison of cardiac T2⁎ values obtained by the proposed algorithm and measured by a validated computer-assisted procedure was shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 8. The assessment of T2⁎ segmental values allowed for the experimentation of the algorithm performances in regions with different levels of artefacts [10]. A significant correlation was found between pixel-wise T2⁎ measurement and ROI-based measurements for the whole range of T2⁎ values of clinical interest in iron overload assessment. Mean-pixel-wise T2⁎ measurements were consistently higher with respect to the ROI-based measurements over the entire T2⁎ range. This finding confirms the results of Ferguson et al. with the heart [25] but are in contrast with results from Marro et al. with the liver [34]. Both of these studies exploits a decay model (exponential plus plateau) different from the one (pure exponential with truncation) used in the present work. Median-pixel-wise measurements (Table 1) showed a lower difference with respect to the ROI-based measurements with a mixed pattern (low underestimation at low T2⁎ values and overestimation at high T2⁎ values). The underestimation at the mid septum level in patients with no iron overload is consistent with the results of Ferguson et al. [25]. The lower reproducibility at higher T2⁎ values could be explained by the fact that inter-sequence and inter-machine agreement reduces for cardiac T2⁎ values longer than 20m [6,7] due to the too low maximum TE value as previously described. Anyway, the proposed procedure appears to be quite accurate in the entire clinically relevant range. Table 3 and Fig. 6 report the results of the comparison of cardiac T2⁎ values obtained by ROI-based adopted in the clinical practice and the automatic truncation procedure inferred from the proposed algorithm. The CoV between the automatic and manual measurement was fully comparable with the inter-observer variability of the manual truncation model [17], confirming the possibility of using the proposed approach in clinical practice. The CoV in the mid-ventricular septum was slightly higher with respect to the automatic truncation method proposed by He et al. [31]. It should be noted that in the work of He et al., the septum ROI was set up exactly at the same position in the manual and automated analysis, while in the present study the two observers independently drew the myocardial contours. This may explain the higher measured CoV. The CoV in the global heart analysis was lower with respect to the mid-septum analysis, confirming previously published results [6]. CoV in the cardiac segments was slightly higher, but always lower than 10%.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The proposed method has proven to be effective in producing T2⁎ maps in a short time for the entire range of T2⁎ values of clinical interest. T2⁎ value measurements were consistent with those of expert readings. The proposed method allows to safely and accurately apply fast T2⁎ mapping in quantifying MIO iron deposition in iron overload patients. Therefore this approach could be easily incorporated into T2⁎ analysis software to be spread into the clinical arena for the development of a fully automated myocardial tissue iron quantification.
