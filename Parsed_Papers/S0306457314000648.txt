                  This paper proposes a novel query expansion method to improve accuracy of text retrieval systems. Our method makes use of a minimal relevance feedback to expand the initial query with a structured representation composed of weighted pairs of words. Such a structure is obtained from the relevance feedback through a method for pairs of words selection based on the Probabilistic Topic Model. We compared our method with other baseline query expansion schemes and methods. Evaluations performed on TREC-8 demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the baseline.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most retrieval systems show relative weaknesses in retrieving relevant documents, especially when few keywords are used to model user information needs. Information retrieval models, that have been proposed through the years, often rely on the bag of words model for document and query representation and can be grouped into three main categories: set-theoretic (including boolean), algebraic and probabilistic models (Christopher, Manning, & Schtze, 2008; Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). It is well known that the “bag of words” model assumes both documents and queries representable as feature vectors. The elements of such vectors can indicate the presence (or absence) of a word or take into account its occurrence frequency, but the information about the position of that word within the document is completely lost (Christopher et al., 2008); then, the elements of the vector are simply weights computed in different ways. In this context, the relevance of a document to a query can be measured as the distance between the corresponding vector representations in the space of features.

It has been found that common users are used to perform short queries, 2 or 3 words on average (Jansen, Spink, & Saracevic, 2000; Jansen, Booth, & Spink, 2008). Unfortunately, the shortness of a query can cause common information retrieval systems failures due to the inherent ambiguity of language (polysemy, etc.). Since most text retrieval systems relying on a term-frequency based index generally suffer from low precision (or low quality document retrieval), a typical solution adopted to reduce this query/document mismatch is expanding the initial query using words or phrases with a similar meaning or some other statistical relation to the set of relevant documents (Carpineto, de Mori, Romano, & Bigi, 2001): this strategy is often referred as query expansion.

In this work we propose a query expansion method that automatically extracts a set of Weighted Word Pairs from a set of topic-related documents provided by the relevance feedback. Such a structured set of terms is obtained by using a method of term extraction previously investigated in Colace, De Santo, Greco, and Napoletano (2013, 2014), Clarizia, Greco, and Napoletano (2011) and based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) implemented as the Probabilistic Topic Model (Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2007).

Evaluation has been conducted on TREC-8 repository. We compared the proposed Weighted Word Pairs (WWP) with a method for term extraction based on the Kullback Leibler divergency (Carpineto et al., 2001). Our approach achieves overall better performances and demonstrates that a structured feature representation has a greater discriminating power than a feature vector made of weighted words.

According to the Information Retrieval (IR) theory, the representation of queries and documents is based on the Vector Space Model (Christopher et al., 2008): a document or query is a vector of weighted words belonging to a vocabulary

                      respectively.

Performance of IR systems can be improved by expanding the initial query with other topics-related terms. These query expansion terms can be manually typed or extracted from feedback documents selected by the user himself (explicit relevance feedback) or automatically chosen by the system (pseudo-relevance feedback) (Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).

A general query expansion framework is a modular system including one or several instances, properly chained, of the following modules: Information Retrieval (IR), Feedback (F), Feature Extraction (FE), Query Reformulation (QR).

A general scheme is represented in Fig. 1
                         and can be explained as follows. Let us consider a generic IR system and a collection of indexed documents 
                           
                              D
                           
                        . The user performs a search in the IR system by typing a query 
                           
                              q
                           
                        . The IR system computes the relevance of each document of the corpus with respect to the query through the Eq. (1). As a result of the search, a set of ranked documents

The query expansion framework described above is quite general. We can use any of the existing IR systems, as well as any of the existing methods of feature extraction, etc. According to this framework, we can make objective comparisons between different system configurations. In this paper we propose a new method of query expansion that use a set of structured features extracted from a minimal relevance feedback. We considered two different open source IR systems: Apache Lucene (Foundation, 2011) that supports structured query based on a weighted boolean model, and the Indri Lemur Toolkit (Ogilvie et al., 2002) that supports an extended set of probabilistic structured query operators based on Inquery. Moreover we compared our feature extraction method with one in the state of the art by considering both the explicit and the pseudo-relevance feedback schemes.

The idea of taking advantage of additional knowledge to retrieve relevant documents has been largely discussed in the literature, where manual, interactive and automatic techniques have been proposed (Efthimiadis, 1996; Christopher et al., 2008; Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Carpineto & Romano, 2012; Na, Kang, Roh, & Lee, 2005).

A better specialization of the query can be obtained with additional knowledge, which is typically extracted from exogenous (e.g. ontology, WordNet, data mining) or endogenous knowledge (i.e. extracted only from the documents contained in the collection) (Bhogal, Macfarlane, & Smith, 2007; Christopher et al., 2008).

In this work we focus mainly on those query expansion techniques which make use of the relevance feedback. We can distinguish between three types of procedures for relevance assignment: explicit feedback, implicit feedback, and pseudo feedback (Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). The feedback is usually obtained from assessors and indicates the relevance degree for a document retrieved in response to a query. If the assessors know that the provided feedback will be used as a relevance judgment then the feedback is called explicit. Implicit feedback is otherwise inferred from user behavior: it takes into account which documents they do and do not select for viewing, the duration of time spent viewing a document, or page browsing or scrolling actions. Pseudo relevance feedback (or blind feedback) assumes that the top “n” ranked documents obtained after performing the initial query are relevant: this approach is generally used in automatic systems.

Since human labeling task is enormously boring and time consuming (Ko & Seo, 2009), most existing methods make use of pseudo relevance feedback. Nevertheless, fully automatic methods can exhibit low performance when the initial query is intrinsically ambiguous. As a consequence, in recent years, some hybrid techniques have been developed which take into account a minimal explicit human feedback (Okabe & Yamada, 2007; Dumais, Joachims, Bharat, & Weigend, 2003) and use it to automatically identify other topic related documents. Such methods uses many documents as feedback, about 40, and achieve a mean average precision of about 30% (Okabe & Yamada, 2007). We will show that the proposed method achieves the same performance of hybrid techniques but using the same minimal explicit feedback.

Whatever the technique that selects the set of documents representing the feedback, the expanded terms are usually computed by making use of well known approaches for term selection as Rocchio, Robertson, CHI-Square, Kullback–Lieber, etc. (Carpineto et al., 2001; Carpineto & Romano, 2012; Cao, Nie, Gao, & Robertson, 2008). In this case the reformulated query consists in a simple (sometimes weighted) list of words.

Although such term selection methods have proven their effectiveness in terms of accuracy and computational cost, several more complex alternative methods have been proposed, which consider the extraction of a structured set of words instead of simple list of them: a weighted set of clauses combined with suitable operators (Callan, Croft, & Harding, 1992; Collins-Thompson & Callan, 2005; Lang, Metzler, Wang, & Li, 2010; Metzler & Croft, 2007).

Others propose methods based on language modeling to integrate several contextual factors in order to adapt document ranking to the specific query context (Bai & Nie, 2008) or to integrate term relationships Bai, Song, Bruza, Nie, and Cao, 2005. The latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been extensively used in information retrieval, especially for term correlations computing Park and Ramamohanarao, 2009.

Furthermore, several existing term selection methods use language models combined with exogenous knowledge, like thesaurus(Cao, Nie, & Bai, 2005), wordnet (Zhang, Deng, & Li, 2009; Pinto, Martinez, & Perez-Sanjulian, 2008) or ontology (Bhogal, Macfarlane, & Smith, 2007).

We define a 
                           
                              root
                           
                         as a special word of the vocabulary

                                    Ω

                        . Following this model, each word of the vocabulary can be a possible root. In our model we consider a small number of roots, 
                           
                              H
                              ≪

                         selecting them according to the highest occurrence probability. The choice for the number H is made after a parameter tuning stage. As we will see later in the paper, when the number of documents is small, usually H is equal to 4 or 5.

To compute the probability of each root given the remaining words of the vocabulary, we introduce a graphical simplification. For each root, let us consider a directed acyclic graph (dag) that describes the relations between a root

Once the H roots have been selected, we have H dags. Starting from these dags we build undirected graphs (ugs) by considering the undirected relations between roots and words instead of directed relations. The ugs are described by the following probabilities:

Moreover, we build an undirected graph ug between the H roots, see Fig. 3b. Such a graph describes all the possible associations between pairs of roots. The probabilities associated to this graph are:

The scope of the query expansion is to add some topic related terms to the initial query. If we use the Weighted Word Pairs to expand the query we have to add 19,806 pairs of words that would be not efficient. For this reason, we perform an optimization stage to reduce the total number of pairs. We set a boundary condition of the optimization procedure by considering a maximum number of pairs equal to

The optimization stage, in addition to reduce the number of pairs, allows to neglect weakly related pairs according to a fitness function which is discussed in Appendix A. In particular, our optimization strategy, given the number of roots H and the desired max number of pairs

A graphical depiction of the WWP is showed in Fig. 3d. In practice this graph is a reduced version of the graph showed in Fig. 3c. Furthermore, in Fig. 4
                         we show the WWP extracted from the topic 402 of TREC-8 “Behavioral genetics”, while in Table 1
                         we show its tabular representation. Double circle represents roots while single circle represents simple words. Dotted lines stand for relations between roots and words, while solid lines stand for relations between roots.

In Algorithm 1 we show the pseudo-code of the procedure for graph building. Each function recalled in the pseudo-code has been described above.

Once the optimal WWP structure has been extracted from the feedback documents, it must be translated into an expanded query. This process, according to Fig. 1, is called query reformulation and is carried out by considering a WWP graph (Fig. 4) as a simple set of Weighted Word Pairs (see tabular representation of a WWP in Table 1). In fact, at this stage there is no more need to distinguish between roots and simple words, although this hierarchical distinction was fundamental for the structure building process. Note that the query reformulation process depends on the IR system considered.

There are several open source libraries providing full-text search features. We have chosen Apache Lucene (Foundation, 2011) and Lemur Project (Ogilvie et al., 2002) since they handle complex query expansions through custom boolean weighted models. Considering Lucene as IR (Foundation, 2011), the WWP plain representation (Table 1) is translated according to Lucene boolean model as follows:

Every word pair is searched with a Lucene boost factor chosen as the corresponding WWP weight 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                                 
                                    ij
                                 
                              
                           
                        , while the initial query is added with unitary boost factor (default).

When Lemur is used as IR module, WWP plain representation is translated into an expanded query using Indri query language as follows:
                           
                              
                                 #weight(0.50 #combine(behavioral genetics) 0.50 #weight(0.029 #band(condit behavior) 0.055 #band(studi behavior) ….

Lemur toolkit (Ogilvie et al., 2002) provides belief operators which allow to combine beliefs (scores) about terms, phrases, etc. There are both unweighted and weighted belief operators. With the weighted operators, weights can be assigned to certain expressions in order to control how much of an impact each expression within the query has on the final score.

The performance comparisons have been carried out testing the following FE/IR configurations:

                              IR only. Unexpanded queries has been performed using first Lucene and then Lemur as IR modules. Results obtained in these cases are referred as baseline.

                              IR. Kullback Leibler Divergency (Carpineto et al., 2001) based feature extraction method has been used to expand initial query and feed Lucene and Lemur IR modules. Both explicit and pseudo-relevance feedback schemes have been used.

We used the TREC-8 collections (minus the Congressional Record) for performance evaluation. The dataset contains about 520,000 news documents on 50 topics (No. 401–450) and relevance judgements for the topics. Table 2
                         shows the number of relevant judged documents for each topic of the dataset. Word stopping and word stemming with single keyword indexing have been performed. Query terms for each topic’s initial search (baseline) have been obtained by parsing the title field of a topic. For the baseline and for the first pass ranking (needed for feedback document selection) the default similarity measures provided by Lucene and Lemur have been used (Foundation, 2011; Ogilvie et al., 2002). Performance has been measured with TREC’s suggested evaluation measures: precision at different levels of retrieved results (P5,10…1000), mean average precision (MAP), R-precision and binary preference (BPREF) (Christopher et al., 2008).

In the case of explicit feedback, we take the first M relevant documents from the result set returned by the system after the initial query. Documents are considered relevant or not relevant according to TREC dataset annotations. In contrast, in the case of pseudo-relevance feedback, we take the top M documents retrieved by the system in response to the initial query.

The most important parameters involved in the computation of a WWP structure are the number of roots H, the number of pairs 
                        
                           
                              |
                              G
                              |
                           
                         and the number of relevant documents M.

We have chosen the number of roots 
                           
                              H
                              =
                              4
                           
                         as a trade off between retrieval performances and computation time
                           1
                           Results have been obtained using an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.40GHz PC with 4GB RAM with no other process running.

                         (see Table 3
                        ).

To choose the number M of relevant documents and the number 
                           
                              |

                         of pairs, we evaluated the mean average precision (map) achieved by varying at the same time M and 
                           
                              |

                        . Fig. 5
                         reveals the relationship between those parameters. In particular, given the number of relevant documents, the performance of the proposed method rapidly increases as number of pairs or increases. The performance increases even when the number of pairs is fixed and number of documents increases, but with a slower speed then the previous case.

However, the highest map values (lightest gray) are obtained only when both, number of documents and pairs, increase. On the contrary, the lowest map value is obtained when both number of documents and pairs are set to zero, that is at the origin of Fig. 5. The origin corresponds to the case of unexpanded query. For the experimentation, we have chosen the values that obtained highest performance, that is: 
                           
                              M
                              =
                              3
                           
                         and 
                           
                              |
                              G
                              |
                              =
                              50
                           
                        .

Note that, the map values showed in Fig. 5 have been obtained with Lucene, but a similar behavior can be observed for Lemur.


                           Table 4
                            shows the comparison between the performance achieved by the WWP method and the random WWP. The table reports results obtained with both the IR modules, Lucene and Lemur. The random WWP has been obtained by skipping the step 1 of the WWP building process. The probabilities

                            and

                            are randomly set instead of being computed by using the LDA. This test allows to evaluate the reliability of the relations computations with respect to a completely random choice. As can be noted from Table 4, WWP global performance is higher (more than 50%) than the random graph one.

In Table 5
                            we show results obtained comparing the WWP method with a Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) based query expansion method (Carpineto et al., 2001) and the baseline. The table reports results obtained with both the IR modules, Lucene and Lemur. As we can see, WWP outperforms KLD and baseline especially for low level of precisions. The improvement of performance is more evident when using Lucene instead of Lemur. These results have obtained without removing feedback documents from the dataset, which is a common behavior for text retrieval systems. However, one could argue that a big improvement in low level precision is essentially due to the feedback documents that have been better ranked thanks to the use of the query expansion. Therefore, another performance evaluation has been carried out using only the residual collection (RSD), where the feedback documents have been removed. Results for this evaluation are shown in Table 6
                           . It can be noticed that the WWP method achieves better global performance even in the case of residual collection with respect to the other methods.

An average precision analysis for each topic when using Lucene and Lemur IR has been also reported in this work (Figs. 6 and 7
                           
                           ). The bar charts allow higher values to hide lower ones so that we can easily identify cases where WWP performs worse than KLD and/or baseline. For example, Fig. 6 shows that the use of an unexpanded query on Lucene for topic 423 achieves better average precision performance than both KLD and WWP. In this case, the use of expanded terms seems to introduce noise in the retrieval task. A similar consideration can be done for Lemur. This analysis demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms other methods in most of the considered query/topics independently of the IR system.

Note that, when Lemur is used (Fig. 7), WWP is able to achieve the best performance in terms of average precision for topic 423 but here we find some issues for topic 430. We observe in some cases that the use of query expansion can have the drawback of reducing performances. Such a behavior can be due to different factors, so that some considerations need to be made. First of all, if we check the number of judged relevant documents available for each topic (Fig. 2), we realize that, for certain topics, such a number is very small compared to the size of the whole dataset. Moreover, not every document in the considered dataset has been judged and there is a large subset of negative examples (document judged as non-relevant) which our system does not take into account to build the graph.

In Table 7
                            we show the performance obtained by WWP, KLD and baseline in the case of pseudo relevance feedback. As can be noticed, WWP outperforms the other methods but achieves worse performance than the case of explicit feedback. In Table 8
                            we show the results obtained on the residual collection.

It is well known that the effectiveness of a pseudo relevance approach strictly depends on the quality of retrieved results in response to the initial query. Whatever is the term selection method, WWP or KLD, the relevance of the first M documents of the result set can highly compromise the performance of the system. Lucene and Lemur have low values of precision@10 for several topics that negatively influence performance in several topics as confirmed by the per-query analysis shown in Figs. 8 and 9
                           
                           .

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work we have demonstrated that a Weighted Word Pairs hierarchical representation is capable of retrieving a greater number of relevant documents than a less complex representation based on a list of words. These results suggest that our approach can be employed in all those text mining tasks that consider matching between patterns represented as textual information and in text categorization tasks as well as in sentiment analysis and detection tasks. The proposed approach computes the expanded queries considering only endogenous knowledge. It is well known that the use of external knowledge, for instance Word- Net, could clearly improve the accuracy of information retrieval systems and we consider this integration as a future work.
