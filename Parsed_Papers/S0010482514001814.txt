                  The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) play key roles in recognizing and binding various pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) resulting in the activation of downstream signaling and innate immunity. Therefore, identification of LRR motifs is very important to study ligand–receptor interaction. To date, available resources pose restrictions including both false negative and false positive prediction of LRR motifs from the primary protein sequence as their algorithms are relied either only on sequence based comparison or alignment techniques or are over biased for a particular LRR containing protein family. Therefore, to minimize the error (≤5%) and to identify a maximum number of LRR motifs in the wide range of proteins, we have developed “LRRsearch” web-server using position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of 11 residue LRR-HCS (highly conserved segment) which are frequently observed motifs in the most divergent classes of LRR containing proteins. A data library of 421 proteins, distributed among five known NLR families has also been integrated with the “LRRsearch” for the rich user experience. The access to the “LRRsearch” program is freely available at http://www.lrrsearch.com/.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play essential role in innate immunity by recognizing different conserved microbial motifs viz., carbohydrates (lipopolysaccharide, mannose etc.), nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), peptides (flagellin), peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acids, N-formylmethionine, lipoproteins and glucans, collectively known as microbial/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs) [1,2]. PRRs are outspread in extracellular, membrane and cytoplasmic compartments and are classified according to their ligand specificity, function, localization and/or evolutionary relationships [3,4]. Functionally, PRRs are divided into two categories: endocytic PRRs and signaling PRRs [2]. Signaling PRRs include large families of membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) [3,5] and cytoplasmic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [4,6]. NLR family of receptors are typically featured with three characteristic domains: leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain [7] at the C-terminal, nucleotide-binding oligomerization (NOD) or NACHT domain [8] at the center and PYD (pyrin domain) [9,10]/CARD (caspase activation and recruitment domain) [11]/BIR (baculovirus ‘inhibitor of apoptosis’ repeat) domain [12] at the N-terminal end. LRR motifs are involved in ligand recognition, NACHT domain mediates self-regulation and oligomerization, and the PYD/CARD/BIR domain is responsible for signal transduction and activation of the inflammatory response [7].

LRRs form modular architectures in more than 6000 proteins, sharing a common structure composed of repeating 20–40 amino acid stretches that are usually rich in the hydrophobic amino acid leucine [13]. In the NLR family, all LRRs comprised of a highly conserved segment (HCS) and a variable segment (VS). The HCS consisted of an 11 residues stretch, LxxLxLxxNxL, in which “L” is Leu/Ile/Val/Phe, “N” stands for Asn/Thr/Ser/Cys and “x” denotes any amino acids [14]. Depending on the variability of length and residue conservation in the VS part, eight classes of LRR subfamilies have been proposed: viz., ‘RI-like (RI)’, ‘Cysteine-containing (CC)’, ‘Bacterial (S)’, ‘SDS22-like (SDS22)’, ‘Plant-specific (PS)’, ‘Typical (T)’, ‘Treponema pallidum (Tp)’ and ‘CD42b-like (CD42b)’ [14–16]. In the NLR, identification of LRR domains is crucial for assessing ligand–receptor interaction, binding site analysis and functional characterization [7,13,14]. To detect LRR, currently available web-resources like SMART [17], Pfam [18], PROSITE [19], InterPro [20] are based on sequence alignment with previously known LRRs [13], Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Support Vector Machine (SVM). Several reports described the structural insights of LRR domains in various PRRs following above methods [21–23]. However, all of these methods could not find the most divergent LRR domain, and thus needed cumbersome manual efforts to identify all LRR motifs.

To overcome these difficulties and to minimize the error in manual prediction, we have developed an application “LRRsearch” which is expected to be better and accurate in predicting most of the LRR domains. The important feature of “LRRsearch” is based on searching the 11 residue LRR-HCS region which is highly conserved across various species. In addition, “LRRsearch” is also incorporated with a non-redundant NLR protein database, “NLRdb”, to provide an easy-to-access information resource of different proteins in the NLR family across various species. In this study, we describe and evaluate an optimized LRR scanning methodology to identify maximum LRR motifs with high efficiency which can be employed in domain-search application.

To create NLRdb, a non-redundant NLR protein family database, publicly available NLR sequences were retrieved from both UniProt Knowledgebase (http://www.uniprot.org/) and NCBI protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). All possible key words, NOD-like receptor, NOD like receptor, NLR, NLRA, NLRB1, NLRC, NLRP and NLRX1 [24,25] were used to access maximum coverage of NLR proteins from those databases. To avoid data redundancy, foremost sequence alignment was performed manually using ClustalW2 program [26] with sequences having more than one entry and duplicate small fragments were eliminated easily in this way. With the remaining part which didn׳t give any clue in sequence alignment, BLASTP program [27,28] was performed by taking each sequence one by one. Three parameters, E value, Query coverage and Max identity, were checked for each individual and a sequence with maximum value in each of these parameters was taken as the representative one and the remaining sequences were discarded. Thus a non-redundant dataset of NLR proteins (Supplementary Table 1) was organized and valuable information like gene name, length, organism name, taxonomic details, database source and sequence information were constituted for each entry. Currently the database has information of about 421 NLR proteins (
                        Table 1).

The NLR database (NLRdb) followed a 3-tier architecture developed on a MVC (Model View Controller) framework with standard coding adherence. The application was hosted on Apache server, PHP as the server side scripting language and MYSQL as backend database. Client side scripting includes XHTML, Java Script and CSS. Besides, AJAX was used for a rich user experience with faster page execution. The database was hosted on 64 bit windows 2008 Server. A flow chart depicting the methodology and the process used in construction of NLRdb is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 1.

Identification of different LRR motifs was carried out from two different sources. At first, all non-redundant NLR protein sequences from NLRdb were annotated semi-automatically in different web-services like SMART [17], Pfam [18] and PROSITE [19], and all probable LRR motifs detected through these applications were drawn out. Then, entire LRR motif sequences were retrieved from LRRML database [16]. After combining all these data, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was carried out in MEGA 5.0 [29] to get a snapshot of the conserved HCS regions. The 11 amino acid “typical”, “bacterial”, “RI-like”, “SDS-like”, “plant-specific” and “CD42b” LRR-HCS were selected over its 12 residue “cysteine-containing” and “Treponema pallidum” counterpart and were taken out from the primary motifs. These secondary 11 residue stretch motif sequences were kept in FASTA format and CD-HIT [30–33] was used to remove sequences showing 100% sequence identity. It was carried out to prevent overpopulating the matrix with same LRR-HCS sequences, and thus 2341 LRR-HCS were identified as unique at their sequence level.

LRRsearch was based on PSSM, constructed by transforming the frequency of each amino acid at each position of 11 residue LRR-HCS motifs using simple logarithm (Supplementary Fig. 1). When all site specific counts were greater than zero, each elements in the PSSM, designated by PSSM

                        , was calculated as

The input sequence was further fragmented from first to last position using an 11 residue sliding window and each fragment was scored using the matrix file. The probability of each 11 residue fragment was further calculated from the PSSM score (Eq. (3)) [34].

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The NLRdb was configured using relational database management system which was a collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables from which data could be accessed or reassembled in many different ways. A web interface was included with the system to allow user to consult the database and to display the results in an interactive way. The client-server architecture allowed the system to run in a central server and could be used simultaneously by any number of client machines. The database had two main cores: list of families and sub-families, and an LRR motif finding tool: “LRRsearch”.

Users could easily browse the database by choosing the specific family and corresponding subfamily (if any) from the drop-down list. The result page (
                        Fig. 3) represented the list of proteins under the particular group. The “Details” option provided a quick and simple access to the protein details which included four key attributes: “Protein Information”, “Organism Details”, “Database Information”, and “Sequence Information”. “Protein Information” included name and alternative name (if any) of the protein, expressed gene name, protein length and NLR family and subfamily classification details. “Organism Details” contained scientific name of the source organism which was further linked to UniProt taxonomy database. Database source and Reference ID that was either Accession Number or UniProtKB ID were kept under “Database Information” to provide a direct access to the details available from the particular database. “Sequence Information” allowed user to get information about the sequence status and protein existence.

Potential LRR motifs existing in a LRR containing protein were predicted by LRRsearch. LRRsearch accepted protein sequence only in raw format. The submitted protein sequence was processed and significant LRR-HCS motifs with ≤5% false discovery rate were displayed in the tabulated form.

LRRsearch result was classified in three different sections (
                        Fig. 4): protein information, LRR prediction and sequence annotation. Protein information provided the knowledge about the protein length and the approximate molecular weight of that protein in kilodalton (kDa) from the user defined sequence. LRR prediction was the important section which gave the details of predicted LRR-HCS motifs presented in the submitted sequence in a tabular form. The predicted LRR-HCSs were arranged in ascending order according to their positional distribution. The last section provided a graphical representation of the predicted LRR-HCSs by highlighting those patterns in the primary sequence.

LRRsearch provided a platform for specific characterization of LRR motifs in simple, accurate and well distributed manner. LRRsearch could cover most divergent classes of LRRs containing proteins by identifying 11 residue LRR-HCS motif. The performance proficiency of LRRsearch over other available web resources was compared with 30 random LRR containing proteins (
                        Table 2), and it showed that LRRsearch identified LRR motifs most efficiently in NLR proteins than other tools. The accuracy of LRRsearch was further affirmed by comparing its predicted outcome with previously known structural data of NOD1 [23], NLRP3 [36], and NOD2 [37]. In each case, LRRsearch׳s predictions supported the structural information of LRR region in these three different NLR proteins (
                        Fig. 5).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This article describes about a new tool “LRRsearch” that provides a platform for more accurate and efficient prediction of LRR motifs in the wide variety of proteins. It is likely to be very useful to track the conserved 11 residue LRR-HCS which are most frequently observed motif in LRR containing proteins, and thus “LRRsearch” can cover most divergent classes of LRRs. With this tool, a database dedicated to NOD-like receptor proteins (NLRdb) representing freely available data of various web resources has been added. The “LRRsearch” is supported by an easy-to-use web interface that suits with most graphical web browsers, and is likely to be an information source for the investigators involved in both theoretical and applied research on LRR containing proteins, and is available freely at http://www.lrrsearch.com/.
