                  Iridium(III)bis(4,6-(difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2′)picolinate (Firpic) is one typical bluish-green phosphor widely used in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). In order to optimize its electroluminescent performance, 3,6-(di-tert-butyl)carbazolyl was introduced into the pyridine ring of the 2,4-difluorophenyl-pyridine ligand via a non-conjugated CH2 linkage. The generated 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-((6-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pridine-3-yl)methyl)-9H-carbazole (Cz-CH2-dfppy) was used as cyclometalating ligand to prepare iridium complex 1, (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic). In comparison with the case to attach carbazole directly on pyridine, this non-conjugated CH2 linking strategy avoids the unwanted bathochromic shift of the phosphorescence and improves the solubility of the iridium complex. (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) (1) was used as doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by both spin-coating and vacuum evaporation methods. Efficient bluish-green electrophosphorescence was obtained with maximum luminance efficiency of 22cd/A (14lm/W, 8.7%) and 26cd/A (12lm/W, 9.5%) for the solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices, respectively, which far exceed those of the parent Firpic based device. The improved performance for (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) was interpreted in terms of improved charge balance brought by the presence of the carbazole groups in the ligands.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Electrophosphorescent devices that contain transition-metal complexes have attracted much attention in recent years, as they can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to realize a theoretical internal quantum efficiency of 100% [1–3]. In particular, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes show high phosphorescent efficiencies and are one of the most important classes of phosphorescent dyes [4,5]. In order to reduce concentration quenching and triplet–triplet annihilation effects, the host–guest strategy is implemented by dispersing the guest into a suitable host at a relatively low concentration [6,7]. Over the past decade, the vacuum-deposited devices have attracted a great deal of attention for extremely high external efficiencies [8,9]. Recently, solution-processed PhOLEDs provided an economically attractive alternative to vacuum-deposited ones, which benefited from using large and bulky molecules or polymers as host or guest materials [10,11]. In the large molecular materials such as phosphorescent dendrimers, the surface groups and/or the dendrons control the processing and intermolecular interactions of the cores, which is responsible for the emission of light [12,13]. Nonetheless, the incorporation of the phosphorescent emitter with decorating groups through conjugated approaches usually causes a red shift in emission spectrum [14]. In order to keep the emission energy and wavelength, non-conjugated linkage between the emissive core and the decorating group is believed to be an ideal strategy that may have the advantage of being solution processable and to tune the optoelectronic properties of the target materials.

In this work, we report the synthesis and properties of the novel derivative of Firpic, (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) complex (1). tert-Butyl-carbazolyl was introduced via non-conjugated CH2 linkage [15] into the pyridyl ring in the difluorophenylpyridine (dfppy) ligand to tune the optical and electronic behavior of the resultant iridium complex 1. The electrochemical, photophysical properties of the complex 1 was investigated. Particularly, complex 1 was used as doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by both spin-coating and vacuum evaporation methods, and the Firpic-based devices with identical architectures also fabricated for comparison. The maximum luminance efficiency of 22cd/A (14lm/W, 8.7%) and 26cd/A (12lm/W, 9.5%) were realized for solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices of (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic), respectively, which far exceed those of the parent Firpic based device.

The synthetic route of the complex 1 is shown in Scheme 1
                     . First, the reaction of 2,4-difluorophenyl boronic acid with 2-bromo-4-methylpyridine in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst [16] produced the intermediate 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-methylpyridine, which was brominated with N-bromosucciniimde (NBS) in the presence of azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in CCl4 to give the 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(bromomethyl)pyridine. Then 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(bromomethyl)pyridine was then added dropwise into the solution of sodium hydride and 3,6-ditertbutylcarbazole in dimethylformamide [17] to form the ligand 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(ditertbutylcarbazolyl-methyl)pyridine. Next the target iridium complex was prepared following the standard two step procedure, i.e. the ligand first reacted with chloride trihydrate in 2-ethoxyethanol at high temperature and then the dichloro dimer intermediate was treated with picolinic acid in the presence of potassium carbonate in the 2-ethoxyethanol to give the final iridium complex 1 
                     [18].

The UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the complex 1 was measured in CH2Cl2 solution. The absorption and photoluminescence spectrum of Firpic was also measured for comparison. The electrochemical behaviors of the complex 1 and Firpic were measured in deoxygenated CH2Cl2 solutions containing 0.1M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as supporting electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry.

The organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were made and measured in the following way. The pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 30Ωsquare−1 were treated by UV-ozone for 20min. Then 40nm thick PEDOT:PSS film was first deposited on the ITO glass substrates, and baked at 120°C for 30min in air. For the solution-processed devices (device I), the emitting layer was obtained by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution of iridium complex dopant and a certain host at a doping concentration of 10wt%. Then, the substrate was transferred to the vacuum chamber for organic and metal deposition. For the evaporated devices (device II), all the organic layers were deposited by vacuum evaporation in the vacuum chamber with a base pressure less than 10−6
                     torr. The type I devices have the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/H1 (60wt%): OXD-7 (30wt%): 1 or Firpic (10wt%) (30nm)/TPBI (60nm)/LiF (1nm)/Al (200nm). The type II devices have the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/NPB (20nm)/mCP: 1 or Firpic (10wt%) (30nm)/TPBI (60nm)/LiF (1nm)/Al (200nm). Particularly, the host H1 employed in solution-processed devices was previously reported by Wang et al. [19]. These multi-layer devices and chemical structures of materials are shown in Fig. 1
                     . The emitting area of each pixel was determined by the overlap of both anode and cathode as 9mm2. The EL spectra, CIE coordinates and current density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics of the devices were measured with PR705 photometer and a source–measure-unit Keithley 236 under ambient conditions. The forward viewing external quantum efficiency (η
                     ext) was calculated using the luminance efficiency, EL spectra and human photopic sensitivity.

                     Fig. 2
                      illustrates the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of complexes 1 and Firpic. The absorption spectrum of the ligand was also measured for comparison in Fig. 2. Both the exhibit two major absorption bands in their absorption spectra. The intense absorption bands in the higher energy region (<400nm) are assigned to the spin-allowed ligand-centered 1π–π∗ transitions. The weak absorption bands tailing from 400 to 460nm should correspond to the excitations to the 1MLCT and 3MLCT, and the spin–orbit coupling enhanced 3π–π∗ states. Firpic shows intense room-temperature phosphorescence with emission maximum at 472nm. The phosphorescence of complex 1 is bluish-green with emission peak at 480nm, which is red shifted by 8nm relative to its parent Firpic. The quantum yield of complex 1 was determined as ca. 0.19 in relative to Ir(ppy)3 (Φ

                     g is the optical energy gap obtained from the absorption threshold of film samples) [20]. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of Firpic and complex 1 are −5.60eV/−2.97eV and −5.50eV/-2.91eV, respectively. Evidently, the introduction of carbazole groups in the cyclometalating ligands of iridium complex 1 raised both HOMO and LUMO levels. This is definitely favorable for an enhanced hole injection directly into the iridium complex when it is used as doped emitter in OLEDs.


                     Fig. 3
                      presents the current density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics and efficiency curves of the devices I and II. It is worth noting that the turn-on voltages V
                     on (voltage at the brightness of 1cdm−2) of complex 1 are lower than those of Firpic in both spin-coated and deposited devices. These results are consistent with the fact that the hole injection barrier into complex 1 (HOMO=−5.50eV) is lower than that into Firpic (HOMO=−5.60eV), which is definitely favorable for more efficient direct charge trapping on iridium dopant. Additionally, the device doped with complex 1 exhibited a higher current density than Firpic-based device at the same driving voltage. It is ascribed to the enhanced holes transportation ability of complex 1 due to the incorporation of the carbazole units. As revealed in Fig. 3a and b, the spin-coated device of Firpic have a turn-on voltage of 4.6V and a maximum brightness L
                     max of 2832cdm−2. The maximum luminance efficiency η
                     L and external quantum efficiency η
                     ext are 10cd/A and 4%. In comparison with Firpic, a tremendous efficiency improvement of 120% is realized for complex 1 with current efficiency η
                     L and external quantum efficiency η
                     ext up to 22cd/A and 8.7%. These efficiencies are comparable to the performance of Firpic-based electrophosphorescent devices fabricated by vacuum deposition. Fig. 3c and d depict the J–V–L characteristics and current efficiency curves of the vacuum-deposited devices of Firpic and complex 1. Similarly, the turn-on voltage of complex 1 at 5V is lower than that of Firpic at 6V. The Firpic-based device exhibited a maximum brightness of 23,990cdm−2 with maximum current efficiency and external efficiency of 18cd/A and 7%. The complex 1-based device show the maximum brightness of 20,780cdm−2, the maximum current efficiency and external efficiency of 26cd/A and 9.5%, being better than those of FIrpic. Table 1
                      summarizes the performance of the devices I and II. The outstanding performance of complex 1 in solution-processed device was attributed to the prominently improved solubility and the improved charge balance brought by the presence of the carbazole groups in the ligands. As summarized in Table 2, in accordance with the PL spectra, the EL spectra of complex 1 shows 5nm bathochromic shift (∼10nm bathochromic shift for shoulder peak) than the EL spectra of Firpic.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, we have synthesized a new bluish-green phosphorescent material, (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(picolinate) (1), containing carbazole groups through non-conjugated linkage in ligands. This non-conjugated linking strategy does not bring significant spectral shift to the iridium complex, but facilitates the peripheral carbazole units to play the hole-injecting and transporting functions. Complex 1 revealed superior electroluminance performance than the parent complex Firpic in both spin-coated and vaccum-deposited OLEDs. Furthermore, the performance of solution processed device is comparable to that of vacuum-deposited one. Efficient bluish-green electrophosphorescence was obtained with maximum luminance efficiency of 22cd/A (14lm/W, 8.7%) and 26cd/A (12lm/W, 9.5%) for solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices, respectively. The improved performance for complex 1 was interpreted in terms of improved charge balance brought by the presence of the carbazole groups in the ligands.
