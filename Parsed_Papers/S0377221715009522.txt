                  We design and implement a dynamic program for valuing corporate securities, seen as derivatives on a firm’s assets, and computing the term structure of yield spreads and default probabilities. Our setting is flexible for it accommodates an extended balance-sheet equality, arbitrary corporate debts, multiple seniority classes, and a reorganization process. This flexibility comes at the expense of a minor loss of efficiency. The analytical approach proposed in the literature is exchanged here for a quasi-analytical approach based on dynamic programming coupled with finite elements. To assess our construction, which shows flexibility and efficiency, we carry out a numerical investigation along with a complete sensitivity analysis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The option-based approach for valuing corporate bonds goes back to Merton (1974). He considers a model for a firm with a simple capital structure made of a pure bond and a common stock (equity). He interprets the stock as a European call option on the firm’s assets, whose value follows a geometric Brownian motion, as set by Black and Scholes (1973). The option’s expiry date and strike price are the bond’s maturity date and principal amount, respectively. Then, he evaluates the debt and equity in closed form. Merton’s pioneering paper has given rise to an extensive literature, known as the structural model, where corporate securities are expressed as derivatives on the firm’s asset value. The default event at a given payment date occurs when the state variable falls under a certain default barrier.


                     Black and Cox (1976) extend Merton’s model in two ways, and solve the structural model in closed form. They propose an exogenous default barrier to cover the pure bond’s holders against severe decreases on the firm’s asset value before maturity. They also consider uncovered bond portfolios made of a pure senior bond and a pure junior bond with the same maturity. Geske (1977) uses the theory of compound options, and further extends Merton’s model to arbitrary corporate-bond portfolios. However, his analytical approach remains questionable when the number of coupon dates increases. Leland (1994) considers a continuous coupon perpetuity, which results in a constant default barrier over time. Next, by maximizing the present value of equity, he solves for the so-called endogenous default barrier in closed form. He accounts for tax benefits under the survival event and bankruptcy costs under the default event. These frictions allow Leland to discuss the notions of maximum debt capacity and optimal capital structure. The latter is a break-down of the Modigliani–Miller conjecture, which states that, in pure and perfect capital markets, the firm’s asset value is independent of its capital structure.

The aim of this paper is to design and implement a unified dynamic-programming framework for valuing corporate securities and computing the term structure of yield spreads and default probabilities. This model extends Merton (1974), Black and Cox (1976), Geske (1977), and Leland (1994), for it accommodates arbitrary corporate debts, multiple seniority classes, payouts, tax benefits, bankruptcy costs, and a reorganization process. The latter is fulfilled through an augmentation of the state process, which now includes not only the firm’s asset value but also the number of grace periods called for by the firm before the current date. The reorganization and liquidation (default) barriers inferred at payment dates are completely endogenous, and follow from an optimal decision process. These extensions come at the expense of a minor loss of efficiency. The analytical approach of the above-mentioned authors is exchanged here for a quasi-analytical approach based on dynamic programming coupled with finite elements.

Further extensions to Merton’s seminal paper in the literature are twofold. The first research stream assumes a very simple firm’s capital structure and solves the structural model in closed form. Longstaff and Schwartz (1995), then Briys and de Varenne (1997), consider a pure bond in Black and Cox’ setting with a Gaussian risk-free rate. Their papers differ on the form of their exogenous default barriers. Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001) extend Longstaff and Schwartz’s setting
                      and allow for a Gaussian exogenous default barrier. Along the same lines, Hsu, Saá-Requejo, and Santa-Clara (2010) evaluate the pure bond in closed form when the firm’s asset value is completely independent from the risk-free rate, which moves as a square-root process. In case of dependence, they use Monte Carlo simulation for valuation purposes. Nivorozhkin (2005a; 2005b) introduce bankruptcy costs for uncovered bond portfolios in Black and Cox’ setting. Starting from Leland’s framework, Leland and Toft (1996) consider a finite-maturity coupon bond that is renewed as long as the firm’s survives. Chen and Kou (2009) exchange the pure-diffusion dynamics of the firm’s asset value of Leland and Toft for a double-exponential jump-diffusion process. Then, they evaluate the debt in closed form. Several authors extend the analytical approach to analyze reorganization processes, especially under Black and Cox-like settings (Abinzano, Seco, Escobar, & Olivares, 2009; Ericsson & Reneby, 1998) or Leland-like settings (Bruche & Naqvi, 2010; François & Morellec, 2004; Mella-Barral & Perraudin, 1997; Shibata & Tian, 2012).

The second research stream refers to numerical methods: numerical integration (Moraux, 2004), finite differences (Anderson, Sundaresan, & Tychon, 1996; Brennan & Schwartz, 1978; Fan & Sundaresan, 2000), binomial trees (Anderson & Sundaresan, 1996; Broadie, Chernov, & Sundaresan, 2007; Broadie & Kaya, 2007), dynamic programming (Annabi, Breton, & François, 2012a; 2012b), and Monte Carlo simulation (Galai, Raviv, & Wiener, 2007; Zhou, 2001). Except for Brennan and Schwartz (1978) and Zhou (2001), the rest of these papers consider reorganization processes. Our paper differs from this body of literature in that it handles an arbitrary debt portfolio and several endogenous barriers for monitoring the reorganization process, depending on the firm’s capital structure, debt seniority, and reorganization design. Most of these papers build on Black and Cox (1976) or Leland (1994) assumptions. Although Broadie et al. (2007) assume a cash-flow-based framework and a consol debt, their binomial tree resembles to our dynamic program in that it handles a double endogenous barrier. Finally, our model differs from Annabi et al. (2012a; 2012b) in two ways. Firstly, as claimed earlier, our setting accommodates arbitrary debt portfolios, while theirs assumes a continuous perpetuity. Secondly, our reorganization process focuses on the optimal number of grace periods a firm can call for, while theirs focuses on the negotiation in between claimholders under default.

Among other objectives, the structural model attempts to explain the observed yield spreads and default frequencies. Despite its parsimony, the simplest structural model (Merton, 1974) compares extremely well to the classic statistical approach for bankruptcy prediction (Hillegeist, Keating, Cram, & Lundstedt, 2004), and, to a lesser extent, to the neural-network approach (Aziz & Dar, 2006). A hybrid approach can be developed, where some of the statistical risk factors are inferred from the structural model, e.g. the distance to default (Benos & Papanastasopoulos, 2007). More complex structural models have further explained the observed yield spreads and default frequencies (Collin-Dufresne & Goldstein, 2001; Delianedis & Geske, 2001; 2003; Eom, Helwege, & Huang, 2004; Huang & Huang, 2012; Leland, 2004; Suo & Wang, 2006). According to Delianedis and Geske (2001), the most important components of credit risk are default, recovery, tax benefits, jumps, liquidity, and market factors.

On the one hand, closed-form solutions, where available, are obviously preferred to approximations. They are extremely efficient; they assure the highest accuracy at a very low computing time. Closed-form solutions explicitly link the unknown parameters to their input parameters and, thus, allow for a direct sensitivity analysis. However, they rely on very simplified assumptions. On the other hand, more realistic models are solved by means of numerical procedures. Our dynamic program is an acceptable compromise in terms of flexibility and efficiency.

Dynamic programming is widely used for modeling and solving several optimal Markov decision processes in finance. Examples include Kraft and Steffensen (2013) and Fu, Wei, and Yang (2014) for optimal portfolios and Gamba and Triantis (2008) for financial flexibilities.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and provides several properties of the debt- and equity-value functions, and Section 3 proposes a reorganization process. Section 4 is a numerical investigation, which replicates reported results from the literature and carries out a complete sensitivity analysis. Section 5 concludes. The dynamic program is resolved in the Appendix A.

                     the indicator function. For time-heterogenous Markov processes, the transition parameters also depend on t. These truncated moments can be seen as the minimum information required for the Markov process {A} to play the role of a state process. Ben-Ameur, Breton, and François (2006) use the transition tables T
                     0 and T
                     1 to evaluate installment options under the geometric Brownian motion assumption.

The conditions (1)–(2) accommodate a large family of pure-diffusion, jump-diffusion, and more general Markov processes. Examples include Zhou (2001) and Chen and Kou (2009), who develop under Gaussian and double-exponential jump diffusions, respectively. We focus herein on the geometric Brownian motion, which verifies

The literature reports two definitions for the notion of default probability,
                      one is unconditional and the other is conditional on late survival. The first, known as the total default probability up to time tn
                     , is

                     define the term structure of default probabilities, total and conditional respectively.

These default proportions can be computed under the risk-neutral or the physical probability measure. Delianedis and Geske (2003) claim that the differences over time in the risk-neutral default probabilities are powerful predictors of corporate bankruptcy. They ignore the drift parameter of the state process {A} under the physical probability measure, known to carry a high estimation sampling error. Although less rigorous, the (total) default probabilities are generally preferred to the conditional default probabilities. The reason lies in the fact that conditional default probabilities, given late survival, are informative only for the very near future. Later on, given survival at time tn

The quasi-closed-form solution in Proposition 3 is applicable for sub-models without tax benefits, when the process {A} is continuous; else, Monte Carlo simulation is used, given the default barriers

To date, we have assumed that a default is immediately followed by a liquidation. This contrasts with most of corporate bankruptcy laws; a reorganization process often
                      takes place before liquidation. The rational for a reorganization process is to partially discharge a firm under default in an attempt to extend its business life, save its job positions, and reinforce its future reimbursements and potentialities. Discharging the firm is usually reported in terms of grace periods and grace payments, which increases the present value of equity.

In the absence of frictions, that is, 
                        
                           
                              r

                     a reorganization process cannot result in a surplus. Thus, what is gained by a claimholder is lost by the other. The balance-sheet equality is

                     0 results in a decrease in D

                     remains constant. In this context, a reorganization process is viable since it allows the firm to share out the surplus between claimholders. We assume debtors-in-possession under reorganization and the strict priority rule under liquidation. Our setting is close to the court-supervised methods of bankruptcy resolution as opposed to private informal reorganization outside the court system.

Our reorganization design depends on two parameters,

We first compare
                      DP values to selected closed-form solutions in the literature, and show that DP is a viable alternative to the analytical approach. DP is flexible and efficient. Next, we perform a sensitivity analysis of main value functions with respect to their input parameters. The results are interpreted according to the corporate finance theory. Assume no payment at t

The code is written in the C language, compiled with the GCC compiler, and executed under Windows 7 and a laptop computer running with a speed of 2.5 GHz and a RAM of 6 Go. The GSL library (Galassi et al., 2009) is used to achieve specific computing tasks, and the CUBATURE software package (Hahn, 2005) to compute default probabilities. It is worth noticing that CPU times account for a fixed cost associated with the transition parameters and a linear cost associated with the backward recursion, and that the fixed cost is usually the highest.

                        Table 2 shows a clear convergence of DP values to their analytical (B&C) counterparts, as the DP grid size increases. The DP procedure shows accuracy at the sixth digit, while only four digits are reported. Default probabilities are mostly supported by junior bondholders.

Again, Table 3 shows a clear convergence of DP values to their analytical (Geske) counterparts, as the DP grid size increases. The DP procedure is still accurate at the sixth digit. For a grid size of

                        average CPU time per case is 1.92 seconds for D
                        0 and 1.98 seconds for the overall results. While default probabilities for the first year are significant, they collapse for the second year, given survival the first year. This fact characterizes the structural model.


                        Delianedis and Geske (2003) point out that default frequencies are more explained by the differences over
                         time in the risk-neutral default probabilities than by the default probabilities themselves. Thus, such an analysis should be done on a regular basis to keep track of the default probability movements over time.

Overall, DP is a viable alternative to the analytical approach not only because it shows convergence, robustness, and efficiency, but also for it shows great flexibility. DP allows one to perform realistic numerical and empirical investigations in a quasi-closed form.

To start with, we consider a coupon bond and, next, a corporate debt made up of a senior coupon bond and a junior coupon bond with a longer maturity. We conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the (junior) bond’s coupon rate c (in % per year) and, then, to the firm’s asset value 
                           
                              a

                        (in dollars). In all cases, when c increases or, equivalently, a decreases, ceteris paribus, the firm moves from a healthy to a distressed situation.

                        . The results show that, in the absence of frictions, the higher the coupon, the lower the equity and the higher the bond value, while the total value of the firm remains flat. The last result indicates that the total value of the firm, which reduces to its exogenous component, is independent of the firm’s capital structure. Thus, in the absence of frictions, the Modigliani–Miller conjecture holds.

The bond value is subject to two conflicting mechanics when the coupon increases. First, a higher coupon increases the bond’s future cash flows, and has a positive impact on the bond value. Second, a higher coupon increases the default probability, and has a negative impact on the bond value. In the absence of frictions, the overall impact of these two conflicting mechanics is positive; the first is dominant.

The bond’s required rate y (in percent per year) is unbounded, as a function of the bond’s coupon rate c (in percent per year), since it sets at zero the bond’s net present value, assuming that its promised cash flows occur with certainty:

                        0 is bounded.

Next, when the firm’s asset volatility σ rises, the equity value increases and the bond value decreases, while the total value of the firm remains constant. A substitution effect is possible in all cases, that is, shareholders benefit from any increase in the risk of the firm’s operations at the expense of bondholders. Thus, in the absence of frictions, bondholders must be protected by special covenants against a potential substitution effect.

Furthermore, the results suggest the following:

Finally, the firm’s default probability is an increasing function of the firm’s asset volatility σ for a healthy company, e.g., 
                           
                              c
                              =

                              percent
                           
                        per year, and a decreasing function for a distressed company, e.g., 
                           
                              c
                              =
                              12
                              
                              
                              percent
                           
                        per year. The last case is not reported in our analysis. This relationship is not monotone for intermediate coupon rates, e.g., 
                           
                              c
                              =
                              10
                              
                              percent
                           
                        per year.


                        Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, follow the same pattern as Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and represent a more realistic situation. We set 
                           
                              
                                 r

                              percent
                           
                        (per year) and 
                           
                              w
                              =
                              0.25
                           
                        . The equity value is still a decreasing function of the bond’s coupon. Conversely, in the presence of frictions, the bond value first increases, and then decreases. The optimum can be seen as the maximum debt capacityof the firm. Clearly, a position right of the optimum is suboptimal; the company agrees to pay a high coupon for a given debt, while a much lower coupon would suffice. Similarly, the total value of the firm first increases, and then decreases. The maximum represents the optimal capital structure. This result indicates that the total value of the firm depends on the firm’s capital structure. Thus, frictions break down the Modigliani–Miller conjecture.

This analysis triggers the following question: how far is a given public company from its maximum debt capacity and optimal capital structure? This question is not easy to answer in real life since the company is represented by a single point but not a complete curve. Combining the structural model and the statistical approach is probably the right way to address this important issue.

The bond value is still subject to two conflicting mechanics. An increase in the coupon rate results in an increase in the bond’s future cash flows as well as the default probability. Their overall impact is positive for low coupons, and negative for high coupons. The substitution effect is still feasible only for investment-grade bonds. For high-yield bonds, though, an increase in the risk of the firm’s operations, measured by σ, benefits both shareholders and bondholders. Protective covenants against the substitution effect are no longer valuable for bondholders under financial distress. The same two conflicting mechanics explain the shape of the tax-benefit and bankruptcy-cost curves.

                        (per year), the default probability becomes an increasing function of the firm’s asset volatility σ.

We also let the risk-free interest rate

                              percent

                        vary instead of the firm’s asset volatility σ. A relevant result is that, unlike riskless bonds, the value of a risky bond may be positively related to the risk-free interest rate. This is the case with high-yield bonds. Rather, investment-grade bonds behave as riskless bonds. This result is consistent with Longstaff and Schwartz (1995), but the explanation differs; the result arises more from frictions in a one-factor model than from market factor interactions in a two-factor model. Figures are available upon request from the authors.

We also consider a bond portfolio made up of a senior coupon bond and a junior coupon bond with a longer maturity. We report the values of corporate securities as functions of the junior coupon rate cj
                         (in percent per year), and, for each value function, we vary the bankruptcy-cost parameter ω ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5}. Equity, tax benefits, junior default barriers, and default probabilities do not depend on the bankruptcy-cost parameter ω. This is a direct consequence of the strict priority rule, which sets the equity value and tax benefits at zero whenever the firm defaults. The parameter ω plays the role of a sharing parameter under default. This result is consistent with Leland (1994). Figures are available upon request from the authors. Figs. 17, 18, 19, and 20 show that senior bondholders are almost always protected by junior bondholders, except for high levels of 
                           w
                        . Thus, for low and moderate levels of ω, costly junior debts do not alter senior bondholders’ position. Alternatively, when ωrises, senior default barriers and default probabilities converge to their junior counterparts, since, for high levels of 
                           
                              w
                              ,
                           
                        junior bondholders are never partially paid under default (see Table 1a).

The results suggest the following:

                        Figs. 21, 22, 23, and 24 follow the same pattern as the previous scenario, but report the value functions of corporate securities as functions of the firm’s asset value. The equity and bond value are both increasing. Leland (1994) claims that, in the presence of frictions, the equity value can switch to a concave function. We have searched for such a pattern without success. Unlike the equity value, the bonds’ values are bounded and convergent, as shown in Proposition 2,

                        and η. Thus, the solution of pb. (12) is always

                        . All in all, if the main objective is to increase equity value, forgive all the time at the maximum rate. This solution is feasible at the theoretical level since bondholders can adjust their prices consequently, but it is not at the practical level since it obviously results in severe conflicting situations. Although the solution is case sensitive, a general property arises from our sensitivity analysis. For a fixed grace rate η∈ [0; 1], the first call period has the most important impact on equity value. Then, the latter quickly saturates. The solution of pb. (14) is usually obtained at 
                           
                              
                                 g
                                 ¯
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                        . This result supports the shortening of the average time under the U.S. bankruptcy law from three years to one year (Sheppard, 1995). Alternatively, the solution of pb. (13)or pb. (14) is not always a corner solution. The optimal reorganization process of pb. (14) is attractive, but it comes up against the unobserved value function D
                        0(A
                        0). For each case, we set in bold the solutions to pb. (12)–(14).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We propose a general and flexible dynamic program, which accommodates an extended balance-sheet equality, arbitrary corporate debts, multiple seniority classes, and a reorganization process. The analytical approach proposed in the literature by Merton (1974), Black and Cox (1976), Geske (1977), and Leland (1994) is exchanged here for a quasi-analytical approach based on dynamic programming coupled with finite elements.

Our theoretical investigation provides several properties of the debt- and equity-value functions, and our numerical investigation shows complete consistency with the corporate finance literature. Examples discuss the substitution effect, maximum debt capacity, optimal capital structure, risk sharing between senior and junior bondholders, several limit properties, and optimal reorganization processes. DP shows flexibility and efficiency. More importantly, our setting can be used to achieve more realistic empirical credit-risk studies.

Future research avenues include the valuation of options embedded in corporate bonds (call, put, extension, and conversion), possibly notified in advance. Another related issue consists in analyzing financial flexibilities, as defined by Gamba and Triantis (2008), within the structural model. Moreover, a modification on the Markov state process allows one to capture the (additional) impact of random jumps on the term structure of yield spreads and default probabilities. The traditional geometric Brownian motion can indeed be exchanged for a Lévy process. Further extensions can be analyzed following Ballotta and Fusai (2015), where several dependent firms issue arbitrary debt portfolios. For a multi-dimensional state-space, the same methodology keeps working as long as the transition parameters can be computed in closed form. Parallel computing can be used to enhance the overall efficiency of the backward procedure since, at each decision date, the value functions are independently computed on the grid points, as shown in Eq. (A.1) in the Appendix A. The main problem is that, when the state-space dimension becomes high enough, we are no longer able to store the transition parameters in the computer. They cease to be a fixed cost and become a linear cost, which results in inacceptable computing times. This is one facet of the curse of dimensionality. The main strategy to bypass this major difficulty is to use random visits of the state space instead of systematic visits, and combine DP with Monte Carlo simulation instead of finite elements.

All value functions, just after a payment date, can be written as a sum of local future values multiplied by their associated transition parameters given the current position of the state process. This sum of small pieces is then discounted back at the risk-free rate. This dynamic program does respect the true dynamics of the state process {A} through the transition tables in Eqs. (1)–(2).

This procedure can be improved further by using the transition tables T
                     2 or T
                     2 and T
                     3, that is, mixing between the dynamic program and piecewise quadratic or cubic polynomials, but the gain in accuracy will mostly be offset by the loss in computing time.
