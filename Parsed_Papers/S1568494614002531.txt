               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, a parallel version of seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) is proposed for designing circular and concentric circular antenna arrays with the low sidelobe levels at a fixed beamwidth. The SOA is a relatively new evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the concept of simulating the act of humansâ€™ intelligent search with their memory, experience, and uncertainty reasoning. In this work, The SOA has been parallelized by benefiting from its dividable population form. The numerical results show that the design of circular and concentric circular antenna arrays using the parallel SOA provides good sidelobe levels with a fixed beamwidth. The quality of results obtained by the parallel SOA is checked by comparing with those of several evolutionary algorithms in the literature.
