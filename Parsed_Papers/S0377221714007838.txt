@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  We present a novel approach for practically tackling uncertainty in preference elicitation and predictive modeling to support complex multi-criteria decisions based on multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). A simplified two-step elicitation procedure consisting of an online survey and face-to-face interviews is followed by an extensive uncertainty analysis. This covers uncertainty of the preference components (marginal value and utility functions, hierarchical aggregation functions, aggregation parameters) and the attribute predictions. Context uncertainties about future socio-economic developments are captured by combining MAUT with scenario planning. We perform a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to assess the contribution of single uncertain preference parameters to the uncertainty of the ranking of alternatives. This is exemplified for sustainable water infrastructure planning in a case study in Switzerland. We compare 11 water supply alternatives ranging from conventional water supply systems to novel technologies and management schemes regarding 44 objectives. Their performance is assessed for four future scenarios and 10 stakeholders from different backgrounds and decision-making levels. Despite uncertainty in the ranking of alternatives, potential best and worst solutions could be identified. We demonstrate that a priori assumptions such as linear value functions or additive aggregation can result in misleading recommendations, unless thoroughly checked during preference elicitation and modeling. We suggest GSA to focus elicitation on most sensitive preference parameters. Our GSA results indicate that output uncertainty can be considerably reduced by additional elicitation of few parameters, e.g. the overall risk attitude and aggregation functions at higher-level nodes. Here, rough value function elicitation was sufficient, thereby substantially reducing elicitation time.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past decade, the number of applications of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and more specifically, multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) and multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) (e.g. Keeney, 1982; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993), has considerably increased in the environmental sciences (Ananda & Herath, 2009; Huang, Keisler, & Linkov, 2011). This is also the case in other disciplines (Wallenius et al., 2008). In MAUT applications, strong simplifying assumptions are often made to keep elicitation and modeling of preferences feasible given the available resources. Common simplifications are a) the choice of additive MAUT models (Hajkowicz, 2008; Hyde, Maier, & Colby, 2005; Joubert, Stewart, & Eberhard, 2003), b) use of linear marginal value functions (Raju & Vasan, 2007; Weber, 1987), c) assumption of risk neutrality, as well as d) neglecting uncertainty of model parameters (e.g. “weights”), attributes, and boundary conditions such as socio-economic change (Hyde, Maier, & Colby, 2004; Martin, Bender, & Shields, 2000; Torrance et al., 1996). The reasons are manifold, e.g. higher model comprehensibility for decision makers, time constraints, and the need for cognitively tiring repetitive assessments (Karvetski, Lambert, & Linkov, 2009a; Stewart, 1995), but often remain undisclosed. Although the necessity of a systematic consideration of uncertainty has been widely acknowledged in theory (e.g. Butler, Jia, & Dyer, 1997; Durbach & Stewart, 2011, 2012b; French, 2003; Kangas & Kangas, 2004; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; Stewart, 1995, 2005), it is commonly not considered in practice.

Different sources of uncertainty in MCDA are discussed in the literature. These cover uncertainties arising from (1) problem framing and structuring, (2) attribute prediction, and also (3) components of the preference model, i.e. in the case of MAVT and MAUT: (3a) the choice of hierarchical aggregation functions, (3b) the form of the marginal value/utility functions, and (3c) the corresponding aggregation parameters (“weights”). Furthermore, many of the commonly used preference elicitation techniques lack robustness towards biases (Bleichrodt, Pinto, & Wakker, 2001; Borcherding, Eppel, & von Winterfeldt, 1991; Morton & Fasolo, 2009; Weber & Borcherding, 1993), constituting an additional source of uncertainty.

By using the word “uncertainty” in this paper, we make no distinction between uncertainties elsewhere referred to as risk (known cause–effect, probabilistically quantifiable), uncertainty (known cause–effect, not probabilistically quantifiable), and ignorance (“deep uncertainty”, unknown cause–effect, not quantifiable). Other classifications distinguish between aleatory uncertainty (due to randomness, see risk) and epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of knowledge, sometimes quantifiable). Instead, we use the term uncertainty when referring to “knowledge gaps or ambiguities that affect our ability to understand the consequences of decisions” (Gregory et al., 2012, p. 127), i.e. the way it is used in common language.

                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Problem framing and structuring: Problem framing and structuring concerns the definition of the decision problem and boundary conditions, a stakeholder analysis to establish participation, and the development of the system of objectives and a set of alternatives for evaluation (Belton & Stewart, 2002; Keeney, 1982). Uncertainties arising from problem structuring are hardly quantifiable. People arrive at different decisions for the same problem dependent on the problem framing (Belton & Stewart, 2002; Morton & Fasolo, 2009). Different hierarchical structuring of the same system of objectives has been shown to affect the assigned weights (due to ``splitting bias'', e.g. Weber & Borcherding, 1993). Additionally, the number of identified fundamental objectives is linked to how well decision makers are supported during the formulation of fundamental objectives (Bond, Carlson, & Keeney, 2008, 2010). Thorough structuring is thus indispensable. An overview of structuring methods is given in e.g. Belton and Stewart (2010) and Franco and Montibeller (2011). A growing trend in MCDA is to address uncertainties about future framework boundary conditions that are beyond the influence of decision makers with scenario analysis (e.g. Goodwin & Wright, 2001; Montibeller, Gummer, & Tumidei, 2006; Stewart, French, & Rios, 2013).


                                 Attribute prediction: The sources of uncertainty about the attribute levels of each decision alternative depend on the assessment process. Uncertainty can arise from the imprecision of quantitative elicitation and formulation of expert estimates which is prone to biases (Ayyub, 2001; Cooke, 1991; Kynn, 2008; O'Hagan et al., 2006). It can also stem from the uncertainty of model predictions such as uncertainty of model input/structure/parameters (see e.g. French, 1995; Refsgaard, van der Sluijs, Højberg, & Vanrolleghem, 2007; Walker et al., 2003).


                                 Hierarchical aggregation function: The multi-attribute value or utility function is typically structured hierarchically (see later example, Fig. 1
                                 ). The value or utility of the main objective depends on lower-level utility or value functions. These may directly depend on the attributes (“marginal utility or value functions”) or indirectly through intermediate aggregation functions. The uncertainty about the hierarchical aggregation function is governed by the lack of knowledge about which independence conditions are satisfied by the decision maker's preferences (Eisenführ, Weber, & Langer, 2010; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993), and the precision of other aggregation model parameters. The additive, multiplicative, and multi-linear models are presented in Keeney and Raiffa (1993). The first requires mutual preferential independence, additive independence, and either difference independence (for values) or mutual utility independence (for utilities) to hold (Eisenführ et al., 2010). The second model does not require additive independence. The third model requires the weakest assumptions, but easily becomes infeasible due to non-identifiability of its parameters (Stewart, 2005). Other less common models are the Cobb–Douglas model (i.e. the weighted geometric mean, originally suggested as a production function but later also used in the current context; Cobb & Douglas, 1928), minimum-models, or mixtures of these (e.g. Langhans, Lienert, Schuwirth, & Reichert, 2013; Langhans, Reichert, & Schuwirth, 2014; Schuwirth, Reichert, & Lienert, 2012).


                                 Marginal (“single-attribute”) value or utility functions: Uncertainty about the shape of value and utility functions also arises from the imprecision of preferences, as well as inconsistencies and elicitation biases. Following von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947), in Eisenführ et al. (2010) and Dyer and Sarin (1979), we differentiate between (measurable) value functions and (ordinal) utility functions. Value functions describe preferences regarding sure attribute outcomes. Utility functions are used to rank “risky” attribute outcomes (the uncertainty of which is quantifiable by probability distributions). Utility functions are either directly elicited (Hershey & Schoemaker, 1985; Wakker & Deneffe, 1996) or obtained from converting value functions to utility functions given a specific intrinsic risk attitude (Dyer & Sarin, 1982). Again, several biases are known. For assigning values: scope insensitivity and reference point effects (e.g. Morton & Fasolo, 2009), and for the assessment of utilities (Bleichrodt et al., 2001; Cox, Sadiraj, Vogt, & Dasgupta, 2012; Eisenführ et al., 2010): non-linear weighting of probabilities (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), ambiguity aversion (Ellsberg paradox; Ellsberg, 1961), and certainty effects (Allais paradox; Allais, 1953). In the absence of bias-free elicitation methods, some have questioned the use of expected utility theory (e.g. Abdellaoui, Bleichrodt, & Paraschiv, 2007;Cox et al., 2012; Rabin, 2000; Schmidt, Starmer, & Sugden, 2008). Others developed approaches to correct for biases (Bleichrodt et al., 2001) or simply accept some degree of descriptive deviation from theory in prescriptive decision analyses (e.g. French, 2003; Stewart, 2005).


                                 Aggregation parameters (“weights”): Uncertainty and imprecision of the weights are related to the articulated accuracy and consistency of judgments (Jessop, 2011). The elicitation of weights is prone to biases, such as the splitting bias, range effect, and hierarchical effects (Morton & Fasolo, 2009; Weber & Borcherding, 1993). Comparing four weight elicitation methods, Borcherding et al. (1991) judge none to be internally more consistent or less biased than the others, and suggest doing more consistency checks. Mustajoki et al. (2005) and Jessop (2011) argue that the assumption of exact weights imposes a precision not represented by the stakeholder's preferences and recommend using imprecise or interval weights instead. Using imprecise weights also reduces inconsistencies within and between elicitation methods. Hierarchical elicitation (e.g. Pöyhönen, Vrolijk, & Hämäläinen, 2001) and ex post corrections (Jacobi & Hobbs, 2007) have been suggested to minimize the splitting bias.

Although often interchangeably used, the term uncertainty analysis refers to the quantification of model output uncertainty through propagation of uncertainty of model parameters and inputs (French, 2003), and sensitivity analysis to “the study of how uncertainty in the output […] can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input” (Saltelli, Tarantola, Campolongo, & Ratto, 2004). Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) allows inputs to vary according to a given probability distribution, whereas local sensitivity analysis (LSA) uses a linearization of the model at a pre-defined point in parameter space (Saltelli, 2008). Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses address a range of modeling-related questions (e.g. French, 2003; Saltelli, 2008). Two of them are of particular interest to decision making: (1) How does the ranking of alternatives change, given the uncertainty of preference model inputs and (2) how strong is the influence of individual factors (to focus elicitation and modeling on reducing uncertainty that matters)?

In MAVT and MAUT, uncertainty and local sensitivity analyses are much more commonly performed than global sensitivity analyses (Gómez Delgado & Bosque Sendra, 2004; Saltelli, Ratto, Tarantola, & Campolongo, 2006; Saltelli, Tarantola, & Chan, 1999a). GSA has been suggested to support decision makers in the analysis of results from MCDA studies (Mustajoki, Hämälainen, & Lindstedt, 2006; Saltelli et al., 1999a), but only applied in few cases (e.g. solid waste management: Gómez Delgado & Tarantola, 2006). The vast majority of available uncertainty and sensitivity analyses focusses on the uncertainty of the weights (e.g. Butler et al., 1997; Hyde et al., 2005; Jessop, 2011; Jiménez, Ríos-Insua, & Mateos, 2006; Mustajoki, 2012; Mustajoki et al., 2006; Raju & Pillai, 1999) or a combination of aggregation parameters and attributes (e.g. Gómez Delgado & Bosque Sendra, 2004; Gómez Delgado & Tarantola, 2006; Hyde et al., 2004; Saltelli et al., 1999a). Zhou and Ang (2009) consider weights and two multi-attribute aggregation methods. Simulation studies by Stewart (2005) and Durbach and Stewart (2009, 2012a) assess the impact of hierarchical value und utility model simplifications under different marginal utility curvatures, degrees of imprecision in preference statements, and attributes among other aspects. Schuwirth et al. (2012) perform a LSA over changes of the weights, marginal value functions, risk attitudes for conversion to utilities, and the attributes. Another methodology for tackling uncertainty of the weights and marginal utility function curvatures is “Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis” (SMAA; see e.g. Lahdelma, Hokkanen, & Salminen, 1998; Lahdelma & Salminen, 2012). SMAA is a simulation approach for determining which preference combinations would lead specific alternatives to rank best without requiring the decision makers’ preferences to be known. The model structure only allows compensatory (additive) aggregation and risk neutral (value functions identical to utility functions) preferences.

The planning of urban water supply infrastructures is an ideal application field for MAUT because it not only involves many, conflictive objectives and stakeholders, but also because of the high interactions with other systems, its long asset life times, and uncertain future development of main drivers of its performance. Urban water supply infrastructures in industrialized countries are mainly centralized treatment and piped distribution systems, which ensure a continuous supply of drinking water for households, industries, businesses, and public use (e.g. street-cleaning, public green space). They are facing a number of dynamic challenges such as urbanization and population development, aging and need of rehabilitation, climate variability, as well as a highly dynamic socio-economic and socio-political environment (Ferguson, Frantzeskaki, & Brown, 2013; Ruth, Bernier, Jollands, & Golubiewski, 2007; Sharma, Burn, Gardner, & Gregory, 2010). For a thorough planning of these water infrastructures, long-term changes and large uncertainties of drivers such as water availability, water demand, population and spatial development, and economic development need to be considered. Technically, transitions to more decentralized infrastructures (e.g. rainwater harvesting, or water treatment and reuse in households) are suggested to ensure flexible adaptation to future changes and increase sustainability (Sharma et al., 2010; Wong & Brown, 2009). Additionally, alternative forms of utility governance can be chosen, e.g. regionalization or (partial) privatization to achieve higher efficiency and professionalism (Dominguez, Worch, Markard, Trujillo Alvarez, & Gujer, 2009; Lieberherr, Klinke, & Finger, 2012). In contrast to this, the reality of today's water infrastructure planning is often judged inflexible, narrow-minded, and negligent of future uncertainties, broader goals, important stakeholders, and alternative paths of action (Ashley et al., 2008; Dominguez et al., 2009; Economides, 2012; Ferguson et al., 2013; Störmer et al., 2009).

The objective of this paper is to show how to practically tackle uncertainty in elicitation and modeling of MAUT preferences. Our approach is developed and tested in a case study on sustainable water infrastructure planning in Switzerland. It is part of a larger study on water supply and sanitation planning introduced in Lienert et al. (2014a) . We use this case study to exemplify our approach, and present the results for water supply. This includes the elicitation of preferences of 10 stakeholders, which were selected based on an earlier stakeholder analysis (Lienert, Schnetzer, & Ingold, 2013). To address the challenges of long-term infrastructure planning under uncertainty, the MCDA is combined with scenario planning. The study is guided by three main questions:

                           
                              1.
                              How can multiple sources of uncertainty in MAUT be comprehensively considered during elicitation and analysis of preferences?

Which uncertain preference parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the ranking of alternatives, and how does this contribution change under different modeling assumptions?

What are the stakeholders’ preferences regarding “good water supply infrastructure”, and which water supply alternatives can be recommended given different future scenarios?

The case study and methods are presented in Section 2. Of the above mentioned sources of uncertainty, the sources from (2) to (5) are quantitatively described. The uncertainty from framing and structuring (1), was considered by systematic structuring and framing within individual interviews and workshops (see Lienert et al., 2013; Lienert et al., 2014a), and preference elicitation including consistency checks. In Section 3 we present the elicited preferences, attribute predictions, and resulting rankings of alternatives including uncertainty for four future scenarios. The results of the global sensitivity analysis for one exemplary stakeholder are shown in Section 4. The results from Sections 3 and 4 are discussed in Section 5 and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

The “Mönchaltorfer Aa” region is a rural area near Zurich, Switzerland. Four municipalities (approx. 24,200 inhabitants) and five local water suppliers participated in the case study. Water infrastructures are either run by municipalities or cooperatives. Part of the water is imported from a regional cooperative. Despite an overall perception of high levels of service, supply security, and good water quality, some doubts about the long-term planning of the water supply system prevail.


                           Lienert et al. (2013) identified 41 important actors for water and wastewater infrastructure planning, 29 of which are either shared between both sectors or are relevant to water supply only. Out of these, 10 were selected to participate in the MCDA, eight of which were nominated based on their importance for water supply infrastructure planning (SH1–8), see supporting information (SI; Section SI1). To ensure a better balance, and because of their importance for long-term legislative and political changes, we also included two stakeholders from the national level, although these were judged less important for local planning processes (SH9 and SH10). Detailed information on stakeholder classification is also given in Lienert et al. (2013). Together, they represent different entities and decision-making levels, summarized in Table 1
                           
.





The objectives hierarchy in Fig. 1 was developed in individual interviews and a stakeholder workshop (Lienert et al., 2014a). The overall objective of achieving a “good water supply infrastructure” constitutes five fundamental objectives: “high intergenerational equity”, “high resources and groundwater protection”, “good water supply”, “high social acceptance”, and “low costs”. These are divided into sub-objectives which are directly measured by a corresponding attribute, except “good water supply” (Fig. 1). The sub-objectives of “good water supply” are further divided into “good drinking water (dw) supply”, “good household water (hw) supply”, and “good firefighting water (ffw) supply”, since these are separately supplied in some alternatives. They are characterized by the same sub-objectives concerning water quantity, reliability, and quality. The latter is not considered for “good ffw supply”, because water quality is irrelevant for firefighting. The attributes and their assessment are explained in Table SI2.1 (SI). Some attribute ranges had to be chosen generously to ensure that the predictions for the decision alternatives (incl. uncertainty) were covered, because the final predictions were still missing at the time of the MCDA interviews.

Altogether 11 decision alternatives were generated in a stakeholder workshop (Lienert et al., 2014a). 17 factors regarding organizational structure, spatial extent, technical management, and system technology were used to generate a sufficiently different set of options. Technically, these ranged from conventional centralized treatment and distribution of drinking water for all purposes (potable, household, and firefighting use) to partially or fully decentralized alternatives, e.g. with rainwater harvesting in households, in-house treatment, water delivery by lorries, or decentralized fire-fighting tanks. Different spatial extents (all or part of the utilities together, collaborations with external service providers), organizational forms (e.g. municipality-run, cooperatives, contracting), as well as technical management regimes (minimal/moderate/extensive inspections and maintenance; rehabilitation by condition or prioritization) were also covered. The detailed characteristics of the alternatives and their attribute predictions are compiled in the SI, Section SI3.

The alternatives were evaluated for four scenarios with a time horizon of 40 years (2010–2050). The future scenarios Boom, Doom, Quality of life, and Status quo (developed in a stakeholder workshop, see Lienert et al., 2014a) cover changes in per capita income, population growth, urban expansion, water demand, and similar aspects. Hence, they define important framework conditions for the technical dimensioning of the alternatives. In the Status quo scenario, the situation in 2050 is assumed as today. There is no urbanization increase, and a stable population of ca. 24,200 inhabitants. The landscape remains rural with extensive agriculture. There is high environmental and water quality awareness. Economic growth reaches approx. 0.4 percent/year of real income increase, as in the past years. The Boom scenario, despite being highly prosperous (real income increase of 4 percent/year) and technologically booming, faces rapid urbanization challenges with an increased need for both densification and expansion of urban areas (200,000 inhabitants in 2050). The Quality of life scenario represents the “most desirable” scenario, with moderate, stable population and economic growth (ca. 29,000 inhabitants in 2050, real income increase +2 percent/year), and high environmental awareness. In contrast, the Doom scenario represents the least desired situation with strong financial pressures (real income decrease: −1.5 percent/year) and sacrifices regarding environmental protection and water quality. The urban extent, however, remains the same as in the Status quo, and the population decreases only slightly (ca. 23,000 inhabitants in 2050).

We judged elicitation of scenario-dependent weights or preferences as proposed by e.g. Karvetski, Lambert, and Linkov (2009b) and Montibeller et al. (2006) as highly hypothetic given the long time horizon. Instead, we evaluate the alternatives given current stakeholder preferences (e.g. Goodwin & Wright, 2001). This means that we use the same preferences based on which decisions are currently taken. Nonetheless, we encourage future validation and/or re-elicitation following an adaptive management approach. Even though we assume stable preferences for all scenarios, the performance of alternatives (and hence rankings) considerably differs in the scenarios, as attribute levels change under varying framework conditions.

For a complete MAUT analysis, the aggregation functions, marginal utility functions, and weights of all aggregation nodes (branch intersections) of the objectives hierarchy need to be elicited (e.g. Eisenführ et al., 2010; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993). This is practically infeasible in our case, given the high complexity of the objectives hierarchy (30 marginal value and utility functions, 15 hierarchical aggregation nodes, 44 weights, Fig. 1) and little elicitation time available with stakeholders. Consequently, we applied a simplified elicitation procedure followed by an uncertainty analysis. Hereby, we considered the uncertainty of not elicited components and stated stakeholder preferences.

A two-step approach combining an online survey with face-to-face elicitation was chosen. The face-to-face interview approach to preference elicitation is typical in MCDA (e.g. Eisenführ et al., 2010; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993) and builds on the “constructive processing approach” (Hoeffler & Ariely, 1999). It assumes that preferences are constructed during the elicitation process (e.g. Belton & Stewart, 2002). Alternatively, MCDA preferences can also be formed, discussed, and elicited in groups (e.g. Kilgour & Eden, 2010; Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007), which is often done in practice. Therefore, close interaction between the analyst and the decision maker is an important element of decision support. To avoid group effects among stakeholders obscuring individual preferences (e.g. groupthink or anticipatory consensus, see Gregory et al., 2012; pp. 196–197), we preferred face-to-face interviews over group elicitation. The elicitation of preferences through (usually large) online surveys is more common in economics, especially when aiming at elicitation of representative “average” preferences of a population which requires large samples. They commonly rest on the assumption of existing preferences which only need to be elicited appropriately (using e.g. willingness to pay studies or discrete choice experiments; for the latter see e.g. Ben-Akiva & Lerman, 1989). This allows addressing more stakeholders in less time – a property we make use of to simplify and focus the individual face-to-face interviews.

All MCDA interview partners received information materials 2–6 weeks in advance, giving a short description of the purpose of the study, the decision problem, and the five top-level fundamental objectives. To avoid splitting bias (Borcherding et al., 1991; Schuwirth et al., 2012), the description of the five objectives was roughly equally long (299–305 words each). It contained an explanation of the objective and examples about the influence of different water supply alternatives on the achievement of the objective. The current situation was also presented. Additional material was provided, i.e. a table describing the attributes and ranges used for measurement (similar to Table SI2.1), and information about the modeling of preferences and underlying rationality assumptions (consistency, completeness, transitivity, and preferential independence). Before the interviews, stakeholders were asked to give a preliminary ranking of the objectives in an online survey to allow individual adaptation of the interviews.

The purpose of the online survey was to rank the objectives and focus later face-to-face elicitation only on the most important ones. The objectives were ranked hierarchically, starting from the top-level, and moving downwards in the hierarchy/tree (i.e. from left to right in Fig. 1). The ranges of the respective attributes were provided in a pop-up dialog as well as in separate pdf documents accessible through hyperlinks in each section. The approach used for ranking is similar to the Swing method (e.g. Eisenführ et al., 2010) for weight elicitation, but without asking to quantify scores. Hereby, the outcomes of a hypothetical reference alternative with all objectives on the worst level were compared to the outcomes of other hypothetical alternatives having one objective each on the best level. Stakeholders then ranked these hypothetical alternatives in the order in which they preferred to improve the single objectives to their best levels. After each ranking on one hierarchical level, the stakeholders marked the objectives they judged relevant for the comparison of alternatives, and which ones could be left out (“irrelevant”). For “good household water supply”, and “good firefighting water supply”, stakeholders could choose to use the ranking of sub-objectives as in the drinking water case (asked first) or rank them differently in a separate step. The online survey took about 25–45 minutes to complete.

Three people attended each interview: the stakeholder (interviewee), the analyst (interviewer), and an assistant (taking notes, running real-time calculations to select value functions and trade-offs for later parts of the interview). It started with a reminder of the purpose of elicitation and room for questions. We emphasized that the elicited preferences are individual and subjective, and that there are no wrong answers. The elicitation took about 3 hours, split into three parts with 5–10-minute breaks in between.

First, the Swing weights of all 44 objectives were elicited hierarchically in a top-down manner. They were elicited as intervals (as recommended e.g. by Jessop, 2011; Mustajoki et al., 2006), including a “best guess”. The ranking of objectives from the online survey was validated in each step, before the 0–100 scores were assigned. Second, a few marginal value functions were assessed using the mid-value splitting technique, and asking for v
                           0.5, v
                           0.25, and v
                           0.75 (explained in Schuwirth et al., 2012). We elicited the certainty equivalent (CE) of a 50–50 lottery between the best and worst outcomes so that marginal value functions could be converted to marginal utilities (Dyer & Sarin, 1982). Again, intervals and a best guess instead of a single value were requested. Utility independence (UI) was checked by a shortened version of the procedure described in Keeney and Raiffa (1993, pp. 299–301). A 50–50 lottery which leads to either the best or the worst outcome regarding one objective was compared to the assessed certainty equivalent while the outcomes regarding the other objectives were held fixed. If the stakeholder was approximately indifferent in a situation where all remaining objectives were at their worst level, and also if they were at their best levels, it was asked if the same could be assumed for all levels in between the two extremes. If affirmed, the stakeholder was considered utility independent. The number of value functions, CEs, and UIs assessed depended on the time, but at least one value function with corresponding certainty equivalent and utility independence were elicited per stakeholder. After this, rough information about the shapes of the most important remaining marginal value functions was obtained by asking if the improvement from the worst attribute level to the mid-range was equally good as the improvement from the mid-range to the best level. This gives insight about the location of the v
                           0.5 value and consequently about the curvature (concave, convex, or linear). Third, consistency trade-offs were asked as in Schuwirth et al. (2012), using information from the weight and value function elicitation.

During elicitation, individual acceptance thresholds were discussed whenever a stakeholder judged attribute levels above (below) a certain threshold as unacceptable. The stakeholder specified whether the threshold should affect the overall assessment of the alternative (i.e. would it be unacceptable, no matter the level of the other attributes) or only the affected sub-objective. Thresholds were validated, and sometimes added by the stakeholders, after receiving a written summary of the elicited preference information.

The stakeholders’ preferences are described by individual hierarchical utility models decomposed into marginal (single-attribute) utility functions, weights, and an aggregation function, which aggregates the marginal utilities and weights to achieve one overall score for each alternative. Because the Swing method cannot be used for the weighting of marginal utility functions (as it requires the statement of preference differences, see Eisenführ et al., 2010; p. 306), marginal values were aggregated first, and then converted to utilities on the highest level of the hierarchy. Two aggregation models were considered: the common additive aggregation model for compensatory aggregation (Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; weighted arithmetic mean) and the Cobb–Douglas model for not fully compensatory aggregation (Cobb & Douglas, 1928; weighted geometric mean). Their mathematical functions are given in Table 2
                        . These and further aggregation models are discussed in Langhans et al. (2014)

To convert multi-attribute values V(v) to multi-attribute utilities, the exponential model was used (e.g. Eisenführ et al., 2010; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993):

Both, the prediction of the attribute levels and the preference parameters of the utility function, are uncertain in our example (as elsewhere). These uncertainties are formulated as probability distributions. From pa
                        (x), the probability density of the attributes x for alternative a, we can compute the expected utility of an alternative a (Eisenführ et al., 2010)

Additionally, we propagated the uncertainty of preferences through the probabilistic description of the preference parameters (aggregation function, marginal value function curvature, utility function curvature, weights). This is not usually done in MCDA applications. It leads to a probability distribution of expected utilities. As the utilities have only an ordinal interpretation (Keeney & Raiffa, 1993), we calculated the resulting probability distribution of ranks of the different alternatives for each scenario.

Practically, the distribution of attribute outcomes was approximated by a random sample of n = 10,000 realizations for each alternative and scenario, assuming independence between attributes (i.e. total matrix size for four scenarios and 11 alternatives = 440,000). In a second step, we drew s = 10,000 times from the distribution of preference parameters and calculated the expected utilities for the attribute sample for each s. The expected utilities of the alternatives for each s were then ranked for each scenario. The distributions of the ranks were then used to compare the alternatives. We compared these results to a ranking obtained under “usual” simplification assumptions, i.e. assuming additive aggregation and linear marginal values – unless elicited in detail –, the elicited best-guess weights, and a utility function which is identical to the value function (risk neutral).

The outcomes of the attributes were predicted for all 11 alternatives and four scenarios (over 40 years; 2010–2050). Our attribute predictions stem from sources of varying quality: (1) the alternative definition (e.g. number of infrastructure sectors that collaborate in planning and construction, collab) or dimensioning (e.g. areal demand for water facilities in households, area), (2) expert estimation (e.g. aesthetic and microbial drinking water quality, aes_dw and faecal_dw; technical flexibility, adapt), (3) detailed models (e.g. rehabilitation demand, rehab; reliability of drinking water supply, reliab_dw), or combinations, see Tables SI2.1 and SI3.2 for details and distributional assumptions. In the first case, the prediction of attribute levels resulted from dimensioning and no additional uncertainty was assumed. For instance, tanks were dimensioned on the maximum amount of water they need to hold, and the area demand on private property was derived from standard sizes of such tanks. In the second case, the experts’ estimates (intervals) were interpreted as 90 percent confidence intervals of a normal distribution, the lower value of the specified range as 5 percent quantile, the upper as 95 percent. From these, we obtained the mean and standard deviation. In the third case, the formulation of probability distributions was rather straightforward. Unless an appropriate distribution was known from the modeling process, an output sample was generated and different distributions (normal, lognormal, beta, gamma, logistic, truncated normal) were fitted. Using quantile–quantile and histogram plots, the best-fitting distribution was selected.

Because the aggregation model was not elicited in detail, we assumed that any of the aggregation models (additive, Cobb–Douglas) or mixtures, e.g. suggested by Langhans et al. (2013, 2014
                           ), could be appropriate at each aggregation node, if preferential independence of objectives holds. Hence, the aggregation function is

The shape parameter of the marginal value functions was also probabilistically described, its distribution depending on the information obtained during elicitation. Three cases were distinguished:

                                     to follow a normal distribution N(µj, σj
                                    ). Graphical inspection revealed that the resulting sample space when using full standard deviations of the fit was rather large and that the elicited intervals were also covered (within the 95 percent confidence intervals) if only half the standard deviation was used (Figs. SI4.12a–f). Hence, the latter was done to increase specificity.


                                    Approximate shape known: The uncertainty of the exponential curvature parameter cj
                                     was described by a uniform distribution Unif[min, max]; the minimum and maximum were chosen as follows: Unif[0, 10] if concave, Unif[−10, 0] if convex, and Unif[−0.4, 0.4] if approximately linear.

                                    ∼Unif[−10, 10]

Since we did not elicit the aggregation parameters for utilities but only the parameters to aggregate values (Section 2.3). We aggregated values up to the highest hierarchy level. The aggregate overall value was then converted into an aggregate overall utility assuming an exponential function with r∼Unif[−10, 10] (Eq. (1)).

The elicited “best guess” weight and intervals (equally spaced around best guess) were interpreted as centered 95 percent confidence intervals and probabilistically described as normal distributions truncated at [0, 1]. The mean value µi
                            was the best guess and the stated intervals were interpreted as ±1.96 times the standard deviation σi
                            to cover the 95 percent interval (SI, Table SI4.1). Weights were then independently sampled within each (sub-) branch of the objectives hierarchy and normalized to 1 (dividing by their sum), as required by the additive and Cobb–Douglas model. Therefore the resulting weights no longer follow a truncated normal distribution. Other sampling techniques and their implications are described in Butler et al. (1997) and Mustajoki (2011).

Acceptance thresholds were implemented as external elimination criteria by setting the overall value and utility of an alternative or branch (depending on the specification by the stakeholder) to zero if the predicted attribute level exceeded (or fell below) the threshold. Some of the stated thresholds for the “days per year with hygienic concerns of drinking water” were stricter than the estimated attribute level of the current system. For example, some stakeholders set the threshold to 0 or 2 days per year while the status quo (estimated by an expert) lies between 0 and 5 days per year. Current legal guidelines require that no fecal indicator bacteria are found during microbial screenings. This might have motivated the respective stakeholders to set such extremely low acceptance thresholds (see SI, Table SI4.6). Microbial screening is done approx. 1–6 times per year depending on the water supplier and fecal bacteria have been (rarely) detected, leading the expert to estimate that up to 5 days of water quality impairment per year are currently possible. To reconcile this, thresholds were adjusted to allow for the status quo of max. 5 days per
year, implying that stakeholders find the current situation acceptable. Additionally, the exponential distribution is not steep enough to cover the stated intervals of two stakeholders over the whole attribute range from 0 to 365 days per year (SH5 and SH6). Therefore, the function was estimated on a range from 0 to 30 days per year, also in line with the acceptance threshold of SH5, and assumed as zero for higher attribute levels (SI, Fig. SI4.12e). SH10 specified a step function for the attribute “percent utilization of groundwater recharge” with absolute certainty (SI, Fig. SI4.12b), which we used instead of an exponential function.

The magnitude of influence of the preference parameters on the alternatives’ rankings was calculated with a variance-based global sensitivity analysis, following the extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (e-FAST) approach by Saltelli et al. (Saltelli, 2008; Saltelli et al., 2006; Saltelli, Tarantola, & Chan, 1999b). An applicationto a simple MAVT-problem is presented in Saltelli et al. (1999a). We considered 90 uncertain parameters

The uncertain model output Y was represented by the Kendall correlation coefficient τ ϵ [−1, 1] between the ranking for given parameter values 
                           θ
                         and the standard ranking (Kendall, 1938). Kendall-τ is a commonly used statistic to measure the relationship between two rankings. τ equals 1 if the compared rankings are identical, −1 if they are completely opposite, and 0 if there is no relationship. Here, the rankings resulting from parameter changes were compared to a reference ranking (obtained using the mean preference parameters). Thus, for each sample from the joint distribution of preference parameters 
                           θ
                         (Section 2.3), the expected utility of the 11 alternatives was calculated. The attribute distributions were represented by a discrete, independent sample with sample size reduced to n = 1000, because the rankings were nearly identical to those obtained from the larger n = 10,000 sample (Fig. SI6.1). The necessary parameter sample size s to achieve approximately stable sensitivity coefficients was iteratively determined. The preferences of SH2 (local operational personnel) were used as a “base case”. Although termed global sensitivity analysis, the sensitivity coefficients depend on the distributional assumptions regarding the uncertain parameters in the 90-dimensional parameter space. Therefore, we defined five analytic GSA layouts to address specific research questions (Table 3).

Most of the preference and uncertainty modeling was implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2011). The R package utility (Reichert, Schuwirth, & Langhans, 2013) was used to implement and evaluate the MAUT model. We used the following packages for parameter optimization, estimation of the underlying failure model parameters, global sensitivity analysis and visualization: optimx (Nash & Varadhan, 2011), DEoptim 
                        (Mullen, Ardia, Gil, Windover, & Cline, 2011), adaptMCMC (Scheidegger, 2012), sensitivity (Pujol, Iooss, & Janon, 2012; assuming M = 4), and ggplot2 and reshape (Wickham, 2007, 2009). The online survey was set up in a trial version of Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2012).

Some attribute outcomes in the Boom scenario differ substantially from those of the other three scenarios (Table SI3.2, Figs. SI3.1a–f). This is the case for attributes whose performance is strongly linked to the scenario assumptions (Section 2.1, “Future scenarios”): “realization of the rehabilitation demand” (rehab), “utilization of groundwater resources” (gwhh), “system reliability” (of drinking, household, and firefighting water; reliab_dw/ hw/ ffw), “changes in total cell counts” (drinking and household water; cells_dw/hw), “hygienic concerns” of drinking water (faecal_dw), “available water for firefighting” (vol_ffw), “annual cost in percent of mean taxable income” (costcap), and “mean annual cost increase (costchange)”. Besides their impact on the ranking of alternatives, these attributes furthermore discriminate between rankings in the four scenarios, i.e. allow to assess the stability given different boundary conditions.

Other outcomes do not differ or change only slightly as a result of the scenario assumptions. This is true for all attributes linked to “high social acceptance” (efqm, voice, auton, time, area, collab), but also for “energy consumption for water treatment and transport” (econs), “flexibility of technical extension or deconstruction of infrastructure” (adapt), “days per year with esthetic impairment” (of drinking/ household water; aes_dw, aes_hw), and “hygienic concerns” for household water (faecal_hw). The respective ranking of alternatives concerning these attributes is thus robust in all scenarios.

Finally, the predicted levels of some other attributes are identical and hence do not help to discriminate alternatives, but could be important in other cases and were thus not removed. In the case of “water quantity limitations” of drinking water (vol_dw), the outcome is zero days per year for all alternatives and scenarios, its evaluation could thus be discarded. Similarly, absence of detailed predictions for the attributes of the “high physico-chemical quality” of drinking and household water (no3_dw/hw, pest_dw/hw, pest_bta/hw) does not support better differentiation of alternatives, but adds uncertainty (the overall attribute ranges were assumed). Whether differences in the predictions for these attributes have an impact and efforts should be spent on reducing this uncertainty, cannot be concluded without a more detailed sensitivity analysis covering also the uncertainty of the attribute parameter predictions. Details regarding individual alternatives are discussed in Section 3.3 where appropriate.

The top-level objective “good water supply” (Table SI4.1, and Fig. SI4.1) received the highest weights, scoring between 0.23 and
0.39 for stakeholders (SH) 1–9, and 0.35–0.43 for SH10 (second place, overlaps with ‘resources and groundwater protection’). Of its sub-objectives (Fig. SI4.2), “good drinking water supply” was the most important for nine of 10 stakeholders and second for SH5. “Good household water supply” was eight times second (third for SH4, SH6), ranging from 0.28–0.83. Consequently, “good firefighting water supply” was eight times in the third place (second for SH4, SH6). The sub-objective 
                              “
                           high social acceptance” was considered least important by all stakeholders with weights between 0 and 0.15, except SH9, who rated the weight between 0.17 and 0.23 (third). Two stakeholders (SH1, SH10) would even discard “high social acceptance” and four others (SH4–6, SH8) assigned zero weight to some of its sub-objectives (Fig. SI4.11).

The ranks and weights of the remaining three top-level objectives were more divergent. Due to the weight variations of these objectives, the ranking of the alternatives may substantially differ depending on the stakeholder. There are no clearly visible grouping patterns of stakeholders based on the weight information alone. The ranking of objectives in the online surveys was very similar to that of the face-to-face interviews, but the judgment about the relevance of objectives was not (Table SI4.3). Stakeholders marked considerably more objectives as “irrelevant” if asked online (ca. 40 percent), than during face-to-face interviews (ca. 10 percent).

We obtained preference information for 172 value functions (sum over all stakeholders). The shape was elicited in detail for 21 of them (Figs. SI4.12a–f; summary Table SI4.4). Non-linear shapes were most frequent (88 concave, 61 convex), 23 functions were linear. The shape of the marginal value functions differed between and within stakeholders and objectives (e.g. SH4, SH8).

As shown from the fitted marginal utility function parameter r, half of the stakeholders were intrinsically risk averse for specific objectives (10 out of 21), and about a quarter risk prone (6) or risk neutral (5) (Table SI4.5). The direction (not the magnitude) of the risk attitude across several objectives was identical for three stakeholders (SH2, SH3, SH5; risk averse) and differed conditional on the objective for four others (SH1, SH4, SH8, SH10). For the remaining three stakeholders one marginal certainty equivalent was elicited for each.

Eight stakeholders specified acceptance thresholds (AT) that need to be considered when evaluating the alternatives (Table SI4.6). They concern either specific attribute levels, or a perceived loss / deterioration regarding some of the attributes compared to the current situation. They most commonly addressed drinking water quality concerns, specifically “days per year with hygienic concerns” (mentioned by 8 of 10 stakeholders, ATs at 0 days per year, 2 days per year, or 30 days per year). Others concerned the amount of groundwater abstraction, the cost increase, or the reliability of the firefighting water system. In all cases, the overall value of the alternative is affected (set to zero if AT is exceeded) and not only the value of the sub-objective.

Six stakeholders stated that their certainty equivalent might change slightly, if the levels of the remaining attributes were extreme (on the best or worst level; see Table SI2.1). The stakeholders did not however, relate this to other individual attributes, but only to the overall performance of the alternative. We are not aware of similar observations in other studies or of behavioral effects that could explain this behavior. Arguably, this could be considered a deviation from theory. Since the stakeholders agreed that this deviation was small and could be remediated by slightly increasing the stated interval of the certainty equivalents, we were willing to accept that this would suffice to reconcile stakeholder preferences with the assumption of utility independence.

To find out whether there are alternatives which are clearly best for all stakeholders or can be suggested as potential compromise, we first present the rankings of alternatives for all stakeholders and future scenarios, before looking into rankings for individual stakeholders. The differences in the rank distributions considering uncertainty are explained with help of the median rank (MR) and inter-quartile ranges (IQR) (Fig. 2
                        ; Table SI5.2). An alternative is better if its median rank is smaller (i.e. approaching the first rank), and for overall risk-averse stakeholders presumably also if its IQR is narrower (e.g. if several alternatives have the same median).

There is no single alternative which is clearly best or worst for all stakeholders and all scenarios. Calculating the average over the median (or mean) ranks of the 10 stakeholders (Table A1, Appendix A). Alternative A6 (“Maximal collaboration, centralized”) is best in the Doom and Quality of life scenario and second after A1b (“Centralized IKA”) in the Status quo scenario. In the Boom scenario, A2 (“Centralized IKA, rainwater stored”) is the best alternative, followed by A1b which also performs well in the Doom and Quality of life scenarios. Among the worst alternatives are A3 (“Fully decentralized”) and A5 (“Decaying centralized infrastructure, decentralized outskirts”), besides A9 (“Centralized, privatization, minimal maintenance”; Doom, Quality of life scenarios only). Most stakeholders could be manually classified into two groups by their rank distribution patterns. They are marked either with a circle or a triangle (Fig. 2).

The “circle group” consistsof SH2, SH4, and SH9. Its rank distribution pattern varies between the Boom and the other scenarios (Fig. 2). For the Doom, Quality of life, and Status quo scenarios, alternative A6 (“maximal collaboration, centralized”, orange lines) is the best, with a median rank of 1–2 and little overlaps (small IQR: 1–5) for all three stakeholders. The ranking of the other alternatives is less clear in the Boom scenario and differs by stakeholder. Two alternatives perform similarly in the Boom scenario, A2 (“Centralized IKA”, grey, MR 1–2, IQR 1–3; best for SH2 and SH4) and A1b (“Centralized, IKA, rain stored”, lower red, MR 1–4, IQR 1–4; best for SH9). The worst alternative is A9 (“Centralized, privatization, minimal maintenance”, pink, MR = 11, IQR = 8–11), for all scenarios. This low ranking of A9 can in part be explained by the acceptance thresholds (5 days per year) and comparatively high weights concerning the attribute “days per year with hygienic concerns of drinking water quality” (faecal_dw, Section 2.4, “Acceptance thresholds and individual adjustment”; and Fig. SI4.5; Table SI4.6). According to the attribute predictions, those of A9 could sometimes exceed threshold of 0–10 days per year, thus explaining its low performance (Fig. SI3.1b). For Alternative A6 this attribute was predicted to be 0 days per year for all scenarios. Consequently it was not penalized by this threshold. It also performs well regarding a range of other highly-weighed attributes, namely “realization of the rehabilitation demand” (rehab, ca. 25–80 percent, Fig. SI3.1a), “flexibility of technical extension or deconstruction of infrastructure” (adapt, ca.45–65 percent, Fig. SI3.1a), “system reliability” of drinking, household, and firefighting water (reliab_dw/ hw/ ffw, all <0.01, Fig. SI3.1b, c and e), “days per year with esthetic impairment” of drinking water (aes_dw, 0–10 days per year, Fig. SI3.1b), and the cost attributes (costcap, costchange, ca. 0.01 percent of mean income and <0.8 percent increase per year, Fig. SI3.1f). Its poor performance concerning “utilization of groundwater recharge” (gwhh, ca. 80–150 percent, Fig. SI3.1a) in the Boom scenario explains why it is not one of the best alternatives in that case. In the Boom scenario, A1b, and A2 perform similarly well regarding most of these objectives, and outperform A6 regarding “utilization of groundwater recharge” (gwhh, <15 percent), and some of the household water quality attributes (aes_hw, faecal_hw, cells_hw, Fig. SI3.1b–d).

The “triangle group” has five members, SH5–8, and SH3 (Fig. 2). Like in the circle group, alternative A6 (orange) clearly has the lowest median rank (1–3) and smallest IQR (1–2) for SH6–8, but not for SH3 and SH5 (A1b best regarding MR and IQR, blue) in all scenarios except Boom. The worst alternatives in the Doom, Quality of life, and Status quo scenarios for all group members are either A3 (“Fully decentralized”, yellow) or A5 (“Decaying infrastructure everywhere”, green); both with mean rank 10–11 and IQR 9–11. In the Boom scenario, the individual best and worst ranks are less clear. Better-ranked alternatives are: A2 (MR 1–3; best for SH5–7) and A8b (“Status quo, technical variant”, MR 1–4; best for SH3 and SH8). The worst alternative is either A3 (MR 9–11, IQR 9–11), A4 (MR 9–10, IQR 9–11), or A5 (MR 9–11, IQR 9–11). Thus, the performance of alternatives in the triangle group cannot be easily explained by one single preference characteristic. None of the stakeholders stated strict acceptance thresholds (Table SI4.6), which might influence the ranking.

The ranking for SH1 is similar to the triangle group, but especially affected by attributes with diverging predictions in the four scenarios. The best alternative with the lowest median rank (=high expected utility) is either A8b (Boom, Quality of life), or A4 (Doom, Status quo). This is linked to the outcomes of A4 for “system reliability” of drinking, household, and firefighting water (reliab_dw/ hw/ ffw). They perform well in the Doom and Status quo scenarios, because the amount of decentralized assets in A4 is small, leading to a higher reliability of the system, and ultimately to A4 being the best-performing option. The reliability is lower in the other scenarios, because the proportion of decentralized assets increases, and A8b is best instead (Fig. SI3.1b–e). The performance regarding costs might also have an impact in the Boom scenario, since the weight of costs is comparatively high for SH1 (see Fig. 2). The elicited value function for annual cost increases (costchange) is strongly convex for SH1 which leads to a stronger decreasing marginal value in the case of high cost increases compared to low increases as expected with A8b (Fig. SI4.12f). The worst alternative for SH1 is either A3 or A5, and the same reasoning applies as for the triangle group. Additionally, A3 and A5 might lead to high cost increases, further penalizing their outcome.

Regarding SH10, A8b has the best median rank of 1 in the Boom and Quality of life scenario. In the Doom scenario, A8a would be best (MR: 1, IQR: 1–3), and in the Status quo A1b (MR 1–2). The worst alternative is either A3 (MR 9–11, IQR 9–11) or A5 (MR 10–11, IQR 9–11). As SH10 discarded “intergenerational equity” and “social acceptance”, the remaining top- and lower-level objectives have comparatively high weights, such as the “natural groundwater balance” or “high supply reliability” (Table SI4.1). Additionally, the value function over the corresponding attribute (“percent utilization of groundwater recharge”) for this objective is unity whenever 100 percent or less of groundwater recharge are abstracted (Fig. SI4.12b), otherwise the whole alternative is unacceptable (see ATs, Table SI4.16). This explains the poor ranking of A6 in the Boom scenario (likely exceeding 100 percent; Fig. SI3.1a). The ranks of A3 and A5 appear in line with the predictions for drinking, household, and firefighting water reliability. Compared to others, these are very high in A3 and A5; Fig. SI3.1b–c and
f).

In some cases, the ranking obtained under usual simplifying assumptions (linear marginal value functions unless elicited in detail, additive aggregation, best-guess weights, risk neutrality) deviates considerably from the rankings obtained with the uncertain parameters. This is indicated by the divergence between the stars (usual simplifying assumptions) and vertical dash (median rank) in Fig. 2. For example, in the Doom scenario, alternative A6 would receive a much better rank of 1 for stakeholder SH1 under usual simplification assumptions, while its median rank is only 6. Opposed to this, the ranking of alternative A4 in the Doom, Quality of life, and Status quo scenario would be clearly inferior (usual simplification assumptions: rank 8, 8 and 7, MR: 2, 4, 2). Differences between the rankings under usual simplification assumptions and uncertain preferences are most frequent for SH1, SH4, SH5, and SH9, but do not substantially depend on specific alternatives or scenarios (see also Table SI5.3). Despite these individual differences, the mean rank across the 10 stakeholders would lead to identify the same candidate best alternatives (or potential compromise solutions), as indicated by the mean of the individual median ranks used above (Table A1, Appendix A).

The first (Sz
                     ) and total order (STz
                     ) sensitivity coefficients for the five analysis layouts (cf. Table 4) were calculated with s = 4000, i.e. a sample matrix of 360,000 rows by 90 columns. With this sample size, the first order coefficients Sz
                      were approximately stable, but not the total order coefficients STz
                      of which only the rank was approximately stable (Table SI6.1, Fig. SI.6.2). Increasing s further was not feasible due to the computational expense (with s = 4000 implemented as 72 parallel runs per GSA layout, each ran about 3 days on a high-performance computation cluster). Nevertheless, we judged knowledge of the first order coefficients and a ranking of total order coefficients sufficient for the interpretation of the results. Thus, first order coefficients are interpreted quantitatively and total order coefficients qualitatively, based on their ranking.

The sum of the Sz
                      is below unity for all five model layouts, see Table 4 (∑θz
                     ). This means that the models are considerably nonlinear and that 30–77 percent of the output variance (of the rank correlation coefficient τ) can be explained by the variation of individual parameters alone (main effect). In the base case (SH2_SQ), 77 percent of the output variance is explained solely by the main effects, which can be attributed by a large extent to the overall utility function curvature r, accounting for ca. 72 percent of the output variance. This parameter also has the largest total order coefficient (rank 1, see also Fig. 4), demonstrating high interactive effects with other parameters. If the top-five ranking parameters were known with certainty (r, a.IE, a.overall, c.IE_rehab, a.SA; i.e. the overall risk attitude, aggregation mixture parameter of “high intergenerational equity”, overall aggregation mixture parameter of “good water supply infrastructure”, marginal value function curvature of “low rehabilitation demand”, aggregation mixture parameter of “high social acceptance”), more than 75 percent of the uncertainty of the ranking could be resolved (Table 4; see “∑Rank 1–5”). All other parameters are much less relevant, with main effects <2 percent and considerably lower interaction effects (smaller red bars in Fig. 4). The utility function curvature r is also clearly the most important parameter regarding its effect on output uncertainty when the Boom scenario (SH2_BO) or reduced parameter ranges (SH2_SQ_red) are considered. In that case, r explains 25 percent and 31 percent of the overall variance by its main effect, respectively, and is also the most important parameter regarding interactions. However, uncertainty about other parameters such as the aggregation mixture parameters ratios αk and marginal value function curvatures cj
                      becomes more influential, visible in the top-ranked parameters and the sums of the respective grouped sensitivity coefficients (Table 4, lower part).

The high importance of the utility curvature parameter r can be explained by the distributions of the values (see Fig. 3
                     ). Due to the external acceptance thresholds (ATs), some alternatives (A1a, A1b, A2, A8a, A8b, A9) have extremely wide overall value distributions, reaching from zero to values above 0.85. If SH2 is risk averse (r > 0), alternative A6 will always perform best in the Status quo scenario, because it is considerably less uncertain. Consequently, the ranking of A8a/b compared to A7 is affected by the risk attitude, if ATs apply.

If the ATs are not accounted for, uncertainties of other parameters become more influential, reflected in the respective sensitivity coefficients (“SH2_SQ_noAT”, Table 4). Not only is the non-linearity of the model considerably higher (main effect explains only 39 percent of output variance, 61 percent due to interactions), but also the sensitivity towards the risk attitude is much lower (negligible main effect, low interactive effect; see also Fig. 4
                     “SH2_SQ_noAT”). If ATs are not considered, the marginal value function curvatures cj
                      are the most influential parameters (grouped main effect: 31 percent, 8 out of 15 top ranked parameters).

If no stakeholder preferences are considered (NoPref_SQ), about 70 percent of the output uncertainty arises from interactions between uncertain parameters, and only 30 percent can be explained by individual effects. 10 out of the 15 most influential parameters by individual effect are weights. Also, the summarized main effect of the weights group (∑wi
                      = 17 percent, considerable interactions, see also Fig. 4, NoPref_SQ) suggests that the model is most sensitive to the weights – quite contrary to their lower sensitivity in the four other cases. Once again, the sensitivity to the overall utility curvature parameter r is negligible in the absence of ATs.




@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Regarding the “Mönchaltorfer Aa” case study, our 10 stakeholders were unanimous about “good water supply” being of highest and “social acceptance” of lowest priority for achieving the overall goal of “good water supply infrastructure” (given the assumed attribute ranges). The relative importance of the other objectives diverged more strongly between stakeholders.

No single best or worst alternative for all stakeholders or scenarios could be identified, as the individual ranking distributions differed and sometimes overlapped (Section 3.3). Nonetheless, suggestions for potential compromise solutions can be made: Under the presented assumptions, alternative A6 (“Maximal collaboration, centralized”) might be a good compromise since it performed well for many of the highest-weighted objectives, namely water supply reliability and drinking water quality, intergenerational equity (technical flexibility, rehabilitation demand), but also for costs. A6 consequently had the best mean rank in the Doom and Quality of life scenario and the second rank in the Status quo scenario. In the Boom scenario, however, it performed considerably worse than the best-ranked alternative A2 (“Centralized IKA, rainwater stored”, Table SI3.1), due to its high “utilization of groundwater recharge”, compared to A2 and other well-performing alternatives. A2 and A6 are technically similar, also to the poorly performing A9 (“Centralized, privatization, minimal maintenance”). They are basically adaptations of the current centralized supply system, but all foresee pipe dimensioning for residential areas based on household peak demands, rather than the (higher) firefighting peak demands. Firefighting is accounted for by decentralized, shared firefighting tanks. Another (relevant) difference is the poor management and rehabilitation in A9, compared to moderate efforts undertaken in A2 and A6. Also the limitation of water imports from external sources in A6 to max. 10 percent of the water demand to achieve “high resources autonomy” had a strong impact on the results in the Boom scenario. The stakeholder preferences (Section 3.2) revealed that the objective of “high resource autonomy” is of negligible importance. Therefore, a variant of A6 which imports more water from external sources could be a viable option that performs better in the Boom scenario.

We find the presented two-step procedure consisting of an online survey and a face-to-face interview (Section 2.2) very useful to elicit stakeholder preferences. The online survey helped to familiarize the 10 stakeholders with the decision problem. Additionally, we obtained an importance ranking of the objectives that was used to focus interviews on the most relevant objectives and hence reduce complexity. The reasons for stakeholders to re-enter objectives in the interview that they had deemed “irrelevant” in the online survey are unclear and require more specific analyses. As reported in the literature, stakeholders often do not appropriately consider the attribute ranges, e.g. when stating weights (Morton & Fasolo, 2009; von Nietzsch & Weber, 1991 (in Eisenführ et al., 2010); Weber & Borcherding, 1993). This might have happened during the online survey, and recalling the ranges in the face-to-face situation might have led stakeholders to reconsider their initial judgment. Another reason could be that stakeholders felt uncomfortable with excluding potential taboo objectives such as “high social acceptance” in the face-to-face situation. A possible indication for this is that most interviewees gave very low weights to those re-included objectives.

In MCDA-practice, online surveys to elicit preferences are rare, a major concern being the reliability of the responses and the introduction of biases if preferences are elicited unassisted from people that do not understand the implications (e.g. Marttunen & Hämäläinen, 2008; Mustajoki, Hämäläinen, & Marttunen, 2004). However, finding sound online survey procedures that allow eliciting detailed personal preferences required for MCDA, e.g. from a larger number of stakeholders, would be highly interesting. However, more (also experimental) research is needed (Lienert, Duygan, & Zheng, in preparation). We regard the suggested approach as one step in this direction.

The imprecision of stakeholder preferences was addressed by eliciting intervals (as suggested by e.g. Jessop, 2011; Mustajoki et al., 2005) and a best guess. This was possible with minimal additional effort. Also, rough information about not-elicited value functions was obtained by asking just one preference difference question for each. In contrast to other shortened approaches reported in the literature (e.g. Schuwirth et al., 2012), we did not ask for a quantitative specification of the equivalence point. This provides less detail, but can be elicited in considerably less time. Compared to detailed value function elicitation with the mid-value splitting method (taking about 15–45 minutes for one value function), simplified elicitation was easy, worked instantly with all stakeholders, and was much faster (ca. 1–3 minutes each). Results of the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for SH2 revealed little influence of the uncertain value function shape on overall output uncertainty for three of five designs. Hence, for this case study, this approach provides a viable simplification for handling elicitation complexity and limited time without restricting the analysis to linear forms. In the case of the Boom scenario and when no acceptance thresholds apply, GSA gives clear indication on which of the uncertain value functions should be elicited in detail in order to reduce uncertainties.

During elicitation, strong preference thresholds regarding drinking water hygiene were identified, leading to the rejection of alternatives exceeding these thresholds (Section 3.1, “Preference thresholds and individual adjustments”, and Section 3.2). We did not find reports of similar experiences in practical MAUT applications. It remains open if stakeholders would have stated the same thresholds (in the case of drinking water hygiene even stricter than the predicted current situation), if more precise attribute predictions would have been already available at the time of the interviews. Precise knowledge of the attribute outcomes would have allowed one to choose less extreme attribute ranges, and contradictions of the stated acceptance thresholds for drinking water hygiene compared to the status quo could have been discussed with stakeholders. It was not possible to wait with detailed elicitation until the attribute predictions were completed, but for the above reasons we strongly encourage doing so in future studies. According to our experience with this case study, we also recommend to do consistency checks for acceptance thresholds. This seems advisable given their high impact on the results (demonstrated by the GSA).

We did not systematically assess the stakeholders’ opinions about the elicitation methods themselves, but asked for feedback on the overall structured decision-making process this work was embedded into (Lienert et al., 2014a, 2014b (Table 10)). The only issues with preference elicitation were: a) difficulty to understand some objectives and attributes (“good physico-chemical quality of drinking water”), b) missing objectives (“technology readiness”, consideration of redundant water supplies e.g. in “high reliability of supply”), and c) doubts whether the full range of 0 up to 100 percent end-user codetermination is desirable.

The uncertainty of preference parameters arising from imprecise statements, missing information about value and utility function curvatures, and the underlying aggregation functions was propagated to the outcomes of the alternatives (Section 2.4). Also, the uncertainty of the attribute predictions was included. This goes much further than available uncertainty analyses (e.g. Butler et al., 1997; Hyde et al., 2004; Jessop, 2011; Jiménez et al., 2006; Raju & Pillai, 1999), which mostly focus on the uncertainty of the weights and attributes only. It allowed important insights into the uncertainty of the resulting rankings, and how much these would deviate from an analysis under “usual simplification assumptions”, namely linear single-attribute value functions, additive aggregation, sure weights (best-guess), and neutral risk attitude implied by neglecting uncertainty of attribute predictions (Section 2.4).

For some stakeholders, a strong divergence between the ranking of alternatives with uncertain preferences and the ranking for “usual simplification assumptions” was observed. For example, we would have recommended A6 or A1b given usual assumptions for SH1 in the Doom scenario, while the ranking under uncertain preferences resulted in better performance of A4 and A8b. The recommendations for potential compromise solutions for all stakeholders, however, were not affected. Despite this, the objective of the decision process might not always be to identify compromise solutions but rather to understand which alternatives are clearly best (or worst) for some stakeholders but not for others, and why. That can be important especially in deliberative processes with higher conflict potential than observed in this study. Although simplifications are clearly necessary for making elicitation and analysis feasible, the results caution us against oversimplification during preference modeling, because it may lead to wrong conclusions or recommendations. Nevertheless, the use of simplifying assumptions to explore (and not only to rank) alternatives may provide important insights. The process of helping stakeholders define their fundamental objectives and to use them to create and compare innovative solutions does not need the detailed consideration of uncertainties presented here (e.g. Gregory et al., 2012). It might even be counterproductive for understanding due to being overwhelmed by uncertainties. On the other hand, the ignorance of uncertainties in current long-term planning is unlikely to be overcome by decision support approaches that do just the same, and the cost of being wrong due to its non-consideration can be high. This should be taken into account when MCDA evaluations are used to create legitimacy for particular decisions based on the ranking of alternatives.

The combination of uncertainty analysis and scenario planning was very beneficial for the comparison of alternatives in this case study. Whereas the ranking of alternatives in the Status quo, Quality of life, and Doom scenario were often similar, they diverged in the Boom scenario. These findings demonstrate that uncertain drivers of future change need to be considered in long-term water infrastructure planning (also advocated by e.g. Ferguson et al., 2013; Milly et al., 2008; Ruth et al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2010). The current narrow-minded extrapolation of the status quo under stationary assumptions (e.g. Ashley et al., 2008; Dominguez et al., 2009; Störmer et al., 2009) should be overcome. The combination of MCDA and scenario planning provides a valuable framework for doing so, and furthermore allows including different stakes, which has often been overlooked in the past (e.g. Economides, 2012).

We also showed how GSA can be used to explore which of the uncertain parameters have the largest impact on the results (Section 4). This information is helpful to better understand model behavior and to simplify elicitation for large objectives hierarchies. Textbooks require objectives hierarchies to be as concise as possible (e.g. Eisenführ et al., 2010; Gregory et al., 2012; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993), but there seems to be no consensus about how many objectives are still concise. Bond et al. (2008, 2010) found that unaided decision makers on average identify about seven relevant objectives, while they would identify twenty-two relevant objectives when picking from a master list. In practical MAVT/MAUT, it seems that only 10 or less attributes are considered on average (Ananda & Herath, 2009; Hajkowicz & Collins, 2007; Mendoza & Martins, 2006). However, larger objectives hierarchies presumably often better reflect the complexity of real-world decision making (see e.g. Langhans et al., 2013 for river rehabilitation). Therefore, we think there is a real need for viable solutions also in these more complex cases.

The results of the analysis indicate that our elicitation design (Section 2.2) did focus on the most important parameters. Without any preference information available (“NoPref_SQ”), the results were highly sensitive to weights, both regarding their individual and interactive effects. This justifies the efforts spent on elicitation of the weights despite their large number (44 weights overall). Results from the other GSA layouts also imply that the remaining uncertainty from the weight intervals was negligible compared to the uncertainty about other parameters which were not elicited in detail and hence more uncertain. These parameters were chiefly the risk attitude (explaining up to 72 percent of the output uncertainty in the case of stakeholder SH2; Status quo scenario), but also the aggregation form of the highest-level aggregation nodes, and the curvature of specific marginal value functions. We are not aware of any application regarding the elicitation of risk attitudes of multi-dimensional values. Usually, the curvatures of marginal (single-attribute) utility functions are elicited (e.g. Bleichrodt et al., 2001; Eisenführ et al., 2010; Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; Smidts, 1997). In our case, however, the precise elicitation of risk attitude might not even be necessary, despite its high influence. Since the value distributions are quite different for the better-performing alternatives, rough knowledge about whether the stakeholder is approximately risk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-prone should be sufficient to order the alternatives. For example, if a stakeholder is risk-averse, alternatives that exceed acceptance thresholds (and therefore lead to zero value) can directly be excluded.

In all GSA layouts, more precise knowledge of a few parameters could strongly reduce ranking uncertainty. Efforts should thus be spent on eliciting these most important parameters. The challenge is, however, to determine the most influential parameters, as GSA computation is very costly. In this study, the uncertainty of the attribute predictions was only indirectly considered by calculating values and expected utilities for a fixed attribute sample. Therefore, we could not gain any insights regarding the importance of uncertainty in attribute predictions compared to the uncertainty of the preference parameters. In many cases, it will be important to know whether to spend efforts on obtaining better predictions or more detailed preference information. Additionally, improving the computational efficiency of GSA including many uncertain parameters e.g. as recommended by Saltelli et al. (2010) should be one objective of further studies, also to be able to obtain stable, quantitatively interpretable total order indices.

We would also like to raise attention to the high influence of interaction effects between parameters. Given the ubiquity of local (one at a time) sensitivity analyses in practical MAUT/MAVT and available software, we should be cautious when interpreting the influence of single parameters, because LSA is unable to capture interactive effects (e.g. discussed in Saltelli et al., 2006).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We presented an approach to tackle uncertainty in a complex practical MAUT intervention and identified five major sources of uncertainty to be addressed during preference elicitation and modeling. These are the problem framing and structuring, attribute predictions, hierarchical aggregation function, marginal value or utility functions, and the weights. We explained how we dealt with these uncertainties in a complex case study on water supply infrastructure planning in Switzerland. A thorough uncertainty analysis was combined with a scenario planning approach regarding socio economic boundary conditions, to evaluate the performance of water supply infrastructure alternatives in light of uncertain preferences (and preference models), and uncertain attribute predictions for four future scenarios. Despite individually different preferences, we could identify potential compromise alternatives. The ranking of the alternatives changed most strongly under the highly dynamic Boom scenario, indicating that the consideration of changing boundary conditions (e.g. regarding population increase or decrease and the economic situation) is very important in long-term planning of water supply infrastructures.

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) allowed us to assess the contribution of individual parameters and parameter groups on the uncertainty of the ranking of alternatives. In the presented example, the overall uncertainty in the ranking of alternatives can be largely reduced by additional elicitation of only a few parameters. An analysis assuming no preference information at all demonstrated in hindsight that our elicitation approach was able to address the most important uncertain preference parameters (in this case: the weights). It also showed that GSA can be helpful even prior to factual preference elicitation, to focus on reducing the uncertainty of those parameters which matter. To improve the presented elicitation approach, we suggest to split the interview into two parts. The first should be used to elicit interval weights and to check independence conditions. Also, rough information about the marginal value function forms can be obtained with the simplified procedure described herein. Based on these, a valid MAUT model is defined and an uncertainty analysis is done. If no clear ranking of alternatives can be derived from the results, GSA can be performed to determine which parameters should be elicited in-depth during a second, follow-up interview.
