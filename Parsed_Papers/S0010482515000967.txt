                  This paper presents a model-based approach to analyze the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation. In the proposed approach, a low-order lumped parameter model of autonomic-cardiac regulation is used to derive the system equilibria based on the measurements of heart rate and blood pressure, and then the stability margin associated with the equilibria is quantified via the Lyapunov׳s stability analysis method. A unique strength of the proposed approach is that it provides a quantitative measure of autonomic-cardiac stability via a computationally efficient analysis. Therefore, by integrating it with system identification techniques to derive autonomic-cardiac regulation model tuned to each individual, the proposed approach is able to assess subject-specific autonomic-cardiac stability. Indeed, our initial in-silico investigation showed that the proposed approach could estimate the system equilibria accurately, and the associated stability margin behaved consistently with widely accepted physiologic knowledge. The proposed approach may be useful in identifying physiological conditions that can lead to instability in autonomic-cardiac regulation, quantifying the margin of stability and distance to instability related to autonomic-cardiac regulation, and developing interventions to prevent autonomic-cardiac instability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The autonomic-cardiac regulation operates by the interaction between autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system (CVS). The ANS regulates involuntary organ functions to maintain the homeostasis in the CVS against physical (such as exercise and orthostatic hypotension) and psychological (such as anxiety and fear) disturbances [1–3]. Specifically, the ANS regulates blood pressure (BP) by manipulating cardio-respiratory parameters including heart rate (HR), cardiac contractility, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and so on to deliver adequate oxygenated blood to organs in different physiologic conditions [4]. The autonomic-cardiac regulation is regarded as stable if BP converges to an equilibrium state when it is perturbed by a disturbance. On the other hand, it is regarded as unstable if BP starts to exhibit non-decaying or slowly decaying oscillations, or even diverges from its nominal state.

Existing literature suggests that certain changes in the characteristics of autonomic-cardiac regulation (such as an excessive increase in the transport delay associated with sensory afferent pathways) may lead to the onset of its instability (as manifested by unstable BP responses) [5,6]. For example, Cavalcanti et al. [5,7] demonstrated that perturbations in the autonomic-cardiac parameters affect the stability of the CVS. Ottesen [6] showed that the delay in the baroreflex feedback mechanism exerts a large influence on the stability property of the CVS. Ottesen [6] also illustrated that complex dynamic interactions between nonlinear behaviors and delays associated with the autonomic-cardiac regulation may cause instability. Besides, Abbiw-Jackson [8] reported that an increase in the gain of the baroreflex feedback responsible for the control of venous volume may incur the onset of oscillations in BP. As well, deBoer et al. [9] showed that the delay in the baroreflex feedback loop may initiate the Mayer waves (low-frequency oscillations in the mean arterial BP). Given multiple root causes possibly responsible for the instability in the autonomic-cardiac regulation, formal analysis of autonomic-cardiac stability may be beneficial in improving our understanding of the physiologic mechanisms underlying the autonomic-cardiac regulation and also in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods for the ANS-CVS disorders.

It has been shown that mathematical analysis based on physics-based models can be a versatile tool in examining the autonomic-cardiac stability (such as its reliance on the autonomic-cardiac parameters). For example, it was revealed that the occurrence of the Mayer waves is closely related to the baroreflex parameters [6,7,10]. It was also indicated that the delays associated with the baroreflex feedback play a critical role in the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation [6]. In another investigation based on a physics-based model, it was suggested that the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation is affected by baroreflex parameters other than the delays (such as the gain of baroreflex loop) [8]. In addition to stability, such analysis was also used to better understand transient behaviors and characteristics of the autonomic-cardiac regulation. For example, it was illustrated that postural challenges applied to hypertensive elderly subjects resulted in slow convergence of baroreflex modulation to a steady state [11]. Further, an analysis based on a physics-based model was also used to investigate the reliability of the heart rate variability index in the study of autonomic regulatory mechanisms [12]. In addition to the physics-based models, subject-specific data-driven techniques (often resulting in black-box or empirical transfer function models) have also been widely used to analyze the ANS–CVS behaviors [13–15].

To the best of our knowledge, however, state-of-the-art model-based approaches to stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac regulation appear to suffer from limited capability in quantifying the stability margin, although some previous studies attempted to assess the qualitative impact of the changes in the autonomic-cardiac parameters on the stability margin associated with the ANS–CVS dynamics [6,16]. In addition, many existing approaches lack the ability to analyze autonomic-cardiac regulation under simultaneous perturbation of multiple autonomic-cardiac regulation parameters. Considering that it is crucial to maintain a certain degree of stability margin in the autonomic-cardiac regulation (for example, individuals with treatment-resistant hypertension [17]), it is desired that a model-based stability analysis method for autonomic-cardiac regulation be equipped with the capability to assess and quantify its stability margin under a wide range of physiologic conditions.

In our recent study, we investigated an optimization-based system identification approach to determine subject-specific autonomic-cardiac regulation based on a physiology-based ANS–CVS model [18]. In this study, we expand our previous study to develop a model-based subject-specific approach to analyze the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation. In the proposed approach, a low-order lumped parameter model of autonomic-cardiac regulation is used to derive the system equilibria using the measurements of HR and BP, and the stability margin associated with the equilibria is quantified via the Lyapunov׳s stability analysis method. In this regard, the main contributions of this study are (1) an analytic method to derive the equilibria of autonomic-cardiac regulation, and (2) a systematic approach to analyze the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation in the neighborhood of the equilibria. A unique strength of the proposed approach is that it provides a quantitative measure of autonomic-cardiac stability via a computationally efficient analysis. Thus, by integrating it with system identification techniques to derive autonomic-cardiac regulation model tuned to each individual (such as our previous work [18]), the proposed approach is able to assess subject-specific autonomic-cardiac stability. We examined the proposed approach in two ways. First, we compared the stability results obtained by the proposed approach with widely accepted physiologic knowledge. Second, we employed the proposed approach to explore model parameter configurations that can potentially incur instability in autonomic-cardiac regulation. We demonstrated that the proposed approach could determine the equilibria and quantify the stability margin associated with them reasonably well. In sum, the proposed approach can be a powerful tool to analyze autonomic-cardiac stability and the causes of instability due to its capability to derive stability margin associated with different autonomic-cardiac parameter configurations.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the details of the autonomic-cardiac regulation model employed in this study and its delay-free realization that was employed to develop the proposed approach. In Section 3, we present the proposed approach to determine the autonomic-cardiac equilibria (HR and BP) and their stability margin. Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results obtained from the initial in-silico investigation of the proposed approach. This paper is concluded in Section 6 with future directions.

In this section, the autonomic-cardiac regulation model used to develop the proposed approach to the analysis of autonomic-cardiac stability is presented. We adopted a physiology-based model developed in a previous work [18]. Then, we modified and improved the model to make it suitable to derive the proposed approach.

Numerous mathematical models with different levels of complexity have been proposed in the literature to represent the autonomic-cardiac regulation. Examples include a three-element Windkessel model of CVS with the baroreflex feedback represented as series connection of delayed linear dynamic system and a sigmoid nonlinear function [5], a simple nonlinear feedback control model that incorporates a CVS model represented by a delayed transfer function followed by an amplitude-limiting nonlinearity, and a linear proportional-derivative controller for the ANS [19], coupled nonlinear delayed differential equations describing HR and BP regulation mechanisms [20], and a relatively complex model consisting of hemodynamics as the Windkessel model and the Starling heart, baroreflex as a linear function with saturation, and autonomic control as multiple transfer functions [21].

To develop an analytic, rather than numerical, model-based stability analysis tool for autonomic-cardiac regulation that is reliable and computationally efficient, a low-order, physiology-based and high-fidelity model is desired. In this study, we adopted a model developed by Fowler et al. [20] as one such model (

                        where H is the HR and P is the mean arterial BP. The definitions and nominal values of the parameters in (1) and (2) are summarized in 
                        Table 1. In this model, sympathetic and parasympathetic modulating functions produced by the baroreflex control mechanism are denoted by T

In this study, we neglected the inhibitory impact of the parasympathetic reflex on the sympathetic reflex by setting γ=0 in (1) and (2), since it is well known that its effect on the overall autonomic-cardiac regulation is generally small [6,20]. Then, the model (1) and (2) can be rewritten as follows:

To eliminate analytic and computational challenges arising in the stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac regulation due to the transport delay, the sympathetic delay was replaced by its approximation. Note that this simplification ultimately reduces the infinite-dimensional autonomic-cardiac regulation model (6) and (7) to a finite-dimensional model amenable to analytic treatment and investigation. To this aim, the Padé approximation was used to eliminate the delayed state variable P(t−τ) in (6) and (7) as follows. First, a new state variable X was defined as follows:

This section elaborates on the proposed approach to the model-based stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac regulation. Once a subject-specific ANS–CVS model (6) and (7) is derived by a system identification technique, the proposed approach operates in three steps. In the first step, the equilibrium state of the autonomic-cardiac regulation (in terms of HR and BP) is estimated as a closed-form steady-state solution of the delay-free model (11). In the second step, the autonomic-cardiac regulation model is linearized in the neighborhood of the equilibrium state to obtain the Jacobian matrix of the system. In the third step, the stability of autonomic cardiac regulation in the neighborhood of the equilibrium state is assessed and its margin quantified by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.

The equilibrium state was estimated by exploiting the fact that all the time derivatives in (11) should be zero at an equilibrium state:

                        ) from the nonlinear equations above is not trivial. One can conceive employing a numerical optimization method to solve (15) and (16), or alternatively, solving the original delayed nonlinear differential equations (11) until a steady-state is reached. However, there are at least three potential drawbacks in these alternatives: large convergence time and expensive computational load (especially when the dynamic behavior of the autonomic-cardiac regulation is slow) as well as risk of convergence to local minima.

To avoid these drawbacks, we propose to derive a closed-form, analytic solution for the equilibrium state using a linearized form of (15) and (16). Note that this amounts to linearizing the sigmoid function σ(·). In this study, σ(·) was approximated to the following piecewise linear function in which it is replaced by a set of three linear functions to approximate its behavior in low-BP, mid-BP and high-BP regions

To the best of our knowledge, there is no well-accepted method for global stability analysis of nonlinear dynamic systems with transport delays, which subsume the autonomic-cardiac regulation model used in this study. However, according to the Lyapunov׳s stability theorem [25], the stability property of a nonlinear dynamic system in the neighborhood of an isolated equilibrium state can be determined by investigating the stability property of its linearization in the neighborhood of the equilibrium state. The equilibrium state estimated in the previous subsection for the autonomic-cardiac regulation can be regarded as isolated in that it can be uniquely determined for a specified set of autonomic-cardiac regulation model parameters. To exploit the linear systems theory in our autonomic-cardiac stability analysis, we derived a delay-free realization (11) of the autonomic-cardiac regulation model. Thus, the local stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation at an equilibrium state can be assessed by calculating the Jacobian matrix of (11) evaluated at the equilibrium state W

According to the Lyapunov׳s stability theorem [25], the autonomic-cardiac regulation is stable in the neighborhood of an equilibrium state if all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix have negative real parts. On the other hand, it is unstable if any of its eigenvalues has a positive real part. Thus, a natural choice for the measure of stability margin for a stable autonomic-cardiac regulation is the minimum distance between the eigenvalues and the imaginary axis. Therefore, the following stability margin was proposed:

                           M
                         is indeed a quantitative measure of stability margin for the autonomic-cardiac regulation in that its absolute value measures the distance between the dominant (i.e., the slowest) eigenvalue(s) of the ANS–CVS and the imaginary axis. The autonomic cardiac regulation forfeits its stability margin and even approaches to instability as 
                           M
                         increases.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this study, we generated two sets of randomized in-silico ANS–CVS models, each of which was used to validate the proposed approach to estimate the autonomic-cardiac equilibria and to quantify the autonomic-cardiac stability, respectively. First, to validate the proposed approach to estimate the HR and BP equilibrium state, we generated a set of 100 random in-silico ANS–CVS models. Each model was constructed by assigning randomized autonomic-cardiac parameters to (6) and (7). These parameters were generated to reside within ±20% of respective nominal values under uniform distribution. Second, to validate the proposed approach to analyze the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation, we generated additional 12 sets of random in-silico ANS–CVS models. Each set contained 100 models associated with 100 random perturbations of a single autonomic-cardiac regulation model parameter within 50–200% of its nominal value while all the other parameters were fixed at their respective nominal values.

Using the randomized in-silico models generated in the previous subsection, the proposed approach was tested as follows. First, for each model in the first set of 100 randomized ANS–CVS models to validate the proposed approach to estimate the equilibrium state, the autonomic-cardiac equilibria estimated by the proposed approach were quantitatively compared with those derived numerically. In particular, we estimated HR and BP equilibria via the proposed approach as outlined in Section 3.1. Then, we solved the nonlinear steady-state equations (15) and (16) for H
                        
                           f
                         and P
                        
                           f
                         using the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox [26]. In addition, we also derived Hf and Pf by simulating the delayed nonlinear differential equation model of the autonomic-cardiac regulation (6) and (7). We used the MATLAB׳s delay-differential equation solver (DDE23) to simulate (6) and (7) until steady state was reached. Then, we determined H
                        
                           f
                         and P
                        
                           f
                         as final values of the simulated HR and BP time series. Finally, the quality of the equilibria estimated from the proposed approach was examined by inspecting how consistent they were with their numerically derived counterparts via the Bland–Altman analysis.

Second, for each model in the second 12 sets of randomized ANS–CVS models to examine the validity of the proposed approach to assess the autonomic-cardiac stability, the proposed measure of stability margin 
                           M
                         
                        (26) was compared with a numerical stability margin computed to stand for the level of oscillations in the in-silico BP responses. Specifically, using the in-silico BP responses simulated from (6) and (7), we defined a measure of stability below that captures the amount of oscillations in the BP responses around steady-state:

                           M
                         in (26) was computed as outlined in Section 3.2. The numerical measure (27) was computed directly from the BP response data. The two measures were then compared with each other for consistency.

                        , the proposed stability measure was further validated using widely accepted physiologic knowledge on the reliance of autonomic-cardiac stability on its parameter configuration. Specifically, stability margin of autonomic-cardiac regulation is known to be reduced as the parasympathetic tone (V
                        
                           H
                        ) is decreased and/or the sympathetic tone (β
                        
                           H
                        ) is increased [12,21,27]. It is also known to be reduced as the sympathetic delay is increased [1,7,28]. In our effort to further validate the proposed approach, we examined how the proposed stability margin measure responds to the perturbations of these autonomic-cardiac parameters.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The Bland–Altman analysis indicated that the equilibria estimated by the proposed analytic approach were highly consistent with their numerically derived counterparts (
                        Fig. 2). In particular, with respect to the equilibria derived by simulating the delayed nonlinear differential equation model of the autonomic-cardiac regulation (6) and (7), the bias and 95% confidence interval associated with the BP equilibria were only 1.0mmHg and 0.4mmHg, respectively. As well, the bias and 95% confidence interval associated with the HR equilibria were both less than 0.5bpm (Fig. 2). Noting that estimating the equilibria using the proposed approach amounts to just solving a quadratic equation (23), we could conclude that the proposed analytic approach estimated the HR and BP equilibria of autonomic-cardiac regulation very well with relatively low computational load. It must also be mentioned that the proposed approach did not suffer from the risk of being trapped by local minima, since it is not based on numerical optimization.

                               associated with γ. This is simply due to the fact that γ was set to zero in the model used to develop the proposed stability analysis approach, while its nominal value was retained in the model used to generate in-silico autonomic-cardiac regulation data.
                        , indicating that the reliance of autonomic-cardiac stability on autonomic-cardiac model parameters may be quantitatively elucidated simply by analyzing the proposed stability margin 
                           M
                         within the parameter space of interest.


                        Fig. 3 also shows that the proposed stability margin 
                           M
                         behaves consistently with the widely accepted physiologic knowledge on the impact of sympathetic/parasympathetic tones and delays on autonomic-cardiac stability. Fig. 3 shows that 
                           M
                         increases with decreasing V
                        
                           H
                         and increasing β
                        
                           H
                        . It also shows that 
                           M
                         increases as τ increases, and the regulation can even become unstable if τ becomes large enough (i.e., positive). Together with the consistency between 
                           M
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 M

                                 t
                                 i
                                 o
                                 n
                              
                           
                        , these observations also support the validity of the proposed approach for autonomic-cardiac stability assessment.

The results also suggest that the relation between the autonomic-cardiac model parameters and the stability margin is not always monotonous: an increase (or a decrease) in an autonomic-cardiac model parameter does not always result in a unidirectional change in the stability margin. Indeed, Fig. 3 shows that the stability margin is monotonously related to many autonomic-cardiac model parameters (such as C
                        
                           a
                        , τ, α
                        
                           sp
                        , V
                        
                           H
                        , β
                        
                           H
                        , α, δ
                        
                           h
                         and H
                        0), but it exhibits bi-phasic relation to R
                        0a
                         and P
                        
                           sp
                        . Considering that these bi-phasic relations can complicate the analysis of autonomic-cardiac stability, these parameter must be treated with care in examining the stability margin of autonomic-cardiac regulation.

Considering that autonomic-cardiac regulation is a multi-parameter nonlinear system with transport delay, analyzing autonomic-cardiac stability with respect to a single autonomic-cardiac model parameter may not always provide a comprehensive insight on the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation. Thus, it would be desirable to analyze the stability properties of autonomic-cardiac regulation and quantify its stability margin in response to simultaneous changes in multiple autonomic-cardiac model parameters. In this regard, strength of the proposed approach is that it can examine the trend of autonomic-cardiac stability with respect to perturbations in multiple autonomic-cardiac model parameters. For example, 
                        Fig. 4 depicts the reliance of 
                           M
                         on the simultaneous changes made on two autonomic-cardiac model parameters (specifically, P
                        
                           sp
                         and one other autonomic-cardiac model parameter). In this way, the autonomic-cardiac stability against simultaneous changes in multiple autonomic-cardiac model parameters can be easily predicted. In fact, Fig. 4 demonstrates the complexities associated with the multi-dimensional autonomic-cardiac stability analysis: the interactions among autonomic-cardiac model parameters in determining its stability. For example, Fig. 4 demonstrates that a specific amount of perturbation in P
                        
                           sp
                         can have different influence on the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation when ANS–CVS is subject to simultaneous changes in other autonomic-cardiac model parameters

                           2
                           Indeed, a large P
                              
                                 sp
                               results in reduced stability margin in response to an increase in H
                              0, whereas the same P
                              
                                 sp
                               yields an improved stability margin in response to an increase in C
                              
                                 a
                              .
                        . All in all, Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates the importance of analyzing the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation in multi-dimensional parameter space, and a lot of in-depth work on this issue in follow-up studies is warranted.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

This study has a number of limitations. First, and perhaps the most importantly, the ANS–CVS model we used did not incorporate the influence of respiratory system. Respiration is regarded as an influential factor that must be taken into account in analyzing the interaction occurring in ANS–CVS [9,13–15,29]. In particular, it was shown that ANS–CVS interaction cannot be accurately assessed without accounting for respiration [30]. The importance of respiration on ANS–CVS interaction strongly suggests that the proposed approach must be expanded to accommodate the influence of respiration on ANS–CVS for more credible stability analysis. Second, the parameters in our ANS–CVS model were assumed to be independent of each other when the randomized in-silico models were generated. However, this assumption may not always be true. Thus, it is possible that a small portion of the in-silico models used in this study may not be good reproductions of reality. To improve upon this limitation, an in-depth understanding of the interactions and inter-dependence among autonomic-cardiac regulation model parameters is required.

In this paper, we proposed a model-based analytic approach to the stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac regulation. Based on a physiology-based model of autonomic-cardiac regulation, we developed an analytic, computationally efficient approach to estimate the equilibrium states of the system and a systematic approach to analyze the stability of autonomic-cardiac regulation. The initial feasibility of the proposed approach was tested using randomized in-silico ANS–CVS models.

The goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of model-based stability analysis of autonomic-cardiac regulation. To test the proposed approach in the absence of adverse influences originating from model inaccuracy (e.g., due to imperfect system identification caused by measurement noise), this study did not incorporate a system identification technique to derive ANS–CVS model from data. In the future, follow-up studies aiming at testing the efficacy of the proposed approach when integrated with a system identification technique need to be conducted, which includes the integration of the proposed approach with a system identification technique to yield a method that can provide stability margin directly from the observed data, the analysis of the method׳s robustness to measurement noises, and the validation of the method using experimental data.
