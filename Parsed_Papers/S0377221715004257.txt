                  We consider the coordination challenge with a risk-neutral manufacturer which supplies to multiple heterogeneou retailers. We find that the manufacturer can maximize its expected profit only if the expected profit of the supply chain is maximized, or equivalently supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. The target sales rebate (TSR) contract is commonly used in practice to achieve SCC. However, as we found in this paper, the presence of heterogeneity in retailers’ minimum expected profit requirements is the major cause that a single TSR contract and the related single hybrid contracts all fail to achieve SCC and maximize the manufacturer’s expected profit simultaneously. Thus, we develop an innovative menu of TSR contracts with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ) . Although there are multiple contracts in a menu, we find that the manufacturer only needs to decide one basic TSR contract and two newly developed parameters termed as the risk-level indicator and the separation indicator, in applying the sophisticated menu of TSR-FOQ. By adjusting the two indicators, the manufacturer can control the profit variance of the retailers and the separations of the component contracts of the menu. We further propose another sophisticated menu of TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount contracts which can give each retailer a higher degree of freedom in the selection of order quantity. Differences between the two menus are analytically examined. Some meaningful managerial insights are generated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In supply chain management, there is no doubt that coordinating a supply chain system with risk sensitive retailers is an important issue (Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000; Chen & Seshadri, 2006; Chiu & Choi, 2013). However, in the literature, there is an absence of a fair and flexible supply contracting mechanism which can help achieve coordination in a supply chain with multiple heterogeneous risk-sensitive retailers. This motivates us to conduct this analytical study. Specifically, we consider a two-echelon (not an n-echelon) supply chain with a single manufacturer (M) and multiple retailers (Rs), where M is risk-neutral and Rs are risk-averse mean-variance seekers. We consider that each retailer faces a separate market of the similar size (noting that separate markets do not necessary mean that the markets are in different countries, they could be in different places of the same country). These assumptions consider the scenario in which the manufacturer finds many retailers to act as its agents to sell its product in separate markets and each retailer serves a market of a similar size. Given different economic conditions, these Rs have different profit targets (i.e., minimum participation requirements on the expected profit), which reflects the heterogeneity of retailers. If the profit target is not satisfied, the individual R will order nothing and may “withdraw from the supply chain”. As a result, the manufacturer will lose the opportunity to sell the product in that particular market. Given the heterogeneous mean-variance Rs, we aim to explore the supply contracting mechanism that will allow M to coordinate the supply chain while maximizing its own expected profit. Besides the economics issues, in order to maintain a good relationship with retailers and to enhance the sustainability of the supply chain, the manufacturer also considers the issues associated with fairness, faithful supply contracting and partnership. Therefore, to avoid (1) any negative effects caused by unfairness among retailers; (2) the legal problem that may arise from price discrimination (Robinson-Patman Act, see Crowley, 1947 for more details); and (3) the risk that may bring an unexpected cost in time and efforts to handle the unfairness and the legal issues, M has to offer the same supply contract scheme to all Rs. In other words, even M can easily find a customized single contract which is designed “just for” a specific R, to maximize its own expected profit, its realization is difficult because this contract must then also be made available to every other R. Therefore, the multiple-retailer problem cannot be considered as separate single-retailer problems, and then be solved in a single retailer setting. Moreover, in order to isolate the effects of the heterogeneity of the retailers, we consider that the markets are independent and identical, which is also adopted in the literature (e.g. Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000), and the manufacturer has sufficient capacity to fulfill all the orders from the retailers. This helps isolate the core problem of having “multiple risk sensitive” retailers and reveal insights on the respective coordination mechanism.

By modeling risk aversion using the mean-variance (MV) approach (Chiu & Choi, 2013; Huang, Simchi-Levi, & Song, 2012), we consider that Rs all follow the MV objectives (we call them MV-Rs) and each MV-R aims to minimize the variance of profit subject to the constraint of having the expected profit no less than a given level (i.e., the profit target or the minimum requirement on expected profit is achieved). The MV approach has been adopted extensively for supply chain risk analysis. The advantages of applying the MV approach in modeling risk sensitive supply chain agents include: (i) it is easy to understand even for practitioners such as managers in the industry, (ii) it is analytically tractable, and (iii) it has good literature supports (Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000; Chiu & Choi, 2013; Choi & Chiu, 2012; Choi, Li, & Yan, 2008). As it will be shown later, we analytically find that, in a supply chain with multiple MV-Rs, M’s expected profit is maximized only if the expected profit of the entire supply chain is optimized, i.e., the supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. Therefore, we will focus on examining the supply contracts to achieve SCC, as this also implies maximizing M’s expected profit.

In the literature, mostly a single retailer is considered in the analysis of SCC with supply contracts, including revenue sharing contract and target sales rebate contract. In this study, we explore how a target sales rebate (TSR) contract can help to achieve SCC while maximizing the expected profit of M. Under a TSR contract, the manufacturer will grant a rebate to a retailer if the sales of the retailer exceeds a pre-specified target (cf. Chiu, Choi, & Li, 2011; Taylor, 2002). A sales rebate thus provides an incentive for the retailer to order and sell more, and helps coordinate the supply chain by resolving problems such as double marginalization. We choose to study the TSR contract because (i) many manufacturers have employed the TSR and related contracts in practice (see Chiu, Choi, & Li, 2011; Chiu, Choi, & Tang, 2011), (ii) it offers a greater flexibility to achieve SCC as there are three control parameters in the contract, (iii) it is intuitively appealing and has a sufficient literature base.

In our analysis, we find that SCC cannot be achieved (and hence M’s expected profit cannot be maximized) if a single TSR contract is employed and the heterogeneity of Rs is the main reason accounting for this. We, therefore, propose and examine two variations of TSR contracts, namely the TSR with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ) contract, and the TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount (TSR-MQD) contract. In a TSR-FOQ contract, the order quantity is pre-specified, so Rs can only decide to accept or reject it. In a TSR-MQD contract, a minimum order quantity (MOQ) is specified such that Rs can order no less than the given MOQ. In addition, a TSR-MQD contract includes a quantity discount function which offers a lower unit wholesale price for a larger order quantity. Although a TSR-FOQ contract and a TSR-MQD contract allow more control for M than that under a TSR contract, they both fail to guarantee the achievement of SCC. This presents a challenge to the coordination problem. To achieve SCC, we employ the menu of contracts approach, in which M needs to design the menu of contracts in a way that the Rs will react by selecting components for the contract and ordering the “desirable quantity” (which is equivalent to the best quantity for the supply chain). This imposes a challenge on M as the Rs are virtually free to decide their favorable component contracts and ordering quantities. As a remark, in the literature and also in practice, the menu of contracts approach is typically devised to resolve information asymmetry between the players involved. We suggest to adopt the menu of contracts approach in this paper because the single contract approach fails to guarantee the achievement of SCC with multiple heterogeneous retailers. We believe that the menu of contracts approach can also be extended to a more general setting that consider both the heterogeneous retailers and information asymmetry. However, the focuses of this paper are on (1) examining the challenges in coordinating such supply chain multiple heterogeneous retailers with different minimum expected profit preferences, and (2) examining the application of menu of contracts with multiple heterogeneous retailers. As we shall see later on, the problem formulation in our analysis is already very complicated, a more general setting will limit the development of analytical results and insights. Therefore, we leave the information asymmetry extension to future study.

In this paper, we derive two menus of contracts, namely the menu of TSR-FOQ contracts and the menu of TSR-MQD contracts. The sufficient conditions under which the two menus of contracts can coordinate the supply chain and maximize M’s expected profit are obtained. For the case when the sufficient conditions are unattainable, two sub-optimal menus of contracts are derived under which SCC is still achievable. In developing these coordinating menus of contracts, we introduce some innovative concepts. Firstly, we define two new concepts for describing the connections between component contracts of a menu, they are non-dominated component contracts and MV-non-inferior component contracts (see Section 5 for details). We find that the component contracts of a menu which achieves SCC must be non-dominated and MV-non-inferior. Secondly, we propose two new contract terms specifically applied for the menu of contracts, a risk level indicator (for Rs) and a separation indicator (of component contracts of the menu). As the menu of contracts contains multiple supply contracts, it is complicated for M to determine the parameters for achieving SCC. By introducing the risk level indicator and the separation indicator, the contract setting is significantly simplified. More specifically, instead of controlling the contract parameters of all component contracts in the menu, M only needs to control “the component contract” which is specifically designed for one particular R, plus the risk level indicator and the separation indicator. We suggest that the risk level indicator is specific for the supply chain setting (multiple risk-averse retailers) considered in this paper, and the separation indicator is general for applying the menu of contracts. When one considers a similar supply chain coordination model with another kind of heterogeneity of retailers, the risk level indicator will be replaced by another specific indicator, and the separation indicator will remain applicable.

This study contributes to the advancement of both academic research and practice of SCC by extending and generalizing the result on SCC with one manufacturer (i.e., M) and multiple heterogeneous risk averse retailers (i.e., Rs). We reveal that the expected profit of M is maximized only if SCC is achieved. Moreover, we illustrate that for M, the heterogeneity of Rs is the major barrier to achieve SCC and to maximize M’s expected profit simultaneously. The SCC mechanisms under different settings have been established. Some innovative analytical schemes for achieving SCC and expected profit maximization of a manufacturer have been proposed and their performance has been examined. The results provide some important references for manufacturers to employ rebates, menu of contracts, and other associated contracts to achieve SCC while maximizing their own expected profits. In addition, our findings provide useful insights on SCC and suggest ways to extend the traditional coordination mechanism from cases with a single retailer to the case with multiple heterogeneous risk-averse retailers. Our study thus lays the foundation for a new line of research.

The organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. We present the literature review in Section 2. In Section 3, the supply chain model is constructed, and some preliminaries are derived. Then we review the SCC issue for the case of a single MV-R, and examine the performance of several “single TSR” contracts in Section 4. The concepts of non-dominated contracts and MV-non-inferior contracts are introduced in Section 5. In Section 6, we develop the specific menu of TSR-FOQ contracts and the menu of TSR-MQD contracts, and derive the respective sufficient conditions that allow the two menus of contracts to achieve SCC while maximizing the manufacturer’s expected profit. Finally, we conclude the paper and discuss some open research areas for future work in Section 7. To improve presentation, all proofs are shown in Appendix A.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is a vast literature on SCC. In the following, we focus on the most relevant works and present a concise review. First, sales rebates take various forms which can be observed in different industries. For instance, in fashion apparel, suppliers of national brands such as Levi’s used to impose a channel sales rebate scheme on the items that they wanted to push to the market using a rebate known as “push money”. In the auto industry, a kind of channel sales rebate called “dealer incentive” is used and companies such as Ford, Mazda and Toyota are exercising this scheme (Taylor, 2002). Rebate schemes, in the form of consumer rebate, have been well studied in the marketing science literature (e.g., Gerstner, Hess, & Holthausen, 1994; Zhang, Krishna, & Dhar, 2000). In supply chain management context, the first study on channel coordination via TSR is Taylor (2002). In Taylor (2002), the TSR is proposed to coordinate a supply chain in which the product demand depends on sales efforts. Later on in Ferguson, Guide, and Souza (2006), the SCC problem with false failure returns is studied. They propose a TSR contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per unit of false failure returns below a target. They show that the proposed TSR contract can provide an incentive to the retailer to increase its effort, which results in a decrease in the number of false failures. SCC via a contract that involves a TSR under price-dependent demand distributions is explored in Chiu, Choi, and Tang (2011). A hybrid contract that includes both a TSR and a returns policy is shown to be capable of coordinating the respective supply chains in Chiu, Choi, and Tang (2011). A contract with price match and selective compensation rebate is used to achieve sales effort coordination for a supply chain with one manufacturer and two retail channels (an online retailer and a brick-and-mortar retailer) (Xing & Liu, 2012). Relatively recently, how a TSR can be implemented to coordinate a supply chain which involves a risk neutral supplier and a risk sensitive retailer is examined in Chiu, Choi, and Li (2011). They show that there exist multiple TSR contracts which can achieve SCC. We build on this research and also examine the use of TSR contracts.

In the SCC literature, a TSR is not the only contract which can enhance channel performance. In fact, contracts such as returns policy, revenue sharing policy, quantity flexibility policy and some others have been shown to successfully coordinate a supply chain with a stochastic demand. We refer readers to Tsay, Nahmias, and Agrawal (1999), Cachon (2003) and Bernstein and Federgruen (2005) for a comprehensive review of SCC with risk neutral agents. For a supply chain involving members with different degrees of risk aversion, to the best of our knowledge, the first published work is Lau and Lau (1999) which examines the use of returns policy for a single supplier and single retailer supply chain in which both parties seek to maximize a mean-variance (MV) objective function. Later on, a study of the risk-free perishable item returns policy with a risk neutral retailer in a manufacturer-retailer two-echelon supply chain is reported by Webster and Weng (2000). Subsequently, two influential studies have been presented by Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2004), 2005). In Gan et al. (2004), the method for coordinating a supply chain with a single risk-averse supplier and a single risk-averse buyer is investigated. They propose the concept of Pareto-optimality as an objective for achieving SCC. In Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2005), the SCC problem with a single risk neutral supplier and a downside risk-averse retailer is explored with some important managerial insights. For more related studies, we refer to Chiu and Choi (2013).

For the case of coordinating a supply chain with multiple risk-averse retailers, Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) are the pioneers. They demonstrate how a menu of mutually beneficial contracts in the form of buyback (with pre-specified fixed order quantities) can achieve supply chain coordination when the retailers take mean-variance objectives. In Chen and Seshadri (2006), the work of Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) is extended to a supply chain with a single supplier and an infinite number of risk sensitive retailers. They show that the menu of contracts as proposed in Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) can coordinate the supply chain when the supplier knows the distribution of the retailers’ risk aversion thresholds.

Similar to Gan et al. (2005) and Chiu, Choi, and Li (2011), we investigate risk-averse retailers in a two-echelon supply chain. Our work is also related to Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) and Chen and Seshadri (2006) in the sense of involving multiple retailers. However, we are substantially different from these studies because we consider not only the challenging problem of multiple heterogeneous risk-averse retailers, but also flexible supply contracts in which the retailers can choose their own order quantities instead of having pre-fixed quantities set by the manufacturer. Our proposed contracts also meet the common legal requirement and fairness concern on price discrimination. As such, the problem under our study is far more complex, and therefore we need to develop new contracting terms such as the risk level indicator and the separation indicator to achieve coordination. Table 1
                      highlights the similarities and key differences between our paper and other related papers in the area of supply chain coordination.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain with one manufacturer and n retailers. The manufacturer (M) produces a newsboy type product, and sells it to the retailers (Ri
                     , 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                        
                     ). Then the retailers resell the product in n separate markets. To avoid the unfairness across the supply chain members, the legal problem of price discrimination and the related extra cost in time and efforts to handle it, the manufacturer must provide the same contract package to all retailers.

To maintain the brand image and positioning, the manufacturer fixes the in-season retail price of the product at p and the salvage value of any unsold product is s. The product’s manufacturing cost is c. As optimization of the brand positioning is not the main focus of this paper, we consider that p, s and c are exogenous. The in-season demands for the product in markets (denoted by xi
                     ) are uncertain, and they are independent and identically distributed with a density function f(·), and a distribution function F(·), or equivalently, we consider the markets are homogeneous and independent. Lastly, we consider that there is no capacity limit of the manufacturer. Noting that the independent and identical market, and unlimited capacity assumptions for multiple retailers problem, are adopted in Agrawal and Seshadri (2000). This helps isolate the core problem of having multiple risk sensitive retailers and reveals insights on the respective coordination mechanism. We assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between F(·) and its argument. Moreover, we consider that the leftover product can be sold off during the off-season. To avoid any trivial case, we assume that p > c > s > 0.

We consider that the manufacturer is the game leader who acts first, and the retailers are game followers who act afterwards. To be specific, the manufacturer first decides the details of the supply contract and then offers it to the retailers. After knowing the details of the supply contract, each Ri
                         decides whether to accept the supply contract or to reject it. If Ri
                         accepts the supply contract, then Ri
                         makes a quantity decision based on the offered supply contract. If Ri
                         rejects the supply contract, then the order quantity of Ri
                         is zero.

We focus on deriving a menu of target sales rebate (TSR) contracts that (i) maximizes the expected profit of the manufacturer and (ii) coordinates the supply chain. The basic TSR contract is a supply contract under which the manufacturer charges Ri
                         the unit wholesale price of the product w > c, and the manufacturer will reward a rebate u > 0 to Ri
                         for each unit sold beyond a sales target T > 0 (see Chiu, Choi, & Tang, 2011; Taylor, 2002). For a TSR contract, the contract parameters w, u and T are decided by the manufacturer, and Ri
                         decides the order quantity qi
                        . A menu of supply contracts contains m > 1 supply contracts. When the manufacturer offers a menu of contracts to all Ri
                        , each Ri
                         needs to select one of the contracts from the menu first, and then decides qi
                         accordingly.

We consider two specific variations of the TSR contract: the TSR contract with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ), and the TSR contract with minimum order quantity and quantity discount (TSR-MQD). For a TSR-FOQ contract, the order quantity 
                           
                              q
                              FOQ
                           
                         is pre-specified by the manufacturer, and Ri
                         can only decide to accept or to reject the offered TSR-FOQ contract. If Ri
                         accepts the offered TSR-FOQ contract, then 
                           
                              
                                 q

                        ; otherwise, if Ri
                         rejects the offered TSR-FOQ contract, then 
                           
                              
                                 q

                        . For the TSR-MQD contract, a minimum order quantity

                         is specified by the manufacturer such that Ri
                        ’s order quantity is no less than

                        . In addition, the TSR-MQD contract includes a quantity discount function D(q), which is increasing in q and is specified by the manufacturer. Under the TSR-MQD contract, for any given order quantity

                        Proposition 3.1 shows the equivalence between problems (1) and (2). Therefore, both of them can be used to model the same decision making problem for the decision makers. However, problem (1) is in fact more intuitive and easy to implement. It also fits the real world situation in which many companies are risk averse and also possess a certain profit target in their operations. Therefore, we adopt problem (1) in the subsequent analysis.

We study the SCC of the supply chain with a single risk-neutral manufacturer and multiple risk-averse mean-variance Rs. There are several ways to define SCC for the case when the chain members are risk sensitive. We adopt the definition of SCC in Sethi, Yan, and Zhang (2005): supply chain coordination is achieved when the supply chain’s expected profit is maximized.

The supply chain’s expected profit can be maximized only if

We review the case of single MV-R, and define some useful notation first. According to Chiu, Choi, and Li (2011), the conditions under which the basic TSR contract allows SCC to be achieved for the case of a single MV-R are given by:

According to Proposition 4.2, the feasible range of T for coordinating a single MV-R supply chain is fixed when the risk level indicator φ is given. As we show later, this property is important in the decision sequence of contract parameters for achieving SCC.

                         are identical for some situations, so SCC can also be achieved under the TSR-FOQ contract even though M’s objective is maximizing her own decentralized expected profit.

By offering the TSR-MQD contract, M tries to have a better control of qi
                         by including

                         and D(q). Similar to the case with a single basic TSR contract, a single TSR-MQD does coordinate a supply chain with single MV-R. However, this single basic TSR-MQD contract is specifically designed for a particular R, and it will fail to coordinate another single MV-R with different μi
                        . (We note that it is of interest to investigate M’s decentralized solutions of the TSR-MQD contract too. As our focus is on SCC and the TSR-MQD contract fails to achieve SCC, we leave the problem to future study.) The following Proposition 4.4 summarizes the findings in this section.

                              cannot be achieved simultaneously, by offering a single TSR contract, a single TSR-FOQ contract or a single TSR-MQD contract to the Rs.
                           

Heterogeneity of Rs’ μi

                      simultaneously, M should consider a more sophisticated solution scheme. We suggest to design one specific TSR contract for each retailer, and then combine them to form a menu of TSR contracts. However, the menu of TSR contracts approach arises two problems.

                     . Obviously, all retailers select θ
                     TSR, 2 from the menu because it has a lower w, but the same u and T (θ
                     TSR, 2 
                     dominates θ
                     TSR, 1 from the view of retailers). Next, consider another menu of two TSR contracts, θ
                     TSR, 3 and θ
                     TSR, 4. For a fixed q > 0, retailer’s expected profit and variance of profit under θ
                     TSR, 3 are given by 10 and 50, respectively, and retailer’s expected profit and variance of profit under θ
                     TSR, 4 are given by 11 and 40, respectively. For this case, all retailers select θ
                     TSR, 4 from the menu because it has a bigger expected profit and a smaller variance of profit (θ
                     TSR, 3 is MV-inferior to θ
                     TSR, 4).

Retailers only select non-dominated and non-MV-inferior contracts. Therefore, only menus of non-dominated and non-MV-inferior contracts should be considered for achieving SCC. It is easy to determine which contracts are dominated by, or MV-inferior to other contracts when the menu of contracts is simple. However, it is difficult when the menu of contracts is complex. In this section, we introduce the mathematical definitions of the two concepts, the non-dominated contracts and the MV-non-inferior contracts, and have some discussions on the two concepts afterwards.

                        Definition 5.2
                        Consider two supply contracts θa
                            and θb
                           . For any given order quantity q > 0, θa
                            is MV-non-inferior to θb
                            at q if the following holds: R
                              i
                           ’s expected profit under θa
                            is strictly smaller than under θb
                            and R
                              i
                           ’s variance of profit under θa
                            is strictly smaller than under θb
                           .

We note that θa
                      dominates θb
                      at q > 0 does not imply that θa
                      dominates θb
                      at q′ > 0, for q′ ≠ q. Similarly, θa
                      is MV-non-inferior to θb
                      at q does not imply that θa
                      is MV-non-inferior to θb
                      at q′ > 0.

On the one hand, for any given menu of contracts, with order quantity q, rational Rs will only select a non-dominated contract at q from the menu, and an MV-R will select the contract that yields the minimum variance of profit for a fixed expected profit.

                         by solving the system of Eqs. (9) and (10). Eqs. (9) and (10) are the rates of change of w(μ), u(μ) and T(μ) against the rate of change of μ, which are proportional to the value of δ. A larger δ yields larger rates of change of w(μ), u(μ) and T(μ) against the rate of change of μ. Hence, a larger δ leads to larger differences between w(μj
                        ) and w(μk
                        ), between u(μj
                        ) and u(μk
                        ), and between T(μj
                        ) and T(μk
                        ), for j ≠ k. Therefore, δ can be interpreted as the separation indicator of component contracts (of the menu of TSR contracts). Moreover, when (9) and (10) are satisfied, a component contract of

                         that has a bigger w(μ), also has a bigger u(μ). Next, we develop the

                         might appear to be very complicated, but actually M only needs to control three values, namely, T(μ
                        1), δ, and φ of 
                           
                              Θ
                              FOQ
                           
                        . The parameters T(μ
                        1), φ, and δ represent respectively “the sales target of the component contract which is specifically designed for R1 (i.e., the R with the biggest profit target μ
                        1)”, the risk level indicator for the Rs, and the separation indicator of the component contracts. A larger φ results in larger variances of profit of Rs for a fixed T(μi
                        ), and a larger δ results in larger separations among component contracts of 
                           
                              Θ
                              FOQ
                           
                        . As T(μ
                        1) is bounded and its lower bound depends on φ, M should decide φ first before setting T(μ
                        1). The parameter δ is independent of φ and T(μ
                        1).

The first conditions of Proposition 6.2 (w(μn
                        ) > c) are important because M is unwilling to offer any wholesale price below the product cost c. Condition (11) of Proposition 6.2 follows the condition on T for coordinating a supply chain with a single MV-R in Proposition 4.1.

As M can take different values of φ and δ, once the sufficient conditions of Proposition 6.2 hold, there exist multiple

For the menu of TSR-FOQ contracts we examined earlier, q is fixed and pre-specified at 
                           
                              q

                        . For some real world cases, to enhance implementation, q cannot be fixed and Rs have the freedom to decide q. Therefore, we propose another menu of contracts, namely, the menu of TSR-MQD contracts under which Rs can decide q.

We consider a specific menu of TSR-MQD contracts (denoted by Θ
                        MQD) with n component contracts θ
                        MQD, j

                        . The unit rebate and the sales target of θ
                        MQD, j
                         are given by u

                        MQD, j
                         is given by w
                        MQD(μ). The minimum order quantity under θ
                        MQD, j
                         is q
                        MOQ, j
                        , and the quantity discount function is D
                        MQD(q). Let E
                        MQD, j
                        (q) and V
                        MQD, j
                        (q) be the expected profit of the R and variance of profit of the R, respectively, with θ
                        MQD, j
                         for a given q ≥ 0. Under Θ

                        MOQ, j

                        MQD is an additional constraint on δ, items (6) and (7) specify the minimum order quantity and the quantity discount function of each component contract of Θ

                        ). This implies that on one hand M will provide a quantity discount to Rs; on the other hand the wholesale price is increased to offset the loss from the quantity discount. As a note, according to (13), β depends on q
                        MQD, i
                        , and a smaller β could be obtained for bigger q
                        MQD, i
                        s.

Similarly, Θ
                        MQD seems to be very complicated, but M only needs to control the values of T
                        MQD(μ
                        1) and δ. Once they are determined, the values of w

                        ) and u
                        MQD(μi
                        ), for

                         and D(q) can be determined accordingly. Note that T
                        MQD(μ
                        1) and δ are interdependent, and they should be decided simultaneously. The major differences between Θ

As M can take different values of δ, once the sufficient conditions of Proposition 6.4 hold, there are multiple Θ
                        MQD under which SCC is achieved. On the one hand M has less freedom in setting Θ
                        MQD (in which

                        MQD(μ

                        MQD. This shows that to achieve SCC and obtain

Due to the heterogeneity of the minimum expected profit requirement among mean-variance retailers (Rs), we know that the manufacturer (M) cannot achieve supply chain coordination (SCC) and maximize its expected profit simultaneously by offering a single TSR contract to the Rs. To tackle this problem, we propose that M offers a menu of contracts to the Rs. We introduce two menus of TSR contracts, namely the menu of TSR-FOQ contracts (
                        
                           Θ
                           FOQ
                        
                     ) and the menu of TSR-MQD contracts (Θ
                     MQD) for achieving coordination and maximizing M’s expected profit. The order quantities of the Rs are pre-determined and specified in 
                        
                           Θ
                           FOQ
                        
                     . We find that coordination can be achieved and M’s expected profit is maximized by adjusting three parameters: T(μ
                     1), φ and δ, which respectively represent “the sales target of the component contract which is specifically designed for the R who has the highest profit target”, the risk-level indicator, and the separation indicator of component contract. The menu of TSR-MQD contracts has fewer restrictions on the order quantity. The Rs can determine their respective order quantities no less than the minimum order quantities that are equal to the sales target of the respective component contract. We show that another two-parameter policy (from the perspective of M), which includes T
                     MQD(μ
                     1) and δ as required under Θ
                     MQD plus a quantity discount function D(q), is capable of achieving channel coordination and maximizing M’s expected profit.

Comparing 
                        
                           Θ
                           FOQ
                        
                      and Θ
                     MQD, we find that Θ
                     MQD places fewer restrictions on the Rs in deciding the order quantities. However, it is more restrictive for M, as there are fewer decision variables and more constraints on the decision variables. It is observed that to maximize M’s expected profit and hence achieve channel coordination through TSR contracts, we require more contract parameters when heterogeneous Rs are considered than the case with homogeneous Rs. By having more parameters and therefore a greater degree of freedom for the retailers, the contracts would be more sophisticated, flexible and powerful.

We believe that the mean-risk approach for our supply chain analysis under TSR contracts is meaningful. Decision makers can use the proposed models to determine the appropriate TSR contract’s parameters for achieving supply chain coordination. Moreover, our findings are useful for decision makers to better understand the conditions and properties of the menu of TSR contracts which coordinates the supply chains and maximizes the manufacturer’s expected profit with multiple mean-variance retailers. This helps the decision makers to decide how to apply TSR contracts and menu of contracts to enhance efficiency. These findings not only contribute to the literature but also provide fresh and significant insights into the risk related supply chain management.

As a future research direction, it is interesting to consider a game that allows retailers to determine their minimum expected profit requirements after knowing the contract/menu details. Moreover, besides the menu of contracts approach, whether there are any other approaches which can guarantee the achievement of SCC is also worth to explore. In addition, information asymmetry on the minimum expected profit requirement, and other heterogeneity of the retailers which are commonly found in practice, should also be considered in the future.

                            As a result, c < w(μ
                           1) < p. Therefore, w(μ
                           1), u(μ
                           1), and T(μ
                           1) given in Proposition 6.2 are within the feasible regions of w, u and T, respectively (Note: w(μi
                           ) and u(μi
                           ) are increasing in μi
                           , and T(μi
                           ) is decreasing in μi
                           ).

As T(μi
                           ) > T(μ
                           1) for all i > 1, we have g
                           1(T(μi
                           )) > g
                           1(T(μ
                           1)) > 0, and hence u(μi
                           ) > 0. Observe that, w(μn
                           ) > c implies that p > w(μ
                           1) > w(μi
                           ) > w(μn
                           ) > c. Therefore, w(μi
                           ), u(μi
                           ) and T(μi
                           ) given in Proposition 6.2 are within the feasible regions of w, u and T, respectively. Next, taking the first order derivative of T(μi
                           ) and u(μi
                           ) with respect to μi
                           , we obtain (9) and (10), respectively. Therefore, u(μi
                           ) and T(μi
                           ) given in Proposition 6.2 satisfy all of the conditions in Proposition 6.1, which implies that the non-dominating and MV-non-inferior conditions are satisfied.
