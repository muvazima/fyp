                  In this paper, we propose a Parzen window entropy based spectrum sensing algorithm for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) wall of cognitive radio primary user detection. We compute the information entropy using a non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method. Single node sensing is extended to cooperative sensing using the weighted gain combining (WGC) fusion method. The weights of WGC technique are computed using a Differential Evolution(DE) algorithm and compared with the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) method. In addition, the detection performance of the proposed Parzen window entropy is compared with Shannon entropy and energy detection techniques. We consider a DVB-T signal with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) subjected to Rayleigh fading under noise uncertainty as a primary user signal for simulation. The simulation result reveals that in the case of a single node and cooperative sensing, the proposed method achieves SNR wall of

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cognitive Radio provides a promising solution to overcome the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless communications [1]. It supports the dynamic spectrum allocation feature to drive next generation communication. Spectrum sensing is the most prominent function that detects the presence of a signal in a radio channel in Cognitive Radios. There are many sensing algorithms reported in the literature [2], including matched filtering, cyclostationary detection and energy detection. Energy detection is the simplest blind detection technique which does not require apriori information of the signal. However, it fails to detect the signal in the presence of noise uncertainty [3]. If the characteristics of the signal are known apriori, then matched filtering gives ideal results. On the contrary, cyclostationary detection senses the primary user signals under noise uncertainty by exploiting the cyclic properties of the signal at the cost of more computational complexity. The Entropy detection technique seems to be a powerful technique which detects very-low-SNR signals with reasonable complexity in less time [4,5]. In entropy based detection technique, sensing performance is exploited in both time and frequency domains [5,6]. In the time domain, entropy is constant (independent of SNR) and cannot distinguish between signal and noise. As an alternative, the frequency domain can be used to detect low-SNR signals in the presence of noise uncertainty. In these methods, the average probability density function (pdf) is characterized by histogram bin-width and a number of bins. The main drawback of histogram bins is that they are not smooth and their performance often relies on the two extreme points of the histogram. In the present paper, to counteract this effect, estimation of the density directly by the kernel pdf is proposed. Furthermore, Renyi entropy is found to be a more generalized form that increases the overall detection performance, in comparison to Shannon entropy.

Multiple Cognitive Radios are deployed for sensing to mitigate the effects of fading and shadowing. In cooperative sensing, the sensing reliability is increased by combining the individual decisions at the fusion center [7,8]. The sensing data sent by each cognitive user may not be reliable for detection, due to different channel characteristics. The sensing data are aggregated at the fusion center based on different fusion rules, i.e., soft and hard fusion techniques. In the case of hard fusion technique, each node sends binary decision value to the fusion center (FC), and the FC takes a decision by using either binary logic such as AND, OR or majority. In the case of soft fusion technique, the fusion center receives true information about the signal in contrast to binary values and applies rules such as random weights, equal gain combining (EGC) and weighted gain combining (WGC) to take the final decision. Among these, the WGC assigns the weights based on the SNR of each node giving optimum results. If the signal and noise variances are known apriori, then log-likelihood ratio test (LLR) is simple to implement [9]. In the LLR method, the weight of each node is calculated using received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). If SNR is not known a priori, then evaluation of weight is critical. However, it is not always practical to expect that the receiver node will have a priori information about noise characteristics such as variance. In this scenario, an improper approximation to weight values will lead to performance degradation.

In this paper, we propose a Parzen window-based entropy for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio. We investigate the effect of kernel-based entropy estimation for evaluating the detection performance in the frequency domain. Parzen window-based entropy estimation is robust because the primary user signal can be detected by considering fewer-samples compared to the Shannon entropy detection method in the presence of noise uncertainty with lower-false-alarm probability. The Differential Evolution algorithm is used to compute the weights of each node in cooperative sensing as it does not require a priori information about the noise characteristics.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the single node sensing using Parzen window entropy. Section 3 presents the cooperative spectrum sensing using Parzen window entropy along with the DE algorithm for weight estimation. Section 4 summarizes the proposed algorithm results and comparison with state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

In this section, we review the spectrum sensing model of cognitive radio. The binary hypothesis test for single node sensing is modeled as

In statistics, the pdf of a finite set of samples can be evaluated using non-parametric models. Kernel density estimation is one of the non-parametric approaches to estimate the pdf, p(x) for a specific point from a sample p(xn
                        ) without requiring any prior knowledge about the underlying distribution. It is also named as the Parzen–Rosenblatt window method. Let (x

                         and h is the width of the kernel. The most dominant parameter that affects the density is the width of the kernel. It is also called as a smoothing parameter and is analogous to the histogram bin-width.

The pdf of a kernel function is assumed to have zero mean and symmetric around the axis [12]. Several kernel functions like Gaussian, Skewed Unimodel, Kurtotic Unimodel, Bimodel, Trimodel, Claw, and Comb densities having different mean and variances have been represented in literature [13]. These target densities specify the various types of challenges to curve estimation. For a Gaussian kernel, the optimum value of h depends on the number of the Gaussian samples and variance of the samples (Table 1
                        ). As stated by Silverman’s rule [13], the width of a Gaussian kernel is

                         is the estimated Gaussian noise entropy that is constant for a fixed number of kernel bins (n)[5]. The computational complexity of evaluating the Shannon and Parzen entropy is O(n

The single node sensing performance can be enhanced by increasing the number of nodes or CR users. Let us assume that there are M nodes in cooperation and the Mth node having channel gain hm
                     . The hypothesis H

The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is an evolutionary computation method successfully being applied to diverse domains of science and engineering applications [16,17]. It has been reported that DE performs better than the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for optimizing numerical benchmark functions and real life optimization problems [17]. The basic DE algorithm has four major steps, (i) initialization of the population, (ii) mutation, (iii) crossover and (iv) selection process. Differential Evolution is one of the evolutionary algorithms that generate random population by solving the fitness function iteratively to meet a desired measure of quality. Here, the cumulative sum of kernel entropy is maximized to evaluate the required probability of detection. The cooperative node weights are always said to be normalized, whose cumulative sum is equal to one. The evaluation of weights for maximizing cumulative sum of kernel entropy is formulated as an optimization problem as

In this section, the performance of the proposed Parzen window entropy detection technique is investigated using a DVB-T signal with AWGN channel under Rayleigh fading environment. The DVB-T broadcasting signal includes finite-duration symbols of OFDM. There are three specifications pertaining to the signal namely bandwidth, mode, and cyclic prefix length. The carrier frequency is set to 4.8 MHz. The bandwidth of the signal varies from 6 MHz to 8 MHz. There are two modes 2K or 8K mode deciding the number of sub-carriers used in coded OFDM modulation. The 2K mode assumes 2048 and 8K mode assumes 8192 sub-carriers. A cyclic prefix is commonly used in the modulation to reduce interference. The lengths of the cyclic prefixes used in OFDM are 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32. In this paper, the mode and the number of samples are set to 2K and 256 respectively. The noise uncertainty level is considered as

                     90 dBmW in the simulations.

Multi-node sensing is incorporated to increase the probability of detection under low-SNR regime. In multi-node or cooperative spectrum sensing, each CR user is assumed to be located within 3–10 km from the primary user. Simulations were carried out by considering free space path loss. The SNR value is varied from 0 to 
                        −
                     30 dB. The SNR wall is evaluated at probability of detection Pd
                      = 0.9 assuming the probability of false alarm Pfa
                      = 0.1 and 0.01 respectively. The SNR wall of detection of the proposed Parzen window entropy detection technique is compared with the conventional histogram based Shannon and Renyi entropy detection techniques along with the basic Energy detection technique.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows the SNR wall of detection based on Parzen entropy, Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy and Energy detection techniques at Pfa
                      = 0.1. The figure clearly indicates that the Energy detection technique senses the primary user signal at an SNR of 
                        −
                     7.5 dB, whereas the Shannon entropy and Renyi entropy detection senses up to 
                        −
                     9.5 dB and 
                        −
                     13.5 dB SNR at the probability of false alarm of 0.1. In contrast, the proposed Parzen window entropy detection technique has sensed up to an SNR wall of 
                        −
                     19.25 dB. There is a significant improvement of 12 dB in SNR wall compared to the Energy detection, 10 dB compared to Shannon entropy detection and 6 dB compared to Renyi entropy detection techniques. Fig. 2
                      depicts the performance of detection of all four methods at Pfa
                      = 0.01. Here, the SNR wall attained is 
                        −
                     3 dB for Shannon entropy detection, 
                        −
                     3.5 dB for Energy detection, 
                        −
                     4.5 dB for Renyi entropy detection and 
                        −
                     9 dB for proposed Parzen window entropy detection. Most of the sensing techniques show poor performance when the false alarm probability is decreased from 0.1 to 0.01. At Pfa
                      = 0.01, the signal is sensed at an SNR value of 
                        −
                     3 dB using Energy detection, 
                        −
                     3.5 dB using Shannon entropy, 
                        −
                     4.5 dB using Renyi entropy and 
                        −
                     9 dB using Parzen entropy detection. The figure clearly depicts that the proposed technique has a remarkable performance improvement of 12 dB and 6 dB at Pfa
                      of 0.1 and 0.01 respectively.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of various detection techniques are shown in Fig. 3
                      at an SNR of 
                        −
                     10 dB. It is observed that the energy detection fails to detect the signal at a susceptible Pfa
                      of 0.1 whereas Shannon and Renyi detection techniques perform well at 0.1 false alarm probability. However, the proposed Parzen window detection method outperforms all the detectors showing superior detection performance at Pfa
                      less than 0.1.

There are three parameters Gaussian samples (n), kernel width (h) and kernel entropy that decides the performance of the proposed detection technique. Fig. 4
                      shows the relationship between the parameters. The width (h) is a scaling factor that controls how wide the probability mass is spread out around a point. The figure depicts that the width of the window decreases with increase in the number of Gaussian samples. When the width increases from 60 to 200, the entropy also increases from 4.235 to 5.2167. However, the minimum entropy reveals the minimum randomness of the primary user signal. Therefore, for choosing the best value of n, the dependence of n on entropy is also plotted in the same Fig. 4. It is observed that the least entropy of 4.267 is obtained at n = 111. Hence, this value of n was used in simulations to evaluate the performance of proposed Parzen window entropy estimation. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 5
                      that shows the plot of probability of detection for various values of n at fixed SNR of 
                        −
                     10 dB. The values of n were chosen such that the entropy was minimum. For values of n between 31 and 82, the probability of detection started from below 0.1 whereas Pd
                      increased to 0.3 for n = 94 and 105. In a similar trend, when n is further increased to 120 the starting value of Pd
                      is 0.9.

Most of the detectors show higher sensing reliability at low-SNR regime by considering more number of samples. However, the proposed method shows good sensing capability even with less number of samples. This strategy can be viewed in Fig. 6
                      for distinct values of N = 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256. The response of Pd
                      is almost same for different values of N as 64, 128 and 256. However, it deteriorates significantly for N less than 64.

As stated earlier, the DE algorithm is used to compute the normalized weights for implementing cooperative spectrum sensing. Fig. 7
                      shows the saturation of detection probability with the increase in the number of generations. Here, the number of generations and population size are set as 50 and 60 respectively. The detection behavior is observed for seven nodes with SNR ranging from 
                        −
                     10 dB to 
                        −
                     25 dB.


                     Fig. 8
                      depicts the comparison of cooperative spectrum sensing performance of proposed Parzen window technique against Shannon, Renyi and Energy detection techniques for M = 5 nodes. In a multi-node scenario, the Energy detection method yields an SNR wall of 
                        −
                     6 dB for a Rayleigh faded signal with false alarm probability of 0.1. The corresponding Shannon entropy and Renyi entropy detection techniques detect the primary user signal at an SNR of 
                        −
                     7.9 dB and 
                        −
                     13.7 dB respectively whereas the proposed Parzen window entropy has destined itself at an SNR of 
                        −
                     23.2 dB. In all the above techniques, the weights are computed using log-likelihood ratio test. It is evident from the results that the proposed method outperforms the methods mentioned above. Fig. 9
                      illustrates the detection performance of single node and multi-node (M = 3, 5 and 7) cooperative sensing of Rayleigh faded signal with noise uncertainty 
                        −
                     90 dBmW. In this simulation, the results are plotted for two different cases of soft fusion techniques. In the first case, the weights are calculated using the log-likelihood Ratio test [9]. The LLR test evaluates the weights based on variances of signal and noise. In the second case, the optimized weights are computed using the Differential Evolution algorithm [9]. For three nodes in cooperation, the SNR wall attained is 
                        −
                     21.63 dB using the LLR method and 
                        −
                     21 dB using the DE method. Similarly, if we consider five nodes, the primary user signal is sensed at an SNR of 
                        −
                     23.2 dB using the LLR method and 
                        −
                     22.7 dB using the DE method. A further increase of 
                        −
                     24.83 dB and 
                        −
                     24 dB can be achieved by increasing the number of nodes to seven. The simulation results are also tabulated in Table 2
                     . It is observed that there is a substantial increase in the detection probability with the increase in the number of nodes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, a Parzen window-based entropy for spectrum sensing which can achieve higher SNR wall than the histogram based entropy detection method is presented. The proposed detector employs kernel pdf to calculate the Renyi entropy called as Parzen window entropy. The sensing performance is significantly improved with a fewer number of samples using the proposed technique. The sensing results of the proposed method are compared with the traditional entropy detection and energy detection methods. The single node and multi-node detection simulation result revealed that a single CR user can easily detect the signal even when the signal strength is as low as 
                        −
                     19.25 dB and multiple CR users can detect 
                        −
                     24.83 dB signals. Furthermore, the most appropriate weights (for WGC) are evaluated using the LLR test and Differential evolution algorithm for implementing cooperative spectrum sensing. The accuracy of the proposed sensing technique can also be tested in real time using USRP SDR as part of a future study.
