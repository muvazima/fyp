                      surfaces such that any two abutting pieces have their derivatives match up to order k after reparameterization (see e.g. Gregory and Hahn, 1987; Boehm, 1988; Peters, 2002). Isogeometric elements are higher-order isoparametric elements of classical engineering analysis (Irons and Zienkiewic, 1968): linear combinations of isogeometric elements serve to approximately compute the solution of a differential equation over bounded, often geometrically non-trivial, regions. The term isogeometric was coined in Hughes et al. (2005) to highlight the case when the region is traced out by (shape) functions drawn from the same space as the problem unknowns (analysis functions, a.k.a. displacement functions). The space is typically spanned by tensor-product splines defined on rectangular domains (de Boor, 2002).

Until (Nguyen et al., 2014), the isogeometric approach has not been investigated near points where more or fewer than four tensor-product elements meet smoothly. (Such points are called irregular, extraordinary or star points.) Earlier work, for example (Wang et al., 2012), has the isogeometric elements join only 
                        
                           
                              C

                      along rays emanating from irregular points. Since the smooth joining of surface pieces at irregular points is governed by 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                        
                      relations, it is natural to apply the concept of geometric continuity to constructing everywhere differentiable isogeometric elements. This paper shows that when both the region's parameterization and the analysis functions are drawn from the same space of 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                        
                      continuous maps then the resulting isogeometric elements are 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                        
                     . This observation formed the background for the second author's presentations in early 2014 Peters (2014), with the publication (Nguyen et al., 2014) illustrating the approach. Already (Kiendl et al., 2009) hinted at the use of geometric continuity by suggesting to uniformly stretch one of the domains of two abutting tensor-product functions. Such stretching represents a very special case of 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      continuity, that is called parametric continuity to emphasize that the union of both domains can be embedded in the plane by an affine change of variables. However, uniform stretching does not provide the change of variables necessary to address the general challenge presented by irregular points.

The goal of the present paper is to formally prove the statement of the title and to thereby provide a theoretical framework for 
                        
                           
                              G

                              C

                     -elements. Such elements can readily be constructed from the rich literature on geometric surface constructions or be based on new constructions in that field. For example, the construction in Scott et al. (2013) (see also Westgaard and Nowacki, 2001; Peters, 1995) could be used to build an isogeometric element rather than to just serve as a surface definition in the context of the boundary element method (there, linear combinations of trivariate Green's functions are to be determined, a setup quite different from the one discussed in the present paper).

To keep the paper focused, we do not discuss the interesting and practically relevant issue of polynomial reproduction near irregular points, a property known under the name of ‘flexibility’ in the geometric design literature. It is only recently that 
                        
                           
                              G

                      surface constructions that reproduce all quadratic modes at the extraordinary point have been derived (see e.g. Karčiauskas and Peters, 2015).

The paper also does not comment on the related but different approach of using subdivision surfaces for isogeometric analysis (see e.g. Cirak et al., 2002) and it does not comment on methods that approximately enforce angle constraints through penalty functions, such as bending strips (Kiendl et al., 2010).

Most recently, the technical report (Kapl et al., 2014), posted after submission of this paper, follows up on the theory and computations in Peters (2014), Nguyen et al. (2014) by exploring the space of

                     Appendix A shows that the definition of jets also carries over, essentially unchanged, to half-spaces. Jets on half-spaces are used in the definition of geometric continuity below.


                     Geometric continuity. Geometric continuity refers to matching geometric invariants. However, for practical constructions, the following parameterization-based definition of matching derivatives after a change of coordinates is widely accepted and equivalent in most relevant cases (Peters, 2002, Sect. 3). We formulate geometric continuity in m variables as follows.

                     -manifold constructions is natural. The point of Theorem 1 is to formally justify this approach and to lay a foundation from which to address issues of approximation, flexibility and polynomial reproduction. For, as a consequence of Theorem 1,

                     -manifold constructions can be used to devise smooth isogeometric elements for regular as well as irregular layouts, in any number of variables. In particular, existing

                      surface constructions in the literature can directly be used to solve differential equations both on surfaces and on planar regions where more or fewer than four four-sided pieces come together – with the value of each construction depending on their individual approximation and convergence properties.
