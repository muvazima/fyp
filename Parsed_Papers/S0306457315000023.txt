                  Semantic similarity assessment between concepts is an important task in many language related applications. In the past, several approaches to assess similarity by evaluating the knowledge modeled in an (or multiple) ontology (or ontologies) have been proposed. However, there are some limitations such as the facts of relying on predefined ontologies and fitting non-dynamic domains in the existing measures. Wikipedia provides a very large domain-independent encyclopedic repository and semantic network for computing semantic similarity of concepts with more coverage than usual ontologies. In this paper, we propose some novel feature based similarity assessment methods that are fully dependent on Wikipedia and can avoid most of the limitations and drawbacks introduced above. To implement similarity assessment based on feature by making use of Wikipedia, firstly a formal representation of Wikipedia concepts is presented. We then give a framework for feature based similarity based on the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts. Lastly, we investigate several feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures resulting from instantiations of the framework. The evaluation, based on several widely used benchmarks and a benchmark developed in ourselves, sustains the intuitions with respect to human judgements. Overall, several methods proposed in this paper have good human correlation and constitute some effective ways of determining similarity between Wikipedia concepts.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Semantic similarity between concepts is becoming a common problem for many applications of Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence such as natural language processing, knowledge acquisition, information retrieval, and word sense disambiguation (Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006; Liu, Bao, & Xu, 2012; Sanchez, Batet, Isern, & Valls, 2012). Proper assessment of concept similarity improves the understanding of textual resources and increases the accuracy of knowledge based applications. The notion of similarity is to identify concepts having common “characteristics”. Semantic similarity is understood as the degree of taxonomic proximity between concepts (or terms, words). In other words, semantic similarity states how taxonomically near two concepts (or terms, words) are, because they share some aspects of their meaning. Technically, similarity measures assess a numerical score that quantifies this proximity as a function of the semantic evidence observed in one or several knowledge sources (Sanchez & Batet, 2013). In fact, assessing semantic similarity between concepts (or terms, words) has been and continues to be widely studied, and is a central and common issue in many research areas such as Psychology, Linguistics, Cognitive Science, Biomedicine, and Artificial Intelligence (Liu et al., 2012; Pirro, 2009). Roughly speaking, semantic similarity measurement relates to computing the similarity between concepts (or words, terms, short text expressions), having the same meaning or related information, but which are not lexicographically similar (Li, Bandar, & McLean, 2003; Martinez-Gil & Aldana-Montes, 2013). Up to the present, research on semantic similarity has been very active and many results have been achieved (Martinez-Gil, 2014).

Making judgments about the semantic similarity of different concepts is a routine yet deceptively complex task. To perform it, people draw on an immense amount of background knowledge about the concepts. Any attempt to compute semantic similarity automatically must also consult external sources of knowledge. Most of the work dealing with semantic similarity measures has been developed using taxonomies and more general ontologies, which provide a formal and machine-readable way to express a shared conceptualization by means of a unified terminology and semantic inter-relations from which semantic similarity can be assessed (Batet, Sanchez, Valls, & Gibert, 2013; Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006; Couto, Silva, & Coutinho, 2007; Cross, Yu, & Hu, 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003; Sanchez & Batet, 2013; Sanchez, Batet, Valls, & Gibert, 2010; Sanchez et al., 2012). According to the theoretical principles and the way in which ontologies are analyzed to estimate similarity, different families of methods can also be identified (Sanchez & Batet, 2013). These families are (Martinez-Gil, 2014; Petrakis, Varelas, Hliaoutakis, & Raftopoulou, 2006): (1) edge counting measures: which consists of taking into account the length of the path linking the concepts (or terms) and the position of the concepts (or terms) in a given dictionary (or taxonomy, ontology) (Leacock & Chodorow, 1998; Li et al., 2003; Rada, Mili, Bicknell, & Blettner, 1989); (2) information content measures: which consists of measuring the difference of the information content of the two concepts (or terms) as a function of their probability of occurrence in a text corpus (or an ontology) (Buggenhout & Ceusters, 2005; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995, 1999; Sanchez & Batet, 2013; Sanchez et al., 2010); (3) feature based measures: which consists of measuring the similarity between concepts (or terms) as a function of their properties or based on their relationships to other similar concepts (or terms) (Banerjee & Pedersen, 2003; Petrakis et al., 2006; Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003; Sanchez et al., 2012); (4) hybrid measures: which consists of combining all of the above (Batet et al., 2013; Pirro, 2009; Schickel-Zuber & Faltings, 2007).

In a nutshell, edge counting measures base the similarity assessment on the number of taxonomical links of the minimum path separating two concepts contained in a given ontology (Li et al., 2003; Rada et al., 1989). The main advantage of edge counting measures is their simplicity. They only rely on the graph model of an input ontology whose evaluation requires a low computational cost. Due to their simplicity, these approaches offer a limited accuracy due to ontologies model a large amount of taxonomical knowledge that is not considered during the evaluation of the minimum path (Batet, Sanchez, & Valls, 2011; Sanchez & Batet, 2013). In another perspective, the main assumption of edge counting measures is that an edge represents the same semantic distance anywhere in the structure of the graph (or path), which is not true as sections of the graph may be finely classified and others only coarsely defined (Mathur & Dinakarpandian, 2012).

To acknowledge some of the limitations of edge counting measures, Resnik (1995) proposes to complement the taxonomical structure of an ontology with the information distribution of concepts evaluated in input corpora (Sanchez et al., 2012). Information Content (IC) based approaches assess the similarity between concepts as a function of the information content that both concepts have in common in a given ontology. In the past, IC was typically computed from concept distribution in tagged textual corpora (Jiang & Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995). However, this introduces a dependency on corpora availability and manual tagging that hampered their accuracy and applicability due to data sparseness (Sanchez et al., 2010). To overcome this problem, in recent years several researchers have proposed ways to infer IC of concepts in an intrinsic manner from the knowledge structure modeled in an ontology (Sanchez & Batet, 2011, 2013; Sanchez, Batet, & Isern, 2011). However, the fact that intrinsic IC-based measures only rely on ontological knowledge is also a drawback because they completely depend on the degree of coverage and detail of the unique input ontology (Sanchez & Batet, 2013).

To overcome the limitations of edge counting measures regarding the fact that taxonomical links in an ontology do not necessary represent uniform distances, feature based measures are addressed by considering the degree of overlapping between sets of ontological features (Sanchez et al., 2012). As a result, they are more general and, potentially, they could be applied in cross ontology similarity estimation settings (i.e., when concept pairs belong to two different ontologies), a situation in which edge counting methods cannot be directly applied (Petrakis et al., 2006; Sanchez et al., 2012). So, on the contrary to edge counting measures which are based on the notion of minimum path distance, feature based approaches estimate similarity between concepts according to the weighted sum of the amount of common and non-common features. By features, authors usually consider taxonomic and non-taxonomic information modeled in an ontology, in addition to concept descriptions (e.g., glosses) retrieved from dictionaries (Petrakis et al., 2006; Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003; Tversky, 1977). Due to the additional semantic evidences considered during the assessment, they potentially improve edge counting approaches (Sanchez & Batet, 2013).

There are still some limitations in the above-mentioned ontology based similarity measures (Batet et al., 2011; Batet et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Sanchez & Batet, 2011, 2013; Sanchez et al., 2011; Sanchez et al., 2012). In fact, similarity estimation is based on the extraction of semantic evidence from one or several knowledge sources. The more available the background knowledge is and the better its structure is, the more accurate the estimation will potentially be. Usually, these knowledge sources can be well-defined semantic networks such as WordNet (Ahsaee, Naghibzadeh, & Naeini, 2014; Fellbaum, 1998; Liu et al., 2012) or more domain-dependant ontologies such as Gene Ontology (Couto et al., 2007; Mathur & Dinakarpandian, 2012) and biomedical ontologies MeSH or SNOMED CT (Batet et al., 2013; Pedersen, Pakhomov, Patwardhan, & Chute, 2007; Sanchez & Batet, 2011). On the one hand, the prerequisite of ontology based similarity measures is the existence of a (or several) predefined domain ontology (or ontologies). Such ontologies are established by a panel experts in the given domains. Clearly, the construction process of domain ontologies is time-consuming and error-prone and maintaining these ontologies also requires a lot of effort from experts. Thus, the methods of ontology based similarity measures are limited in scope and scalability. On the other hand, while WordNet (or domain ontology) represents a well structured taxonomy organized in a meaningful way, questions arise about the need for a larger coverage. Especially, with the emergence of social networks or instant messaging systems (Martinez-Gil & Aldana-Montes, 2013; Retzer, Yoong, & Hooper, 2012), a lot of (sets of) concepts or terms (proper nouns, brands, acronyms, new words, conversational words, technical terms and so on) are not included in WordNet and domain ontologies (in fact Web users can publish whatever they want to share with the rest of the world by using Wikis, Blogs and online communities at present), therefore, similarity measures that are based on these kinds of knowledge resources (i.e., WordNet or domain ontologies) cannot be used in these tasks. These limitations are the motivation behind the new techniques presented in this paper which infer semantic similarity from a kind of new source of information, i.e., a wide coverage online encyclopedia, namely Wikipedia (Hovy, Navigli, & Ponzetto, 2013; Medelyan, Milne, Legg, & Witten, 2009). Several researchers like Ponzetto and Strube (2007), Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007, 2009), Zesch, Muller, and Gurevych (2008), Taieb, Aouicha, Tmar, and Hamadou (2012), and Yazdani and Popescu-Belis (2013) have worked on the problem of semantic relatedness measures for concepts (or terms, words) by making use of Wikipedia. It is important to note that semantic similarity and semantic relatedness are two separate notions. Semantic relatedness is a more general notion of the relatedness of concepts, while similarity is a special case of relatedness that is tied to the likeness of the concepts (see Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006 for a discussion of semantic similarity and semantic relatedness). For example, antonyms (e.g., “increase” vs. “decrease”) are related, but not similar. Or, following Resnik (1995), “car” and “bicycle” are more similar than “car” and “gasoline”, though the latter pair may seem more related in the world (Yazdani & Popescu-Belis, 2013). In this paper hyperlinks between Wikipedia articles (or Wikipedia concepts) are not considered, so in the following we will use the term of semantic similarity.

The purpose of this paper is to present several new feature based similarity measures to solve the shortcomings of existing approaches for semantic similarity. The present paper focuses on the study of semantic similarity between concepts (or words, terms) drawn from Wikipedia (Wikipedia concepts, i.e., the titles of Wikipedia articles). In other words, we approach the problem of feature based semantic similarity between Wikipedia concepts from a novel perspective by making use of Wikipedia. Thus, the terminologies of Wikipedia concepts, concepts, and words can be used interchangeably. The author prefers to use concepts but some readers may interpret them to be terms or words instead. Since Wikipedia is a rich encyclopedia (or corpus, thesaurus, network structure) that covers almost all imaginable sources, thus, the method to similarity measures based on Wikipedia presented in this paper can process lots of terms (i.e., proper nouns, brands, acronyms, new words, conversational words, technical terms and so on) that Web users publish by social networks such as Wikis and be used in dynamic domains.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly review some background on feature based similarity and Wikipedia. Section 3 presents some feature based approaches to similarity assessment using Wikipedia in detail. This includes the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts, a framework for feature based similarity, and several feature based measures resulting from instantiations of the framework. Section 4 is devoted to presenting evaluation of our approaches. Finally, in Section 5, we draw our conclusion and present some perspectives for future research.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

For completeness of presentation and convenience of subsequent discussions, in the current section we will briefly recall some basic notions of feature based similarity and Wikipedia. See especially (Medelyan et al., 2009; Petrakis et al., 2006; Ponzetto & Strube, 2007; Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003; Sanchez et al., 2012) for further details.

Feature based approaches to similarity measures assess similarity between concepts as a function of their properties. This is based on the Tversky’s model of similarity (Tversky, 1977), which, derived from the set theory, takes into account common and non-common features of compared terms, subtracting the latter from the former ones. In fact, common features tend to increase similarity and non-common ones tend to diminish it. According to Tversky, the similarity of a concept a to a concept b is a function of the features common to a and b, those in a but not in b and those in b but not in a. Admitting a function ψ(c) that yields the set of features relevant to c, Tversky proposed the following similarity function:

                        ψ(b) is the intersection between those two sets of features,

                              b
                              )
                           
                         is the set obtained when eliminating the elements of ψ(b) from the set of features of concept a, ψ(a), and α, β and γ are parameters that provide for differences in focus on the different components. According to Tversky, similarity is not symmetric, that is, simtve
                        (a,
                        b)≠
                        simtve
                        (b,
                        a) because subjects tend to focus more on one object than on the other depending on the way the comparison experiment has been laid out (Pirro, 2009).

The definition of the set of features is crucial in this model. Goodman (1972) argues that assessing similarity between objects a and b is vague and meaningless without a “frame of reference”. He states “‘is similar to’ functions as little more than a blank to be filled”. Asking the question “How similar are a and b?” begs the answer to a subtly different question “How are a and b similar?” (Medin, Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993). Thus, crucial to similarity assessment is the method to select on what features similarity is being judged (Cross et al., 2013). The existing approaches rely on information that is available in ontologies, in particular the set of synonyms (called synsets in WordNet Fellbaum, 1998), definitions (i.e., glosses, containing textual descriptions of word senses) and different kinds of semantic relationships are considered (Sanchez et al., 2012).


                        Rodriguez and Egenhofer (2003) present a kind of approach to computing semantic similarity. The similarity is computed as the weighted sum of similarities between synsets, features (e.g., meronyms, attributes, etc.) and neighbor concepts (those linked via semantic pointers) of evaluated terms:

A feature based function called X-similarity relies on the matching between synsets and term description sets (Petrakis et al., 2006). The term description sets contain words extracted by parsing term definitions (“glosses” in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or “scope notes” in MeSH (Batet et al., 2013)). Two terms are similar if their synsets or description sets or, the synsets of the terms in their neighborhood (e.g., more specific and more general terms) are lexically similar. The similarity function is expressed as follows:

                        where i denotes relationship type. Because not all terms in the neighborhood of a term are connected with the same relationship, so each different semantic relation type (i.e., Is-A and Part-Of for WordNet and only Is-A for MeSH) is computed separately and the maximum (considering all the synsets of all concepts up to the root of each hierarchy) is taken.

Equivalently, the similarity for description sets Sdescriptions
                         and synonyms Ssynsets

                         requires little introduction or explanation. As everyone knows, it was launched in 2001 with the goal of building free encyclopedia in all languages. Today it is easily the largest, most widely used, and fastest growing encyclopedia in existence (Medelyan et al., 2009). Being a collaborative open source medium, Wikipedia is edited by volunteers. It provides a very large domain-independent encyclopedic repository (Ponzetto & Strube, 2007). The English version, as of 12 July 2014, contains 4,554,919 articles. It represents a vast investment of freely given manual effort and judgment, and the last few years have seen a multitude of papers that apply it to a host of different problems (Ittoo & Bouma, 2013; Kaptein & Kamps, 2013; Medelyan et al., 2009; Nothman, Ringland, Radford, Murphy, & Curran, 2013; Sorg & Cimiano, 2012; Yazdani & Popescu-Belis, 2013). Wikipedia is a multilingual Web based encyclopedia. From its inception the Wikipedia project offered a unique, entirely open, collaborative editing process, scaffolded by then – new Wiki software for group website building, and it is fascinating to see how it has flourished under this system. It has effectively enabled the entire world to become a panel of experts, authors and reviewers – contributing under their own name, or, if they wish, anonymously. The text in Wikipedia is highly structured. Traditional paper encyclopedias consist of articles arranged alphabetically, with internal cross-references to other articles, external references to the academic literature, and some kind of general index of topics. These structural features have been adapted by Wikipedia for the online environment, and some new features added that arise from the Wiki editing process (Medelyan et al., 2009). The structure of Wikipedia is as follows (Medelyan et al., 2009; Ponzetto & Strube, 2007).


                        Articles: The basic unit of information in Wikipedia is the article. Articles are written in a form of free text that follows a comprehensive set of editorial and structural guidelines in order to promote consistency and cohesion. Each article describes a single concept, and there is a single article for each concept. Article titles are succinct phrases that resemble terms in a conventional thesaurus.


                        Redirect pages: A redirect page is one with no text other than a directive in the form of a direct link. These pages are used to redirect the query to the actual article page containing information about the entity denoted by the query. This is used to point alternative expressions for an entity to the same article, and accordingly models synonymy.


                        Disambiguation pages: Instead of taking readers to an article named by the term, the Wikipedia search engine sometimes takes them directly to disambiguation page where they can click on the meaning they want. These pages collect links for a number of possible entities the original query could be pointed to. This models homonymy.


                        Hyperlinks: Articles are peppered with hyperlinks to other articles. Because the terms used as anchors are often couched in different words, Wikipedia’s hyperlinks are also useful as an additional source of synonyms not captured by redirects. Hyperlinks also complement disambiguation pages by encoding polysemy. In particular, articles mentioning other encyclopedic entries point to them through internal hyperlinks. This models article cross-reference.


                        Category structure: Since May 2004 Wikipedia provides also a semantic network by means of its categories: articles can be assigned one or more categories, which are further categorized to provide a so-called “category tree”. In practice, this “tree” is not designed as a strict hierarchy, but allows multiple categorization schemes to coexist simultaneously. The category system is considered a directed acyclic graph, though the encyclopedia editing software does not prevent the users to create cycles in the graph (which nevertheless should be avoided according to the Wikipedia categorization guidelines, Ponzetto & Strube, 2007). Categories are not themselves articles. They are merely nodes for organizing the articles they contain, with a minimum of explanatory text.

In this section we propose some feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures of concepts using Wikipedia. In order to illustrate these feature based approaches, we first present the notion of formal representation of Wikipedia concepts. We then give a framework for feature based similarity based on the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts. Lastly, we investigate several feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures resulting from instantiations of the framework.

The basic unit of information in Wikipedia is the article. Each article describes a single concept, and there is a single article for each concept. The choice of Wikipedia articles as concepts is quite natural, as each article is focused on a single issue, which it discusses in detail. That is, each Wikipedia article describes a complete entity, so-called concept (i.e., a complete representation of the information drawn by one Wikipedia article). A concept is compound by an identifier name or title, a set of alternative aliases or synonyms, Wikipedia glosses (glosses for short, i.e., the first paragraph of text of Wikipedia articles), a set of anchor texts (or anchors for short, i.e., labels of internal hyperlinks in Wikipedia articles) that are some Wikipedia concepts and the categories to which it belongs. Wikipedia article titles are succinct phrases that resemble terms in a conventional thesaurus. In what follows, we call the titles of Wikipedia articles as Wikipedia concepts. Let us now focus on the Wikipedia page for Artificial Intelligence (Fig. 1
                        ), which we will use in the remainder of this paper as our primary source of examples.

Formally, the Wikipedia concept Artificial Intelligence can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.

Now we propose the definition of formal representation of Wikipedia concepts.
                           Definition 1
                           Let A be a Wikipedia article and Con be the title of A. The formal representation of Wikipedia concept Con is defined as follows:
                                 
                                    
                                       Con
                                       =

                                       Synonyms

                                       Glosses
                                       ,
                                       Anchors
                                       ,
                                       Categories
                                       〉
                                       ,
                                    
                                 
                              where Synonyms
                              ={Con,

                              Conm
                              } is the set of synonyms of Con, Glosses is the first paragraph of text of A, Anchors
                              ={Anc

                              } is the set of anchor texts (i.e., labels of internal hyperlinks) in A, and Categories
                              ={Cat
                              1,…,

                              } is the set of categories of A.


                        Fig. 2
                         is a formal representation of Wikipedia concept Artificial Intelligence. Obviously, the values of Glosses, Anchors, and Categories may be obtained from Wikipedia articles directly. We can get the value of Synonyms by making use of the redirect page (see Section 2.2). Technically, we also may exploit the property wikiPageRedirects of DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2009) to obtain the value of Synonyms. Fig. 3
                         shows part of the value of Synonyms for Artificial Intelligence.

It should be noted that not all anchors (labels of internal hyperlinks) in Wikipedia articles are in the set Anchors. For example, approaches, tools, and applications in the Wikipedia concept Artificial Intelligence (see Fig. 1) are not in the set Anchors, because they do not represent Wikipedia concepts here.

It is well known that the definition of the set of features is crucial in feature based measures. From Definition 1 (formal representation of Wikipedia concepts), it is obvious to know that the four parts Synonyms, Glosses, Anchors, and Categories of Wikipedia concepts can be looked as the features of Wikipedia concepts. Thus, we may give some methods of semantic similarity measures for Wikipedia concepts by exploiting the above mentioned four kinds of features. For each feature, we have different notions for semantic similarity measures. For example, for the feature Glosses, we can use Gloss overlap method (Lesk, 1986), Extended Gloss overlap method (Banerjee & Pedersen, 2003), SyMSS approach (Oliva, Serrano, Castillo, & Iglesias, 2011), semantic text similarity method (Islam & Inkpen, 2008), or LInSTSS approach (Furlan, Batanovic, & Nikolic, 2013) to measure their similarity. Of course, we also can define some novel approaches to similarity measures for Glosses of Wikipedia concepts based on Tversky’s model of similarity (Tversky, 1977) or X-similarity model (Petrakis et al., 2006).

Clearly, to present these feature based approaches to similarity measures, we need a framework for these approaches firstly.

Obviously, to give the similarity measure between Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, we first have to compute the similarity measures for Ssynonyms
                              (Synonyms,
                              Synonyms′), Sglosses
                              (Glosses,
                              Glosses′), Sanchors
                              (Anchors,
                              Anchors′), and Scategories
                              (Categories,
                              Categories′). For instance, we can utilize {Artificial intelligence, Cybernetics, Formal sciences, Technology in society, Computational neuroscience, Emerging technologies, Unsolved problems in computer science} and {Learning in computer vision, Machine learning, Learning, Cybernetics} to define the similarity of Categories and Categories′.

                              ={See
                              1,…,

Form Section 3.2 we know that we can obtain different feature based approaches to similarity assessment resulting from instantiations of the framework presented in Definition 2. For example, we can make use of the approaches presented in (Banerjee & Pedersen, 2003; Furlan et al., 2013; Islam & Inkpen, 2008; Lesk, 1986; Oliva et al., 2011) to define the function Sglosses
                         (see Section 3.2). In this paper, we study feature based methods. Thus, we will propose some novel feature based approaches to similarity measures for Wikipedia concepts by extending the existing feature based approaches such as Tversky’s approach of similarity (Tversky, 1977), X-similarity approach (Petrakis et al., 2006), R&E approach (Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003), or Ontology based approach (Sanchez et al., 2012).

For any Wikipedia concept Con
                        =〈Synonyms,
                        Glosses,
                        Anchors,
                        Categories〉, Synonyms, Anchors, and Categories are sets of terms (or words, concepts), i.e., they have the same abstract representation, however, Glosses is a string representation. Clearly, we can transform Glosses into a set of terms (or words, concepts). Here we introduce a kind of simple method. Concretely, given a string s, we can obtain the corresponding set Setglosses of terms (or words, concepts) using the following method: each word in the string representation s is transformed into an element of the set Setglosses. For instance, given a Glosses “Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also an academic field of study,…”, the corresponding set Setglosses
                        ={Artificial, intelligence, AI, is, the, intelligence, exhibited, by, machines, or, software, It, also, an, academic, field, of, study, …}.
                           Remark 2
                           We may pre-process the Glosses of Wikipedia concept before it is transformed into a set of words. For example, we may eliminate all special characters, punctuations (e.g., parentheses), and stop words (e.g., “a”, “an”, “and”, “be”, “of”, and “is”). On the other hand, we can consider that all of inflected variants of a word represent the same concept. For instance, the stem of the verb ‘test’ includes all inflected variants, such as ‘tests’, ‘tested’ and ‘testing’. For word stemming, various algorithms exist and can be applied (Chen, Bau, & Yeh, 2011), such as Paice/Husk algorithm (Paice, 1990) and Porter algorithm (Porter, 1980). The pre-processing should find the original form of word. In this paper we will consider the pre-processing and let the formal representation of Wikipedia concept Con is defined as 〈Synonyms,
                              Setglosses,
                              Anchors,
                              Categories〉.

Since Synonyms, Setglosses, Anchors, and Categories are sets of terms (or words, concepts), thus, we can define the functions Ssynonyms
                        , Sglosses
                        , Sanchors
                        , and Scategories
                         by making use of a uniform form. Without loss of generality, we assume that there are two sets of terms (or words, concepts) Set
                        1 and Set
                        2. Obviously, these two sets may be Synonyms, Setglosses, Anchors, or Categories. According to X-similarity approach (Petrakis et al., 2006) or R&E approach (Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003), we have the following similarity computation methods for Set
                        1 and Set
                        2:

On the other hand, the sets Synonyms, Setglosses, Anchors, and Categories have different meanings, in particular, Synonyms is a set of synonyms and Categories comes from category structure of Wikipedia (Kaptein & Kamps, 2013; Ponzetto & Strube, 2007), where category structure of Wikipedia can be looked as a general (or domain-independent) ontology. Aiming at the characteristics of Synonyms and Categories, we can provide some novel similarity methods for Wikipedia concepts.

Since Synonyms is a set of synonyms, so we may define the function Ssynonyms
                         as follows: given any two sets of synonyms Synonyms
                        1 and Synonyms

Since May 2004 Wikipedia provides also a semantic network by means of its categories: articles can be assigned one or more categories, which are further categorized to provide a so-called category structure. For example, the article Artificial intelligence is assigned seven categories (see Fig. 1): Artificial intelligence, Cybernetics, Formal sciences, Technology in society, Computational neuroscience, Emerging technologies, and Unsolved problems in computer science. Obviously, the categories of an article such as Artificial intelligence, Cybernetics, and Formal sciences can be considered as some concepts. In Fig. 5
                         a small part of the category hierarchy is shown. The category “Artificial intelligence” has 31 subcategories such as Artificial intelligence applications and Artificial intelligence researchers. Two hundred and fifty-eight pages are assigned to the category, and it has seven parent categories, listed at the bottom of the page: Intelligence by type, Areas of computer science, Cognitive science, Cybernetics, Neuroscience, Futurology, and Personhood. In fact, Wikipedia categories are organized in a loose hierarchy. Some cycles of linked categories exist, but the guideline is to avoid them. In practice, category structure is a kind of directed acyclic graph, thus, category structure may be considered as a huge and comprehensive ontology. Thus, we can define the function Scategories
                         by extending the ontology based approach to similarity measure (Sanchez et al., 2012). Now we propose the definition of Scategories
                         formally.
                           Definition 3

                              <
                              c means that a is a subcategory of c or c is a parent category of a. a

                              c means that a is a parent category of c or c is a subcategory of a. a

Wikipedia category structure is a huge and comprehensive “category network” (i.e., graph), in fact, the strength of Wikipedia lies in its size, which could be used to overcome the limited coverage and scalability issues of current knowledge bases. However, the large size represents also a challenge: the search space in the Wikipedia category structure (i.e., graph) is very large in terms of depth, branching factor and multiple inheritance relations. Problems arise also in finding robust methods for retrieving (or obtaining) relevant information (Ponzetto & Strube, 2007). For example, in Definition 4, the large amount of nodes in Wikipedia category structure requires an efficient algorithm for obtaining the value of μ(a). Therefore, to compute μ(a) efficiently, in what follows we propose an approximate method via limited neighborhood of Wikipedia category structure.

Intuitively, k-neighborhood(a) represents the set of nodes that are hyponyms or hypernyms of a, hyponyms (resp., hypernyms) of hypernyms (resp., hyponyms) of a via at most k edges (i.e., superconcept relations or subconcept relations) or the concept a itself in Wikipedia category structure. It is easy to know that k-neighborhood(a) is a subgraph of the Wikipedia category structure.

According to Definition 6, we can obtain the approximate features describing the concept a

Similarly to the ontology based approach (Sanchez et al., 2012) (see Definitions 3 and 4 in Sanchez et al., 2012), we can give the notions of dissimilarity or approximate dissimilarity for concepts (i.e., categories) in Wikipedia category structure.

Now we can provide the notions of similarity (or approximate similarity) between categories a and b as follows:
                           Definition 10
                           The similarity (resp., approximate similarity) Simcat

                              ×
                              CA
                              →[0,1] (resp., Simkcat
                              : k-NV(a)×
                              k-NV(b)→[0,1]) between a and b according to their features is defined as:


                              
                                 
                                    
                                       Simcat
                                       (a,
                                       b)=1−
                                       disnorm
                                       (a,
                                       b) and


                                       Simkcat
                                       (a,
                                       b)=1−
                                       disknorm
                                       (a,
                                       b).

From Definition 10 we know that the similarity between two categories has been presented based on normalized dissimilarity. Since Categories in Wikipedia concept Con
                              =〈Synonyms,
                              Setglosses,
                              Anchors,
                              Categories〉 is a set of categories {Cat
                              1,…,
                              Catk
                              }, so we can give the notion of the function Scategories
                               by making use of Simcat
                               or Simkcat
                              .

With regard to the computation of similarity for sets of categories, the approach has been inspired by the method for evaluating concept similarity defined within the Enterprise Ontology Management Tool SymOntos (Formica & Missikoff, 2002) and Formal Concept Analysis (Formica, 2006). Essentially, it is based on the maximum weighted matching problem in bipartite graphs, that can be solved in polynomial time (Galil, 1986). Informally, it is illustrated as follows.

Obviously, we can propose some approaches to similarity measures for Wikipedia concepts by exploiting the functions Ssynonyms
                               and Scategories
                               (or Skcategories

                               is the average or max. Given two Wikipedia concepts Con

It is worth noting that a framework of similarity measures for Wikipedia concepts is presented in this paper. Twelve kinds of approaches to semantic similarity measures (see SimFirCon
                              ,
                              SimSecCon
                              ,…,

                              ) for Wikipedia concepts resulting from instantiations of the framework are also proposed. Clearly, we can provide more methods to similarity measures by instantiating the framework (e.g., use the approaches presented in (Banerjee & Pedersen, 2003; Furlan et al., 2013; Islam & Inkpen, 2008; Lesk, 1986; Oliva et al., 2011) to define the function Sglosses
                              ).

To validate the effectiveness of semantic similarity measure methods proposed here and to evaluate them, in this section we will use real-world datasets to compute semantic similarity for Wikipedia concepts. Concretely, we use Wikipedia as the data resource of our experiments. For environment of our evaluation, the version of Wikipedia used to obtain our measures is released on 4 June 2013, and we use JWPL
                        3
                        
                           https://code.google.com/p/jwpl/.
                     
                     
                        3
                      (Java Wikipedia Library), Java with JavaTM 2 SDK and MySQL to program and implement our approaches. At the same time, in our experiments we eliminate all special characters, punctuations, and stop words. We also consider that all of inflected variants of a word represent the same concept, concretely, for word stemming, we use Porter algorithm (Porter, 1980).

It is well known that an objective evaluation of the accuracy of semantic similarity functions is difficult because the notion of similarity is subjective. Generally, semantic similarity measures are evaluated by means of standard benchmarks of word pairs whose similarity has been assessed by a group of human experts. However, in this paper we evaluate the semantic similarity for Wikipedia concepts such as “Artificial intelligence” and “Machine learning”. Thus, comparison of the proposed methods with standard benchmarks imposes some challenges and requires some modifications and adjustments in order to make such comparison meaningful. The comparative experiments have been grouped into two parts.

Firstly, we evaluate the proposed semantic similarity measures for concepts which come from three widely used benchmarks, namely Miller and Charles’ benchmark (hereafter referred to as M&C) (Miller & Charles, 1991), Rubenstein and Goodenough’s benchmark (R&G) (Rubenstein & Goodenough, 1965), and the WordSimilarity-353 Test Collection
                        4
                        
                           http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/wordsim353.html.
                     
                     
                        4
                      (353-TC, we only consider its test data subset, i.e., 153 word pairs) (Finkelstein et al., 2002). Since some word pairs in M&C, R&G, and 353-TC do not appear in Wikipedia concepts, therefore, we only consider the word pairs in M&C, R&G, and 353-TC that also appear in Wikipedia concepts. On the other hand, some words in M&C, R&G, and 353-TC appear in disambiguation pages of Wikipedia, our experiments do not consider these words since we do not investigate the approach to disambiguation of Wikipedia concepts in this paper. Therefore, we need to select some words in Wikipedia concepts manually in our experiments. Concretely, there are 13 word pairs from M&C, 28 word pairs from R&G, and 94 word pairs from 353-TC that also appear in Wikipedia concepts. Some comparison of our approaches to human judgements (HJ, i.e., M&C, R&G, and 353-TC) for this test is shown in Table 1
                      (we only list the results of 13 word pairs from M&C, 28 word pairs from R&G, and 30 word pairs from 353-TC, and Fir,
                     Sec,…,
                     Twe stand for SimFirCon
                     ,
                     SimSecCon
                     ,…,
                     SimTweCon
                     , respectively).


                     Table 2
                      shows the correlation coefficients of the different measures with human judgements, where we assign k
                     =10 in k-neighborhoods.

Secondly, our similarity measure methods use Wikipedia to act as information source. It is well known that Wikipedia is a rich encyclopedia that covers almost all imaginable sources, thus, the presented methods to similarity measures may deal with lots of Wikipedia concepts that Web users publish by Wikis. To evaluate the accuracy of semantic similarity of our methods for Wikipedia concepts, we will develop a benchmark and then use the benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of our proposals.

For comparison purposes, we have selected 30 pairs of real-world Wikipedia concepts as shown in Table 3
                     . The similarity between each pair is assessed by 10 students and 10 teachers in a scale between 0 (semantically unrelated) and 4 (highly synonymous). After a normalization process, a final set of 30 concept pairs is rated with the average of the similarity values provided by the students and the teachers. Thus, this benchmark is created and can be used to evaluate the accuracy of our approaches. That is, this permits an objective evaluation of similarity measures exploiting Wikipedia as knowledge source. Our benchmark (OB, i.e., the average of the similarity values provided by the 10 students and the 10 teachers) is shown in Tables 3 and 4
                      shows the correlation coefficients of the different measures with our benchmark, where we assign k
                     =10 in k-neighborhoods.

From the above experimental results (see Tables 1–4) we know that most results accord with our intuition, in particular, we can see that some of our similarity measures obtain higher correlation values (i.e., most of the correlation values are greater than 0.5, see Bold results in Tables 2 and 4). This indicates that some approaches to similarity measures proposed here are effective. On the other hand, comparing the twelve kinds of approaches to semantic similarity measures (i.e., SimFirCon
                     ,
                     SimSecCon
                     ,…,
                     SimTweCon
                     ) presented in this paper, from Tables 2 and 4 we know that the methods SimFirCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimThiCon
                     , SimFouCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , SimEigCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                      can outperform the measures SimFifCon
                     , SimSixCon
                     , SimNinCon
                     , and SimTenCon
                      in the general case. Especially, SimThiCon
                     , SimFouCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                      have good correlation values for three benchmarks (i.e., M&C benchmark, R&G benchmark, and our benchmark). Thus, general speaking, we may select SimThiCon
                     , SimFouCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , SimTweCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , and SimEigCon
                      (especially SimFouCon
                      and SimEleCon
                     ) to compute the similarity of Wikipedia concepts.

Now we analyze and discuss the experimental results (see Tables 1–4).

Our approaches SimFirCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimThiCon
                     , SimFouCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , SimEigCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                      perform well on M&C benchmark, R&G benchmark, and our benchmark, their performance drastically decreases when applied to the 353-TC benchmark (best performance is 0.496 and is obtained by SimFouCon
                     ). The reason is that the 353-TC dataset models semantic relatedness, rather than semantic similarity (see (Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006) for a detail discussion of semantic similarity and semantic relatedness). Our approaches are designed to quantify similarity, thus yielding a poor performance on the 353-TC benchmark. This is supported by the 353-TC annotation guidelines, which define similarity as “belonging to the same domain or representing features of the same concept”. 353-TC contains also highly rated word pairs such as cell and phone or energy and crisis which are closely related, since they tend to occur frequently together, but no similar, as they share few or no properties (i.e., features) at all.

Regarding the approaches SimFirCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimThiCon
                     , and SimFouCon
                     , they perform relatively well on M&C benchmark, R&G benchmark, and our benchmark, with the lowest correlation being 0.520 and the highest 0.827. Tables 2 and 4 show that the measures of SimThiCon
                      and SimFouCon
                      obtain higher correlation values than those of SimFirCon
                      and SimSecCon
                      (0.520 and 0.572 vs. 0.657 and 0.708 on M&C, 0.523 and 0.604 vs. 0.718 and 0.763 on R&G, 0.755 and 0.778 vs. 0.809 and 0.827 on our benchmark). The reason is that the aggregation function of SimFirCon
                      and SimSecCon
                      is the average and that of SimThiCon
                      and SimFouCon
                      is max. In fact, this ranking of the measures is consistent with previous studies using the aggregation function max such as (Petrakis et al., 2006; Sanchez & Batet, 2013).

On the other hand, while both SimFirCon
                      and SimSecCon
                      (resp., both SimThiCon
                      and SimFouCon
                     ) exploit the same aggregation function average (resp., max), SimSecCon
                      performs better than SimFirCon
                      (resp., SimFouCon
                      performs better than SimThiCon
                     ) on all benchmarks because SimSecCon
                      and SimFouCon
                      use the R&E approach (Rodriguez & Egenhofer, 2003) and SimFirCon
                      and SimThiCon
                      utilize the X-similarity approach (Petrakis et al., 2006). In R&E approach, a similarity measure is based on the normalization of Tversky’s model and the set-theory functions of intersection and difference. Moreover, the relative importance of the noncommon characteristics is also considered in R&E approach. However, X-similarity approach is based on plain set similarity (see Section 3.3), that is, it is only based on the normalization of the set-theory function of union. The same situation is repeated for the approaches SimFifCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , SimNinCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimSixCon
                     , SimEigCon
                     , SimTenCon
                     , SimTweCon
                      showing that the exploitation of R&E approach provides better performance than X-similarity approach in feature based similarity assessment of Wikipedia concepts.

The most distinguishing difference between SimFifCon
                      and SimNinCon
                      (resp., between SimSixCon
                      and SimTenCon
                     ; between SimSevCon
                      and SimEleCon
                     ; between SimEigCon
                      and SimTweCon
                     ) is that SimFifCon
                      (resp., SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , and SimEigCon
                     ) is proposed by used the similarity of categories (i.e., Scategories
                     , see Definition 12) and SimNinCon
                      (resp., SimTenCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                     ) is presented by exploiting the approximate similarity of categories (i.e., Skcategories
                     , see Definition 12). From Tables 2 and 4 we know that SimNinCon
                      (resp., SimTenCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , SimTweCon
                     ) performs better than SimFifCon
                      (resp., SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , SimEigCon
                     ) on all benchmarks overall. The reason is that Scategories
                      in SimFifCon
                     , SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , and SimEigCon
                      is defined by making use of the whole Wikipedia category structure and Skcategories
                      in SimNinCon
                     , SimTenCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                      is defined by using the k-neighborhood of Wikipedia category structure (see Definition 6). Obviously, for any categories cat
                     1 and cat
                     2, the whole Wikipedia category structure contains lots of nodes (i.e., categories) which are not related to cat
                     1 or cat
                     2. On the contrary, by the definition of k-neighborhood we know that the nodes (i.e., categories) of k-neighborhood of cat
                     1 (resp., cat
                     2) are related to cat
                     1 (resp., cat
                     2) to a certain extent. As a result, SimNinCon
                     , SimTenCon
                     , SimEleCon
                     , and SimTweCon
                      can obtain higher correlation values than SimFifCon
                     , SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , and SimEigCon
                     , respectively.

Comparing SimFifCon
                      (resp., SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , SimEigCon
                     ) with SimFouCon
                      (resp., SimThiCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimFirCon
                     ), one should note that there is a different result here. In SimFifCon
                      and SimSixCon
                      the aggregation function is max and in SimSevCon
                      and SimEigCon
                      the aggregation function is the average (unless there is a common synonym). However, SimSevCon
                      and SimEigCon
                      perform better than SimFifCon
                      and SimSixCon
                     . Seemingly, this conclusion contradicts that of SimFirCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimThiCon
                     , and SimFouCon
                      (i.e., SimThiCon
                      and SimFouCon
                      perform better than SimFirCon
                      and SimSecCon
                     ). In fact, this is a reasonable conclusion because there are two different similarity computation methods in SimFifCon
                     , SimSixCon
                     , SimSevCon
                     , or SimEigCon
                     , however, there is only one similarity computation method in SimFirCon
                     , SimSecCon
                     , SimThiCon
                     , or SimFouCon
                     . For example, there are two methods SR
                     
                     &
                     
                        E
                      and Scategories
                      in SimFifCon
                     , however, there is only one method SR
                     
                     &
                     
                        E
                      in SimFouCon
                     .

Besides, from Tables 2 and 4 we also know that SimFifCon
                      and SimSixCon
                      obtain the lowest correlation coefficients on all benchmarks. Regarding similarity computation of SimFifCon
                      and SimSixCon
                     , from Tables 1 and 3 we know that the maximum is obtained by Scategories
                     . That is to say, in SimFifCon
                      and SimSixCon
                     , while three features (i.e., glosses, anchor texts, and categories) are considered, only one feature (i.e., categories) is exploited in practical computation. The similar situation is repeated for the approaches SimNinCon
                      and SimTenCon
                     . This shows that if similarity assessment of Wikipedia concepts only relies on Wikipedia category structure, such feature based similarity computation methods yield substantially inferior results. The reason is that Wikipedia category structure is a relatively recent addition to the encyclopedia, and less visible than articles, especially, it has been criticized as haphazard, incomplete, and rife with redundancy than usual ontologies. However, we can still exploit it to act as a kind of useful knowledge source in feature based similarity assessment for (Wikipedia) concepts. Under this case, we need to consider multiple features such as glosses, anchor texts, and categories in similarity computation of (Wikipedia) concepts (e.g., SimFouCon
                      and SimEleCon
                     ).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The final goal of computerized similarity measures is to accurately mimic human judgements about semantic similarity. At present similarity measures have been used for many different areas such as natural language processing, ontology mapping, and Web searching. In this paper, some limitations of the existing feature based measures are identified, such as the facts of relying on a (or multiple) predefined domain ontology (or ontologies) and fitting static domains (i.e., non-dynamic domains). To tackle these problems, we propose some novel feature based semantic similarity measurement methods that are fully dependent on Wikipedia and can avoid most of the limitations and drawbacks introduced above. To implement semantic similarity measurement based on feature by making use of Wikipedia, firstly a formal representation of Wikipedia concepts is presented. We then give a framework for feature based similarity based on the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts. Lastly, we investigate several feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures resulting from instantiations of the framework. The evaluation, based on several widely used benchmarks and a benchmark developed in ourselves, sustains the intuitions with respect to human judgements. Overall, several methods presented here have good human correlation and constitute some effective ways of determining similarity between Wikipedia concepts. As future work, we are planning to apply the proposed semantic similarity estimation to semantic Web search (or semantic search) tasks. In addition, considering the limitations (e.g., small size) of the existing standard benchmarks for concept similarity assessment, we will pursue the design of a new benchmark specially focused on Wikipedia concepts.
