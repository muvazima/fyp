                  The mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) reformulation by Zheng, Sun, Li, and Cui (2012) for probabilistically constrained quadratic programs (PCQP) recently published in EJOR significantly dominates the standard MIQP formulation (Ruszczynski, 2002; Benati & Rizzi, 2007) which has been widely adopted in the literature. Stimulated by the dimensionality problem which Zheng et al. (2012) acknowledge themselves for their reformulations, we study further the characteristics of PCQP and develop new MIQP reformulations for PCQP with fewer variables and constraints. The results from numerical tests demonstrate that our reformulations clearly outperform the state-of-the-art MIQP in Zheng et al. (2012).
               
            

We consider in this paper the following probabilistically constrained quadratic program (PCQP):

                     =0, Problem (P) is already NP-hard (Luedtke, Ahmed, & Nemhauser, 2010). For recent and computationally efficient solution methods for problem (P), please refer to Dentcheva and Martinez (2012), Kogan and Lejeune (2012), and Lejeune (2012). Problem formulation (P) arises naturally in many applications, including portfolio selection (Gaivoronski & Pflug, 2005), supply chain management (Lejeune & Ruszczynski, 2007) and production planning (Murr & Prekopa, 2000). One prominent special case of (P) is the Value-at-Risk (VaR)-variance portfolio selection problem (Bonami & Lejeune, 2009):

                     The standard mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP0) is ready to be solved by existing mixed-integer program solvers, such as CPLEX, within a branch-and-bound framework using continuous relaxation.

Very recently, based on a Lagrangian decomposition approach, Zheng et al. (2012) develop the following class of reformulations with a parameter θ,

                     −

                        θ
                     ) is more efficient than reformulation ( MIQP0) as the continuous relaxation of (MIQP
                        θ
                     ) always generates a lower bound tighter than or at least as tight as that of (MIQP0). The choice of θ plays a significant role in solving (MIQP
                        θ
                     ). Zheng et al. (2012) propose three approaches to find the “best” θ
                     ∈
                     Θ. The first choice of θ is obtained by solving the following semi-definite program (SDP),

                        θ
                     ) (see Zheng et al., 2012). The other two heuristic choices of θ are proposed to reduce the computational complexity in finding the optimal θ
                     ∗. The second choice of θ in Zheng et al. (2012) is obtained by solving the following small-size SDP:

While making promising progress in their study, Zheng et al. (2012) acknowledge themselves that their reformulation suffers a dimensionality problem. By studying further the characteristics of PCQP, we strengthen the result in Zheng et al. (2012) by proposing new formulations with fewer variables and constraints. Our numerical results demonstrate that our reformulations clearly outperform the state-of-the-art MIQP reformulation proposed in Zheng et al. (2012).

                      is a quadratically constrained quadratic program with more constraints and variables. One can thus expect that the former is easier to solve. For the tightness comparison, it is trivial to verify that

We report our numerical results in this section to compare the performance of our MIQP reformulations for PCQP with the ones in Zheng et al. (2012). We first use the same test sets as in Zheng et al. (2012), which are the VaR-variance problems specified in (1)–(3) with u
                     =0.5e. We refer to Zheng et al. (2012) for the detailed specification of the test sets. Our numerical tests were implemented in Matlab R2011a and IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.3 and run on a 64bit Linux (3gigahertz, 8gigabyte RAM). The semi-definite programs (11) and (23) are modeled by CVX 1.2 (see Grant & Boyd, 2010) and solved by SDPT3 within CVX whose default precision is 1.5×10−8. The MIQP formulations are run on default setting of IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.3 with the maximum CPU time limit set equal to 3600seconds. We further compare the computational results between the two using additional randomly-generated new test sets
                        1
                        The data files of the new instances and the Matlab codes in our numerical test are available from http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/∼dli/Codes.html.

                      for the VaR-variance problems of dimensions 175 and 200, where the maximum CPU time limit is set at 7200seconds.

More specifically, we compare the following six reformulations in our numerical tests: (i) (MIQP0): the standard mixed-integer quadratic program as stated in Section 1; (ii) (MIQP1): the MIQP reformulation resulted from (MIQP
                     0) by changing the cardinality inequality to an equality; (iii)

                      summarize the numerical results for the test sets of larger dimensions, where “Time” is the computing time (in seconds) for solving the formulation in IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.3; “Rel. gap” is the relative gap of the incumbent solution when IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.3 is terminated (note that the default tolerance is 10−4); and “No. of nodes” is the number of nodes explored by IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.3.

From the tables, we can see that for most instances, our new reformulations require much less computation time compared to the reformulations in Zheng et al. (2012). For those instances which the reformulations in Zheng et al. (2012) fail to solve in the sense of achieving optimality when reaching the time limit, our new reformulations solve almost all of them.

                      visits more nodes in less time than (MIQP0). This makes sense since the relaxation of the former may become looser after fixing some variables even though it is tight at the root node as shown in Theorem 2.5. Finally, we observe that changing the cardinality inequality to an equality has limited improvements when compared to the reformulations in Zheng et al. (2012).
