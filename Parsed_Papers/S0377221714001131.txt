Secondly, we provide a theoretical tool for seeking the best-case and worst-case order quantities when merely the support and the first k moments of the demand are known. Using this tool we derive closed form formulas for such quantities in the case of known support, mean and variance, i.e. k
                     =2. Consequently, we generalize all results presented so far in literature for the worst-case and best-case scenarios, and present some new ones. Extensions of our findings to the cases of the known mode of a unimodal demand distribution, the known median, and to other stochastic inventory problems are indicated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the pioneer works of Arrow, Harris, and Marshak (1951) and Morse and Kimball (1951), the classic single-period, single-item inventory problem with random demand, commonly referred to as the newsboy or newsvendor problem, has attracted a great deal of attention and played a central role at the conceptual foundations of stochastic inventory theory; Porteus (2002, chap. 1). Typically, it is formulated as follows. Each day the proverbial newsboy has to decide how many newspapers to stock before observing demand. He purchases them from a publisher at a unit cost c, and sells them at a price p to customers whose uncertain demand is described by a random variable X. Any unsold items are recycled with a unit salvage value s; it is assumed that p
                     >
                     c
                     >
                     s. The newsboy problem is to find the order (purchase) quantity that maximizes the expected profit, and this quantity is known to be the smallest q such that 
                        
                           F
                           (
                           q
                           )
                           ⩾
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 -
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 p
                                 -
                                 s
                              
                           
                        
                     , where F is the cumulative distribution function of X. Numerous extensions of the newsboy problem were reviewed in Khouja (1999) and Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011). Note here that we adopt a classic approach by assuming that the decision-maker is risk-neutral. The models in which he/she is risk-averse, risk-seeking, or uses a maximum entropy approach can be found in Wang, Webster, and Suresh (2009), Du Andersson, Jörnsten, Nonås, Sandal, and Ubøe (2012), Wu, Zhu, and Teunter (2013), and Wu et al. (2013).


                     Scarf (1958) was the first who addressed the distribution-free newsboy problem. He assumed that merely the mean μ
                     =
                     E(X) and the variance σ
                     2
                     =
                     Var(X) are known, and derived a closed form formula for the order quantity that maximizes the minimum expected profit over all demand distributions with given μ and σ
                     2. For this reason, this worst-case order quantity is also referred to as being found under the maximin criterion. Gallego and Moon (1993) disseminated the rather unnoticed result of Scarf, modified it by restricting the demand distribution to non-negative values, provided a simpler proof with economic interpretations, and showed some applications to other stochastic inventory problems. Alfares and Elmorra (2005) extended the modified Scarf formula to the case of shortage penalty.


                     Gallego, Ryan, and Simchi-Levy (2001) assumed that X is a discrete random variable taking a finite number of given values. When selected moments and percentiles of X are known, they showed that the worst-case order quantity can be found by solving a linear program. They also demonstrated that if the demand distribution is characterized by μ and σ
                     2 then the maximin policy mostly performs quite well, relative to a policy based on the normally distributed demand. Similar results concerning the performance of the modified Scarf formula were earlier reported by Gallego and Moon (1993). Perakis and Roels (2008) and Andersson et al. (2013) observed, however, that in some situations the maximin policy may lead to an expected profit much lower than the optimal one.

The order quantity found under the worst-case demand scenario is pessimistic (conservative). A less pessimistic policy based on minimizing the expected maximum regret was proposed as an alternative; see e.g. Yue, Chen, and Wang (2006), Perakis and Roels (2008). Yue et al. (2006) found the corresponding closed form formula for the minimax regret order quantity under the Scarf assumption that μ and σ are known without imposing the non-negativity constraint on the demand distribution. Perakis and Roels (2008) extended their result by adding this obvious constraint, and also solved some cases involving the known median and mode, the symmetricity and unimodality of the demand distribution. Another alternative to the maximin policy was proposed in Andersson et al. (2013). Assuming only the knowledge of μ and σ, the authors demonstrated empirically that finding the most likely distribution in the sense of the maximum entropy leads on average to better results.

To the best of our knowledge, the maximax criterion, which maximizes the expected profit under the best-case demand scenario, has been much less examined. Only trivial cases, resulting from Jensen’s inequality, of the best-case order quantities have been mentioned in Gallego and Moon (1993) and Yue et al. (2006). This observation also refers to other distribution-free stochastic inventory problems discussed in literature; see e.g. Godfrey and Powell (2001), Wu, Li, and Tsai (2002), Lin and Chu (2006), Ho (2009), and Kwon and Cheong (2014).

In this paper we present new theoretical foundations for analyzing the distribution-free newsboy problem under the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Firstly, by using a simple expression for the expected profit, we reveal that this problem actually reduces to the standard newsboy problem with demand distributions that bound the allowable distributions in the sense of increasing concave order. Secondly, we provide a theoretical tool for seeking the best-case and worst-case order quantities when merely the support and the first k moments of the demand are known. Using this tool we derive closed form formulas for such quantities in the case of known support [a,
                     b], mean μ, and variance σ
                     2, i.e. k
                     =2. Consequently, we generalize all results presented so far in literature for the worst-case and best-case scenarios, and present some new ones. Theoretical tools are also provided for examining the problem when the median, or the mode of the unimodal distribution are additionally available.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formulate the problem under study and show its main theoretical result. Section 3 includes a theoretical tool for seeking the sharp lower and upper bounds on the expected met demand needed for deriving the worst-case and the best-case order quantities. Using this tool we find, in particular, closed form formulas for such bounds in the case of known support, mean, and variance. The resulting worst-case and best-case order quantities are presented in Section 4. Section 5 illustrates our findings by the use of a numerical example taken from literature. In Section 6 we present some extensions of our results, while final remarks are made in Section 7.

In the classic newsboy problem, no cost is assumed if the order quantity does not meet the demand. Although this cost might be difficult to define in practice, we adopt a more general model considered by Alfares and Elmorra (2005) and Perakis and Roels (2008), in which a known unit lost sales (shortage) cost of ℓ is assumed. Therefore, if q is an order quantity and X denotes the random demand, min(X,
                     q) represents the demand that is met, X
                     −min(X,
                     q) the demand that is unmet, and q
                     −min(X,
                     q) is the salvage amount. Thus, min(X,
                     q) units will be sold at a price p, q
                     −min(X,
                     q) units at s, and the ordering and lost sales costs will be cq and ℓ[X
                     −min(X,
                     q)], respectively. Consequently, the expected profit is expressed by

                     E[min(X,

                     ∗
                     =0 does not help because π (0)=−ℓμ for a non-negative X.

We would like to emphasize here that the expected profit π(q) has been mostly presented by using more complex (but equivalent) expressions. For example, in Alfares and Elmorra (2005) and Perakis and Roels (2008) this profit is shown as

In the previous section we showed that to find the order quantities under the maximin and maximax criteria it suffices to identify sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on the expected met demand E[min(X,
                     q)]. When only the support and the first k moments of X are assumed to be known, such bounds can be sought by using very general Theorem 2.1 in the monograph of Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII). To avoid the use of quite advanced mathematics, below we present a restricted to the function min(x,
                     q) simpler version of this theorem that is sufficient for achieving the purpose of this paper. It can be regarded as a theoretical tool for seeking L(q) and U(q). The term “non-boundary conditions” should be made clear from Corollaries 1 and 2 that follow the theorem. Recall that for any random variable X its zero moment is 1, that is, μ
                     0

                     E[X

                      denote the one-point (degenerate) distribution with mass in x. The following result, where the first moment is merely known (k
                     =1), is attributed to folklore; it is presented here to make the paper more complete.

Note here that the trivial upper bound U(q)=min(μ,
                     q) is also justified by Jensen’s inequality. The two-point minimum distribution 
                        F
                      has mean μ and variance (μ
                     −
                     a) (b
                     −
                     μ). Therefore, for any distribution F on [a,
                     b] with mean μ, its variance σ
                     2 must satisfy σ
                     2
                     ⩽(μ
                     −
                     a) (b
                     −
                     μ); see e.g. Bhatia and Davis (2000). This explains the non-boundary conditions stated in the following.

The additional knowledge of σ
                     2 assumed in Corollary 2 makes the bounds L(q) and U(q) tighter than those in Corollary 1. For the case [a,
                     b]=[0,1], an equivalent result can be found in Kamburowski (1989) within the context of PERT; we want to note here that distribution F″ reported there (similarly as 
                        F
                      presented above) is not a five-point distribution as it is stated on page 58 in the monograph of Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1). Clearly, the infimum 
                        F
                      has a continuous part on

It is interesting to consider the case when the support [a,
                     b] is unknown. Since the demand cannot be negative, by letting a
                     =0 and b
                     →∞ in Corollary 2, one obtains the next result. Note here that for the support (−∞,∞), the infimum

As we demonstrated in this section, Theorem 2 appears to be useful in identifying sharp bounds on E[min(X,
                     q)] when the support [a,
                     b], mean μ, and variance σ
                     2 of X are known. We examined then some quadratic functions, that is, polynomials of order k
                     =2. When higher moments of X are also known, the problem becomes much more complex. For example, if the third moment E[X
                     3] is additionally available, there is a need for solving parametric cubic equations, in which q is a parameter.

                     Theorem 2 presented in Section 3 can be regarded as a theoretical tool for analyzing the problem when the distribution of demand X is characterized by its support and the first k moments. One can extend this tool by assuming that some additional information about this distribution is also available. As in the case of Theorem 2, the next two results can be deduced from Theorem 2.1 in Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII); their proofs are omitted.

One can also consider the class of unimodal distributions of X. Recall that a distribution F is said to be unimodal with mode M if it can be represented as

                           dy

                     ⩾
                     M, where the function f(x) is non-decreasing for x
                     <
                     M and non-increasing for x
                     ⩾
                     M. Thus, the unimodal distribution F is allowed to have a discontinuity at M, and if F is continuous at M, that is F(M+)=
                     F(M−)=
                     F(M), then f(x) is the density function.

                     Theorem 3 can be easily extended to encompass the cases when some other percentiles are known. One can also combine 
                     Theorems 3 and 4 when the information about the median (or other percentiles) of the unimodal demand distribution is available.

For the case of the known mean and variance of non-negative demand X and no shortage cost, Gallego and Moon (1993) showed three extensions of the distribution-free newsboy problem. They were further generalized by Alfares and Elmorra (2005) by assuming that the unit shortage cost is positive. These extensions include the fixed charge single-item problem, the random yield problem, and the resource-constrained multi-period problem. For all of them, one can apply the results presented in this paper. To illustrate, we consider the first of the listed extensions.

We presented new theoretical foundations for analyzing the newsboy problem under incomplete information about the probability distribution of random demand. Our main theoretical result stated in Section 2 shows the reduction of the distribution-free newsboy problem under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios to the standard newsboy problem. We revealed this reduction by finding the relationship between the distribution-free newsboy problem and the notion of the increasing concave order.

We observed that instead of using the maximin and maximax criteria, one can employ the Hurwicz criterion for a given coefficient of optimism α. Our future research will involve advanced experimental studies to identify the coefficient of optimism α for which this criterion produces a nearly optimal order quantity for different arbitrarily assumed demand distributions. We believe that α depends on the ratio r as well as on the skew of these distributions. The results with such optimal α’s could be then compared with those obtained by the use of the maximum entropy approach proposed in Andersson et al. (2013).

In Section 3 we presented, in particular, the sharp bounds on the expected met demand E[min(X,
                     q)] in the case of the known support [a,
                     b], mean μ, and variance σ

The numerical example discussed in Section 5 illustrates how the scope of available information about the demand distribution affects the quality of the results. Of course, extensive simulation experiments are needed to evaluate the average and maximum errors induced by the use of the maximin and maximax criteria. Such experiments should also examine the impact of the support [a,
                     b] on the results’ quality because it is well-known that this support might be difficult to estimate in practice.

In Section 6 we presented two theorems that allow for examining the cases of the known mode of the unimodal demand distribution, and of the known median. It would be interesting to empirically examine what information is more valuable in addition to the given support and mean; about the variance, the mode or the median.


                     Theorems 2–4 presented in this paper provide theoretical tools for solving the distribution-free newsboy problems under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios. These theorems refer to some straight-forward cases covered by general Theorem 2.1 proven in the rather forgotten now excellent monograph of Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII). In recent literature one can find some theoretical results claimed as new ones that can be actually deduced from this powerful theorem.
