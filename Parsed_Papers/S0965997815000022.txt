                  In this paper, a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) based DG (Discontinuous Galerkin) method is introduced to solve the three-dimensional Maxwell’s equations for complex geometries on unstructured grids. In order to reduce the computing expense, both the quadrature-free implementation method and the parallel computing based on domain decomposition are employed. On the far-field boundary, the non-reflecting boundary condition is implemented. Numerical integration rather than the quadrature-free implementation is used over the faces on the solid boundary to implement the electromagnetic solid boundary condition for perfectly conducting objectives. Both benchmark examples and complex geometry case are tested with the CFD-based DG solver. Numerical results indicate that highly accurate results can be obtained when using high order even on coarse grid and the present method is very suitable for complex geometries. Furthermore, the costs of CPU time and the speedup of the parallel computation are also evaluated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last few decades, the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method has been widely used to solve the Maxwell’s equations in the time domain [1–3]. Finite element methods [4] have also been tried for solving the Maxwell’s equations, which is usually limited from using high order schemes due to its continuity requirement over the element interfaces. The Finite Volume (FV) method [5,6] is also an option, whose main disadvantage is the low order property.

Recently, Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods [7] have been trying to solve the time-domain Maxwell’s equations. In [8], DG was used to solve the dispersive lossy Maxwell’s equations in PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) regions. High-order DG methods were employed to solve the Maxwell’s equations on hexahedral and hybrid grids in [9,10]. In [11], the Petrov–Galerkin and DG methods for both time-domain and frequency-domain electromagnetic calculations were compared. A non-conforming multi-element DG for irregular geometries was introduced in [12]. Two hybridizable DG methods for time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations were developed in [13]. The convergence and super-convergence of staggered DG for Maxwell’s equations on Cartesian mesh were discussed in [14]. The DG solutions of the Maxwell’s equations in meta-materials and anisotropic materials were discussed in [15–17]. A Schwarz-type domain decomposition method and an hp-adaptivity method were introduced in [18,19] for large scale electromagnetic simulations.

In this paper, we aim to apply a CFD-based high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to solve the 3D Maxwell’s equations and test the efficiency of the numerical simulation when using quadrature-free implementation and parallel computing. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the three-dimensional Maxwell’s equations are displayed. The CFD-based high-order DG discretization is described in Section 3. The methods for improving the efficiency of the numerical simulation are given in Sections 4 and 5. The entire computational procedure is displayed in Section 6. Section 7 demonstrates the numerical results and the conclusions are given in Section 8.

High-order DG schemes have been widely used in CFD for Euler and N–S equations. The Maxwell’s equations in Eq. (5) share the same conservative form with the Euler equations, which makes the application of high-order DG to the Maxwell’s equations quite straightforward.

After multiplying a test function V, integrating over the computational domain and performing an integration by parts, the following weak form is obtained:

The numerical evaluation of the integrals in Eq. (12) over the elements and the element interfaces dominates the CPU cost [20]. In order to accelerate the numericial simulation, the quadrature-free implementation [20] is adopted to convert the numerical integration to matrix–vector multiplication.

Since the above matrices need to be computed only once, repeatedly evaluating the integrals at each time step is avoided and the entire cost of the CPU time can be significantly reduced. Note that the integrals on the solid boundary Eq. (15) are computed via numerical integration, where the solid boundary conditions are imposed.

One of the significant advantages of the high-order DG scheme is its suitability for parallel computation. In this paper, the parallel computing based on the domain decomposition is employed.

The computational domain is subdivided into sub-domains using the widely used partitioning tool “Metis” [22,23]. “Metis” partitions the computational mesh based on “Graph partitioning”, which can ensure the number of the elements assigned to each processor is nearly the same and the number of adjacent elements assigned to different processors is minimized. Then the computing costs among the processors can be well balanced and the data transferring between the sub-domains can be minimized. Fig. 1
                      shows a two-dimensional mesh partitioning result, where the entire domain is partitioned into to 4 sub-domains with almost the same number of elements.

Based on the details discussed previously, the computational procedure can be summarized as below:
                        
                           1.
                           Generate the unstructured computational grid “Grid-master.txt” for a given geometry. The file “Grid-master.txt” contains the information of the elements, the nodes and the faces of the grid over the entire domain.

Partition the “Grid-master.txt” into N sub-domains using “Metis”, which generates a text file “partition-infor.txt” as shown in (31) where the

                                          i

                              .

The “Grid-slave-i.txt”, which includes the local mesh information of the ith sub-domain itself and the connections between its neighbors, can be generated based on “Grid-master.txt” and “partition-infor.txt”.

Set the number of the iterative steps and the order of DG.

                         contours become smoother with the increasing number of elements. Fig. 5 displays the results computed with the DG method of various orders on

The convergence in accuracy can also be observed from the RCS (Radar Cross-Section) results in Fig. 6
                        , where the RCS results obtained by using various orders on a series of grids are compared with the exact series solution.

                        (a). The CPU time significantly increases with increasing order. The speedup of the parallel computing is displayed in Fig. 7, where the CPU time of 100 time-steps is recorded for evaluating the speedup and the 4th-order DG is employed on

                        . Note that the difference between the actual speedup ratio and the ideal one becomes more and more significant with increasing number of cores because the CPU costs of the data exchanging between partitions become relatively more and more expensive compared to those of the local computations performed on each sub-domains (see Fig. 8
                        ).

In order to make comparisons between the present DG method and the widely used FV (Finite Volume) method [24] in both efficiency and accuracy, a series of FV results are provided here. The FV simulations are performed on four different unstructured grids in Fig. 9
                        , which have 40,810, 204,171, 889,282, 3,543,847 elements respectively. The comparison between the RCS results obtained by the FV method and the exact series solution is given in Fig. 10
                        . The RCS distributions obtained by the FV method are approaching the exact series solution with increasing number of elements. However, significant difference can still be observed even when the finest mesh is used. By comparing Figs. 6 and 10, it can be clearly observed that the accuracy of the FV simulation on finer mesh is lower than that of the high-order DG simulation on relatively coarse mesh.


                        Fig. 11
                         displays the CPU time costs of the FV simulations, where all of the FV simulations are also performed with 16 partitions. From Figs. 7 and 11, it can be observed that the CPU time costs of the FV simulations on the mesh with 889,282 and 3,543,847 elements are more expensive than the most time-consuming DG case (the 4th-order simulation on

                        ).

Another frequently used test case is the perfectly conducting cube. The computational mesh is demonstrated in Fig. 12
                        , which contains 10,386 elements in total. The

                         obtained with different orders are given in Fig. 13
                        . The

                         contours become smoother with increasing order. Only slight difference between the RCS results obtained by the DG method of different orders can be observed in Fig. 14
                        , which indicates that the used mesh is fine enough for RCS evaluation when high-order is employed.

In order to demonstrate the ability of the present method to handle complex geometries, a perfectly conducting missile model is also tested here. Fig. 15
                        (a) presents the size of the geometry. The computational mesh in Fig. 15(b) contains 59,762 elements which is partitioned into 32 sub-domains here. The mesh size varies significantly near the solid boundary due to the complex geometry and the mesh size near the far-field boundary is relatively large compared to that near the solid boundary.

                         contours on the used mesh in Fig. 15, but the 3rd-order DG and the 4th-order DG produce smoother results. The RCS results obtained with orders from 1 to 4 are compared in Fig. 17
                        , where the convergence in accuracy can be observed with increasing order. The CPU costs when using various orders are displayed in Fig. 18
                        (a) and the speedup for the 4th-order case is demonstrated in Fig. 18(b).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The three dimensional time-domain Maxwell’s equations are solved using a CFD-based Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured grid. The quadrature-free implementation and parallel computing based on mesh partitioning are employed to accelerate the computation. Two benchmark problems, the perfectly conducting sphere and cube, are used to test the accuracy and efficiency. The numerical simulation of the missile model verifies the suitability of the present numerical method for complex geometries.
