                  The numerical manifold method (NMM) surmounting the mesh dependence has successfully solved very complicated problems involving small deformation and large movement, but had few applications to large deformation and large rotation problems because the false volume expansion and other issues exist. In this study it is shown that the false volume expansion in NMM can be excellently resolved by using the S–R (strain–rotation) decomposition theorem which can precisely reflect complex physical behaviors occurring in the process of large rotation and large deformation. The numerical methods based on the S–R decomposition theorem have been limited to the static analysis of large deformations. To remove this limitation, a new formulation taking into account dynamical features is proposed based on the weak form of momentum conservation law. Under the framework of NMM, the generalized-
                        α
                      method is employed to discretize the temporal variables. The updates of variables are described using the updated co-moving coordinate system. Thus, a new method named S–R-D-based NMM is established. The new formulation can be implemented in any other partition of unity based methods as well, so as to improve the performances of such methods in the analysis of dynamic large deformations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In theoretical and applied solid mechanics, cases of geometric and physical nonlinearities should be considered. Many formulations can be used to deal with these two types of nonlinear problems. The Lagrangian formulation, which contains the total Lagrangian formulation (T.L.) and updated Lagrangian formulation (U.L.), and the Eulerian formulation are the two classic formulations. Unlike T.L. and U.L, which adopt a material description, the Eulerian formulation adopts a spatial description  [1], in which the mesh is fixed in space. This formulation is widely used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation (ALE)  [2–5] is successful in taking advantage of the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulation. To eliminate limitations of the mesh, the element-free Galerkin method (EFG)  [6] and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM)  [7] have been used to model large deformations  [8,9]. Besides, a mesh-free method called the cracked particle method is very suitable for the simulation of complex crack evolution in two- or three-dimensions  [10,11]. The material point method (MPM)  [12,13] can also be employed  [14]. Alternative methods include the natural element method (NEM)  [15,16], the co-rotational formulation  [17,18], and the nearest-nodes finite element method (NN-FEM)  [19]. Moreover, the lattice spring model (LSM)  [20] and the distinct lattice spring model (DLSM)  [21] were used for large deformation analysis. In addition, an ALE formulation for EFG was proposed  [22]. The ALE was embedded into the extended finite element method (XFEM)  [23] and was applied to the modeling of thixoforming processes  [24].

The numerical manifold method (NMM), which utilizes the dual systems of the mathematical cover (MC) and physical cover (PC) and belongs to the partition of unity (PU) method  [25,26], was initially developed in 1991  [27]. Concurrently, a simplex integration method for NMM, the finite element method (FEM), discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA), and analytical analysis were proposed  [28]. Owing to the dual cover system, NMM can be used to model continuous and discontinuous problems in a uniform manner. As a result, the method has drawn attention from many researchers. Formulations of high-order approximations have been derived in detail  [29]. Like other PU-based methods, linear dependency  [25] exists in high-order NMMs, and leads directly to the occurrence of singularities in the global matrix. An algorithm for predicting the rank deficiency of the global stiffness matrix was provided in  [30], and was extended in  [31]. Recently, a new procedure for eliminating linear dependency was developed  [32]. For finite cover generation, in addition, a generalized and efficient procedure was suggested in  [33]. A strategy of multilayer covers was introduced into NMM in  [34].

A major role of NMM is to analyze the propagation of cracks  [35–37]. Some new strategies for solving the issues with NMM in the simulation of crack propagation were recently suggested  [38]. NMM has also been used for studying fluid flow  [39], seepage flow  [40,41] and plate bending  [42]. Different from NMM, which introduces two independent cover systems over the problem domain to reproduce discontinuity in solution, the phantom node method (PNM)  [43–45], which uses the superposed elements or phantom nodes near discontinuous interface and the signed distance function and Heaviside function to achieve a discontinuous approximation, was employed to simulate the arbitrary crack problems  [46]. Though, the crack kinematics obtained with this method are identical to the step-enriched XFEM  [45,47], it is more convenient to treat complex crack configurations and the Edge-based smoothed phantom node method was proposed in  [48].

However, NMM, which can be applied to both small and large deformation analyses as well as static and dynamic analyses at the same time, has rarely been reported.

As we know, Green’s strain tensor, which is widely adopted for use in the large strain analysis, successfully eliminates the false strain caused by a finite rotation. However, the definition of a rotation that is compatible with Green’s strain is non-existent, restricting its applicability to large deformations and rotations  [49]. On the other hand, classical polar decomposition  [50], which can be used to decompose strain and rotation from a given deformation gradient field, is based only on mathematical considerations. Namely, the deformed configuration can be achieved through a pure stretch transformation proceeding to a rigid rotation transformation, or vice versa. This decomposition unavoidably results in two distinct strains, i.e. the pre-rotation strain and the post-rotation strain. In contrast, for the S–R (strain–rotation) decomposition theorem proposed in  [51], the strain and local rotation occur simultaneously and without order, and the strain is uniquely determined  [52]. Moreover, the local rotation is represented in a simple analytical form  [53]. Furthermore, the S–R decomposition theorem has been applied to the analysis of static large deformations  [54,55].

Since the 1990s, formulations based on the S–R decomposition theorem for static large deformation problems have been featured in the literature. However, a formulation for dynamic large deformation problems remains absent. In this study, we extend the application of the S–R decomposition theorem by using the weak form of momentum conservation law to deduce a new formulation for dynamic deformation problems. The novel formulation is appropriate for both static and dynamic analyses, involving small and large deformations or rotations. To obtain the discrete form of the new formulation, NMM  [27] and the generalized-
                        α
                      method  [56] are adopted. Thus, a new S–R-D-based NMM is established. Although this new formulation is implemented in the context of NMM, it could undoubtedly be employed by other PU-based methods, such as GFEM/XFEM, EFG, to name just a few. The analysis results of some interesting and challenging examples suggest that the introduction of the S–R decomposition to the simulation of dynamic and large deformation is promising.

The S–R decomposition theorem is always associated with the co-moving coordinate description method. The connection between the theorem and the co-moving coordinate has been demonstrated and illuminated in detail in  [49,51–55]. Here, for completeness, we provide statements of the related concepts and theories.

                                          i

                              , 2, 3), which is embedded in the deformable body, with its coordinate line allowed to stretch and rotation.

In general, the initial reference frame or the initial co-moving coordinate system is chosen as a rectilinear or curvilinear orthogonal system. However, owing to the occurrence of a deformation of the considered body or structure, a new curvilinear system may be formed following the deformation. Fig. 1
                      shows the configuration change of a co-moving coordinate system in the two-dimensional case. The situation is similar in the three-dimensional case. Let 
                        
                           r
                        
                      and 
                        
                           R
                        
                      be the position vectors of a point before and after deformation, and let 
                        
                           u
                        
                      denote the displacement vector. Thus, one can obtain

NMM  [27] consists of four interrelated parts  [39]: the cover systems, the partition of unity functions, the NMM space, and a variational formulation fitting to the method. One can refer to  [27,38,39,58] for more details on the orthodox statements of NMM. Assume that the problem domain 
                        Ω
                     , as shown in Fig. 2
                     , consists of two solid black boundaries and a black dotted line to represent a cracked surface. The mathematical cover (MC) is a collection of simply connected domains, represented in Fig. 1 as red polygons, circles, or ellipses. Each of these simply connected domains can be, in principle, of arbitrary shape and is called a mathematical patch (MP). Different MPs may partially overlap, but all the MPs must cover 
                        Ω
                      completely. The configuration of the MC, including the sizes and shapes of these mathematical patches, determines the partition of unity functions to be expounded subsequently. Physical patches (PPs) are created by cutting all of the MPs using the components of 
                        Ω
                     , namely the boundary, material interface, and cracks. The collection of all the PPs then is referred to as the physical cover (PC). The manifold elements are disjointed subdomains, which can serve as the basic units in integration of the weak form of the problem.

Now, let us take a three-node triangular mesh as an example (see Fig. 3
                        [59]) to illustrate the formation process of manifold elements in more detail, because this is closely related to the assembly of the global stiffness matrix.

Assume that the triangle 
                        
                           Δ
                        
                        ABC
                      constitutes the problem domain, 
                        Ω
                     . The thick lines 
                        AB
                     , 
                        B C
                     , and 
                        CA
                     , are the boundaries of 
                        Ω
                     , whereas the thick dashed line DF is a crack. Consider the triangle 
                        
                           Δ
                        
                        123
                     . Under the finite element cover, all the triangles sharing an identical node, referred to as a star, constitute an MP. For stars 1, 2, and 3, the MPs are 
                        
                           
                              
                                 MP
                              
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     ,

                              ,
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 MP

                     , respectively. The PPs are formed by splitting the MPs with the components of 
                        Ω
                     . For example, the physical patches

                      are both formed from

                     . The process in which one mathematical patch derives multiple physical patches will be referred to as an “MP split” or “star split” in this paper. In a similar fashion, we can obtain

This is the so-called incremental variational equation, where the superscript 
                           t
                         implies that the description is with respect to the configuration of time 
                           t
                        , and the following is the same. It is should be mentioned that the known variable values in Eq. (36) refer to the co-moving coordinate system

                         Eqs. (47)–(50) exactly express the so-called virtual work equation, which is based on the S–R decomposition theorem and described in the updated co-moving coordinate form. The equations will be disposed further in the context of NMM. It should be pointed out that Eqs. (47)–(50) are based on the principle of virtual displacement rather than the principle of virtual power, which was adopted by  [55]. Thus, there are three main differences from the counterpart employed in  [55]: first, the rotation tensor 
                           
                              R
                           
                         does not appear explicitly; second, the strain rate also is invisible; and third, the inertia item is primarily considered. In our experience a dynamic analysis cannot be achieved by merely inserting the inertia item into the static formulation in  [55]. This implies that a new deducing process is needed to obtain the dynamic formulation.

(iii) Providing theoretical basis for updating the co-moving coordinate and state variables of material point.

For the case that these aforementioned initial co-moving systems are all selected to be isomorphic to the rectilinear orthogonal coordinate system that is fixed in the space, a formula for updating the co-moving coordinate of the material point has been given in  [55]:

                         are the mass matrix and the equivalent force vector of the element respectively. The global control equation can then easily be assembled. Thus, the S–R-D-based NMM is established completely. Although Eq. (79) has been deduced in the context of NMM, the equations would be suitable as a basis for various other PU-based methods, such as FEM, GFEM/XFEM, and EFG.

In this section, several classical tests are given in order to validate the availability and potential application of the S–R-D-based NMM.

We now use the example of a static large deformation of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free tip (Fig. 7
                        ) to examine the S–R-D-based NMM.

The flexible semi-ring falls freely until CS  =  442, at the moment it just contacts the base, and then at CS  =  525, the points B and D all reach the lowest position and the flexible semi-ring starts to rebound under the contact force. At CS  =  572, the semi-ring is completely separate from the base, as shown in Fig. 14
                        .

The semi-ring continues ascending. At CS  =  604, the distance between points A and E reaches the maximum; whereas, at CS  =  652, the point C reaches the highest position and the flexible semi-ring starts to fall, as shown in Fig. 15
                        . At CS  =  735, the flexible semi-ring starts to rebound secondly and the point C again reaches the highest position at CS  =  798, as shown in Fig. 16
                        .

In addition, from CS  =  400 to 610 with an interval of 15, namely, CS  =  400:15:610, a series of deformations of the flexible semi-ring are shown in Fig. 17
                        ; whereas these deformations corresponding to from CS  =  620 to 800 with CS  =  620:15:800, are shown in Fig. 18
                        . From the two figures, as for the change of the central axis of the flexible semi-ring, it is can be observed that there is a distinct difference between the results given by

This test demonstrates that the mass of an element can be perfectly conservative using S–R-D-based NMM, along with a satisfactory precision in the angular velocity, which is not the case for the original NMM.

As an aside, Jiang and Zheng recently gave an efficient remedy for the false volume expansion of DDA in simulating large rotation  [63] by fixing a local frame moving and rotating with each block.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In order to extend the application of the S–R decomposition theorem, the updated process for the co-moving coordinate system was investigated. Then, a dynamic formulation was first deduced in detail. By incorporating the S–R decomposition into the new formulation, the strain and local rotation of any point in the deformable body undergoing a large deformation are simultaneously and accurately captured. Of course, this theorem and our new formulation can also be applied to problems involving small deformations. The proposed formulation can be implemented in any other PU-based methods as well, such as GFEM/XFEM and EFG, to enhance the performance of these methods for a nonlinear analysis. Furthermore, in order to construct the discrete form of the formulation, NMM and generalized-
                        α
                      method were employed in the discretization of space and time variables, respectively. As a result, an S–R-D-based NMM was established. Several interesting and challenging examples were provided, demonstrating the superiority and potential of the new NMM.
