                  A capital allocation scheme for a company that has a random total profit Y and uses a coherent risk measure ρ has been suggested. The scheme returns a unique real number

The resulting capital allocation is linear and diversifying as defined by Kalkbrener (2005). The problem is reduced to selecting the “center” of a non-empty convex weakly compact subset of a Banach space, and the solution to the latter problem proposed by Lim (1981) has been used. Our scheme can also be applied to selecting the unique Pareto optimal allocation in a wide class of optimal risk sharing problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the basic problems in risk management is to determine the allocation of risk capital among agents or business units. We make two assumptions: (i) a company consists of n subsidiaries, each contributing a random profit Xi
                     , so that the total profit of the company is

The capital allocation problem is to distribute ρ(Y*) among subsidiaries, that is, to assign subsidiary i the capital ki

The capital allocation problem in this or similar form has been extensively studied in a number of papers, see e.g. Denault (2001), Delbaen (2004), Kalkbrener (2005), Cherny and Orlov (2011) and references therein. We rely on a natural assumption (see Kalkbrener, 2005), that the risk contribution ki
                      of subsidiary i depends only on Xi
                      and Y*, but not on the decomposition of Y* − Xi
                      among the rest of subsidiaries. In this context, a capital allocation with respect to risk measure ρ(.) is just a function of two arguments Λρ
                     (X, Y), such that Λρ
                     (Y, Y) = ρ(Y). With ki

                      ≤ ρ(Xi
                     ), i = 1, … , n can now be rewritten as

                     Kalkbrener (2005) proved that a linear diversifying capital allocation exists if and only if the risk measure ρ is positively homogeneous and subadditive. He also proved that it is unique for a fixed Y and ρ(.) if and only if the directional derivative

Cherny and Orlov (2011) argue that it might not exists for a popular risk measure CVaR(.) if the distribution function of Y is not continuous, which is typical e.g. in the context of credit portfolios. Actually, if we denote 
                        
                           Y
                           (

                      to be the set of all Y such that (1) does not exists for some X, one can prove that 
                        
                           Y
                           (

                      is non-empty unless ρ(.) is linear (see Proposition 1), and, moreover, one may get

                      by solving a natural optimization problem (see Example 3). Problem I can be adapted to this context as follows

                        Problem II
                        Let ρ be a positively homogeneous and subadditive risk measure, and assume that 
                              
                                 Y
                                 ∈
                                 Y
                                 (
                                 ρ
                                 )
                                 ,
                              
                            so that a linear diversifying capital allocation Λρ
                           (X, Y) is not unique. Which one to choose?

A possible approach to solve Problem II is to impose additional assumptions on capital allocation. Kalkbrener (2005) introduced a “continuity in Y” axiom, and proved that if a linear, diversifying, and continuous capital allocation exists, it is unique. However, Theorem 4.3. in Kalkbrener (2005) states that the existence of such a capital allocation is equivalent to the existence of directional derivative in (1), so this approach makes no progress in Problem II.


                     Cherny and Orlov (2011) suggested to consider the capital allocation problem within the framework of coherent risk measures of Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999), and introduced an assumption that Λρ
                     (X, Y) is law-invariant, that is, depends only on the joint law of X and Y. They proved that the linear diversifying law-invariant capital allocation exists and is unique for a class of so called weighted VaR risk measures, defined on an atomless probability space. However, there are important coherent risk measures outside of this class, for which such a capital allocation does not exist or might not be unique, see Section 2.

In this paper, we develop an approach of selecting one linear diversifying capital allocation for every coherent risk measure. Our approach can naturally be extended to other classes of positively homogeneous and subadditive functionals. We do this by reducing this problem to selecting a “center” in a convex weakly compact subset of a Banach space, which is fixed under affine isometries, and the latter problem was solved in Lim (1981). If directional derivative in (1) exists for every X, our capital allocation coincides with that of Kalkbrener (2005); if ρ belongs to the class of weighted VaR, it coincides with that of Cherny and Orlov (2011). We do not assume that probability space is atomless, and an important special case of discrete probability space is treated separately.

This work is organized into eight sections. Section 2 formulates a capital allocation problem, provides several motivating examples, and reduces the problem to identification of the “center” in a convex weakly compact set. Section 3 suggests a solution in a special but important case when the underlying probability space is finite. Section 4 reformulates the concept of law-invariant capital allocation, suggested by Cherny and Orlov (2011), in terms of invariance under automorphisms of the underlying probability space. Section 5 solves the capital allocation problem in the general case, while Section 6 discusses an economic interpretation of the obtained solution. Section 7 applies the results to the optimal risk sharing problem. Section 8 concludes the work.

This implies existence of r.v.’s on Ω with all possible CDFs (see e.g. Proposition A.27 in Föllmer and Schied, 2004).

                     . This paper studies the problem of selection of a linear diversifying capital allocation for a given risk measure ρ(.).

Theorem 4.2. in Kalkbrener (2005) proves that there exists a linear diversifying capital allocation Λρ
                     (., .) if and only if ρ(.) is positively homogeneous and subadditive. This suggests that the capital allocation problem can naturally be considered in the context of coherent risk measures in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999).

                        Coherent risk measures


                        A coherent risk measure is any functional 
                              
                                 ρ

                                    Ω

                                    ρ(X) ≤ ρ(Y) if X ≥ Y (monotonicity),


                                    ρ(λX) = λρ(X) for all X and all λ ≥ 0 (positive homogeneity),


                                    ρ(X + Y) ≤ ρ(X) + ρ(Y) for all X and Y (subadditivity),


                                    ρ(X + C) = ρ(X) − C for all X and constant C.

A risk measure ρ(.) is called continuous from below if

                              )

                           ρ
                           
                              (
                              Y

                      for every non-decreasing sequence Yn
                      converging to Y pointwise on Ω. For simplicity of presentation, we first solve the capital allocation problem for the case of coherent risk measures, which are continuous from below. The extension to all coherent risk measures, and beyond, is presented in Section 5.

Corollary 4.35 in Föllmer and Schied (2004) states that coherent risk measure ρ is continuous from below if and only if

                      is not a singleton (equivalently, such that (1) does not exist for some X). We start with the following simple observation.

                        Proposition 1
                        For risk measure ρ satisfying (R2) and (R3), the directional derivative (1) exists at 0 in any direction X, if and only if ρ is linear. Hence 
                              
                                 0

                                 ρ
                                 )
                              
                            if and only if ρ is not linear.

If ρ is linear, the directional derivative (1) exists and equal to ρ(X). In the opposite direction, if the derivative (1) exists for Y = 0, then the right derivative, which is ρ(X), is equal to the left one, which is − ρ( − X). Hence, using subadditivity, ρ(X

                     Proposition 1 shows that, for every non-linear ρ, set 
                        
                           Y

                      contains 0, and therefore, in particular, it is non-empty. One may argue that the set 
                        
                           Y
                           (
                           ρ
                           )
                        
                      is typically non-empty but the event

                      is rather exceptional. This is supported by Corollary 5.1. in Kalkbrener (2005), which states that 
                        
                           Y

                      consists only on constants for risk measure ρ
                     STD(X) = c · σ(X) − EX, where σ(X) = ‖X − EX‖2 is the standard deviation. However, ρ
                     STD is not a coherent risk measure (axiom R1 fails), and, in applications, is sometimes replaced by ρ
                     MAD(X) = c‖X − EX‖1 − EX, which is coherent for

The risk measure (4) has the following interpretation: a company may consider two possible probabilistic scenarios with Radon–Nikodym derivatives Q
                     1 and Q
                     2, and the risk of every random profit Y is just the worst-case expected loss. Now, assume that the company can choose a policy from a set of admissible policies, leading to a set of possible profits

                     Representation of risk measures based on finite number of scenarios (6) is often used for simulation of coherent risk measures in practice, see Lesnevski, Nelson, and Staum (2007).

Set 
                        Q
                      in (2) can be interpreted as a set of (Radon–Nikodym derivatives of) possible probabilistic scenarios Q, considered by a company. Then

                      is a set of Radon–Nikodym derivatives of the “worst-case” scenarios (that is, those ones, for which an equality in (2) holds for a given Y). Then, capital allocation problem III is interpreted as a problem of choosing the unique probabilistic scenario from a set of worst-case ones, and then assign the capital allocation according to the chosen scenario.

                           (x) is the characteristic function of T. With f(T) given by (9), formula (7) defines the capital allocation for every positively homogeneous and subadditive risk measure ρ. We will call it the centroid capital allocation.

Because T is the set of Radon–Nikodym derivatives of the “worst-case” scenarios, the centroid (9) can be interpreted as the “average”, or “expected” element of T, assuming that they are “equally probable”.

Next sections discuss what are the desirable properties we want CA-solution to possess, show that the centroid capital allocation satisfies these properties, and also suggest a capital allocation scheme for an arbitrary probability space Ω.


                     Cherny and Orlov (2011) suggested that the capital allocation should be law-invariant, that is, Λρ
                     (X, Y) should depend only on the joint law of (X, Y), and have studied such capital allocations for the case when ρ can be represented as

The proof of the direction (iii) → (ii) for an atomless probability space can be extracted from the proof of Theorem 2.3 in Cherny and Orlov (2011).□

Equivalent conditions (i) and (ii) in Proposition 2 can be interpreted as the “correct” analogue of law-invariance axiom for capital allocations for general probability space Ω. Condition (i) also has the following financial interpretation: the states of natures ω
                     1 and ω
                     2 such that Y(ω
                     1) = Y(ω
                     2) are indistinguishable from the company point of view, and only average value of X over all such states is taken into account for capital allocation. Theorem 6.3 in Cherny (2006) implies that the corresponding capital allocation exists and unique for the family (14) on general Ω.

                     2 is called mod 0 automorphism of Ω, if (i)

                                    (X, Y) coincides with the unique linear diversifying law-invariant continuous in X capital allocation, described in Theorem 2.3 in Cherny and Orlov (2011).

                           Dana (2005, Lemma 4.3) implies that there exists an r.v. Z with the same distribution as X which is comonotone with Y. Then

Condition (*) in Proposition 4 reformulates the “law-invariance” axiom of Cherny and Orlov (2011) as follows: the selector f(T) from any convex set T should be a fixed point of any map from the family

                     mapping T into T. The interpretation of this condition is straightforward: if the risk measure ρ is law-invariant, then the corresponding set 
                        
                           S
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                      is invariant under any automorphism of an underlying probability space, and we require that the resulting capital allocation should also be invariant under such automorphisms. However, some popular law-invariant coherent risk measures, including ρ
                     MAD from Example 1, cannot be represented in the form (14), and a law-invariant capital allocation may still be non-unique, see Cherny and Orlov (2011) for more examples. Also, a law-invariance axiom for capital allocation does not make sense if ρ is not law-invariant (which is typically the case in Example 2). In the next sections, we develop an approach to capital allocation, valid for all coherent risk measures, by extending the condition (*) to a larger family of maps, called affine isometries.

                                    Ω
                                    )
                                 
                              
                            will be called AI-preserving (affine-isomerty-preserving), if B(f(T)) = f(T) for every affine isometry B such that B(T) = T. In other words, f is an AI-preserving CA-solution, if the selector f(T) from any convex set T is a fixed point of any affine isometry, mapping T into T. In this case, we will call f(T) the center of convex set T.

For a finite probability space, AI-preserving CA-solution is presented in Example 4.

                        Proposition 8
                        If probability space Ω is a finite set, then the centroid capital allocation, defined in Example 4, is an AI-preserving CA-solution.

It follows from (16) that the centroid (9) is a fixed point of any affine isometry, mapping T into T.□

From now, we assume that Ω is an infinite set. In this case, the notion of centroid for subsets of

                              1
                           
                           
                              (
                              Ω
                              )
                           
                        
                      does not exist in the form (9), because there is no analogue of Lebesgue measure on an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space. More precisely, every translation-invariant measure on such space that is not identically zero assigns infinite measure to all open subsets, see Hunt, Sauer, and Yorke (1992). For this reason, the construction of the “natural” center for every convex weakly compact subset T of a Banach space is a non-trivial and well-known problem. Brodskii and Mil’man (1948) developed a method for assigning center to every set T with “normal structure”, see their paper for definition. The construction which works in general case and returns a unique center was suggested 33 years later in Lim (1981).

To be self-contained, we repeat the construction here. It defines Cα
                      for all ordinals α by transfinite induction. Let C
                     0 = T. Let β be an ordinal and suppose that Cα
                      has been defined for α < β. If β is a limit ordinal, let 
                        
                           
                              C
                              β
                           
                           =

                                 α
                                 <
                                 β

                      be a closed convex hull of the set

                        Let T be a nonempty weakly compact convex subset of a Banach space. The center f*(T) is a fixed point of every affine isometry mapping T into T.

In other words, Proposition 9 states that f* is an AI-preserving CA-solution.

                     Relation (19) is a corollary from Proposition 4 (i), and remains valid for every law-invariant coherent risk measure ρ, which is continuous from below and can be defined on an atomless probability space.

Next, we remark that our methodology can be easily extended to wider families of risk measures. Corollary 5.1. in Kalkbrener (2005) solves the capital allocation problem for nonconstant Y for risk measure ρ
                     STD(X) = c · σ(X) − EX, which is not coherent (R1 fails). Similarly, R1 fails for ρ(Y) = c‖Y − EY‖1 − EY in Example 9 if

Deviation measures introduced in Rockafellar et al. (2006a) to measure the non-constancy, inherent in an r.v. Y. If ρ is a deviation measure,

                      should be interpreted as deviation contribution (rather than risk contribution), that is, it measures the contribution of nonconstancy of X to the nonconstancy of Y. The capital allocation problem with deviation measures naturally arises in the context of cooperative portfolio investment, see Grechuk, Molyboha, and Zabarankin (2013).

Error measures are designed to measure non-zeroness of an r.v., with the prominent example ρ(X) = ||X||2, see Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2008). If ρ is an error measure, a natural interpretation for

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We argue that the problem of selection the unique linear diversifying capital allocation (Problem II) is essentially a problem of selection the unique probabilistic scenario from a set of worst-case ones (Problem III), and then the capital should be allocated according to the selected scenario via (7). The most straightforward approach would be assume that all these scenarios are “equally probable”, and then calculate the “average” one. If Ω is finite, this leads to the centroid capital allocation (9).

The assumption that Ω is finite is not as unrealistic as it seems, because discrete distributions naturally arise when historical data are used to estimate the future outcomes. For example, assume that the company makes an investment to the stock market, and solves a (one period) portfolio optimization problem in the form

If the underlying distributions are continuous, and Ω cannot be modelled as finite probability space, the set of (the Radon–Nikodym derivatives of) worst-case probabilistic scenarios 
                        
                           S

                           Y

                      is infinite-dimensional, and we cannot say that these scenarios are “equally probable”, because there is no reasonable way to introduce a probability measure on 
                        
                           S
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                     .

If the underlying risk measure (and whence the set 
                        
                           S
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                     ) has any kind of “symmetry” (which we mathematically formalized as invariance under affine linear transformations), we suggest that the capital allocation scheme Λ should possess the same kind of symmetry. For example, if ρ is law-invariant, Λ should be law-invariant, consistently with Cherny and Orlov (2011). As another example, risk measure ρ
                     MAD (see Example 9) equally penalizes ups and downs comparing to mean, in sense that ρ
                     MAD(X) = ρ
                     MAD(Y) if EX = EY and X − EX = EY − Y; in particular heavy down tails in penalized to the same extend as heavy up tails. We require that the same property should be reflected in the capital allocation scheme, that is, heavy down tail should not be a reason for extra capital allocation, comparing to heavy up tail. All this kind of informal reasoning is summarized, formalized, and generalized in Definition 2: if an affine isometry does not change the risk measure, it also should not change the capital allocation. A construction of Lim (1981) returns the capital allocation with this property.

This construction, however, is not explicit, and cannot be used directly in practical applications. Example 9 shows how the use of a particular affine isometries may lead to a quick solution. In case when such isometries are not available, one may approximate the underlying distributions with the discrete ones, and use the centroid capital allocation (9), which can be efficiently computed.

This section applies the developed capital allocation technique to a related problem of optimal risk sharing, an old and classical problem originated by Borch (1962), Arrow (1963), and others. There are n agents, indexed by I = {1, 2, … , n}. Agent i ∈ I has an initial endowment

Recently, optimal risk sharing problem has been intensively studied in the case when ρi
                      are coherent (see Burgert and Ruschendorf, 2008), or, more generally, convex

                            is a convex risk measure if it is convex and satisfies R1 and R4 in Definition 1.

In these papers, the existence of Pareto optimal and equilibrium allocation has been investigated, but the Problem IV has not been addressed.

We argue that there is a close connection between Problem IV and capital allocation problem, formulated in the introduction, at least in coherent case. First, if ρi
                      satisfy R4, and

We have reduced the problem of identifying the unique linear diversifying risk contribution Λρ
                     (X, Y) to the problem of selecting the unique center of a convex weakly compact set in a Banach space. The latter problem has a natural solution (centroid) in finite-dimensional case, which corresponds to the case when probability space Ω is finite. In the general case, we have used the construction of Lim (1981), which has the advantage that the resulting center is a fixed point of every affine isometry mapping the set into itself. This construction produces the unique risk contribution, defined for all

                      and for every coherent risk measure ρ, as well as for other classes of functionals, such as deviation measures or error measures. Our solution is consistent with those derived in Kalkbrener (2005) and Cherny and Orlov (2011) in cases the latter exist and unique. It can also be applied to selecting the unique Pareto optimal allocation in a wide class of optimal risk sharing problems.
