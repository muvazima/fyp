                  HIV-1 membrane fusion plays an important role in the process that HIV-1 entries host cells. As a treatment strategy targeting HIV-1 entry process, fusion inhibitors have been proposed. Nevertheless, development of a short peptide possessing high anti-HIV potency is considered a daunting challenge. He et al. found that two residues, Met626 and Thr627, located the upstream of the C-terminal heptad repeat of the gp41, formed a unique hook-like structure (M-T hook) that can dramatically improve the binding stability and anti-HIV activity of the inhibitors. In this work, we explored the molecular mechanism why M-T hook structure could improve the anti-HIV activity of inhibitors. Firstly, molecular dynamic simulation was used to obtain information on the time evolution between gp41 and ligands. Secondly, based on the simulations, molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and molecular mechanics Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) methods were used to calculate the binding free energies. The binding free energy of the ligand with M-T hook was considerably higher than the other without M-T. Further studies showed that the hydrophobic interactions made the dominant contribution to the binding free energy. The numbers of Hydrogen bonds between gp41 and the ligand with M-T hook structure were more than the other. These findings should provide insights into the inhibition mechanism of the short peptide fusion inhibitors and be useful for the rational design of novel fusion inhibitors in the future.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has become one of the major medical and humanitarian challenges (Allen and Rizzo, 2012). So far, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves four classes of anti-HIV drugs: (i) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), (ii) protease inhibitors (PIs), (iii) fusion and entry inhibitors, and (iv) integrase inhibitors (Su et al., 2015). In particular, HIV-1 fusion/entry inhibitors can inhibit early steps of the HIV replication cycle, thereby inhibiting the spread of infection in the first time (Yu et al., 2013). Fusion of HIV virus membrane with host cell membrane is an essential event for virus infection and proliferation. This process is mediated by HIV envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) (Tsvetkov and Serbin 2014) and glycoprotein 41 (gp41) (Ma et al., 2014), thus, it is served as an attractive target for designing a novel HIV-1fusion/entry inhibitors (Zheng et al., 2014).

T20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) is the first HIV fusion inhibitor approved by U.S. FDA. Although T20 is effective (Augusto et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2013), T20 has some shortcomings that limit its clinical usefulness. Firstly, owing to its nature characteristic, T20 is marketed in an injectable form. Patients are subcutaneously injected twice in every day. Because of the chronic nature of the disease therapy, this dosage form may be one of major problems for the patient’s adherence to this drug regimen. Secondly, T20 clinical efficacy is also negatively affected by gp41 resistance mutations that arise owing to continued use. To overcome these disadvantages, a number of strategies have been applied to discover the next generation inhibitors with improved potency and pharmaceutical properties (Lu et al., 2014). However, the resulting peptides usually inherit a longer sequence (Liu et al., 2014), such as SC35EK (35-mer) (Kajiwara et al., 2009), SFT (sifuvirtide, 36-mer) (Yao et al., 2012), and T2635 (39-mer) (Eggink et al., 2011). Undoubtedly, the length of peptide closely relates to difficulty and cost of its production, but short peptides (amino acid residue numbers<14) lead to a dramatic loss of antiviral potency and binding stability (Paulsen et al., 2002). Therefore, the development of peptide’s fusion inhibitor with highly active antiretroviral efficacy and reasonable residue numbers faces great challenges (Zhang and Sagui, 2014).

Promisingly, He’s group discovered a novel strategy to solve above problem. By studying the inhibit’s mechanism of gp41, they found that two key residues, Met626 and Thr627, which forms a hook-like structure (M-T hook), located upstream of the pocket-binding domain (PBD) of the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR). The M-T hook can dramatically improve the binding stability of the inhibitors (Chong et al., 2012a,b); and the addition of the M-T hook structure to the N terminus of C-peptide could markedly enhance its antiviral activity (Chong et al., 2012b, 2013). Based on their former research, Chong et al. proposed a prototype that the short C-peptide fusion inhibitors could be developed by adding an M-T hook structure. They introduced the methionine and threonine to the N terminus of a panel of C peptides (24-mer or less), and found one pepide, named MT-SC22EK, was highly active against diverse HIV-1 variants, including those T20- and SC29EK-resistant variants. Based on the crystal structures of MT-SC22EK, their paper reported that MT-SC22EK primarily targets on the hydrophobic pocket region on N-heptad repeat (NHR) trimer with its PBD and M-T hook regions, whereas the sites conferring T20-resistance are not bound by the inhibitor. Therefore, the M-T hook structure provides a novel strategy for designing short peptide fusion inhibitors that can overcome the problem of drug resistance.

The major problem affected activity of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors is molecular resistance. Owing to point mutations in the GIV motif of NHR (L33 to L45), the inhibit activity of T20 is on the decrease (Liu et al., 2005). Some studies reported that mutations on NHR of gp41 would induce the compensatory mutation on CHR, which may balance those damages and remedy the function of gp41 (Xu et al., 2005). In our former work, we studied the two kinds of mutants systems of gp41, N43D single mutation and compensatory mutation S138A (yielding N43D/S138A), respectively, and the analyses of structural alteration indicated that the inhibitor C34 displays different binding modes in wild type and two mutants (Ma et al., 2014). In N43D single mutation system, it was founded that the N43D mutation introduced a negative charge on receptor, thus led to repulsion between receptor and ligand, and induced the conformation changes of complex, and led to greater losses in hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond interaction. In N43D/S138A double mutation system, we founded CHR have more contact with hydrophobic residues of receptor, induced more van der Waals contributions. This great hydrophobic interaction of double mutant could partially offset the energy loss arising from N43D mutation. The change of binding mode on N43D/S138A could explain why compensatory mutation S138A could partially restores infectivity, lead to increased infectivity and greater resistance to inhibitors than mutation N43D.

In order to explore the role of M-T hook structure in improving the activity of fusion inhibitors, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann/Generalized Born surface area (MM-PB/GBSA) approach to analyze structure-function relationships between gp41 and two ligands (SC22EK and MT-SC22EK) (Fig. 1
                     ). The only difference of the two ligands is that MT-SC22EK includes M-T hook, the other without. These results may be useful for designing novel HIV fusion inhibitors (Tan et al., 2016), or optimizing the lead compounds.

The initial structures were downloaded from the RSCB protein data bank (www.rcsb.org) (PDB ID: 3VU5, 3VU6). The amino acid sequences of the two ligands are shown in Fig. 1. The receptor was one N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) chain of gp41. We named the system including NHR and MT-SC22EK as complex 1, the other as complex 2.

The MD simulations were carried out for each complex system using NAMD2.9 software and amber ff03 force-field. Firstly, the each system was solvated with TIP3P (Jorgensen et al., 1983) water box, 10Å of space between the protein and the simulation box boundaries on each direction. After model generation, each system was neutralized separately with Cl− ions. Then, two successive minimization steps were performed: (i) the system was minimized by 20,000 steps using the conjugate gradient with 2.0kcal/mol restraints on the backbone of the protein; (ii) the system was minimized by 20,000 steps using the conjugate gradient without constrained atoms. Next, the systems were gradually heated from 10K to 300K using Langevin dynamics in a slow, stepwise fashion (20K every 100ps). During heating, no restraint was utilized in the complex. Finally, the MD simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble (a constant temperature of 300K and a pressure of 1atm) for 50ns (the time step is 2fs) with all restraints removed. Throughout the MD simulations, a cut-off of 12Å was used for nonbonded interactions while the SHAKE and Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) were used with periodic boundary conditions (Ryckaert et al., 1977).

The binding free energies were calculated by subtracting the free energies of the unbound receptor and ligand from the free energy of the bound complex, shown in Eq. (1): (Kollman et al., 2000; Kuhn and Kollman 2000)

                         are the electrostatic and van der Waals contributions to the molecular mechanics energy, respectively. The polar part expresses the electrostatic contribution to solvation, which is obtained by solving the linear Poisson–Boltzmann equation in a continuum model of solvent. On the other hand, the other part accounted for the nonpolar contribution is related linearly to the solvent accessible surface area. The solvation free energies are calculated using an implicit solvent model. Several implicit solvent models are available to calculate the solvation free energies, including Generalized Bron (GB), Poisson–Boltzmann (PB), and Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) etc. In this experiment, we calculated the solvation free energies with the PB and GB methods.

The nonpolar solvation term in the MM(GB)PBSA method combines an implicit estimate of the entropic changes associated with the insertion of a solute into the solvent. However, it is obvious that the entropic impact of changes in the configurational freedom of the protein and ligand upon complex formation in vacuo. As a general rule, in the process of protein–ligand binding, the restrictions to the number of conformations causes a reduction in entropy; this contribution is known as the configurational (or conformational) entropy. For some systems, some researchers have found that the calculated binding affinity values is more colse experimental binding affinity values by incorporating a normal mode estimation of the entropic component of the binding free energy alongside MMPB(GB)SA(Sadiq et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2014). Including this contribution, the final binding affinity estimate ΔG

                        vib are the contributions to changes in translational, rotational, and vibrational freedoms, respectively.To explore the impact of the binding residue for binding energies, the intermolecular interactions between each residue of the NHR of gp41 and inhibitors were calculated in terms of the pair interaction decomposition of free energy (Miller et al., 2012). The calculations were also performed over MD trajectories using the decomposition energy module in AMBER12 and AmberTools13. The steps of the experiment are shown in Fig. 2
                        .

The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone residues in regard to the initial structure versus simulation time is shown in Fig. 3
                        . The results indicate that the RMSD of the complex1 fluctuates reaching a value of about 3Å at 10ns and keep stable throughout the course of the trajectory. The RMSD of the complex 2 fluctuates reaching a value of 4Å at 10ns and remains stable from 10ns to 30ns. From 30ns to 35ns, an increasing trend in RMSD behavior is observed. Afterwards complex 2 seems to relatively stable for the next 15ns about 5Å. Overall, the fluctuation of RMSD of the complex 2 is larger than the complex 1, which means that the complex 2 is relatively unstable (Fig. 3). To know the extent of variation of individual residues of inhibitor (MT-SC22EK and SC22EK) and receptor respectively, in complex systems, the per-residue root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) of backbone atoms were computed. In the case of receptors, we observed the No. 571-590 residue of the complex 1 shows higher RMSF than that found in complex 2 (Fig. 4
                        ). On the other hand, RMSF of the two inhibitors is same.

The RMSD dissimilarity matrix about the structure of the complex along the trajectory (from the beginning of the optimization to 10ns MD simulations). The blue color indicates the correlation; the red color represents the uncorrelation (Fig. 5
                        ). To see this can provide some implications: (1) RMSD of complex 1 reaches 3Å (Fig. 5a), and complex 2 reaches 4Å (Fig. 5b). This also explains that compared with complex 2, complex 1 is more stable. (2) The similarity of the initial structure and the MD stable structure is weak, which means that the final structures obtained from the stable trajectory that had no relation to the starting structure.

Contributions of the binding free energies are summarized in Table 1
                        . The binding free energy of the complexes 1 and 2 is −46.70kcal/mol to 38.17kcal/mol, respectively. The binding free energy of the complex 1 is considerably higher than the complex 2. In accordance with the energy components of the binding free energy (Table 1), we found that the electrostatic and van der Waals energies contributed to strong favorable binding of the receptor with the ligand. The non-polar solvation energies (

                        , Table 1).

Many key residues contribute to binding free energies that ensure the stability of the protein–ligand systems. The binding free energy was decomposed into per-residue to create a per-residue spectrum (Fig. 7
                        a,b). The approach of residue decomposition is tremendously useful to clarify the inhibition mechanism at a molecular level and helpful to locate contribution of individual residue to the ligand–receptor interactions, too. The decomposition of

                        ). It can be seen that the van der Waals energy contributes mostly to the binding free energies.

To further get insight into the difference contribution between the complex 1 and the complex 2 in the van der Waals energies, we calculated each residue’s contribution to the van der Waals (Fig. 8
                        ). We can see: Ile573, Leu576, Gln577 (in the receptor) and Trp623, Trp626, Tyr633 (in the ligand) have a positive contribution to the van der Waals energy in complex 1; in contrast, the contribution to the binding energy of the residues significantly decrease in complex 2. Overall, the van der Waals interaction of each residues in the two systems has a significantly difference.

The hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that occupied more than 20% are listed in Table 2
                        . It shows the system of complex 1 has more H-bonds than the other system. In the system of complex 1, there are two inter-hydrogen bonds (Trp626 and Thr567, Trp623 and Ile571) and two intra-hydrogens (Thr634 and Ile630, Ser644 and Leu640). However, in the other system, there only two intra-hydrogen bonds (Thr632 and Ile628, Ser642 and Leu638). The M-T structure is conducive to form more H-bonds between receptor and the ligand (Table 2). This also explains the reason why the Trp623 and Trp624 have a positive contribution to the van der Waals energy in complex 1 (Ma et al., 2014).

We analyzed the contact residues near the hydrophobic pocket to further explore the differences of the van der Waals contribution in the two systems (Fig. 9
                        ). The pocket is formed by a cluster of hydrophobic residues, including Leu565, Leu566, Leu568, Thr569, Val570, Trp571, Gly572, Ile573, Lys574, Leu576, and Gln577 (Sardari et al., 2013). According to the experiment reported, when the distance between molecules is greater than 8.5Å, the van der Waals forces between the molecules is negligible (Li and Chou 2003). We calculated the number of contact residues between the hydrophobic pocket of gp41 and the ligands (Table 3
                        ). By comparison, we found that there are more contact residues in the complex 1 than the other (Table 3). From the binding model of the gp41 with the ligand (Fig. 8), we find that the MT-SC22EK inserts the groove of gp41 completely. However, the C-terminal of the SC22EK tend to be away from the combination (Fig. 8b). The analysis of the contact residues reveals that the M-T hook can further fortify the interaction by “hooking” the pocket residues tightly; in contrast, this structure do not appear between SC22EK and the NHR of gp41. To a certain extent, it can explain why the van der Waals interactions between MT-SC22EK (with M-T) and NHR of gp41 are a few stronger than that of the other.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The primary objective of this work focused on exploring the molecular mechanism that M-T hook structure in fusion inhibitors improved the anti-HIV activity of inhibitors. MM-PBSA (GBSA) was used in conjunction with normal mode analysis to successfully account for experimental binding free energies between the gp41 protein and MT-SC22EK (or SC22EK). Average energies were obtained from samples of 100 snapshots extracted from MD simulations. Free energy decomposition on a residual basis indicates differences between MT-SC22EK and SC22EK. We found the M-T hook structure was contributed to the van der Waals energy, which was favorable to the binding energy. The analysis of the H-bond indicated that the system with the M-T hook structure formed more stable H-bonds than the system without M-T hook structure, and these hydrophobic interactions also played a key role in the binding process. The analysis of the contact residues revealed that the M-T hook could further fortify the interaction by “hooking” the pocket residues tightly; in contrast, this structure do not appear in the system without the M-T hook.

This work has provided the detailed molecular mechanism that M-T hook structure in fusion inhibitors. In order to improve lead compounds activity, during drug design, these interactions should be considered carefully. Our research illustrates that the interactions between gp41 and short peptide ligands may lead to possible anti-HIV drug design in the future.
