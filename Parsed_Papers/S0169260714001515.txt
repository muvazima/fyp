                  This paper proposes new combined methods to classify normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals using wavelet transform (WT), phase-space reconstruction (PSR), and Euclidean distance (ED) based on a neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM). WT, PSR, ED, and statistical methods that include frequency distributions and variation, were implemented to extract 24 initial features to use as inputs. Of the 24 initial features, 4 minimum features with the highest accuracy were selected using a non-overlap area distribution measurement method supported by the NEWFM. These 4 minimum features were used as inputs for the NEWFM and this resulted in performance sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.33%, 100%, and 98.17%, respectively. In addition, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to measure the performances of NEWFM both without and with feature selections.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Human brain disorders are responsible for many physiopathological diseases, especially epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that is generally characterized by sudden and recurrent seizures [10,13,20]. Until recently, the occurrence of an epileptic seizure was unpredictable and its mode of action was little understood [9].

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a highly complex signal and it provides one of the most commonly used information sources for studying brain function and neurological disorders [2]. Study of the brain's electrical activity, using electroencephalographic records, is one of the most important steps in the diagnosis of neurological diseases [1,14,31,32,41].

EEG signal processing uses nonlinear methods, such as the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension is used to measure the complexity or degree of the EEG signal disorder [8,13,23]. Apart from EEG, Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was developed specifically for nonlinear and nonstationary signal analysis [36]. Time and frequency domains are commonly used in feature extraction methods for the EEG signals and cross-correlations of EEG time series have been used for high performance classification of the time domain features [7,12,15,45,51]. Past research shows that, to analyze the frequency domain features, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was applied first followed by the calculation of power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals [15,34]. Grammatical evolution (GE) [35,44], eigenvector methods [12,49,50], and the Fourier transform [39] are also other reported approaches for extracting features when classifying epileptic signals from the EEG recordings.

EEG signals have been decomposed into time–frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [5,11]. First, EEG signals are decomposed into several sub-signals by DWT, and then wavelet coefficients of the several sub-signals are produced. The wavelet coefficients were used as inputs of Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [11]. Genetic programming is applied to extract new features, which are nonlinearly transformation from the wavelet coefficients [9]. Wavelet entropy was obtained from the wavelet coefficients on the several sub-signals, and then the wavelet entropy was used as features [20]. Statistical methods were also used to extract features from the wavelet coefficients [46]. Certain features based on DWT were obtained and applied as different classifiers during epileptic EEG classification, including methods, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference [11], relative wavelet energy (RWE) with artificial neural network (ANN) method [26], multistage approach for clustering [16], new phase space-based approach to automatically classify sleep-wake cycle [4], mixture of expert model [46] and support vector machine (SVM) [7].

In the current study, a neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM) [21,22,24] that is known to deliver excellent performance in prediction and classification was used to classify the normal and the epileptic seizure signals from the EEG signals and 3 preprocessing steps were implemented for this purpose. The 3 preprocessing steps, applied sequentially, comprised of wavelet transform (WT), phase-space reconstruction (PSR), and Euclidean distance (ED). NEWFM and non-overlap area distribution measurement method were used for classification and feature selection. In this regard, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to compare the performances of NEWFM without feature selection and NEWFM with feature selection.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related works. Section 3 describes EEG datasets used in this paper. Section 4 describes feature extraction and selection method. Section 5 provides experimental result. Discussion and conclusion have been included in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Until now, several techniques have been proposed for the classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals in the literature and EEG classification accuracy have been reported. A description of the previous research follows.

Güler and Übeyli [11] proposed the ANFIS to classify EEG signals using wavelet coefficients. The presented ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Guo et al. [9] applied genetic programming (GP) to perform automatic feature extraction since GP can improve the discrimination performance of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and decrease the input feature dimension. Kumar et al. [20] reported entropy based detection of neurological disorders, where three entropies, called as wavelets, were used as feature selection parameters and the neurological disorders were classified using two neural network models, viz. recurrent Elman network and radial basis network. Subasi [46] proposed an ANN based expert model, with a double-loop Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, for the detection of epileptic seizures. This study employed DWT for feature extraction on the same two sets of the epileptic EEG signals.

Ling et al. [26] proposed DWT, RWE along with ANN to classify the EEG signals. The EEG signals were first decomposed into different frequency bands with DWT. The RWE provided information about the relative energies associated with the different frequency bands of the EEG signals. A feed-forward ANN was finally used for classification. Abawajy et al. [16] proposed a novel multistage approach for classifying large and highly dimensional dataset. The multistage approach combined dimensionality reduction algorithms, multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms and several supervised classification algorithms. Arnaud et al. [4] proposed a new phase space-based approach to automatically classify sleep–wake cycles in humans, using only two EEG electrode positions. However, this study did not classify each sleep stage using phase space analysis (mainly on Poincare plot), which is generally applied in non-linear and relatively short time series analysis. Chandaka et al. [7] utilized a cross-correlation aided SVM classifier for classifying EEG signals of healthy subjects with eyes open and epileptic patients during seizure with the epileptic EEG signals. This study involved least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and feature extraction using a clustering technique.

In the literature, numerous techniques have been used to obtain representations and extract features of interest for the classification purposes. Until now, there is no study that is related to the phase-space reconstruction and ED approach for feature extraction of the EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines the wavelet transform, phase-space reconstruction, and ED comprising of feature selection based neural network, with weighted fuzzy membership function (NEWFM), to classify the normal and the epileptic seizure EEG signals.

This study used EEG signal datasets (http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3&changelang=3) to classify normal and epileptic seizure signals [3,46]. The experimental dataset was first divided into five sets denoted as A, B, C, D, and E, each containing 100 single-channel EEG signals and each signal is of 23.6s in duration [3,46]. These segments were selected and cut out from continuous multi-channel EEG recordings after visual inspection for artifacts, e.g., due to muscle activity or eye movements. Sets A and B consisted of segments taken from surface EEG recordings that were carried out on five healthy volunteers using a standardized electrode placement scheme (according to the international 10–20 system) [39].

Sets A and B have been acquired using surface EEG recordings of five healthy volunteers with eyes open and closed, respectively. Sets C, D, and E originated from the EEG archive of presurgical diagnosis. The EEGs from five patients were selected, all of whom had achieved complete seizure control after resection of one of the hippocampal formations, which was therefore, correctly diagnosed to be the epileptogenic zone. Segments in set D were recorded from the epileptogenic zone, and those in set C from the hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the brain. While sets C and D contained activities measured during seizure free intervals, set E contained only seizure activities. All EEG signals were recorded with the same 128-channel amplifier system, using an average common reference. The data were digitized at 173.61 samples per second using 12 bit resolution. Band-pass filter settings were 0.53–40Hz (12dB/oct). Furthermore, in this study, sets A and E have been used for comparison with Chandaka's performance [7], Ling's performance [26] and Subasi's performance [46]. In a previously report by Kumar, performances of sets A and E were compared with those of sets B and E, and finally it was concluded that A and E are better in performance than B and E [20].

Sets A and E, depicted in Fig. 1
                     , were used to classify the normal and epileptic seizure signals. These sets contained 100 files and each file contained 4097 successive EEG signals. The 4097 successive EEG signals were further divided into eight sets, each with 512 signals (4096 total) and the remaining one EEG signal was deleted. Thus, 800 sets of 512 signals were created from the 100 files. The 800 sets were then mixed at random. As shown in Table 1
                     , the first 500 sets were used as training sets, while the remaining 300 sets were used as test sets, as done previously by Chandaka, Ling, and Subasi.

@&#METHODS@&#


                        Fig. 2 shows the process for classifying normal and epileptic seizure signals. The proposed model consists of two parts. The first part is preprocessing part for feature extraction and second part deals with classification and feature selection using NWFM. The methods involved in the first part are as follows: as a first step, wavelet coefficients are created from the EEG signals using WT (Fig. 2
                        ). In the second step, wavelet coefficients are plotted in a two-dimensional phase space diagram using PSR. In the third step, the ED is calculated between the wavelet coefficients plotted in a two-dimensional phase space diagram and the origin (0, 0), and then initial features were extracted from the EDs using statistical methods. In the second part, the minimum features with the highest accuracy were selected using a non-overlap area distribution measurement method implemented with the NEWFM. The minimum features were used as weighted fuzzy membership functions that preserved the disjunctive fuzzy information and characteristics [21,24].

The Fourier transform [28] is frequently used for signal processing to analyze signals within certain frequency domains. However, it is not suitable for processing any time-frequency information since they cannot be analyzed simultaneously. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was recently utilized to facilitate efficient time-frequency analysis. The DWT decomposes non-station signals at different frequency intervals with various resolutions [5]. The original signal is decomposed into a set of coefficients describing the frequency content at given times. The DWT can be defined as follows [30]:

                            are coefficients for the corresponding low-pass and high-pass filters. A filtered signal at level i is down-sampled, thereby reducing the length of the signal at level i
                           −1 by a factor of two and generating the detail (d

                              i

The primary advantage of DWT is that, a short or a long time-interval either can be used to observe the characteristics of the signals. For a signal with rapid variation, a small window can be applied, whereas, for a signal with slow variation, a larger window can be used [38]. Additionally, both the approximation coefficients and the detail coefficients can be calculated at the same time [29]. Selection of suitable wavelet and Decision of the number of decomposition levels are very important in analysis of signals using the DWT. The number of decomposition levels is chosen based on the dominant frequency components of the signal [46].

In this study, we produced wavelet coefficients, including detail and approximation coefficients at levels 1–5, using Daubechies 4 (DB4), which is the most frequently used method for EEG signal analysis with WTs [1,18,40,52]. Table 2 shows the frequencies corresponding to different levels of wavelet decomposition for the EEG signals with a 173.6Hz sampling rate.

The extracted features, shown in Table 3
                            were used to represent the frequency distribution of the wavelet coefficients of the EEG signals. These features were calculated for the decomposed signals, shown in Table 2
                           . Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the features of Table 3 on the sets A and E. It was observed that, these features extracted from the decomposed EEG signals for the sets A and E are different from each other. Therefore, we decided that wavelet coefficients can be served as useful parameters in classifying normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals.

It is sometimes necessary to search for patterns in a time series and in a higher dimensional transformation of the time series. Phase space reconstruction (PSR) is a method used to reconstruct the so-called phase space. The concept of phase space is a useful tool for characterizing any low-dimensional or high-dimensional dynamic system. A dynamic system can be described using a phase space diagram, which essentially provides a coordinate system where the coordinates are all the variables comprising mathematical formulation of the system. A point in the phase space represents the state of the system at any given time [42,43].

                              i

                            shows the wavelet coefficients plotted in a two-dimensional phase space diagram.

PSRs for the wavelet coefficients of normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals are shown in Fig. 4. These figures show that the patterns related to the higher dimensional transformations can be more discriminate than those in the time series itself. Fig. 4 also shows that PSR's points of normal EEG signals accumulate more around the origin than those of the epileptic seizure EEG signals, and therefore, the normal signals are in the phase portraits and are more regular than the epileptic seizure EEG ones.

Euclidean distance measures can be used in decision-making. The Euclidean distance has been studied and applied in many fields, such as clustering algorithms and induced aggregation operators [19,33,47]. The Euclidean distance is the distance between two points in an Euclidean space. The Euclidean distance between the origin (0, 0) and PSR (X

Based on the Euclidean distance values E(i) in Eq. (4), 24 features were used as initial inputs for NEWFM and these were extracted using the statistical methods described in Table 4
                           . Features 1, 2, and 3 in Table 4 represent the frequency distributions of Euclidean distance E(i), while feature 4 represents the amount of variation in the frequency distributions [17,46].

                            compares the features in Table 4 on the sets A and E. From Fig. 5, the Euclidean distances calculated from the PSR for the wavelet coefficients in the sets A and E are different from each other. This implies that the Euclidean distances calculated from the PSR can also serve as useful parameters in classifying the normal and the epileptic seizure EEG signals, similarly as Fig. 3
                           .

This study used a NEWFM for classifying normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals. The NEWFM is a supervised classification neuro-fuzzy system that uses the bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership functions (BSWFM) [21,22,24]. Fig. 6 shows that the NEWFM contained three layers, i.e., the input, hyperbox, and class layers. The 24 features extracted using the feature extraction method explained in Table 4 were used as inputs for the NEWFM, as shown in Fig. 6
                           .

As shown in Fig. 7
                           , the weights and the center of each membership functions are adjusted by the Adjust(B
                           l) operation in Algorithm 1, e.g., W
                           1, W
                           2, and W
                           3 are moved down, v
                           1 and v
                           2 are moved toward a

                           3 remains in the same location [25]. After learning, each of n fuzzy sets in hyperbox node B
                           l contains three weighted fuzzy membership functions (WFMs, gray membership functions in Fig. 8). The bounded sum (one of operations on fuzzy set) of WFMs (BSWFM) in the ith fuzzy set of

It has been found in recent years that a large number of features available in many small devices (say, smart phones) are the primary cause of slow operation speed, function failure and inefficiency of the device memory, which makes the device unusable. Irrelevant data can cause confusion in algorithms and lead to false conclusions, thereby producing poor results. The primary aim of feature selection is to eliminate redundant or irrelevant features and enhance the performance of a device with high accuracy and lower the operating costs, using minimum features. To select the best features in this study, the 4 minimum features with the highest accuracy were selected from 24 initial features using the non-overlap area distribution measurement method implemented with the NEWFM. This method measures the degree of salience of the ith feature based on the non-overlapped areas in the area distribution using the following equation [21,24]:

                           Fig. 9 shows examples of both good and bad candidate features selected from the 24 initial features. Specifically, the figure shows the features of two BSWFMs, obtained during the training process with the NEWFM program. The two BSWFMs graphically demonstrate the difference between a normal and an epileptic seizure signal for each input feature. The features shown in Fig. 9
                           (b) are in a state where the two BSWFMs almost overlap with each other and differ from the features shown in Fig. 9(a). In this regard, Fig. 9(b) features appears ambiguous because they cannot be easily divided into normal and epileptic seizure signals. The f(i) values are obtained using Eq. (6) and these values are greater for the features in Fig. 9(a), compared to those in Fig. 9(b). In Table 5
                           , “√” indicates features Algorithm 2 finally selected from the 24 initial features.

We employed the ROC curve to compare the classification performances of NEWFM both without and with feature selections. The ROC curve is a graphical plot of true positive fraction with sensitivity as the y-coordinate and false positive fraction with specificity as the x-coordinate. The ROC can also be represented equivalently by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the positives (True Positive Rate) and the fraction of false positives out of the negatives (False Positive Rate) [6,27]. The area under the ROC (AUC) can be used to measure the performances of NEWFM both without and with feature selections, based on the principle – greater the area, higher is the accuracy.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this study, normal and epileptic seizure signals were classified from the EEG signals following Chandaka et al. [7], Ling et al. [26], and Subasi [46]. Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows the BSWFMs for two feature inputs out of the 24 feature inputs. Differences between the normal and epileptic seizure signals for the 24 feature inputs can be visualized and related characteristics can be analyzed.

Classification performances are shown in Tables 6 and 7
                        
                        . The NEWFM performance was compared with the support vector machine, RWE with ANN, and the mixture of expert model, which were used by Chandaka, Ling and Subasi as classification models, respectively. Table 8
                         shows that NEWFM with feature selection was compared with the NEWFM without feature selection, support vector machine, RWE with ANN, and the mixture of expert model. NEWFM with feature selection method outperforms other methods. But, Ling's Sensitivity [26] is higher than the current proposed method. To this end, further study is needed to increase the sensitivity. As the AUC of the NEWFM with feature selection is wider than that of the NEWFM without feature selection in Fig. 10
                        , NEWFM with feature selection performed better than NEWFM without any feature selection, in classifying normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

This study used the WT, the PSR, and the Euclidean distance in the preprocessing steps to extract useful features from EEG signals. First of all, we produced wavelet coefficients from EEG signals using the WT, and then the PSR was used to plot wavelet coefficients in a two-dimensional phase space diagram. Next, the Euclidean distances were calculated between wavelet coefficients plotted by the PSR and the origin (0, 0). Finally, 24 features were extracted from the Euclidean distances using statistical methods. 4 minimum features with the highest accuracy were selected from the 24 initial features by the NEWFM. The NEWFM obtained BSWFMs for the 4 minimum features to identify the fuzzy membership functions for the 4 features. These fuzzy membership functions were used to classify the normal and the epileptic seizure signals from the EEG signals. Using the 4 minimum features as inputs for the NEWFM, 96.33% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 98.17% accuracy were obtained. These values represented a much better performance when compared to those of Chandaka, Ling or Subasi. Furthermore, when the ROC curve was tested, it was observed that the AUC of the NEWFM with feature selection is wider than the NEWFM without feature selection, which confirms that the former is better and outperforms the latter. To conclude it can be stated that NEWFM is a useful technique to represent the characteristic of EEG signals. Improvement in feature selection method in view to enhancing the sensitivity is planned as the future work.
