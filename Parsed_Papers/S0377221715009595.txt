                  A presale program is popular with manufacturers who wish to reduce the risk posed by uncertain demands. We introduce a new price mechanism in which the manufacturer during the presale period does not disclose the exact regular price in the sale period although it is guaranteed to customers to be higher than the presale price. As positive leadtime is much overlooked in presale models, we analyze the rationality of including one. The numerical results in this paper show that both the specific price mechanism and the positive leadtime have significant effects on the manufacturer’s policy (production quantity, presale price, regular price), the expected profit, and customer behaviors. The optimal discount rate should be greater than 50 percent. This conclusion is consistent with existing results of surveys on saturation points. The manufacturer can take advantage of the latest information on demand gathered in the presale period to update their policy and increase their expected profit.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Customers can buy a product from a manufacturer at the regular price in the sales period. They can also order the product at a known presale price (a discounted price) in advance. We study the optimal production quantity, presale price, and regular price for the manufacturer if customers in the presale period do not know the future regular price, except that it will not be less than the presale price. As leadtime (production time) is important, it is also considered in this paper. This study is motivated by real cases and the weaknesses related to the leadtime in the existing models.

The presale program is slightly different to the advance booking discount program, in which customers know both the discounted price and the regular price. Nevertheless, we may say that the advance booking discount program is a special case of the presale program.

In this paper, two different price mechanisms base on two real cases in which the manufacturer discloses or does not disclose the exact regular price together with the presale price. The first case is that in 2013, Wing Wah Cake Shop, a well-known food company in Hong Kong, disclosed all prices on rice dumplings, which are traditional Chinese food for the annual Dragon Boat Festival, before May 1. (In 2013 the festival fell on June 12.) The presale price of each type of rice dumpling is 88.89 percent of its regular price, and the regular price is 90 percent of the reference price (Table 1
                     ). The company seems very confident on its prices and/or other competitive advantages. It, however, faces the high risk of losing its market if competitors provide products at lower prices. This may be the reason why some manufacturers prefer to disclose presale prices and reference prices (not regular prices) in the beginning. The second case is that in 2007, Maxim’s Catering Limited, a well-known food and beverage company in Hong Kong, began to accept advance orders for moon cakes, which are traditional Chinese food for the annual Mid-Autumn Festival, from the end of June. (The festival fell in September in 2007.) The presale prices were discounted prices of “reference prices”, as in Table 2
                     . A “reference price” is not a regular price, but an upper limit of the regular price. When the manufacturer in the presale period does not disclose the exact regular price, some customers may order the product in advance for fear of uncertain higher prices in the future.

Furthermore, a positive leadtime is a key reason for a seller to apply the presale program or the advance booking discount program. However, the existing models of the advance booking discount program either exclude a positive leadtime or have unreasonable assumptions. Fig. 1
                      shows one example, in which products are unavailable during the leadtime interval in the sales period because the manufacturer orders materials at the end of the presale period.

Thus, a positive leadtime was introduced into our presale models to deal with problems in older models, and our numerical results support its introduction. In this paper, customer’s sensitivity function is a linear function, and the demand follows a uniform distribution. Then, the expected profit is discussed under four situations: (1) known regular price and zero leadtime; (2) undisclosed regular price and zero leadtime; (3) known regular price and positive leadtime; (4) undisclosed regular price and positive leadtime.

The remainder of this paper contains eight sections. Section 2 reviews literature. Section 3 introduces the basic model with a known regular price and zero leadtime. Section 4 extends the model to one with an undisclosed regular price, and Section 5 extends it to one with a positive leadtime. Then, Section 6 considers an undisclosed regular price and a positive leadtime together. Numerical experiments are described in Section 7. Section 8 discusses the influence of the latest demand information on the manufacturer’s policy. Section 9 contains discussions and future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

As presale program relates to seller, buyer, price, product quality, information, etc., there are many possible ways to study this topic.

Much attention has been devoted to the presale strategies of the seller. Weng and Parlar (1999) evaluated the optimal order quantity and discount rate for a retailer’s profit. Xie and Shugan (2001) determined when and how to presell in a variety of situations. Tang, Rajaram, Alptekinoğlu, and Ou (2004) proved that a seller could obtain more expected profit with the advance booking discount program than without the program. They also considered the effects of updating demand forecasts on the optimal discount rates. Inspired by their research, we include a positive leadtime, which was not studied well in models of the advance booking discount programs, into our model. We also allow the manufacturer to change his/her price after observing some information about demand. Erkoc, Iakovou, and Spaulding (2005) optimized the order quantities in a model with three stages for a food and beverage problem in the cruise industry. Bellantuono, Giannoccaro, Pontrandolfo, and Tang (2009) suggested that to obtain high benefit, a manufacturer and a retailer share revenue, and the retailer provides an advance booking discount program to the customers. Mesak, Zhang, and Pullis (2010) investigated the impact of the discount rate and the competitive entry on the allocation policy of service capacity in continuous time. Prasad, Stecke, and Zhao (2011) identified in which situation the strategy with the presale program can result greater expected profit than without advance selling. Lim and Tang (2013) determined the optimal pricing strategies when a market had myopic customers, forward-looking customers, and speculators.

A number of studies have been performed on the relationship between the seller’s strategies and the structure of buyers. Cai, Wang, Han, Zhou, and Huang (2010) assumed that exactly one of the buyers can order before the regular sale period. The strategy was different if this buyer also purchased the product in the regular sale period. Cho and Tang (2013) modeled three selling strategies of a manufacturer, i.e. preselling, regular selling, and combination of preselling and regular selling, as Stackelberg games between the manufacturer and a retailer. They observed that the combination strategy could benefit the manufacturer, but might make the retailer worse. In addition, competition may be considered if there are sellers. McCardle, Rajaram, and Tang (2004) studied competition strategies when each of two sellers can use or does not use the presale program.

Discount rate is the key factor for customer distribution, but frequent and large discounts do not guarantee that the seller’s objectives are achieved. Mobley, Bearden, and Teel (1988) concluded that the marginal utility (i.e., favorable impression) of customers decreases as the discount rate decreases. Neslin, Powell, and Stone (1995) supported the notion that some customers are attracted to a relatively low price. By experiments, Della Bitta and Monroe (1981) observed that customer responses could have significant differences between the 10 percent and 30–50 percent discount levels and between the 20 percent level and 50 percent level, but not much differences between the 30 percent, 40 percent and 50 percent levels. Gupta and Cooper (1992) found a price threshold level of 15 percent and a saturation point for price discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent in the USA. Marshall and Leng (2002) reported similar results in their study on Singapore. These papers are based on real cases; our analysis consistently shows that the optimal discount level should be less than 50 percent.

Information plays an important role in the process. Fisher and Raman (1996) showed that the information obtained soon after the release of the product is useful for increasing the accuracy of forecasts on demand, and for improving the seller’s performance. Gurnani and Tang (1999) updated forecasting while considering two replenishment instants. Sethi, Yan, and Zhang (2001) and Yan, Liu, and Hsu (2003) considered demand information updating on inventory management. We conduct numerical experiments to show the contribution of information when a demand has high correlation with an earlier demand. Mostard, Teunter, and Koster (2011) compared five existing and new forecasting methods of forecasting demand. However, Li and Zhang (2013) claimed one different conclusion that the seller’s expected profit could decrease under some conditions when the seller had more accurate advance demand information. Their conclusion is a bit far away from intuition. They explained it as the seller would reduce the presale price and consumers were less willing to purchase in advance. In fact, since more accurate advance demand information there just means higher correlation coefficient in the bivariate normal distribution, the conclusion can be explained by another way: The reason is that the demands in two periods have more close relationship at higher correlation coefficient. Hence, as the correlation coefficient increases, the seller clearly has higher probability to improve demand information, but the expected profit was expected value evaluated at the beginning of the presale period – before the seller realized the real demand in the presale period.

The seller may like to control information in the presale period. Chu and Zhang (2011) stated that when a seller introduced a new product, the seller had to release some information of the product in advance, but not the full information. In this paper, we compare the situation where the seller does not post the regular price in the presale period with the situation where the seller posts the regular price.

For uncertain (incomplete information) cases, many researchers have reported that individuals are able to estimate reasonable probabilities of random events. von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) stated there objectively exist these probabilities; Savage (1954) claimed that these probabilities could be subjective. No matter that these probabilities are objective or subjective, they can be used to evaluate expected values. Acquisti and Grossklags (2007) reviewed some works about psychology and behavior, and then focused on privacy decision making. In our paper, some customers in the regular sale period order the product in the presale period if the seller does not post the regular price at the beginning. We also consider the effects of information on customer behavior and the seller’s profit.

Coordination in the supply chain may lead to a win-win situation. Hung, Su, and Lin (2011) claimed that both of a supplier and a retailer can benefit if they coordinate to determine the ordering time where the supplier wanted the retailer to make the order earlier to reduce the production cost, but the retailer liked to make the order later since the demand is uncertain at the time of ordering the products. The capacity was infinite there. When the capacity was limited, Yu, Ahn, and Kapuscinski (2015) considered how to distribute the capacity and determine the prices in the advance sale period and the spot period where consumer valuations were uncertain in the advance sale period. They found that sale policies really depend on valuation interdependence.

Some customers may not be sure on the product quality with 100 percent since the product has not been available when customers order. Su (2009) concerned the product quality, and customers can return products. Yu, Kapuscinski, and Ahn (2015) showed that product quality and capacity allocation had clear relationship when the manufacturer was going to send out the quality information by capacity allocation.

Another interesting topic in presale program is about order cancellation. As customers order the product in the presale period and obtain it in the sale season, some customers may regret and make cancellations later because they change their favor or the valuation of the product decreases over time. Lai, Wang, and Zhou (2004) studied an installment payment method that allows customers to quit at certain points of time. You (2006) studied the situation in which customers can cancel their orders anytime with certain costs. Dye and Hsieh (2013) allowed customers to cancel reservations in the presale period, and they proved that the presale price was less than the regular price. (In this paper, we assume that the regular price is guaranteed to customers to be higher than the presale price.) Nasiry and Popescu (2012) showed that there was a regret threshold, over which the seller should not accept orders in advance. In contrast to order cancellation, rebate is one way to reduce customer’s risk of ordering in advance and increase sales. Customers can obtain rebate on the condition of weather in Gao, Demirag, and Chen (2012).

Finally, in this paper, the demand is assumed to have two possible levels, i.e., either high level or low level. Clearly, it is a simplification of reality. However, if the demand in a model was with a lot of levels, the computation would be very complex, as stated by Van Mieghem and Dada (1997). For this, Cachon and Lariviere (1999) presented their model with two level demands, and also claimed that it is sufficient to discuss the basic problem. In practise, major airports used simple high/low scenario when investing tens of billions dollar project such as the Hong Kong airport’s third runway according to HKIA’s master plan (demand forecasting section), which is available at Hong Kong international airport’s website. Kincaid, Tretheway, Gros, and Lewis (2012) also modeled the real demand as high demand and low demand in Appendix D in their report.

Without presale programs, a manufacturer has a traditional sales period, which lasts from timet
                     1 tot
                     2, to sell one type of product at the regular pricep per unit (Fig. 2). The manufacturer purchases materials to exactly match the forecasted demand and makes the product at time t
                     1. The production leadtime is zero such that the product is available from time t
                     1. The product cost isc per unit.

Notations are listed in Table 3
                     . Those in Appendix G are not in this table since they are only in one short section. Capital Greek letters are used to denote the objective function in different situations. The superscript “*” indicates optimization. The appendices contain the proofs of all following theorems and propositions.

Customers are sensitive to the price, and the sensitive function is given by 
                        
                           r
                           (
                           p
                           )
                           =
                           α
                           −
                           τ
                           p
                           ,
                        
                      where α and τ are constants. When the price is p, the demand will be r(p)D at two possible amounts: 
                        
                           D
                           =
                           h
                        
                      with the probability ξ and 
                        
                           D
                           =
                           ℓ
                        
                      with the probability 
                        
                           1
                           −
                           ξ
                           ,
                        
                      where h > ℓ > 0. Then, the expected D is 
                        
                           E
                           [
                           D
                           ]
                           =
                           μ
                           =
                           ξ
                           h
                           +
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           ξ
                           )
                           ℓ
                        
                     .

Demands are satisfied on a first-come-first-served basis. If the product is out of stock, unsatisfied demands are ignored; if it is overstocked, the salvage value is s per unit where s < c < p.

Now, the manufacturer wants to apply a presale program whose presale period is from time 0 to t
                     1, and the presale price is xp where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. If the discount rate is smaller, more customers will move from the sales period to the presale period. Here, we want to set their relationship as simple as possible to highlight the new issues. Thus, suppose that 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           x
                           )
                           100
                        
                      percent customers would like to make an order in the presale period, and the other customers still consider to purchase the product at the regular price p in the sales period. Then, the demand in the presale period is 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           x
                           )
                           r
                           (
                           p
                           )
                           D
                           ,
                        
                      and the demand in the sales period is xr(p) D. There are no other differences from the situation without presale programs.

At time t
                     1, the demand from time 0 to time t
                     1 has been realized, and it should be satisfied. Then, the expected profit in the presale period is 
                        
                           E

The manufacturer purchases materials at time t
                     1 to satisfy the realized demand, plus Q units to satisfy the demand from time t

                     ” means that the discounted price in the presale period is over 50 percent of the regular price in the sales period. This conclusion is consistent with the results from real surveys by Gupta and Cooper (1992), and Marshall and Leng (2002).


                     Theorem 1 shows that the manufacturer should make more products if the expected revenue per unit is enough to cover the unit cost; otherwise, the manufacturer should make fewer products. (If the expected revenue per unit equals the unit cost, the manufacturer will make the same expected profit at different production levels. To simplify our presentation, assume that the manufacturer selects the highest production level.)

In Section 3, customers know both the presale price and the regular price since time 0. In this section, customers find out the exact regular price only from time t
                     1. Before time t
                     1, i.e., in the presale period, they know the presale price, and that the regular price will not be less than the presale price.

Suppose that
                      there is a psychology threshold T of the discount rate, where 0 < T < 1. If x ≥ T, the customers make no change; otherwise, the customers who intended to purchase the product in the sales period have the probability β to purchase the product in the presale period. Thus, βxr(p) D customers will move from the sales period to the presale period.

Given p, the case with x ≥ T is the same as Section 3. For the case with x < T, the expected profit in the presale period

                            the manufacturer can increase the expected profit by 68.51 percent by not disclosing the regular price in the presale period.

We searched for the optimal price, discount rate and production quantity in steps of $0.01, 0.01, and 1, respectively.


                           For the same price p, a manufacturer applying the undisclosed regular price strategy should set a higher (or equivalent) discount rate and a lower (or equivalent) production quantity than a manufacturer who does not apply the policy.
                        

In this section, the regular price is fixed and disclosed at time 0, but a positive leadtime is considered. The difference from Section 3 is that as a result of the positive leadtime, the model here has three stages (Fig. 4). The original presale period is divided into two intervals, namely, Period 1 (the interval from 0 to t
                     0), and the positive leadtime (the interval from t
                     0 to t
                     1) in which the manufacturer produces the products. In other words, the manufacturer does not produce during the sales period; the manufacturer has sufficient time to produce if the materials arrive before the time t
                     0. (Note that the customers are not aware of the leadtime since the price does not change from time 0 to t
                     1.) Suppose that the manufacturer is going to purchase materials only at time t
                     0.

When the manufacturer makes the decision on the quantity of materials at time t
                     0, they have realized the exact demand from time 0 to time t
                     0, and will satisfy it completely. Thus, the whole quantity of materials is the realized demand plus the pending quantity Q to satisfy the demand from time t

                        Theorem 4
                        
                           The optimal discount rate satisfies

                           . The manufacturer may take the risk of letting the product go out of stock if the unit penalty of out of stock is relative small and the demand in the leadtime may be greater than the demand in the sales period.
                        

If the unit penalty g is large the manufacturer would want to order a large quantity of materials to avoid having the product going out of stock; if the demand in the leadtime is small, the manufacturer may not worry about the penalty risk since the production quantity over the minimum demand in the sales period is sufficient to satisfy the maximum demand in the leadtime.

                        Example 3
                        If the penalty for the product being out of stock is small then the manufacturer can accept the risk. If the penalty increases then the manufacturer reduces the risk by adjusting price, discount rate and production quantity.

                           . The policy changes are shown in Table 4. The real demand in the leadtime may not be satisfied under the optimal policy when g ≤ 7; when g > 7, the real demand in the leadtime will be completely satisfied. It is interesting that neither the optimal price nor the production quantity monotonically increases in this example.

A positive leadtime is considered here, and the regular price in the sales period is disclosed at time t
                     1 (Fig. 5). The situation is basically the same as that in Section 5, except that customers do not know the regular price before time t
                     1. They have the same psychological threshold of discount rate as in Section 4. Given p, if x ≥ T, the optimal x and Q have already been determined in Section 5. Hence, assume in this section that x < T.

                           The manufacturer may take the risk of out of stock if the unit penalty for the product going out of stock is relative small and the demand in the leadtime may be more than the demand in the sales period.
                        

We conducted experiments on different combinations of 12 parameters, with each parameter having two levels (Table 5), resulting in 
                        
                           
                              2

                      combinations. The processes of searching for the optimal policy and evaluating the performance of each combination in one combination are the same or similar to that in Example 1 (“ ξh
                     ” will be discussed in Section 8).

We would like to make an observation on the percentage of products whose presale prices are (almost) the same as their prices in the sales period. In Table 2, five products out of seven have the presale prices as same as their prices in the sales period. In other words, 71.4 percent (i.e. 
                        
                           5
                           7
                        
                     ) of products have the discount rate 1.00. Although all the cases in our experiments are with the optimal discount rate less than 1.00, the percentage of cases whose optimal discount rates are 0.99 is close to 71.4 percent: 67.2 percent of cases under the models in Sections 3 and 4 have the optimal discount rate 0.99, and 77.7 percent of cases under the models in Section 5 and Section 6 have the optimal discount rate 0.99. (Note that the discount rate is accurate to two decimal places here. Many optimal discount rates would be greater than 0.99 if we improved the accuracy.)

To discover the effects of an undisclosed regular price and/or a positive leadtime, the basic model in Section 3 was compared with the models in Sections 4– 6 through numerical experiments. For each experiment, we first found out the optimal policy in each model. Then, we evaluated the expected profit, the expected demand in the presale period, and the expected demand in the sale period. Finally, we performed factor analysis on the difference between the optimal prices, optimal discount rates, optimal order quantities, expected profits, and expected demands of the basic model and each of the other models.

In the model of Section 4, customers do not know the regular price in advance. In the model of Section 3 customers know all prices at the beginning. There is no other difference between the two models.

The manufacturer must carefully consider whether to disclose the regular price at the beginning because β and T have significant effects on the expected profit, production quantity, and prices (Table 6).

Customer behaviors can obviously change if regular prices are not disclosed in the presale period. This is shown by the existing significant factors on the change of “Expected demand in the presale period” and “Expected demand in the sales period”.

The leadtime is positive in Section 5 and it is zero in Section 3. The two models have no other difference.

When there is a positive leadtime the manufacturer makes use of the data in Table 7 to think of the optimal policy: (1) all the factors except the penalty g are significant on the expected profit; (2) the column with the heading “w” shows that a positive leadtime has a significant effect on the manufacturer’s policy.

The penalty due to out of stock is not a significant factor here. Normally neither the manufacturer nor the customers expect the product to go out of stock. Thus, this penalty factor does not have a significant impact on both the manufacturer’s policy and the customer’s behavior. In fact, when we talked with several manufacturers a number of years ago, they expressed a similar opinion about penalty in a business contract. Moreover, other factors can also be cited, such as (1) the optimal discount rate x ≈ 90 percent in our experiments, so that most of the demands remain in the regular sales period; and (2) the demands follow the distribution without accident to be at an extreme high level. Of course, if the demand is much higher than expected distribution, then the product may go out of stock and the manufacturer may fail to meet the demands from time t
                        0 to t
                        1. In practice, some sellers provide numbered vouchers to customers so that the upper limit of orders can be fully controlled.

                           Remark 1
                           Even if the high level of g is increased to 12 in Table 5, this factor is not significant yet. It does not mean that the factor can simply be ignored since the policy can be different sometimes. In Example 3, the optimal production quantity increases from 567 to 629 when g increases from 7 to 8 in Table 4.

The rows “Expected demand in the presale period” and “Expected demand in the sales period” show that customer behaviors are obviously changed due to the positive leadtime. Although the customers are not aware of the leadtime and only care about prices, the manufacturer would like to change the prices because of the leadtime.

The regular price is not disclosed immediately and the leadtime is positive in Section 6. The model there has no other differences from the model in Section 3.

In Table 8, the columns with the headings “ β”, “ T”, and “ w” show that both the undisclosed price and positive leadtime are important for the manufacturer’s expected profit and policy decision; the last two rows show that the policy changes lead to a clear change in customer behaviors.

In the previous sections, the manufacturer’s decision policy does not change, even after observing the real demand in the early stages.

For example, in Fig. 3, the manufacturer has observed the demand in the presale period and may actually adjust their policy at time t
                     1. Next we discuss updating the policy in Section 6 according to the latest demand information.


                     Section 6 assumed that the demand from time t
                     0 to t
                     1 and the demand from time 0 to t
                     0 are both high or both low. Now, suppose that the demand from time t
                     1 to t
                     2 is related to the demand from time 0 to t
                     1 in the following way: if the demand from time 0 to t
                     1 is

At time 0, the manufacturer determines the optimal policy and discloses the presale price. At time t
                     0, the manufacturer updates the production quantity and the regular price according to the demand information from time 0 to t
                     0. (Note that the updated regular price will not be less than the presale price yet.)

To show the effects of demand information on expected profit, we performed experiments on the 4096 combinations of the parameters in Table 5. The maximum difference between the expected profit obtained using the latest demand information and not using it is 58.66 percent, and the average is 1.31 percent. Three hundred fourteen combinations result in differences over 3 percent, with their average difference being 15.27 percent. These results show that manufacturers can benefit by updating their policy according to the latest demand information.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper studied several presale mechanism for a manufacturer. Manufacturers often provide a lower price in the presale period, but some manufacturers like to post the regular price in the sales period at the beginning as the others does not. Since the leadtime makes the analysis complex, many models about advance booking assumed that the leadtime was zero. To show the effects of a positive leadtime and an undisclosed regular prices on the performance and policy of a manufacturer, we assumed the demand at two possible levels (i.e. high level and low level) to keep the difficulty acceptable. Then, the results from numerical experiments supported the hypothesis that both a positive leadtime and an undisclosed regular price are important factors to be considered in implementing a presale program.

According to the results, in practice, a manufacturer not only follows the regular procedure to estimate the demand distribution, but also needs to study the customer’s psychological threshold of the discount rate. Then, the manufacturer may consider whether to disclose the regular price at the beginning of the presale period. The production leadtime cannot be ignored in the decision process. After observing the demand in the early stage, the manufacturer needs to update the decision if it is possible.

When the presale period or the production leadtime is long, the manufacturer may produce in batches in the process to match demand and reduce the risk. Then, one interesting problem is to consider multiple chances for the manufacturer to order materials.

The demand with two possible levels is just a simplification of reality, and it is a limitation of this research. If the real demand had several levels, it can be reasonable to believe that the results would be no much difference. However, the real demand distribution may follow uniform distribution, normal distribution, or another one. Thus, further validation work is necessary.

Our models assume that the aggregate demand r(p) D is independent of the presale price xp. If the aggregate demand depends on both of the presale price and the regular price, the results are no difference such as the optimal discount rate is always greater than 
                        
                           1
                           2
                        
                      (Appendix G shows the details).

Moreover, this paper supposed that the manufacturer knows the customer’s psychological threshold of the discount rate. If customers knew that the manufacturer has considered the psychological threshold when making decisions, they might have different reactions, and the manufacturer in turn might have to make some changes. The manufacturer or customers may use game theory as a tool to play this complete/incomplete information game.

Finally, an interesting issue is that a manufacturer can integrate his/her experience with our models and results to generate strategies in practice. It is possible for industry and academia to achieve a win–win situation by cooperation. For example, the discount level is less than 50 percent according to real cases and our models. This result may be an inevitability instead of a possibility if our models have captured the main features of real cases. If yes, what exactly are the features?

                      The root formula of a cubic equation can be obtained from a lot of books such as the Handbook of Mathematical Sciences Beyer (1978). After considering whether those roots are feasible, we can obtain the optimal price.

The objective function (or roots) expression would look complex if we presented it using the original notations. Thus, we do not show their expressions.

The discount rate difference between the undisclosed regular price situation and the determined price situation can be zero or the following two cases:

                                       ” means that the demand in the leadtime is possible to be more than the demand in the sales period. Only at this case, the optimal production quantity is less than the maximum demand in the leadtime. In other words, the manufacturer has the penalty risk of out of stock. Given parameters, we have to evaluate the objective function under the optimal policy from (2.2) and under the optimal policies from other feasible regions. Thus, the optimal policy from (2.2) may not be the global optimal policy for a problem given parameters. For this, we conclude that the manufacturer may take the penalty risk of out of stock only for the case (2.2).

We first study the optimal discount rate.
