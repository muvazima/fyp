                  This study presents a kind of fuzzy robustness design for nonlinear time-delay systems based on the fuzzy Lyapunov method, which is defined in terms of fuzzy blending quadratic Lyapunov functions. The basic idea of the proposed approach is to construct a fuzzy controller for nonlinear dynamic systems with disturbances in which the delay-independent robust stability criterion is derived in terms of the fuzzy Lyapunov method. Based on the robustness design and parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme, the problems of modeling errors between nonlinear dynamic systems and Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models are solved. Furthermore, the presented delay-independent condition is transformed into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) so that the fuzzy state feedback gain and common solutions are numerically feasible with swarm intelligence algorithms. The proposed method is illustrated on a nonlinear inverted pendulum system and the simulation results show that the robustness controller cannot only stabilize the nonlinear inverted pendulum system, but has the robustness against external disturbance.
