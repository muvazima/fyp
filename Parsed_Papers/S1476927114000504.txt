                  We describe a new mathematical method for finding very diverged short tandem repeats containing a single indel. The method involves comparison of two frequency matrices: a first matrix for a subsequence before shift and a second one for a subsequence after it. A measure of comparison is based on matrix similarity. The approach developed was applied to analysis of the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They were investigated regarding the presence of tandem repeats having repeat length equal to 2 – 11 nucleotides except equal to 3, 6 and 9 nucleotides. A number of phase shift regions for these genomes was approximately 2.2×104, 1.5×104 and 1.7×102, respectively. Type I error was less than 5%. The mean length of fuzzy periodicity and phase shift regions was about 220 nucleotides.
                  The regions of fuzzy periodicity having single insertion or deletion occupy substantial parts of the genomes: 5%, 3% and 0.3%, respectively. Only less than 10% of these regions have been detected previously. That is, the number of such regions in the genomes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae is dramatically higher than it has been revealed by any known methods. We suppose that some found regions of fuzzy periodicity could be the regions for protein binding.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fast development of sequencing methods led to a rapid accumulation of DNA sequences from genomes of various organisms (Liu et al., 2012; Xuan et al., 2012). Consequently, it gave rise to investigations of biological functions of DNA sequences and development of new mathematical methods for biological sequence analysis. It is essential to understand sequence properties and associate them with biological functions.

Effective mathematical methods have been developed to search for short tandem repeats including mini- and microsatellites (Gulcher, 2012; Merkel and Gemmell, 2008; Weber, 1990). Mini- and microsatellites play a key role in genome evolution by providing increased recombination rate (Myers et al., 2008; Richard and Pâques, 2000; Usdin, 2008). They are also related to many genetic diseases (Batra et al., 2010; Puri and Manku, 2010) and are supposed to be involved in adaptive evolution (Despons et al., 2011; Gemayel et al., 2010). From a practical standpoint, they are useful in genotyping and personal identification (Guichoux et al., 2011; Manasatienkij and Ra-ngabpai, 2012).

Many mathematical methods and algorithms for finding short tandem repeats have been developed in the last decade (Lim et al., 2013). Efficiency of tandem repeat detection depends on the sensitivity of these methods. Under sensitivity we mean the ability to detect highly diverged tandem repeats including mini- and microsatellites which have accumulated many point mutations. The methods for detecting short tandem repeats can be roughly divided into two classes (Merkel and Gemmell, 2008). The first class includes the methods that detect tandem repeats by using similarity between single periods within analyzed sequence. The second one consists of the methods that use spectral approaches for signal processing. The methods of the first class can efficiently detect periodicity with indels. However, they require all single periods in a sequence to have high similarity with each other. Usually this is related to the fact that a weight matrix for symbol pairs is used to estimate similarity between periods. So these methods may fail to find tandem repeats if similarity between single periods is low or absent. The methods of the first class are used in such programs as RepeatMasker (Chen, 2004), RECON (Bao and Eddy, 2002), REPuter (Kurtz et al., 2001), mreps (Kolpakov et al., 2003), Tallymer (Kurtz et al., 2008), TRF (Benson, 1999) and some other programs. The methods of the second class can reveal fuzzy periodicity having dissimilar single periods with some limitations. The methods of the second class are discrete Fourier transform, other spectral approaches (Leclercq et al., 2007; Saha et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2004; Sussillo et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2009) and the method of information decomposition (Korotkov et al., 2003a, 2003b).

Thus a gap appears to exist in current methods for finding tandem repeats (including mini- and microsatellites). Quite likely, there exist significantly more tandem repeats than are known currently. This gap is due to the fact that current methods cannot detect ancient tandem repeats that have accumulated large amount of both substitutions and indels.

Our objective is to develop a mathematical approach that will be able to find satellites in a case when both similarity between periods is low and the indels are present (fuzzy periodicity). The information decomposition method for finding periodicity in symbolic sequences was suggested earlier (Korotkov et al., 2003a, 2003b). This method is able to find periodicity in nucleotide or amino acid sequences containing large number of substitutions. Therefore, there is no statistically significant similarity between individual periods, but there is similarity for a set of more than two periods. Dynamic programming and many other algorithmic approaches usually cannot reveal fuzzy periodicity because they compare periods pairwise. Statistical significance of similarity between any two periods of fuzzy periodicity can be very low.

Spectral approaches such as Fourier or wavelet transform have several weaknesses for the detection of fuzzy periodicity. First, this is due to the fact that the spectral approaches can’t find the periodicity in presence of indels. Second, periods with a length greater than the size of a sequence alphabet are represented incorrectly in the resulting spectral density (Korotkov et al., 2003a). For instance, the intensity of DNA periods those are four or more symbols long “spreads” into shorter periods. This drawback is also observed for amino acid sequences when period length is greater than 20. Moreover, it can also be significant for short periods if such periods contain the same amino acid in more than two positions (Korotkov et al., 2003a, 2003b).

The information decomposition method allows to find fuzzy periodicity in various genes and amino acid sequences (Korotkov et al., 1997, 1999) and to classify the periodicity types observed (Frenkel and Korotkov, 2008; Shelenkov et al., 2006). It was also found that fuzzy periodicity with a period length about 10–12 nucleotides was present in promoter sequences. Such periodicity may correspond to DNA bend near promoter region (Shelenkov and Korotkov, 2009). Further development of the information decomposition method was aimed to improve detection of fuzzy periodicity containing indels. The first step was to detect frameshifts in fuzzy triplet periodicity, i.e., to reveal fuzzy periodicity containing a single indel (Korotkov and Korotkova, 2010; Korotkova et al., 2011). This approach has shown that bacterial genomes contain about 4% of genes having frameshift mutations. These results almost do not include sequencing errors because the analyzed bacterial genomes have been sequenced dozens of times. At the same time, eukaryotic genomes contain over 9% of genes having frameshifts though some of these cases can be related to intron and exon identification errors.

In this paper we significantly modified this algorithm to reveal highly diverged tandem repeats containing single indel. We developed a new mathematical measure of similarity between frequency matrices. This measure was used to search for fuzzy tandem repeats in the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by evaluating various period lengths from 2 to 11bp. Detection of indel was modeled as detection of a phase shift in periodicity (Korotkov and Korotkova, 2010). The results show that there is considerably larger number of mini- and microsatellites in these genomes than were revealed earlier by other methods. Furthermore, a greater part of these genomes can be related to highly diverged tandem repeats.

For a subsequence from x
                           1 to x
                           2 we calculate one matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2), while for a segment from x
                           3 to x
                           4 we calculate n matrices W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4), t
                           =1,2, …, n. Next we compare the matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2) to the matrices W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4), t
                           =1,2, …, n using the similarity measure shown in Section 2.1.2. If there is an insertion of t
                           −1 nucleotides in a sequence at coordinate x and the subsequence from x
                           1 to x
                           4 contains tandem repeats, then the matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2) will be similar to the matrix W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4), but not to W
                           1(x
                           3, x
                           4). Otherwise the matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2) will be similar to the matrix W
                           1(x
                           3, x
                           4). No similarity between the matrices V(x
                           1, x
                           2) and W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4), t
                           =1,2, …, n are observed in the absence of periodicity between x
                           1 and x
                           4.

Matrix similarity ensures detection of tandem repeats in a subsequence from x
                           1 to x
                           4. We can check whether this subsequence has an insertion or not by finding out which of the matrices W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4), t
                           =1,2, …, n is the most similar to V(x
                           1, x
                           2). When there is no such similarity for all values of t, we can conclude that there are no tandem repeats (for a given period length n) in a subsequence from x
                           1 to x
                           4. If the maximum similarity was found for t
                           =1, then sequence contains tandem repeats in a segment from x
                           1 to x
                           4 with no indels near x. Maximal similarity for t
                           >1 shows that the sequence analyzed contains tandem repeats in a segment from x
                           1 to x
                           4 with insertion of t
                           −1 bases (or deletion of n
                           −
                           t
                           +1 bases) near x.

Let us introduce the measure of similarity of matrix W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4) and matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2) as the argument of standard normal distribution Z(t). Then P(x
                           >
                           Z(t))) shows the probability that the similarity between the matrices W
                           
                              t
                           (x
                           3, x
                           4) and V(x
                           1, x
                           2) is due to random factors. A detailed calculation of Z(t) for two matrices is carried out in Section 2.1.2.

We vary a size l from 60 to 300 bases by changing the positions x
                           1 and x
                           4 keeping x
                           1
                           ≥ 1 and x
                           4
                           ≤
                           L. Then we look for l that maximize Z(k) for the current position x (Section 2.1.2). We denote it as 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       max
                                       (
                                       Z
                                       (
                                       t
                                       )
                                       )
                                    
                                    l
                                 
                              
                           . Thus varying position x with a step of n bases covers the entire sequence S. We check the similarity between the matrix V(x
                           1, x
                           2) and each of the matrices W

In this study we searched for fuzzy tandem repeats having indel at position x, where x was varied over entire chromosome sequence. So the length of the sequence S was greater than tens of thousands nucleotides. In order to analyze such a long sequence, we calculated the functions

After calculating F(x) for a sequence S and for a set of periods we searched for local maxima of this function. To do this, we constructed binary sequence S
                           
                              b
                           . This sequence contained ‘1’ at position x if F(x)>
                           Z
                           0 and ‘0’ otherwise. Then we choose a subsequence S
                           
                              b
                            which satisfies four conditions: (1) subsequence contains at least three subsequent ‘0's at its beginning; (2) subsequence contains at least three subsequent ‘0's at its ending; (3) Subsequence contains at least three subsequent ‘1's in the middle; (4) subsequence can contain any combinations of ‘0’, ‘1’ except the combination of three and more subsequent ‘0's. For each segment we found the maximum value of F(x). Then we filtered all local maxima in two steps. (1) We excluded overlapped segments which contained local maxima for the same period length. From two overlapped maxima we kept the one having greater value of F(x). As a result, we obtained a set of local maxima for one period length with no overlaps. (2) Then we excluded repeated segments from results for all period lengths. If two or more segments with local maxima had overlapped regions, we kept the local maximum with greater F(x) value and excluded the local maxima for other period lengths. This filtration allowed us to exclude multiple occurrences of a periodic segment for different period lengths.

We estimated statistical significance of the local maxima found for

                              k
                            by using pseudorandom number generator. Sequences R
                           
                              k
                            had the same length as C
                           
                              k
                           . Then we sorted sequences R
                           
                              k
                            in ascending order and recorded information on all transpositions made. We rearranged bases in sequences C
                           
                              k
                            as we did for R
                           
                              k
                            sequences. Finally we created the sequence S
                           
                              r
                            which consisted of the shuffled sequences C
                           
                              k
                            at positions i
                           =
                           k
                           +
                           dn. So the length, the nucleotide composition of the sequence S
                           
                              r
                            and its periodicity matrix (see definition of V in Section 2.1.1) was the same as of the sequence S.

Threshold value was chosen iteratively. First, we chose low threshold value Z
                           0
                           =1.0. Then we applied the algorithm from Sections 2.1.1–2.1.3 to S and found local maxima for 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       max
                                       (
                                       Z
                                       (
                                       t
                                       )
                                       ,
                                       x
                                       )
                                    
                                    l
                                 
                              
                            function with a value greater than Z
                           0. Let us denote the number of such local maxima as LM. Then we made the same calculations for 100 random sequences S
                           
                              r
                           , got amount of local maxima for each sequence and calculated LMR – mean number of local maxima for all random sequences. If LMR/LM was greater than 0.05, then we added 0.1 to a threshold value and repeated the procedure. If LMR/LM became less or equal to 0.05, then we stopped iterations and current Z
                           0 value was considered as a threshold value required.

Thus for every chromosome we have two intervals: from 1 to Z
                           0 and from Z
                           0 to +∞. We introduced two random variables E
                           1 and E
                           2. A random value E
                           1 was equal to the number of local maxima in the range from Z
                           0 to +∞ in one S
                           
                              r
                            sequence. A random value E
                           2 was equal to the number of local maxima in the range from Z
                           0 to +∞ in S. The random variables E
                           1 and E
                           2 had binomial distribution. Let N
                           1 denote the number of local maxima in S in the first interval and K
                           1 denote the mean number of local maxima in one S
                           
                              r
                            sequence. The number of maxima in the right interval of S was denoted as N
                           2, and the number of maxima in single S
                           
                              r
                            sequence was denoted as K
                           2. This means that the random variables E
                           1 and E
                           2 are equal to K
                           2 and N
                           2. Let us set up two alternative hypotheses:
                              H0
                              
                              That probabilities p(E
                                 1)=
                                 p(E
                                 2)

That probabilities p(E
                                 1)≠
                                 p(E
                                 2)

We can estimate the probability p(E
                           1) as K
                           2/(K
                           1
                           +
                           K
                           2) and the probability p(E
                           2) as N
                           2/(N
                           1
                           +
                           N
                           2). As a criteria for testing null hypothesis we took the random variable (Gmurman, 2003):

                           1 and E
                           2 can be considered as approximately normal, and, consequently, the difference U′=

To obtain the standard normal distribution we should subtract the mathematical expectation M(U′) from the variable U′ and divide the result by the standard deviation σ(U′).

                           =0.0 or less we use white color, while for the maximal Y we use black color. Grayscale was used for Y in the interval from 0.0 to the maximum value. If we have a statistically significant periodicity in the sequence S, than the value of Y will be relatively large (5.0 and higher). In this case a square with sides stretching from 1 to l
                           1 for the x-axis and from 1 to l
                           1 for the y-axis is colored in dark colors. If a sequence has a phase shift of periodicity at the point x
                           0, then plot is splitted into 2 squares and 2 rectangles. Two squares at the coordinates (1:x
                           0, 1:x
                           0) and (x
                           0:l
                           1, x
                           0:l
                           1) will be painted in dark colors since the matrices of triplet periodicity in these coordinates will be similar. Two rectangles at the coordinates (1:x
                           0, x
                           0:l
                           1) and (x
                           0:l
                           1, 1:x
                           0) will be painted in light colors because the periodicity matrices in these coordinates will be different due to the phase shift. Thus contour plot allows us to see regions with phase shifts in a sequence S.

                           1 to x
                           4 to estimate statistical significance of periodicity in this segment (periodicity with a period length n). If the algorithm from Sections 2.1.1–2.1.3 allows finding indel at x correctly, then statistical significance of this segment with indel taken into account must be greater than the one without consideration of indel. To estimate statistical significance we calculated information matrix V(x

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

We have tested the approach developed on 300 nucleotides long artificial sequence having periodicity Q
                     =7.0 and a period length of 5 bases (Section 2.1.6). We have deleted one base in the middle of the sequence. Then we analyzed this sequence and calculated the value of

                                 ,
                                 x
                                 )

                      for position x. Fig. 1
                      shows that the function

                                 ,

                      runs up to the maximum exactly in the middle of the sequence. It shows that the method can successfully detect phase shifts in periodical sequences. We have also built contour plot for the artificial sequence (Fig. 1b). This plot shows that periodicity of sequence segments for positions from 1 to 150 and from 151 to 300 is similar inside each segment, but the periodicity between these segments is different because of a phase shift. To verify the method, we randomly shuffled this sequence and analyzed it. Fig. 1c contains a plot for values of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 max
                                 (
                                 Z
                                 (
                                 2
                                 )
                                 ,
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                              l
                           
                        
                      over x for this random sequence. We can see that there are no statistically significant phase shift points.

Next we analyzed the method sensitivity (type II error). We generated test sequences with RSR pattern where section S was a periodic sequence with a shift in the middle and periodicity level of Q
                     =5.0. This section was 500 bases long. Section R was a random sequence of the same length as S. For the given periodicity level the method can find shifts in the last section for 26–41% of test sequences. Test results are shown in Table 1
                     . This test is quite strict. For periodicity of higher Q level the method will be more sensitive. Therefore we obtained the lower estimate of its sensitivity.

We have analyzed the genomes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae for a set of various period lengths (2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11). We have not analyzed period lengths that are multiple to 3 bases because such periodicities are related to triplet periodicity of coding regions in DNA sequences and are out of our scope here. Phase shifts in triplet periodicity have been considered previously (Frenkel and Korotkov, 2009; Korotkov and Korotkova, 2010).

We have taken threshold value Z
                     0 as significance level in such a way that the number of phase shifts in randomly shuffled sequences was less than 5% of the number of phase shifts in genome sequences. Fig. 2
                      shows an example of determining Z
                     0 value for the first chromosome of C. elegans for the period length equal to 2. Other threshold values were chosen in the same way.

Then we have compared the results obtained with tandem repeats that have been found previously by Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF) program and are available in the TRDB database (Gelfand et al., 2007). The results obtained are shown in Tables 2–4
                     
                     
                     . These tables show that only a minor part of periodic sequences having phase shift was detected by TRF earlier (<1%). It can be noticed that the number of phase shifts for some period lengths is significantly larger than for other ones. For instance, TRDB contains 1995 tandem repeats with a period length 2 from D. melanogaster genome, while we have found 8831 such periodic segments containing phase shift. Such an effect is observed for several period lengths for the genomes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae.

The genomes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae have been analyzed earlier by the information decomposition method. Fuzzy periodicity regions with no periodicity phase shifts were found (Korotkov et al., 2003a, 2003b). We have compared these results (which are available in MMSAT database (Shelenkov et al., 2008)) with the results of this study. We have taken into account that periodical segment lying to the left or to the right from x can be found by the information decomposition method because these segments do possess periodicity when taken separately from each other. Therefore we considered that the information decomposition method detected the same region as the current method providing the following conditions. (1) The information decomposition revealed the periodical region which included the region to the left from x (from x
                     1 to x
                     2) and also at least a half of the region to the right from x (from x
                     3 to x
                     4). 2. The information decomposition revealed the periodical region which included the region to the right from x (from x
                     3 to x
                     4) and also at least a half of the region to the left from x (from x
                     1 to x
                     2). The comparison made showed that less than 10% of phase shift regions that were found by the current method have been detected previously by information decomposition method.

Also we have tried to find periodical regions revealed in this study by other approaches listed in Section 1. We have not found the fuzzy periodicity revealed in this study.

Let us review several examples of the periodicity found. Fig. 3
                      shows graphs for the region between positions 4611048 and 4611132 in chromosome 2R of D. melanogaster genome. This segment is periodical with a period length 2 and contains a phase shift in the middle. Fig. 3A shows the values of max Z(2) for the position x in this segment. The plot contains a peak value max Z(2)=14.3 in the middle of the segment (near position 150). The peak indicates phase shift from the phase I to the phase II which is a result of one base insertion or deletion.

Let us review another example. It contains periodicity phase shift in a period of length 5. This example is shown in the Fig. 4
                     . Fuzzy periodicity region containing phase shift was found between the positions 391630 and 391970 of S. cerevisiae chromosome IX. It can be seen that max Z(2) has an extreme value. Contour plot also confirms the presence of a phase shift.

Thus this work demonstrates that the genomes of three given organisms contain fuzzy periodicity having phase shifts resulting from indels. It turns out that several types of tandem repeats can exist in a genome. Four types of tandem repeats can be distinguished by classification on the base of a level of accumulated point mutations (both indels and substitutions). Let us list them:
                        
                           1.
                           Ideal tandem repeats can be detected rather easily by all known methods such as dynamic programming, spectral approaches and information decomposition. All periods are identical to each other and there are no indels in a sequence. Some micro- and minisatellites are considered to be of this type.

Imperfect tandem repeats that have accumulated rather small number of point mutations. All spectral approaches cannot detect this type of tandem repeats well, but the programs like Tandem Repeat Finder based on dynamic programming can detect them well. Imperfect tandem repeats preserve statistically significant similarity between any two periods. Namely, this fact allows detecting tandem repeats by the methods based on dynamic programming. A lot of micro- and minisatellites are considered to be of this type.

Fuzzy periodicity that was previously found by the information decomposition method. Currently there is no strong evidence that fuzzy periodicity is descended from tandem repeats, but in silico experiments demonstrated such a possibility (Korotkov et al., 2003a, 2003b). One may assume that the regions of fuzzy periodicity were tandem repeats at the very beginning. But noticeable similarity between periods is absent since sequence has accumulated great number of substitutions. At the same time, such sequences have no indels. Fuzzy periodicity was found in many genes and amino acid sequences (Korotkov et al., 1999).

Fuzzy periodicity with indels that was detected in this work. Such periodicity also could be descended from tandem repeats. But, contrary to the previous type, it has accumulated both substitutions and indels. One of the hypotheses is that these are the most evolutionary ancient tandem repeats that have accumulated considerable amount of mutations. Therefore they are the most hard to find. The proposed method can reveal fuzzy periodicity containing single indel.

The question is “what portion of a genome can be occupied by such sequences?” We have found that the mean length of fuzzy periodicity regions having phase shift is 220 bases. The number of regions having phase shifts is about 1.7×102, 1.5×104 and 2.2×104 for S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and C. elegans genomes, respectively. If we take into account the genome length, then the regions found in this work occupy about 0.3%, 2% and 5% of the genomes, respectively. It is quite substantial fraction of genomes, especially if we consider that we have included in calculation only the regions having fuzzy periodicity in presence of a single indel. Taking into account the regions having more indels will significantly increase this fraction. However, the development of such methods comes across considerable problems.

The origin of these subsequences can be related to micro- and minisatellite formation and their later divergence. We assume that the areas of fuzzy periodicity without indels and the areas found in this study represent rather ancient micro- and minisatellites that have accumulated considerable number of substitutions, but only several indels.

Also we have analyzed possible correlation between the areas of phase shifts and both promoter positions and nucleosome binding sites. However, 4.3%, 3.1% and approximately 1% of the promoters of the genomes C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae contain at least one sequence of fuzzy periodicity with a phase shift. No significant statistical positive correlations were found. We only found the low negative correlation between promoter positions and found regions with fuzzy periodicity. It means that promoters avoid the presence of these regions around.

We suppose that part of found regions could be protein binding sites. It was known earlier that simple sequence repeats can bind proteins (Csink and Henikoff, 1998). In this case the large divergence of nucleotides is possible because not DNA bases but certain groups of atoms in a large or small grooves of DNA are important for binding proteins. Therefore sequence of mini and microsatellites can significantly diverge without losing their functional value. This evolutionary divergence without loss of biological function can occur if the found sequences play a role in chromosome organization or are involved in the processes of DNA replication.(Kashi and King, 2006; Li et al., 2002). Table 5
                      contains four binding sites for transcription factors and some other proteins in D. melanogaster genome. We used the ORegAnno database (Griffith et al., 2008; Montgomery et al., 2006) to find them. These sequences are periodic and contain a phase shift. Phase shift point x is close to center of these binding sites. However, only 1% of DNA-binding sites collected from the ORegAnno database for D. melanogaster genome contains fuzzy periodicity with a phase shift. Such a small share of periodic sequences with a phase shift can be a result of several reasons. Firstly, many DNA-binding sites may have a fuzzy periodicity with no insertions and deletions. Secondly, they may have a periodicity with several insertions or deletions (Shelenkov and Korotkov, 2009) that are not detected by the present method. Thirdly, many DNA-binding sequences may have the periodicity with a large number of substitutions of DNA bases. Consequently statistical significance of the periodicity in these sequences may be below the threshold level selected in the present work. If the threshold level of our work will correspond to 10-20% of false positives (instead of 5%) then the number of DNA-binding sites having periodicity with a phase shift will be several times greater.

It is necessary to develop a mathematical method which will take into account any required number of insertions or deletions in the analyzed sequence when searching for a fuzzy periodicity. This is quite difficult mathematical problem and it is similar to the task of finding multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences with no use of pre-calculated weight matrices. It seems that solution may allow to develop new mathematical approaches for identifying DNA-binding sites as well as for finding all periodic sequences in different genomes.

Altogether, this study shows that a number of various tandem repeats in a genome is rather large. Most likely, tandem repeats have no restrictions on sequence divergence. So sequence modifications can be quiet substantial. This leads to formation of fuzzy periodicity in nucleotide sequences that can be either continuous or can contain indels. Because of such a severe divergence these sequences may be greatly polymorphic and hence can be used as markers for various genetic characteristics.
