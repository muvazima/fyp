                  We study infinite-horizon, optimal switching problems for underlying processes that exhibiting “fast” mean-reverting stochastic volatility. We obtain closed-form analytic approximations of the solution for the resulting quasi-variational inequalities, that provide quantitative and qualitative results for the effects of multi-scale variability of the underlying process on the optimal switching rule. The proposed methodology is applicable to a number of operations research problems involving switching flexibility.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An important class of problems arising in operations research are the so-called optimal switching problems, in which the objective is to find the optimal time to initiate or terminate a process, subject to uncertainty. This general formulation finds numerous applications in manufacturing and logistics (e.g. Benaroch, Webster, & Kazaz, 2012), networked systems, optimal control of energy systems (see for example Parpas and Webster, 2014; Ho and Parpas, 2014, and references therein), decision support (e.g. technology choice in Bobtcheff & Villeneuve, 2010), production management and capacity choice (see, e.g. Dixit, 1989; Trigeorgis, 1993; Pindyck, 1988; McDonald & Siegel, 1985), but also in fields such as natural resource management (see, e.g. Brennan & Schwartz, 1985; Paddock, Siegel, & Smith, 1988), transportation and shipping, etc. (Kavussanos, Tsekrekos, & Cullinane, 2011; Sødal, Koekebakker, & Aadland, 2008).

A key issue in all the above problems is the determination of the stochastic model that can represent the random evolution of the process in question, hereafter called the underlying. Depending on the particular concrete application in mind, the underlying can be interpreted in different ways, for instance a product price in manufacturing, an input price like the price of electricity in energy systems, a commodity price in natural resource management, etc.

A useful class of models for the evolution of the underlying is the family of Itô processes, which lead to convenient formulations of switching problems in terms of elliptic or parabolic quasi-variational inequalities (see for example Bensoussan & Lions, 1984; Brekke & Øksendal, 1994), the solution of which provides useful insights on the optimal switching decision rule. Most of these models adopt the assumption of constant volatility for the underlying process, mainly for analytical and numerical convenience. However, there is ample empirical evidence that often the underlying displays stochastic volatility effects, which may develop on different time scales (Eydeland & Wolyniec, 2003; Hikspoor & Jaimungal, 2008). In particular, one characteristic feature of volatility is that its mean-reversion rate is quite “fast”, as compared to the time scale of evolution of the other state variables, a feature referred to as fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility. This has also been documented for the volatility of financial asset prices (Alizadeh, Brandt, & Diebold, 2002; Fouque, Papanicolaou, Sircar, & Sølna, 2003a, 2003b; Hillebrand, Fomby, & Terrell, 2006), and stochastic volatility has played a prominent role in the valuation and hedging of financial derivatives, explaining many stylized facts of such markets. A comprehensive review related to stochastic volatility in financial markets is Taylor (1994), and a multi-scale approach to the problem of hedging and pricing financial derivatives has been developed in Fouque, Papanicolaou, Sircar, and Sølna (2011), leading to increased recent activity in this field (see for example Souza & Zubelli, 2011; Zhu & Chen, 2011a; 2011b; Chen & Zhu, 2012).

Despite the fact that asset and commodity prices have been documented to exhibit fast mean-reverting volatility, the study of its effects on optimal switching policies has been overlooked. It is the aim of this paper to examine optimal switching decisions under multi-scale stochastic volatility, and assess its quantitative and qualitative effects.

To accomplish this, we formulate and solve infinite-horizon, optimal switching problems driven by a general class of stochastic volatility models that exhibit fast mean-reversion. We employ the perturbation method of Fouque, Papanicolaou, and Sircar (2000) on the resulting quasi-variational inequalities, a fact that allows us to approximate the full problem with a sequence of simplified and manageable problems, each one offering a “correction” of different order to the decision rule corresponding to the constant-volatility model. These corrections, that are the effect of fast stochastic volatility, are derived in closed-form, allowing one to analytically approximate the solution of the general switching problem up to any desired order. Our analytic approach is important as it lends itself easily to comparative statics that are of value to decision-makers dealing with processes or projects that can be switched from and to an idle/active mode, contingent on state variables that exhibit random evolution on multiple scales. Moreover, as the full multi-scale optimal switching problem is difficult and tricky to handle by numerical methods, our analytic results offer useful benchmarks for the numerical analysis of the full problem. Our general results are illustrated in terms of the extension of the switching problem in Dixit (1989), for multi-scale volatility.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 starts by presenting a general optimal switching problem under fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility, and proceeds by providing a general perturbative framework for the analytic approximation of the solution to any desired order. In Section Section 3 we illustrate the method for the multi-scale volatility extension of the switching problem in Dixit (1989) and provide comments on the qualitative and quantitative effects of multi-scale volatility on the optimal policy. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

Consider a risk-neutral decision maker contemplating a project/process that can operate in two modes (active or idle) and which, depending on the mode, produces a stochastic flow payoff Rq
                     (P) (
                        
                           q
                           =
                           0
                        
                      is idle, 
                        
                           q
                           =
                           1
                        
                      active), where P is a commodity or product price (underlying) that can be modeled by a diffusion process. Transition from one mode to the other can take place instantaneously and for an unlimited number of times, but at constant fixed costs, each time a transition decision is made.

                        1
                        The assumption of risk-neutrality is not crucial for the solution and it is made only for simplicity. The extension to a risk-averse process/project owner is straightforward and we make it available upon request from the authors. Equally non-crucial is the assumption of instantaneous transition from one mode of operation to the other. Switches between modes that take time to implement could be easily be accommodated, only at the cost of extra notation.
                     
                  

The problem we consider here, is that of finding the optimal switching decision rule, for a wide class of diffusion models for the price process, exhibiting dynamics on fast/slow time scales, and in particular providing semi-analytic approximations for the decision rule. This framework allows one to avoid the need for numerical treatment and provides important qualitative and quantitative information on the effect of different volatility dynamics on the optimal switching decision.

Our generic model for the underlying P of the project belongs to a general class of latent-factor stochastic volatility models and is given by the Itô process

                           f
                           :
                           I
                           ⊂
                           R
                           →
                           R

                      (I compact). It is important to note that f need not be specified at this point. In the above, (W
                     1, t
                     , W
                     2, t
                     )′ is a standard, two-dimensional Wiener process on a complete filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions (Karatzas & Shreve, 1991), with |ρ| < 1 a constant correlation coefficient.

The small parameter δ plays an important role in our analysis and models the fact that the latent factor Y follows a mean-reverting process, whose dynamics are on a “faster” time scale than the dynamics of P. Note that the introduction of the latent factor Y and of the different time scales make the dynamics of P more realistic, (as suggested by the empirical evidence in Alizadeh et al., 2002; Fouque, Papanicolaou, Sircar, and Sølna, 2003b; Hillebrand et al., 2006; Hikspoor and Jaimungal, 2008, among others), but at the cost of not being able to obtain, unless f is very specific, a closed-form solution for P. Furthermore, the difference in the time scales creates problems in the numerical resolution of (1) and (2), which is of the form of a stiff stochastic differential equation.

The decisions to switch from one mode of operation to the other can be modeled by an adapted, finite variation, càglàd process Q taking values in {0, 1}, with

                      or 1 if at time t, the process is idle or active, respectively. Let q denote the mode of operation at

                     .

Let K
                     0, K
                     1 denote the fixed costs of leaving the idle or the active mode respectively. For any switching decision rule

The above general model provides a convenient and flexible framework for the treatment of a wide class of switching problems encountered in the operations research and management science literature. Just to provide a few indicative examples, in the context of supply-chain contracts, several papers (e.g. Wagner & Friedl, 2007; Löffler, Pfeiffer, & Schneider, 2012) analyze supplier-switching options, that allow firms to switch suppliers and/or flexibly adjust their order quantity over time in the face of uncertainty in the underlying state process (e.g. the exchange rate in Kamrad & Siddique, 2004). In manufacturing (Kazaz, Dada, & Moskowitz, 2005; Kogut & Kulatilaka, 1994), as well as in service processes (Ellram, Tate, & Billington, 2008), optimal switching between in-sourcing and out-sourcing for cost reduction purposes and for achieving better cost management has attracted increased research attention in recent years (see, for example Li and Wang, 2010; Benaroch et al., 2012, and references therein). A wide range of applications, from municipal waste management (Di Corato & Montinari, 2014), to the valuation of flex fuel car engines (Bastian-Pinto, Brand ao, & de Lemos Alves, 2010), to the optimal choice between short-lived and long-lived projects in the face of interest rate uncertainty (as in Dias & Shackleton, 2011), are treated as optimal switching problems in the literature.

Such switching problems, for constant volatility and in the absence of multiple time scales, have been treated in the real options and operational research literature before (see Duckworth and Zervos, 2001; Dixit, 1989, among others). Here, unlike the constant volatility case of e.g. Merton (1973) where the price levels that “trigger” optimal switching are constants, we find that they are strongly affected by the volatility dynamics, and the proposed approach that follows, allows one to provide exact quantitative estimates of this effect to any desired order.

Using standard results on impulse control theory (see e.g. Bensoussan & Lions, 1984; Duckworth & Zervos, 2001), it can be shown that the value functions

The variational inequality in (5) is a free-boundary value problem, the solution of which can be characterized in terms of two thresholds

                      the process should be turned (or remain) idle. The appearance of y, the initial state of the latent factor, is not alarming as it can expressed in terms of the instantaneous volatility. The variational inequality (5) cannot be solved analytically and, as a result of the different time scales, its numerical treatment can be very difficult. However, the singular nature of the problem allows the use of a perturbative approach, similar to averaging or homogenization theory, which can produce semi-analytic results for the switching levels

                     . One of the main contributions of this paper is to provide a step-by-step procedure that allows the approximation, in terms of an asymptotic expansion and at any desired order, of the switching thresholds. Note that the approximation is derived for any possible feedback function f(y), a fact that allows—if desired—easy comparison between various models and provides qualitative and quantitative intuition on the effect of various parameters and processes, yielding useful implications for the decision-maker. The analytic approximation provided here may also be of use for the testing or calibration of numerical algorithms for solving the quasi-variational inequality (5).

                      is the generator for Eq. (1) with a constant (independent of y) volatility, often referred to as the Black–Scholes–Merton operator, equal to

                      which in fact is the average of the volatility weighted by the invariant distribution of the latent variable dynamics.

We can also consider further extensions of model (1)–(4) for switching decisions, where the payoffs in each mode display path-dependence or other exotic-type features. As an example of path-dependence, one may consider an Asian-type switching option, where the payoff in the active mode depends on the running average of P. Such a problem can be brought into the general form (1)–(4) by defining the new variable

                              s

                      and considering the extended model for the Itô process (Pt, Xt, Yt
                     ). The payoff in (4) would depend on Xt
                     , and now the extended model for the underlying would comprise of a two-dimensional “slow” part, (Pt, Xt
                     ), and an one-dimensional “fast” part Yt
                     . The variational inequality derivation proceeds in a similar fashion as for the original model, where now of course 
                        
                           L

                      will depend on three variables (Pt, Xt, Yt
                     ). The analysis proceeds in a similar fashion, the invariant density for Yt
                      being unaffected, at the cost of more complicated expressions when the Fredholm alternative is invoked on account of the higher dimensionality of operators 
                        
                           L

                     . While in principle such extensions are possible, path-dependence may lead to quantitative changes in Propositions 1 and 2 and the resulting optimal switching policy; however the detailed treatment of this problem is clearly beyond the scope of the present paper.

In this section, in order to illustrate the general results of Section 2, we extend the standard, benchmark entry/exit problem treated in Dixit (1989), to include the effect of “fast” mean-reverting stochastic volatility. At this point, we take a general form for the volatility feedback function f(y), but we set, as in Dixit (1989),

                     Proposition 3 provides the general solution, up to first order, of the problem treated in Dixit (1989) for a general multi-scale, stochastic volatility model. Note that any choice of a specific stochastic volatility model, i.e. any specific choice of f, affects the solution through the constants 
                        
                           
                              f
                              ¯
                           
                           2
                        
                      and Γ, which are both easily calculated, either analytically if f is provided in a convenient closed-form, or by elementary quadrature methods for numerical integration if f does not have a convenient analytic form, or is inferred numerically from calibration of the model on empirical data via non-parametric techniques.

We provide a brief discussion concerning the possible specification of the function f, before turning to the treatment of specific, fully-worked examples. Naturally, f should be chosen in such a way that the model is well-posed, but typically, a Lipchitz continuity condition is sufficient for that.

                        
                           (a)
                           An interesting class of choices for f would be to choose it in analytic forms such as 
                                 
                                    f
                                    (
                                    y
                                    )
                                    =
                                    exp
                                    
                                       (
                                       y
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                               or 
                                 
                                    f
                                    
                                       (
                                       y
                                       )
                                    
                                    =
                                    
                                       y
                                    
                                 
                              . Such choices lead to well-established models in the literature (Heston, 1993; Hull & White, 1987), and are usually treated as benchmark cases for quantitative and qualitative studies.

Another choice would be to select f so that the full model belongs to the affine class. Such a choice would be advantageous if European-type or Asian-type options were studied, since in this case the option valuation problem would be reduced to a convenient Riccati differential equation, which nevertheless must be treated numerically; however, it is not clear whether such a reduction simplifies the American-type problem considered here. At any rate, the proposed general scheme of Propositions 1–3 can be fully implemented for such cases.

A third important class of models would be to choose f as a linear combination, 
                                 
                                    f
                                    
                                       (
                                       y
                                       )
                                    
                                    =

                               of a family of orthogonal polynomials 
                                 
                                    {

                               are appropriate expansion weights. Such expansions can be very convenient when used in conjunction with non-parametric schemes for the inference of the model from real data. As noted above, the optimal switching strategy is only affected through constants

In what follows, for the sake of brevity we only illustrate the results of Proposition 3 for the two analytic specifications in case (a) above, which correspond to well-established models in the literature. It should be stressed that the intention of the specific stochastic volatility models that appear in the following examples, is simply to demonstrate the ability of the perturbation method in Fouque et al. (2003a) to “correct” the well-known solution of the general optimal switching problem under constant volatility. The application of the results of Proposition 3 for the specifications in (b) and (c) above are straightforward and are
                     
                      left to the interested reader.

As a first example, we choose the stochastic volatility model employed by Fouque et al. (2003c), where the product price change volatility is related to the latent “fast” mean-reverting factor y via 
                              
                                 f
                                 
                                    (
                                    y
                                    )
                                 
                                 =
                                 exp
                                 
                                    (
                                    y
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           . This stochastic volatility model has been used in the pricing of American-style perpetual options by Zhu and Chen (2011a).

In order to apply Proposition 3, one has to calculate the constants

                            and Γ. For this model,

The effect (of the first order corrections) due to “fast” mean reverting stochastic volatility is quantitatively assessed in Figs. 1 and 2. Since the results are obtained analytically, detailed comparative statics are feasible and available upon request. Note that value differences due to “fast” mean-reverting stochastic volatility are not monotone with respect to the resource price P and can change sign (see Fig. 1).


                           Fig. 2 focuses on the behavior of the optimal switching price thresholds with respect to the switching costs Kq
                           , the correlation coefficient ρ, as well as the parameters of the latent part of the stochastic volatility model. Whether the effect on the thresholds is positive or negative depends on the correlation coefficient. For ρ < 0 which is the most usual case in financial variables (see for example Fouque et al., 2000), the owner of the process/project that can be switched from and to an idle/active mode will optimally decide to leave the current mode at lower thresholds: Lower levels of P (than those in the constant volatility case with volatility set to

                           ) now lead to project activation, and the owner is now willing to incur more losses before activation is suspended on the down side. This effect can be significant in magnitude, as shown in Panel (b) of Fig. 2, where as ρ → ±1 the “corrections”

We provide an additional example of the approach by employing a correlated version of the stochastic volatility model in Renault and Touzi (1996), which is based on the model by Hull and White (1987). In these models the volatility of the underlying is related to the latent “fast” mean-reverting factor y via

This paper formulates and solves an infinite-horizon, optimal switching problem under uncertainty—a methodological problem that is recurrent in many operations research applications—for a general class of stochastic volatility models that exhibit “fast” mean-reversion. Our main results, motivated by the perturbation method (as in Fouque et al., 2000), allow one to obtain analytically and up to any desired order of accuracy the optimal switching policy, subject to the calculation of two constants, which are model-dependent and can be estimated, either analytically (as demonstrated in the examples) or using numerical integration techniques. The results allow the assessment of the quantitative and qualitative effects of stochastic, “fast” mean-reverting volatility in the cash flow process and being analytic, lend themselves to comparative statics which are of interest to the decision-maker and can serve as useful benchmarks for the full numerical treatment of the original problem, which presents difficulties on account of the presence of multiple scales.

As a demonstration of our results, we extend the standard model of switching flexibility by Dixit (1989) to include the effects of multi-scale variability, and explicitly calculate its effects on the optimal decision rule. Our main findings are that when the uncertainty in an economic system exhibits fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility: (a) optimal switching between modes will be more frequent, (b) agents will be more willing to activate earlier and will endure higher losses before deciding to optimally suspend operations and (c) findings (a) and (b) are more pronounced for lower (more negative) levels of correlation between price and volatility uncertainty, faster volatility mean-reversion speeds and higher effective volatility levels.

The proposed methodology is of interest to decision makers dealing with processes or projects that can be switched from and to an idle/active mode, contingent on state variables that exhibit random evolution on multiple scales.

We substitute the expansions (6) into the variational inequality (5) and consider different orders n of δ. At order

                        q, 1 we obtain Eq. (12). Note that from the first-order onwards, there is no free-boundary condition. The next orders can be obtained by acting the operator

                      apply Proposition 1: For the particular choice of Rq
                      in Eq. (13), the general solution of Eq. (7), subject to (8), is readily seen to be (21). Substituting the general solution (21) into the boundary conditions yields the algebraic systems (9) and (10), the solution of which provides the zeroth-order contribution to the free-boundaries.
