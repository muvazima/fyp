                  The multi-level image thresholding is often treated as a problem of optimization. Typically, finding the parameters of these problems leads to a nonlinear optimization problem, for which obtaining the solution is computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper a new multi-level image thresholding technique using synergetic differential evolution (SDE), an advanced version of differential evolution (DE), is proposed. SDE is a fusion of three algorithmic concepts proposed in modified versions of DE. It utilizes two criteria (1) entropy and (2) approximation of normalized histogram of an image by a mixture of Gaussian distribution to find the optimal thresholds. The experimental results show that SDE can make optimal thresholding applicable in case of multi-level thresholding and the performance is better than some other multi-level thresholding methods.
