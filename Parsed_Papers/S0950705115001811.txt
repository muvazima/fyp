                  Structural balance enables a comprehensive understanding of the potential tensions and conflicts of signed networks, and its computation and transformation have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The balance computation aims at evaluating the distance from an unbalanced network to a balanced one, and the balance transformation is to convert an unbalanced network into a balanced one. In this paper, firstly, we model the balance computation of signed networks as the optimization of an energy function. Secondly, we model the balance transformation as the optimization of a more general energy function incorporated with transformation cost. Finally, a multilevel learning based memetic algorithm, which incorporates network-specific knowledge such as the neighborhoods of node, cluster and partition, is proposed to solve the modeled optimization problems. Systematical experiments in real-world social networks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on the computation and transformation of structural balance. The results also show that our method can resolve the potential conflicts of signed networks with the minimum cost.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Social interaction involves friendly and hostile relationships in many complex systems, including multi-player online games, Wikipedia, Web 2.0, online communities and information recommendation systems [1–3]. In these systems, the entities with friendly relationships are friends, cooperators, alliances or memberships in a group, while those with hostile relationships are enemies, competitors, opponents or memberships in different groups. These systems can be represented as signed networks in which nodes represent social entities and positive/negative edges correspond to friendly/hostile relationships.

Structural balance, one of the most popular properties in ensembles of signed networks, reflects the origin of tensions and conflicts, and its computation and transformation have received much attention from physicist, sociologist, economist, ecologist, ecologist and mathematician [4–10]. The structural balance theory introduced by Heider states that the relations “the friend of my friend is my enemy” and “the enemy of my enemy is my enemy” are unbalanced in the strong definition, which is based on the statistical analysis of the balance of signed triads from the perspective of social psychology [11]. There are broad applications of the computation of structural balance, due to the ubiquity of the multi-relational organization of modern systems in a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, the pursuit of balance is desirable in many real-world signed systems. For instance, the pursuit of balance in international relationship networks can reduce military, economic and culture conflicts. The pursuit of balance in information systems can improve the authenticity of collected information and accelerate opinion diffusion [12–14].

The computation of structural balance aims at calculating the least imbalances of signed networks [7]. There are mainly two issues in the computation of structural balance: (i) how to verify imbalances and (ii) how to compute the least imbalances. There have been recent efforts in addressing these issues. The frustration index [5] evaluates the imbalances of signed networks as the number of negative cycles which have an odd number of negative links. The energy function proposed by Facchetti et al. [7,15] measures the imbalances as the number of unbalanced links in signed networks, and both the gauge transformation [7,15] and memetic algorithms [16] are utilized to minimize the energy function. Besides, some studies evaluate the imbalances as the sum of the positive links across two different communities and the negative links within the same community [15,17], and thereafter they adopt the classical community detection algorithms, such as Infomap [18], FEC [19] and MODPSO [20], to identify the communities in signed networks. Note that, in many cases these studies are constraint to the strong definition of structural balance, and they are worth to be applied to the weak definition of structural balance. In the weak definition, “the friend of my friend is my enemy” is unbalanced while “the enemy of my enemy is my enemy” is balanced.

The transformation of structural balance focuses on how to convert an unbalanced network into a balanced one. Classical transformation models are divided into two categories: discrete-time dynamic models and continuous-time dynamic models [21]. Local triad dynamic and constrained triad dynamic are two representative discrete-time models [22,23]. With these models, an unbalanced network is finally evolved towards a balanced or a jammed state by changing signs of edges [5]. Another classical discrete-time model is based on transforming the least number of unbalanced links in signed networks [24,25]. Differential dynamic presented by Kulakowski et al. [26] is a classical continuous-time model, and it exhibits the evolutionary process from an unbalanced network to a balanced one. In this model, the final evolutionary state (i.e., conflict or harmony) of social networks is determined by the total amount of positive links [8]. These models can effectively transform an unbalanced network into a balanced one, and they are worth improving if they take into account the cost of balance transformation.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the computation and transformation of structural balance in signed networks are non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problems [7,27]. This is of particular concern since the solution space increases with the size of a signed network exponentially. Memetic algorithms (MAs) as hybrid global–local search methodologies are widely adopted to solve NP-hard problems [28]. In general, a global search benefits explorations while a local search facilitates exploitations [28]. MAs synthesize the complementary advantages of global and local search methodologies [28–31], which makes it possible to solve large-scale NP-hard optimization problems. MAs have been applied into some large-scale networks optimizations, including balance computation [16], community detection [32,33], network resource allocation [34], neural network design [35], network robustness improvement [36] and network prediction [37–39].

In this study, we propose a fast memetic algorithm, referred to as MLMSB, to compute and transform structural balance of signed networks. First, we extend the energy function criterion [7] to the weak definition of structural balance, and model the computation of structural balance as the optimization of the extended energy function H. Second, by introducing a cost coefficient parameter, we present a more general energy function 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 w
                              
                           
                        
                      to evaluate the balance transformation cost, and model the transformation of structural balance as the optimization of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 w
                              
                           
                        
                     . Finally, a multilevel learning based local search is integrated into a population-based genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the modeled optimization problems. For the proposed MLMSB algorithm to converge fast, we make full use of the network-specific knowledge such as the interactions of nodes, clusters and partitions. Experimental results on five real-world networks demonstrate that MLMSB outperforms the classical algorithms that compute and transform the structural imbalance of signed network. Furthermore, the results also illustrate that MLMSB can identify and resolve potential conflicts with the minimum transformation cost.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces ground knowledge about structural balance of signed networks. The optimization models and our method MLMSB are detailed in Section 3, followed by systematical empirical results in Section 4. The conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

Structural balance theory states that a complete signed network is balanced if and only if all its signed triads are balanced. For a non-complete signed network, it is balanced if it can be filled into a complete network by adding edges in such a way that the resulting complete network is balanced [1]. Wasserman gives an equivalent theorem from the perspective of clustering as follows [40].


                        The strong (weak) definition of structural balance: “A signed network G is completely balanced, if and only if its nodes can be divided into 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                         (
                           
                              k
                              ⩾
                              2
                           
                        ) clusters such that the nodes are positively linked within each cluster whereas negatively linked between the clusters” [40].

According to the equivalent balance theorem, the social relation 
                           
                              -

                         is unbalanced (balanced) when its individuals are divided into 
                           
                              k
                              =
                              2
                           
                         (
                           
                              k
                              =
                              3
                           
                        ) clusters.

The energy function [7] measures the imbalances of signed networks as the number of unbalanced links, and it is computed as follows.

A balanced network will be achieved if the signs of the unbalanced links found by the optimization of H are changed.

In reality, the cost of changing a positive link may be different from that of a negative link. Thus, a more general energy function

                            is introduced with cost coefficient parameter w evaluating the different cost of changing positive and negative links for balance transformation. The corresponding optimization model for the balance transformation with minimum cost is as follows:

Our algorithm MLMSB is first initialized with a population of solutions, each of which represents a possible balance transformation. The population of solutions is then evolved via global search conducted by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a network-specific local search iteratively. The network-specific knowledge, such as the neighborhoods of node, cluster and partition, is incorporated into the GA and local search. The framework of MLMSB is listed in Algorithm 1. The rest of this section will detail the definitions of neighborhoods and the representation, initialization, tournament selection, genetic operation and network-specific local search.

                            of ith chromosome is classified into the 10th cluster. With this representation, each solution represents a possible clustering division of this network. Thereafter, the nodes are divided into several clusters and the ones with the same cluster identifier are grouped in the same cluster.

In the transformation of structural balance, it is necessary to change signs of positive edges across different clusters and negative edges within the same cluster. Fig. 6

Initialization corresponds to Step 1 of MLMSB. In general, the convergence of MAs can be accelerated by a population of initialized solutions with high quality and good diversity [28]. For the initialization to generate a population of high-quality solutions, it is necessary to incorporate network-specific knowledge. Here, we utilize the neighborhood of node, and generate a population of solutions by assigning the cluster identifiers of nodes to those of their neighbors. In order to maintain the diversity of the initial solutions, we adopt a random sequence strategy to update the cluster identifiers of nodes. Algorithm 2 lists the pseudocode of the network-specific initialization.

Genetic operation is the primary impetus of GA to generate promising regions in the solution space. Genetic operation mainly consists of crossover and mutation. The crossover aims to generate good offspring chromosomes by inheriting excellent properties from their parent chromosomes and the mutation is to generate disturbances [28].

In Step 3 of MLMSB, we employ a two-way crossover and a neighborhood based mutation. The two-way crossover exchanges the clustering information of parent chromosomes

In order to reduce useless explorations and generate dependable offsprings, we adopt a neighborhood based mutation which mutates the cluster identifiers of nodes with those of their neighbors. In the mutation processes, when a node has more than one neighbor and these neighbors are in different clusters, we randomly replace its cluster identifier with one of its neighbors. The neighborhood based mutation performs on each solution

In MLMSB, GA can explore and exploit a few promising regions in the solution space. However, it cannot converge to the optimal solutions of promising regions within a few generations. A local search technique is designed to accelerate the convergence of GA to the optimal solutions [30]. Generally, start from an initial solution, and then a local search technique is adopted to repeatedly search for an improved solution by local changes [30]. A local search can effectively reduce useless explorations by incorporating problem-specific knowledge.

In this study, the neighborhoods of node, cluster and partition are incorporated into our multilevel learning technique which consists of a microscopic-level node learning, a macroscopic-level clustering learning and a partition learning. In Step 4 of MLMSB, the multilevel learning is employed on the best solution

The node-level learning can converge to a good solution quickly. However, the node learning technique falls into a local optimum easily because it cannot traverse all solutions in the promising regions. By incorporating the neighborhood structure of cluster, we present a cluster learning technique to find a better solution around the solution

The cluster learning considers different neighborhood structures compared with the node learning, which makes it possible to find a better solution around the solution

                                    . However, the cluster learning is still easy to trap into a local optimal clustering division because it is hard to separate the merged nodes and communities again [33].


                                    Partition learning. In order to overcome the constraint of cluster learning, we design the partition learning. The partition learning performs on two solutions

The reasons why the multilevel learning technique works are that the multilevel learning technique incorporates the network-specific knowledge into the search rules. Moreover, the node learning and the cluster learning can quickly converge to the optimal solutions in the promising regions discovered by GA. In addition, the partition learning overcomes the constraint of cluster learning. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the multilevel learning technique.

MLMSB and our previous works Meme-Net [32], MLCD [33] and Meme-SB [16] model the issue of complex systems as a network optimization problem, and use the network-specific MA to solve the modeled problem. However, they are different in the motivation, optimization model, GA operation, network-specific knowledge and local search.

As for the motivation, Meme-Net focuses on detecting the multi-resolution community structures of undirected networks. However, it is impossible for Meme-Net to detect communities in large-scale networks because of its high computational complexity [33]. MLMCD is devised to identify communities in large-scale networks. Meme-SB aims at computing the structural balance of signed networks in the strong definition. MLMSB is designed for the transformation of structural balance of signed networks.

In the optimization model, Meme-Net models the community detection in undirected networks as the optimization of modularity density (

The maximization of Q can detect communities with massive internal links and few external links. Meme-SB models the computation of structural balance as the optimization of energy function h while MLMSB solves the transformation of structural balance by optimizing a more general energy function

In the adopted GA operation, Meme-Net, MLCD and MLMSB have different representations from Meme-SB. Meme-Net, MLCD and MLMSB adopt an integer vector representation while Meme-SB uses a bit vector representation. Moreover, Meme-Net and MLMSB have different initializations from Meme-SB and MLCD. In the initialization, Meme-Net and MLMSB assign the cluster identifiers of nodes to those of their neighbors while Meme-SB and MLCD update the cluster identifiers of nodes with those of their neighbors. In addition, Meme-Net, MLCD and MLMSB have different crossover operators from Meme-SB. Meme-Net, MLCD and MLMSB use a two-way crossover while Meme-SB adopts a two-point crossover.

In the incorporated network-specific knowledge, Meme-Net uses the undirected links among nodes while MLCD adopts both the undirected connections of node and community. Meme-SB and MLMSB are used for tackling signed networks. Meme-SB uses the neighborhood of node while MLMSB adopts the neighborhoods of node, cluster and partition.

In the devised local search, Meme-Net and Meme-SB adopt a hill climbing and node learning as the local search, respectively. The hill climbing and the node learning optimize the clustering division of networks by updating the cluster identifier of nodes iteratively. MLCD and MLMSB adopt multilevel learning techniques as the local search. However, the detailed operations of the multilevel learning are different because MLCD and MLMSB tackle different optimization models and types of networks.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In this section, we test MLMSB on five real-world signed networks and compare it with nine classical algorithms.

Five signed networks, including two small-scale international relationship networks, two large-scale online vote networks and a large-scale online blog network, are chosen in our experiments. The computation and transformation of the imbalances of two international relationship networks can reduce local and global conflicts. The computation and transformation of the imbalanced links of the three social online networks can find the missing and spurious operations of websites, collect authentic and reliable information and promote the development of social systems. The main properties of these networks are shown in Table 1
                        . The extracted networks can be downloaded from our homepage http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/mggong/publication.htm.
                           
                              
                                 Gahuku-Gama Subtribes Network (GGS): The GGS network constructed by Read in [44] represents the cultures of highland New Guinea. The positive/negative links represent political unions/oppositions among 16 Gahuku-Gama subtribes (http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/sola/info4/andrej/prpart5.htm).


                                 War network: The War network derived from the Correlates of War project [45] illustrates the international relations in the period from 2000 to 2010. The War network is extracted from the datasets “Militarized Interstate Disputes (v4.01)” and “Formal Alliances (v4.1)” in http://www.correlatesofwar.org/datasets.htm, and it consists of 217 nodes and 1295 positive and 138 negative edges. Nodes represent countries, and positive (negative) links indicate conflict (alliance) relations.


                                 Wiki-ele network: The Wiki-ele network consists of 7114 vertices and 78,792 positive and 21,529 negative links. Nodes represent users participating in the elections of administrators (either electors or candidates) and positive (negative) edges indicate positive (negative) elections. Detailed descriptions of the adopted Wiki-ele network are provided in Refs. [6,7] and http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html.


                                 Wiki-rfa network: The Wiki-rfa network records the statistical requests from any Wikipedia member for Wikipedia editors to become administrators. A request can be represented by a supporting, neutral, or opposing vote. In the Wiki-rfa network, there are 11,402 users and 189,004 distinctly directed voter pairs including 139,312 supporting votes, 11,225 neutral votes and 38,467 opposing votes. Here, we consider a symmetrical signed Wiki-rfa network where nodes represent Wikipedia members and positive (negative) links indicate supporting (opposing) votes. After discarding the neutral votes, the signed undirected Wiki-rfa network is composed of 11,276 nodes and 132,962 positive and 37,972 negative links. Detailed descriptions of the Wiki-rfa network are given in http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-RfA.html.


                                 Slashdot network: Slashdot is a famous website for users to submit current primarily technology oriented news and for editors to evaluate these news. In Slashdot website, each user can be tagged by the other users as friends or foes. The dataset “soc-sign-Slashdot081106” in http://snap.stanford.edu/data/#signnets is composed of 77,357 users and 516,575 tags. This dataset can be modeled as a Slashdot network with 77,357 nodes and 516,575 directed and signed links. Notes represent users and positive (negative) edges indicate friendly (hostile) tags among users [6]. The largest strongly connected component (SCC) of Slashdot network consists of 26,996 nodes and 337,351 signed directed edges. Here, its signed undirected version, which has 26,995 nodes and 217,563 positive and 71,075 negative undirected edges, is chosen in our experiments. Assuming that the directed and the undirected versions of SCC of Slashdot network are represented as J and

In this paper, MLMSB is compared with nine classical algorithms, namely GA, OLMSB, TLMSB, SLPAm, SBGLL, MODPSO, SN2013, PRE2014 and FEC. Their computational complexities are recorded in Table 2
                        .

GA, OLMSB and TLMSB are the variant versions of MLMSB without the local search, the cluster and partition learning and the partition learning, respectively. Comparisons between MLMSB, GA, OLMSB and TLMSB are made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised node, cluster and partition learning techniques on the acceleration of MLMSB to an optimal solution.

SLPAm and SBGLL are the extended versions of classical greedy algorithms LPAm [46] and BGLL [47], respectively. LPAm detects the communities of unsigned networks by a modularity-specific label propagation while SLPAm computes the imbalances of signed networks by a

                        -specific label propagation. BGLL is a fast two-phase community detection algorithm based on the optimization of modularity [43,48]. In the first (second) phase, the node (community) chosen from the first one to the last one is assigned to its neighboring community when this change can increase modularity maximally. SBGLL focuses on the imbalance computation of signed networks based on the optimization of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    H

                        . The reason why we choose them as our comparison algorithms is that we want to illustrate that the hybrid algorithm MLMSB can perform better than the classical greedy algorithms SPAm and SBGLL in terms of accuracy.

FEC [19] adopts an agent-based technique to identify the communities in signed networks. In FEC, communities are composed of a few nodes with dense positive but sparse negative links. The positive links across different communities and the negative links within the same community are considered as unbalanced links. A comparison between MLMSB and FEC is made to analyze the relations between the structural balance and the communities under different definitions in signed networks.

MODPSO [20] is a population-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm by optimizing signed ratio association and signed ratio cut simultaneously. MODPSO starts from an initial population of solutions and it iteratively optimizes these solutions based on the framework of multi-objective discrete swarm optimization. MODPSO returns a set of solutions, each of which represents one possible balance transformation. Comparison between MLMSB and MODPSO is made to illustrate the superb performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and stability compared with the population-based evolutionary algorithm.

PRE2014 [17] and SN2013 [25] are two relevant works on the computation of imbalance in signed networks. PRE2014 adopts a classical community detection algorithm Infomap [18] to detect communities in signed networks. SN2013 updates the cluster information of each node by: (i) the movement of the node from its cluster to another cluster and (ii) the interchange of two nodes between two clusters. PRE2014 and SN2013 evaluate the imbalance of signed networks by computing the number of positive links across the found communities and negative links within the same community.

Moreover, the P-value is a statistical hypothesis (i.e., t-test) value, and it is the probability of getting the observed data when the null hypothesis is actually true. Here, the null hypothesis is expressed as that there is no difference between MLMSB and its comparison algorithm on the computation of structural balance, and the observed data are the statistical H values of the comparison algorithm over 50 trials. If the P-value is less than a significance level

                        , it indicates that the observed data are inconsistent with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It is noticed that a small P-value cannot imply that there is a meaningful difference of MLMSB with its comparison algorithm on the computation of structural balance.

                         exhibit the clustering results of the GGS network and the War network with the smallest H, respectively. The clustering results reflect the potential community structures and the unbalanced links obviously. The GGS network is divided into three clusters, and it has two unbalanced links (e.g., the relations between ‘MASIL’ and ‘NAGAM’, ‘MASIL’ and ‘UHETO’). The War network is mainly classified into two clusters, and it has 40 unbalanced links highlighted with black lines.

                         shows the variations of the H values obtained by the iterative optimization algorithms MLMSB, GA, OLMSB, TLMSB, SLPAm, SBGLL, MODPSO and SN2013 with the number of iterations on the War and Wiki-ele networks. The results illustrate that MLMSB, OLMSB, TLMSB, SLPAm, SBGLL and MODPSO converge within 100 generations while SN2013 converge within 300 generations. The results also show that the global search algorithm GA cannot converge within 100 generations, and that MLMSB, TLMSB and SBGLL can quickly converge to good solutions with low H values.

                         values than GA, OLMSB, TLMSB, SLPAm, MODPSO, PRE2014 and FEC. Furthermore, our algorithm MLMSB has the smallest

                         values for all networks under different w values but the Wiki-rfa network under 
                           
                              w

                        .

From Table 4, we can see that MLMSB and its three variations can transform the unbalanced GGS network into balanced ones at minimum cost. For the War, Wiki-ele, Wiki-rfa and Slashdot networks, GA has the largest 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    H
                                 
                                 
                                    w
                                 
                              
                           
                         values. OLMSB can effectively reduce the balance transformation cost of GA. More specifically, the maximum decrease of the cost can reach 45.86%, 90.99%, 92.95% and 95.84% for the War, Wiki-ele, Wiki-rfa and Slashdot networks when 
                           
                              0
                              <
                              w
                              <
                              1
                           
                        , respectively. Moreover, TLMSB can reduce 57.82%, 3.41%, 3.01 % and 0.98% transformation cost for the War, Wiki-ele, Wiki-rfa and Slashdot networks, respectively. In addition, MLMSB can reduce the balance transformation cost of TLMSB. More specifically, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    H
                                 
                                 
                                    w
                                 
                              
                           
                         is maximally decreased by 1.64% for the War network, 2.32% for the Wiki-ele network, 2.04% for the Wiki-rfa network and 3.53% for the Slashdot network.


                        Fig. 13
                         records the variations of the balance transformations found by MLMSB with the cost parameter w. As shown in Fig. 13, there are multiple balance transformations for the GGS, War, Wiki-ele, Wiki-rfa and Slashdot networks. In general, more negative links and less positive links need to be changed of signs with the increase of w. To illustrate the balance transformations intuitively, we plot the clustering results of the GGS network with different w in Figs. 10 and 14
                        , and the clustering results of the War network with

As shown in Fig. 10, the GGS network is divided into three clusters and the positive relations between ‘MASIL’ and ‘UHETO’, ‘MASIL’ and ‘NAGAM’ need to be transformed. As shown in Fig. 14, the GGS network is divided into two clusters and the seven negative links highlighted with black lines need to be transformed.


                        Fig. 11 shows that the War network is mainly divided into two clusters with 32 unbalanced positive links and 8 unbalanced negative links when

It is noticed that in the GGS network, the two clusters drawn with blue
                           1
                           For interpretation of color in Figs. 10 and 14, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.

                         box and red circle in Fig. 10 are merged into the cluster drawn with blue box in Fig. 14. In the War network, the two clusters drawn with red triangle and green circle in Fig. 11 mainly split from the cluster drawn with green circle in Fig. 15. The interesting phenomenon indicates that different balance transformations may lead to the mergence and the separation of clusters in signed networks.

In practical applications, if we know the unbalanced factors and the transformation cost in advance, we can reduce the potential conflicts of real systems by the transformation of the unbalanced factors. The MLMSB algorithm and transformation optimization models are devised to identify and reduce the imbalances in real-world signed systems.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The computation and transformation of structural balance are fundamental to unearth the potential conflicts and maintain the stability of complex systems. In this paper, we have extended the classical energy function so that it can compute the structural balance of signed networks both in strong and weak definitions. After that, the unbalanced links can be transformed by changing signs of unbalanced edges. Moreover, we have proposed a more general energy function to evaluate the transformation cost. In addition, by incorporating the neighborhoods of node, cluster and partition, we have devised a fast memetic algorithm to compute and transform structural balance in signed network. Experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method (MLMSB) compared with other state-of-the-art models in five real-world signed networks. The results also have illustrated the effectiveness of MLMSB on the pursuit of balance at minimum cost.

Despite of the promising performance of MLMSB, there are still some follow-up works. For instance, it is highly likely that multiple relations in complex systems are transformed to each other over time, i.e., dynamic properties. To cater this property, one of our future works will aim at transforming unbalanced structures to balanced ones in dynamic signed networks. Also, directed relationship may be more suitable for some real-world social systems [2,6], and therefore current work will be extended to signed directed networks.
