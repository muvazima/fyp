                  Purpose
                  Clinical pathways fall under the process perspective of health care quality. For care providers, clinical pathways can be compared to improve health care quality. The objective of this study was to design a convenient physician order set comparison system based on claim records from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Data were retrieved from the NHIRD for the period of 2003–2007 for frequent physician order sets found in hospital surgical hernia repair inpatient claim records. The derived frequent physician order sets were divided into five frequency thresholds: 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%. A consistency index was defined and calculated to understand each care providers’ adherence to clinical pathways. In addition, the average count of physician orders, average amount of cost, Charlson comorbidity index, and recurrence rate were calculated; these variables were considered in frequent physician order sets comparison.
               
               
                  Results
                  Records for 3262 patients from 257 hospitals were retrieved. The frequent physician order sets of various frequency thresholds, Charlson comorbidities, and recurrence rates were extracted and computed for comparison among hospitals. A recurrence rate threshold of 2% was established to separate low and high quality of herniorrhaphy at each hospital. Univariable analysis showed that low recurrence rate was associated with high consistency index (70.99±23.88 vs. 52.60±20.30; P
                     <.001), few surgeons at each hospital (3.50±4.41 vs. 7.09±6.57; P
                     <.001), and non-medical center facility type (P
                     =.042). A multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated an association of low recurrence rates with consistency index only (one percentage increased: OR=0.973; CI: 0.957–0.990; P
                     =.002).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The proposed system leveraged the claim records to generate frequent physician order sets at hospitals, thus solving the difficulty in obtaining clinical pathway data. This allows medical professionals and management to conveniently and effectively compare and query similarities and differences in clinical pathways among hospitals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Health service quality is critical for both health care providers and receivers. In the 1980s, Donabedian proposed a conceptual model for studying and evaluating health care service quality [1]. This model classified the quality of care into three perspectives: structure, process, and outcome. The structure perspective focused on “the material, facilities, equipment, human resources, and organization of the health care providers”. The process perspective focused on “what is actually done in giving and receiving care”, including the activities involved in making a diagnosis and recommending or implementing treatment. The outcome perspective focused on the “effects of care based on the patients’ health conditions”. There are many issues associated with the three health service delivery perspectives noted above. There are many concerns associated with implementing these three health service delivery perspectives, such as providing allocation of resources, providing evidence-based care, and reducing variability in outcomes [2]. Clinical pathways provide one approach to addressing these; they comprise “structured, multidisciplinary care plans (identify patient group; set pathway parameters; agree goals; map multidisciplinary care; track variances; feedback and review; upgrade pathway) that detail essential steps in the care of patients with a specific clinical problem [3,4]. They fall under the process perspective and are important components of health service quality.

One of the main issues in clinical practice is the variability in care delivery among health care providers. That is, patients with similar clinical conditions may receive different care, particularly regarding surgical procedures. This situation can result in differences in elements such as hospital stays, laboratory tests, the use of medication and blood products, outpatient treatment, complications, readmissions, total cost, outcomes, and patient satisfaction. All of these issues are of concern to patients, health professionals, and health care management [5]. The application of clinical pathways is one way to address the quality-of-care challenge, as they provide guidance for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in clinical practice [6]. The application of clinical pathways can reduce re-admission [7] and medical cost [8] for hernia surgery, pulmonary complications and hospital stays for head and neck reconstruction [9] or minimize hospital costs and hospital stays for both hepatectomy [10] and kidney surgery [11]. Thus, clinical pathways have been developed and applied in many hospitals.

Clinical pathways have taken many forms. A typical clinical pathway contains a set of physician order activities to be executed during a defined time period for a specific clinical care objective (e.g., exam, anesthesia, drug prescription). The pathway can be used to coordinate the clinical care team, standardize practices, and reduce the variance in health care delivery. The benefits of clinical pathways include achieving expected outcomes, promoting effectiveness and efficiency of clinical care, and optimizing resource utilization. Taken together, these benefits lead to a higher quality of care [12].

Best practice clinical pathways come from two sources: creation of clinical pathways and adherence to clinical pathways. The creation of clinical pathways is usually based on existing evidence and medical rules discussed in a professional committee. This process can ensure that the clinical pathways are as objective as possible. However, a group of professionals under the same health care institution may still overlook or exclude an important factor or activity. Day-to-day usage of the clinical pathways may also identify areas of improvement. In addition, hospitals could possibly find ways to improve their own clinical pathways by reviewing those of other hospitals.

Though comparing clinical pathways in use at other institutions could be helpful, it can be difficult to obtain this information. Even when details of the clinical pathways of another hospital are obtained, the resulting outcome of these clinical pathways can be difficult to determine. Moreover, it is never known whether the other hospital precisely follows the clinical pathways. Thus, it is difficult to make a comparison with another hospital. In summary, we need a practical and convenient method for overcoming the above issues and realizing an effective comparison of clinical pathways.

Among the diverse components of the clinical pathway, sets of physician orders are a main component, which can be extracted and validated by reimbursement database. The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan can be utilized to achieve this purpose. In 1995, Taiwan launched a single-payer National Health Insurance program. More than 99% of the population, about 2.3 million people, were enrolled [13]. A portion of the data from this database was systematically sampled and de-identified to form a database suitable for research purposes. From this database, it is possible to extract frequent physician order sets by examining physician orders that applied to patients from different hospitals. In addition, herniorrhaphy is an outpatient operation, which includes simple clinical pathway. Thus, one part of the clinical pathways for herniorrhaphy can be effectively realized through the comparison of physician order sets. This proposed system can provide the decision-making information needed by health care management to improve the quality of their services. The objective of this study was to design a system that will provide an easy process for health care providers to compare sets of physician orders across all hospitals.

In the remaining sections of this paper, we present the methods, data source, computation algorithm, and overall system architecture of our study. A sample hernia surgical operation procedure and its results are shown in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the results of the sample comparison and address the contribution and potential of our approach.

The data used in our analysis were drawn from the NHIRD. The dataset used a representative sample (N
                        =1,000,000) selected from the entire database of beneficiary information [14]. Data extracted included registration files and original data for reimbursement claims. The registration files included information on patients, physicians, and care providers. The identification data for each file was scrambled to ensure confidentiality. Based on the hospital registration file, we categorized the hospitals into three types: medical center, regional hospital, and district hospital. The inpatient expenditures file contained patient admission claim data, including admission date, discharge date, and up to five ICD9 operation procedure codes for this hospitalization as well as the patient's gender, date of birth, hospital ID, and physician ID. The inpatient orders file contained the physician orders related to the above inpatient expenditures admission record. The physician orders were divided into different categories including medication description and amount, special materials, anesthesia, surgery, treatment of disposal, injection, radiation treatment, inspection, case payment (Diagnosis Related Group, DRG), and others. From the inpatient orders file, we obtained the actual physician orders that applied to the patients.

To demonstrate the usability of the system, we selected and compared results from a hernia repair operation. “Hernias are associated with reduced quality of life and high socioeconomic cost” [15,16]. Hernia repair is classified as a digestive system procedure. The claim records of inpatients over 18 years of age who underwent a unilateral inguinal hernia repair for the first time between 2003 and 2007 were retrieved from the NHIRD, and included ICD9 procedure codes 53.00, 53.01, 53.02, 53.03, 53.04 and 53.05. The selection process is depicted in Fig. 1
                        .

The original NHIRD data comprise detailed records, but our study required us to aggregate information. Therefore, we prepared the data in order to meet the aggregate query requirements. This operation was similar to the transition from a transaction database to a data warehouse. Transaction databases are used for daily operations, and data warehouses for business decision making. First, ETL (extract, transform, and load) must be performed on the transaction database to construct the warehouse database. Then, the normalized transaction database must usually be de-normalized to accelerate and fulfill the aggregate query requirements of the data warehouse. The tasks to be performed in advance are as follows: extract the target detailed medical records that meet the desired procedure codes, apply exclusion criteria, calculate the number of cases grouped by hospital ID and then sort them by the number of cases, calculate the average number of physician orders per hospital, and calculate the average amount of cost per hospital. Once complete, this process yields a population and number overview regarding the target surgical operation. Subsequently, we can decide whether to drill down to the individual data records.

The clinical pathway for a surgical operation at a specific hospital can be derived from the physician orders claimed in the insurance records. Our approach was to compute the frequency of physician orders that applied to patients. We established five frequency thresholds (80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%) and determined the physician orders that reached the respective thresholds. For example, a physician order that reaches 80% frequency indicate that this physician order occurred in more than 80% of the claim cases. Similarly, if a physician order reaches 100% frequency, it means that it occurred in all claim cases. In theory, higher frequency of physician order sets will result in fewer physician orders that qualify. Physician order sets that reached one of the thresholds were considered frequent physician order sets. For example, the frequent physician order sets for some surgical procedure of a care provider could look like Table 1
                        . The meaning of most of the order codes is found in Table 6. The concept of the extraction and comparison process is shown in Fig. 2
                        .


                        Table 1 demonstrates that orders 1–18 occurred in more than 80% of the hospital's total cases. If the hospital's average number of physician orders applied per case is 20, then we can say that 18/20 (90%) of physician orders per case reach the 80% frequency threshold. On the other hand, if the hospital's average number of physician orders per case is 40, we can say that only 18/40 (45%) of physician orders per case reach the 80% frequency threshold; the former situation is more consistent than the latter. To understand the consistency of each hospital, we defined a consistency index as follows:

                        .

In order to assess the relationship between a patient's past health status and the current health outcome, we computed the comorbidity index of every patient and the average comorbidity index of every hospital. We used Charlson's model [17] to compute patient comorbidity, and examined the correlation between morbidity and ICD9 disease and procedure codes, as adapted by Deyo et al. [18]. We designed a software module to compute the Charlson score for each patient by using patient ID and index date. After computing each patient's Charlson score, we computed the average Charlson score for each hospital. We approximated each hospital's comorbidity status with the Charlson scores.

One indicator of health care quality is patient recurrence rate. The system retrieved patients’ recurrence records by identifying the ICD9 code 550.91 (hernia recurrence) from the index date until the end of 2008. As this database is nationwide, we also determined whether the patient returned to the same or a different hospital. The system displayed all recurrence records after the index date. The system also showed the physician ID associated with each surgical procedure. We then determined if different physicians had varying favorite physician orders, assessing if they differed from the frequent physician orders derived from the hospital's frequent physician order sets.

The ultimate objective of the proposed system is to provide a method of comparison among hospitals. Users can select any number of hospitals among which to compare their frequent physician order sets as well as the Charlson score, recurrence rate, and categorized amount of cost. The system then shows the similarity and difference of the selected hospitals, item by item. In the frequent physician order set comparison procedure, the system retrieves the frequent order sets of the selected hospitals and calculates the union of these order sets to form a list data structure. Then, the system traverses each retrieved order set to make a mark in the union order set list if the current visited order matches between the union order set list and the retrieved order set. Then, the system displays the marked union order set list to the user. The pseudo code of the comparison procedure is listed as follows:

@&#RESULTS@&#

The proposed system can display aggregate information regarding the number of cases that underwent surgical hernia repair by year on one web page, or by hospital on another web page. Users can view the aggregate information to obtain an overall view of the target surgical procedure from different perspectives, and then view a list of claim cases in that year or that hospital. The listed fields include patient gender, age, Charlson score, admission date, discharge date, length of stay, amount of cost, and average number of physician orders applied. When users are interested in a specific case, they can further click to view the detailed physician orders applied on the case. The aggregate record distributions from 2003 to 2007 were 520, 688, 717, 680 and 657, respectively. The ratio of patients receiving hernia repair surgical procedure for the first time was about 6.52±0.77 per ten thousand (652/1,000,000).

There were 257 hospitals involved, including 19 medical centers, 79 regional hospitals, and 159 district hospitals. The aggregated count of cases for the top twelve hospitals is shown in Table 2
                        . Among these twelve hospitals were 9 medical centers, 2 regional hospitals, and 1 district hospital. The average Charlson score was at a normal level, 1.72±0.39, and the average number of physician orders applied to patients was 34.33±3.98 (416/12). The recurrence rate was 3.13±0.04% (32/1052), and the average amount of cost per case was 40,068±6468 (480,816/12).

We viewed the average categorized amount of cost for a hospital to understand the amount of cost for each physician order category. An example is shown in Table 3
                        .

We viewed the extracted frequent physician orders for hospitals according to different frequency thresholds: 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%. The results were similar to Table 1. The consistency indices for these 12 hospitals (Table 4
                        ) varied from 32.68% to 82.09%.

The ratio of frequent physician order sets to average number of physician orders applied per case for each hospital at each frequency threshold is depicted in Fig. 6
                        . Higher consistency indices are indicated by higher ratio scales and flatter curves.

We compared 3 medical centers (denoted by B, G, and J) under the 80% frequency threshold of frequent physician order sets. For convenience, the system displayed the results of the comparison (including Charlson score, recurrence rate, categorized amount of cost, and frequent physician order sets) in one table. We separated the table into two smaller tables here to aid explanation. Table 5
                         shows the comparison of the Charlson score, recurrence rate, and categorized amount of cost. Hospital J had a group of medium Charlson score patients, medium amount of cost, and an extremely low recurrence rate.

The comparison results of frequent physician orders are shown in Table 6
                        . The three medical centers presented common orders such as CBC-I, and general biochemistry examination – asparate aminotransferase, E.K.G., chest examination, parenteral fluid, pulse or ear oximetry and so on. Hospital J performed more general biochemistry examinations.

We are interested in the relationship between consistency index and recurrence rate. A 2% recurrence rate at each hospital is the cutting point to separate low and high quality herniorrhaphy. Univariable analysis was conducted to predict rates of recurrence greater than 2% after herniorrhaphy; the results are presented in Table 7
                        . Results showed that a high proportion of consistency index (70.99±23.88 vs. 52.60±20.30; P
                        <.001), small number of surgeons at each hospital (3.50±4.41 vs. 7.09±6.57; P
                        <.001), and non-medical center hospital type (P
                        =.042) were associated with low recurrence rates. Multivariable Cox regression analysis (Table 8
                        ) revealed that only a high proportion of consistency index was associated with low recurrence rates (one percentage increased: OR=0.973; CI: 0.957–0.990; P
                        =.002).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The present analysis of the proposed system indicates that a higher consistency index leads to a lower recurrence rate. This suggests that efforts to increase consistency index may be a good solution for hospitals with low consistency and high recurrence rates; a change in consistency rate may yield improved health care delivery. Based on the results of our analyses, hospitals should aim to achieve a benchmark consistency index of 70%.

In addition, hospital administrations can take several steps to improve outcomes:
                           
                              1.
                              Compute the average orders per case and frequent physician order sets at each frequency threshold.

Compute the consistency index based on the derived frequent physician order sets.

Review the variation between the universal physician order set and the frequent physician order sets.

Compare the frequent order sets with those of other care providers.

Adjust clinical pathway physician orders.

Adhere to the adjusted clinical pathway.

Our proposed system can easily support the implementation of these improvement steps. With the annual addition of new NHIRD data, the system can provide insights on innovative practices and allow continuous updating of the sets of physician orders.

Clinical pathways are germane to the process perspective of health care quality. Comparing the sets of physician orders across care providers is a good approach to identifying areas for clinical improvement and improving health care service delivery overall. Our system provides a convenient point of access to this part of the clinical pathway, because data is often challenging to obtain. Physicians may use the comparative data to better understand the hospital eco-system, their current practices, and ways to improve current practices.

We chose hernia repair as a starting point for this system because it can be examined as a single pure surgical operation more easily than other conditions with a higher proportion of mixed operational procedures [19]. Furthermore, hernia repair is less complicated than other conditions, and the operation required is relatively well established, compared with operations for other conditions. In previous reports, recurrence after herniorrhaphy may be associated with skills of surgical mesh fixation [20], characteristics of mesh [21,22], and types of hernia [23]. We expect that this system can provide even more benefits for physicians when increasingly complex operations, such as cancer, are examined.

The Charlson score is a general evaluation of the severity of comorbidities of the patient. In this study, there is no statistically significant difference between low and high recurrence rate in terms of the Charlson score (Table 7). It means that the Charlson score has no association with recurrence after herniorrhaphy. Our study has similar findings compared to one meta-analysis study, which reports that female gender, direct inguinal hernias at the primary procedure, operation for a recurrent inguinal hernia, and smoking history are significant risk factors for recurrence after inguinal hernia surgery [24].

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

We calculated the consistency index by tabulating the number of physician orders. We only assessed quantity and did not consider the physical influence of the physician orders. For example, a surgical method may be considered more influential than a lab test method. This circumstance may be improved by controlling for the weight of physician orders in future studies. Moreover, herniorrhaphy is not a major operation, which has very low surgical mortality (less than 0.1%). In terms of patient outcomes (28-day mortality), there is no statistically significant difference between frequent sets of physician orders and mortality.

The purpose of this system is to compare hospitals, not individual physicians. However, physician orders or decision making of method of operations that apply to patients may differ from those issued physician-to-physician. This situation may influence overall hospital consistency. In the previously mentioned consistency index analysis, we considered the number of surgeons at each hospital that performed this operation. In order to provide more cross-reference information for users, this system can also display the de-identified physician ID to better signal when two operations were performed by the same physician.

The frequent physician order set we calculated was based on the hospital viewpoint. In contrast, analyses computed from the individual patient base might yield another order set, a frequent association physician order set. If we further considered the sequence of these physician orders during a hospital stay, it will lead to a frequent sequential physician order set. These results may be obtained from data models by data mining association items or sequential items in future work.

Currently the system is a project-based application for a specific surgical operation purpose. In the future, the system can be improved to provide general-purpose queries for any procedure code operation.

Herniorrhaphy is a well-developed and matured procedure with few deviations during general practice. Nonetheless, deviations from original clinical pathways may happen, and are enrolled on the variance record. Most important of all, some deviations may be beneficial for specific patients in specific situations. However, such variance records are not available on our database, and our system does not support this function. In the future, our system may do regular mining for individual hospital to find the serial change of uncommon physician orders, which may become standard afterward.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In conclusion, we developed a system that provides a convenient way for physicians to retrieve and compare one part of the clinical pathways among health care providers. The sets of physician orders were derived from the NHIRD, an evidence-based database. Thus, the data can provide a means for actual practice other than just a document description or workflow. The claim records of the NHIRD, the related Charlson score, days of hospitalization, and recurrence rate were also calculated and displayed for comparison to evaluate the related potential quality. Results suggest that a higher consistency index leads to lower recurrence rates. Care-provider administrators can use a consistency index of 70% as a reference benchmark when taking steps to continuously adjust and adhere to their clinical pathways.

None declared.
