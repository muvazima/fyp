@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Gaussian distributions are the most widely used probabilistic models to characterise physical processes [2]. There are, however, several signals and processes that require non-Gaussian probabilistic models. Laplace distributions are perhaps the most commonly used non-Gaussian statistical models in signal processing and communication systems [15]. Some examples, where Laplace probabilistic models are used, include modeling of estimators in speech enhancement and audio source separation [6,18], modeling of distributions of transform-coefficients in image and video coding [1], modeling of position errors in navigation systems and modeling of non-Gaussian noises in communication systems [3,24,27]. Furthermore, in finance, Laplace models are used for predicting and modeling of market risks [13].

For mathematical representation of such Laplacian dynamic systems, a model that is flexible to be configured to accurately capture the statistical dynamics of the systems is desired. Moreover, for simulations purposes, it is essential that the mathematical model posses a structure that is simple and convenient for generating realizations of Laplace processes. In this paper, we present a random-coefficient [19] mathematical form to simulate a third-order Laplace autoregressive process. Following the work in [7], the Laplace AR process uses similar Markovian mathematical structure as those of the well-known Gaussian AR processes but the coefficients of the AR process are chosen to be random. This Markovian property allows it to be flexible and simple to implement. The most significant feature of the developed random-coefficient Laplace AR process is that its autocorrelation property has Yule–Walker type of equations which simplifies the generation of random sequences of desired autocorrelations, and also makes system modeling or data fitting convenient.

There are other ways of generating non-Gaussian random sequence that have been reported in the literature [23,16,26,25,9]. A common way of generating a non-Gaussian random sequence is to apply a white noise Gaussian sequence to a system that consists of a linear time-invariant filter followed by a non-linear transformer. The function of the linear time-invariant filter is to produce a sequence of a desired autocorrelation, while the non-linear transformer is used to shape the random sequence to a specified distribution [22]. Such a method generates random sequences of accurate autocorrelations and correct distributions, however, it is inconvenient in its implementation because it does not posses a mathematical form that perfectly fits into a state-space representation which is essential for applying many popular parameter estimation techniques.

Another idea for generating Laplace AR process lies in the fact that the marginal pdf of the real as well as imaginary component of the product of two independent circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distributions is Laplace distribution [12]. Therefore, a Laplace AR process can be generated by multiplying two independent complex Gaussian AR processes and by taking only either the real or imaginary component of the product process. While this method can generate accurate Laplace process with desired characteristics, modeling systems with such two separate processes lacks conciseness and increases the dimension of unknowns in parameter estimation problems [12]. Furthermore, we note that while the real and imaginary components of the product process are uncorrelated, they are not independent [12]. Consequently, if generating a complex Laplace process with independent marginal distributions is desired, another product of two complex circularly-symmetric Gaussian AR processes would be needed, requiring four AR processes that have totally eight inputs of independent Gaussian processes. In contrast, our developed random-coefficient algorithm would require four uniformly distributed and two Laplace distributed processes to generate a complex Laplace process with independent marginal distributions.

The paper is organized as follows: we first provide our motivation for developing the proposed Laplace AR process in Section 2. In Section 3, we define the mathematical structure of the random-coefficient third-order AR process, provide a detailed pseudocode algorithm to generate a Laplace AR sequence, derive Yule–Walker type autocorrelation equations of the AR process, and describe the conditions for wide-sense stationarity of the AR process. In Section 4, we provide illustrative computer simulation examples to verify our theoretical derivations and demonstrate its application for modeling Laplacian dynamic systems. Conclusions are given in Section 5.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

Our interest in the work of Laplace AR processes has been initially motivated by the desire to efficiently and compactly model the channel of a single-hop relay communication system [14]. The channel of a single-hop relay communication system consists of a cascade of two channels, i.e., a channel between transmitter and relay, denoted by 
                        
                           
                              h
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     , and a channel between relay and receiver, denoted by 
                        
                           
                              h
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . Rather than modeling the fading process of each channel by a separate mathematical model, it is convenient and efficient if the fading process of the overall channel is modeled by a single model that captures the statistical characteristics of the overall channel.

For non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication, it is known that the magnitude of the fading process of a wireless channel has Rayleigh distribution while the phase of the fading process of the channel has uniform distribution. The magnitude and phase variation of the fading process of a wireless channel can, then, be captured by a zero-mean circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution [21,22] allowing the representation

Given the probabilistic model and the autocorrelation of the fading process, our objective is to develop a single Laplace AR process that concisely represents the dynamics of a single-hop relay channel. The parameters of the Laplace AR process are desired to be easily configurable to have an autocorrelation that matches the desired autocorrelation of the channel for different fading conditions as given by (1). Such modeling of the channel would allow the formulation of the transmission equation of a relay communication system in a concise state-space form for convenient application of well-known methods such as Kalman filtering [17] and particle filtering techniques [8,10] for data detection and channel estimation. A modeling example of such a channel is provided in Section 4.

Laplace distributions are self-decomposable [7], and this fact can be used to derive a recursive mathematical form for Laplace AR process that is similar to the Gaussian AR process.

Following [7], we use random coefficients AR process to derive a general zero-mean symmetric third-order Laplace AR process. The third-order Laplace AR process has the following mathematical form

                     . There is a relationship among these sets of parameters. The 
                        α
                      and 
                        β
                      parameters are independent parameters and are chosen to meet a desired autocorrelation property of the Laplace random sequence. The parameters 
                        γ
                      and b are dependent parameters and their values can be exactly computed from the values of 
                        α
                      and

In the sequel, we establish the relationship between the independent and dependent parameters, and derive the equations to determine 
                        γ
                      and b from the values of 
                        α

                        β
                     . When deriving the relationship, we use the fact that the characteristic function of a probability distribution is unique. Thus, we derive the parameters by equating the characteristic equation of the right-side terms of (6) to the characteristic function of the Laplace distribution for

                      As described earlier, the values of α and β are determined from the desired autocorrelation requirement, and they are obtained before the b and γ-equations are solved. Therefore, the right hand side of both b and γ-equations are constant numbers. For ease of notation, let us denote the right hand side constants of (17), (18) and (19) as

The set of b-equations is non-linear equations, and does not have a plug-in analytic solutions. However, they can easily be solved using numerical methods such as the fixed-point iteration method [5] shown in Algorithm 1
                      below.

Given the b values, the set of 
                        γ
                     -equations is linear equations, and can be analytically determined using

                         a pseudocode to simulate a Laplace AR sequence using the developed method, assuming that the parameters

From the equations derived to determine the parameters of a random-coefficient third-order AR process, we can extrapolate the structure as well as the corresponding equations to determine the parameters of a random-coefficient first-order and second-order Laplace AR processes. A random-coefficient first-order AR process, for example, will have a structure given by [7]

Obviously, the equations to determine the parameters of the random-coefficient second-order Laplace process can be obtained using the same steps followed for the derivation of the parameters of the third-order process, but the relationships can also be deduced by reducing (17)–(18) and (20)–(21) as

In this section, we derive the autocorrelation function of the random-coefficient third-order Laplace AR process and show that it has a Yule–Walker type of equations. Assuming the Laplace AR process defined in (6) is a wide-sense stationary process, its autocorrelation function is given by

We conducted a third experiment to illustrate the application of the proposed random-coefficient AR process. Using autocorrelation matching, we have used it to model the fading process of a single-hop relay channel whose fading process is Laplace distributed. In our experiment, we considered a relay communication system in which both the relay and the receiver were mobile at speeds of 30 and 120 miles per hour, the carrier operating frequency was 
                        f

                      GHz, and the transmission rate was 104 symbols/sec, which translates to a sampling period of

By generating several sequences of the derived AR model, we compared its autocorrelation to the theoretical autocorrelation of the fading process calculated above, and we observed that the difference of the two autocorrelation values are very small. As an example, the sample autocorrelation values of 1.9961, 0.2694, −0.3911 and 0.1013 for time lag 
                        l

                        1
                        ,
                        2
                     , and 3 respectively were obtained for one typical realization. These values are close to the theoretical autocorrelation of the fading process of the considered single-hop relay channel.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

There are several signals, processes and system that require non-Gaussian probabilistic models for their accurate description. Laplacian models are one of the most widely used non-Gaussian probabilistic models. In this paper, we have presented a random-coefficient mathematical structure to generate a third-order Laplace AR process. The developed Laplace AR process has a convenient and flexible mathematical structure for simulating sequences. Detailed pseudocode of the algorithm for generating a third-order Laplace AR process is provided.

The most salient feature of the developed AR process is that, similar to the Gaussian AR processes, its autocorrelation function satisfies a Yule–Walker type of equations. This feature of the Laplace AR process enables us to design sequences that match a desired autocorrelation property.

By way of simulations, we have verified that the statistical moments such as mean and variance as well as other measures of higher cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis of sequences generated by the proposed AR process are consistent with the expected theoretical statistical characteristics of a Laplace distribution.
