                  The subject of this paper is the problem of finding the optimal replenishment schedule for an inventory, subject to time-dependent demand and deterioration, within a finite time planning horizon. It is shown that taking inflation into account has a profound effect on the solution of the problem. For instance, there is a critical number of replenishment periods, in excess of which the optimal schedule is characterized by the inclusion of token orders at the end of the planning horizon. This and other conclusions, obtained via a careful mathematical analysis of the problem, rectify those of earlier studies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The archetypical model of inventory control concerns a stock that diminishes due to consumer demand and deterioration (Goyal & Giri, 2001; Raafat, 1991). When the demand is time-dependent, the control problem is to minimize the total cost of holding and replenishing the stock within a finite time planning horizon. The decision variables are the number of occasions on which the stock is to be replenished and the moments at which this replenishment should occur. When shortages are allowed, the times at which the stock is exhausted and a period of shortage commences become further decision variables. Taking inflation into account leads to a modification of the cost function, without altering its structure. One might therefore expect that inflation is of little consequence with regard to the mathematics of the optimization problem. Indeed, with the notable exception of a result concerning the problem with shortages (Chern, Yang, Teng, & Papachristos, 2008, Theorem 1, part 1), previous studies support this observation. The publications (Bose, Goswami, & Chaudhuri, 1995; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chern et al., 2008; Chung, Liu, & Tsai, 1997; Datta & Pal, 1991; Hariga, 1995; Misra, 1975, 1979; Moon, Giri, & Ko, 2005; Pentico & Drake, 2011; Yang, Teng, & Chern, 2001; Yang, Teng, & Chern, 2010) are among the most significant contributing to the overwhelming evidence that incorporating inflation is of quantitative importance only. In this paper we shall show that the opposite is the case. We shall demonstrate that taking inflation into account has a drastic effect on the solution of the optimization problem.

(The origination of the model (1) can be credited to Ghare and Schrader (1963). It has become a cornerstone of the modelling of a deteriorating inventory (Bakker, Riezebos, & Teunter, 2012; Goyal & Giri, 2001; Raafat, 1991), and, has been embraced in many studies of one, the other, or both of the cost functions (4) and (5). The two cost functions are equivalent because quantitatively they differ by an amount that is independent of the decision variables. This can be demonstrated using elementary calculus. The first rigorous mathematical proof of the existence of a unique minimum of the cost function(s) for fixed n was provided by Donaldson (1977) in the particular case that D is linear and 
                        
                           θ
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . The result was subsequently established for more general D and 
                        
                           θ
                           =
                           0
                        
                      by Henery (1979). Further proofs under progressively weaker hypotheses on both D and 
                        
                           θ
                        
                      have been presented by Balkhi and Benkherouf (2004), Benkherouf and Balkhi (1997), and Benkherouf and Gilding (2009). As a matter of fact, assuming that the remainder of Hypothesis 1 holds, the most recent does without part (iii) of this hypothesis. Priority for a proof of the convexity of the minimum value with respect to n can be claimed by Friedman (1982) for the case where 
                        
                           θ
                           =
                           0
                        
                      and a priori D is hypothesized to be such that there is a unique minimum satisfying (2) for all n. A proof covering a broader class of models is given in (Benkherouf & Gilding, 2009).)

In reality, costs are affected by inflation. The adaptation to account for inflation in economic order quantity (EOQ) models was pioneered by Buzacott (1975), Misra (1975), and Bierman and Thomas (1977). A refinement due to Misra (1979) was to distinguish between inflation occurring at internal and external rates. The internal inflation rate can be viewed as one which is determined by the financial circumstances of the particular inventory holder, whereas the external inflation rate is determined by the ambient economic state. Extensions to finite time planning horizon models followed (Bose et al., 1995; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chern et al., 2008; Chung et al., 1997; Datta & Pal, 1991; Dye & Hsieh, 2011; Hariga, 1995; Hsieh & Dye, 2010; Moon et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2001, 2010). The adaptation to include the effect of inflation in the OHP cost function (4) is to take

                     Thus, when inflation is taken into account, the character of the minimum of the cost functions (4) and (5) undergoes a radical change. Moreover, the property of strict convexity of the minimum value with respect to n is lost.

We shall also consider the corresponding problem when a shortage of stock is allowed between consecutive periods of consumption, and one may optionally start or end with a period of shortage. We shall show that for both the OHP and OHD cost models, the optimum of this problem undergoes a like change in character. These deductions refute ones in (Chern et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2001, 2010).

The technique we use is an extension of the approach to this general structured type of optimization problem in (Benkherouf & Gilding, 2009). This approach has since proven fruitful for a number of other related problems (Al-Khamis, Benkherouf, & Omar, in press; Benkherouf & Boushehri, 2012; Benkherouf & Omar, 2010). The extension is the content of the coming section. Section 3 is then devoted to the finite time planning horizon problem without shortages, and Section 4 to the one with. Both of the last-mentioned sections close with a subsection comprising a discussion of the consequences of the analysis.

Both the cost functions (7) and (8) may be written in the form

                     , the functions (11) and (13) violate two of these assumptions.

When inflation is not included, the cost function of inventory control with a finite time planning horizon H is such that irrespective of the number of replenishment periods n it has a unique minimum with respect to the consecutive times

                         satisfying (2) at which the stock is replenished. When inflation is included, this property is lost. In general, the best that one can say is that there is a unique infimum, which is unrealistic. As much as this does not seem to have been noticed in the literature to date, one may still ask whether or not it was to have been expected. Does it not make sense that when one has a prescribed setup cost, the effective impact of this cost will be eroded with the passage of time under the influence of inflation? Would it therefore not be beneficial to delay placing orders? Taking the number of orders to be fixed, would it not be better to postpone the placement of as many orders as long as possible? In the extreme, would it not be better to place them at the last possible moment? The present analysis shows that all of these questions are answered in the affirmative.

In practice, one would not entertain placing token orders at the end of a planning horizon, as the mathematically optimal solution with a large number of replenishment periods dictates. Given the additional freedom to choose the number of replenishment periods, the present analysis confirms that this would not be the best policy. Either there is a unique number of replenishment periods for which the overall optimum is obtained by a unique timing of the placement of that number of orders before the end of the planning period, or there are two consecutive numbers for both of which the optimum value is obtained from such a placement of orders.

The problem of finding the optimal replenishment schedule of an inventory modelled by (1) within a finite time horizon is extendible to the incorporation of periods of shortage (Benkherouf, 1995, 1997; Benkherouf & Gilding, 2009; Benkherouf & Mahmoud, 1996; Chern et al., 2008; Moon et al., 2005; Papachristos & Skouri, 2000; Teng, Chern, Yang, & Wang, 1999; Yang et al., 2001, 2010). With the idea that the demand rate is not affected by shortage, and that no stock means no losses due to deterioration, the dynamics of a shortage period can be described by

Considering the optimal replenishment schedule problem when shortages are allowed, there is no loss of generality in assuming that there is a shortage period between every two consecutive consumption periods. Whether, in addition, one begins or closes the planning horizon with a shortage period is a matter of choice. All options for the problem without inflation have been considered in the literature to date. We label them accordingly:
                           
                              (CC)
                              
                                 Start and end with a period of consumption.
                              


                                 Start with a period of consumption and end with a period of shortage.
                              


                                 Start with a period of shortage and end with a period of consumption.
                              


                                 Start and end with a period of shortage.

                        The finding of an optimal replenishment schedule for the OHP cost function for an inventory including shortages and inflation can then be reduced to the optimization of the function (10) under the following conditions:

Our first task is to verify that the models with shortage periods do fit into the general theory set up in Section 2 and previously applied to the models without. The next two lemmata, proven in Appendix G, determine this.

                         were excluded from the previous analysis because they failed to fit the general approach propounded in Section 2 (cf. Lemma 2). Nonetheless, they are amenable to a comparable analysis. That said, in keeping, the conclusions fall extraordinarily out of the pattern so far.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The majority of earlier studies of the inventory control problem with shortages and inflation (Bose et al., 1995; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chung et al., 1997; Datta & Pal, 1991; Hariga, 1995; Hou, Huang, & Lin, 2011; Moon et al., 2005; Uthayakumar & Rameswari, 2012) involve diverse assumptions on the admissible lengths of replenishment and shortage periods. The problem with no a priori restrictions on the timing of the orders or the start of shortage periods – as considered here – was previously studied for the OHP cost model in all four scenarios by Yang et al. (2001, 2010) and in the SC scenario by Chern et al. (2008), Hsieh and Dye (2010), and, Dye and Hsieh (2011).

The paper of Yang et al. (2001) includes a theorem that states that the cost function 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                         has a unique minimum that satisfies (2) for every 
                           
                              n
                              ∈
                              N
                           
                        . This conclusion was questioned by Skouri and Papachristos (2002) who demonstrated it to be false with numerical counterexamples. Partial rectification was effected by Chern et al. (2008), who in the SC scenario proved a part of a theorem that says that under a certain condition the minimum of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                         is given by (9) with 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              1
                           
                         for all 
                           
                              n

                        . As it turns out, this particular condition is not only sufficient but also necessary for this conclusion (Gilding, in preparation). The complementary part of the aforementioned theorem of Chern et al. (2008) states that under a diametrically opposed condition, the cost function

                         does have a unique minimum satisfying (2) for every 
                           
                              n

                        ) has the same character as that without, it is vacuous. The same can be said of the two theorems of Yang et al. (2010) that correspond.

Each of the papers (Chern et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2001, 2010) contains a further theorem stating that the minimum value

                         of the optimization problem for fixed n is a convex function of n, whereby it is evident from each appendix to which the reader is referred for the proof of the theorem that strict convexity is meant. Such is contradicted by Theorems 9 and 11 of the present paper.

The discrepancies between the results in the present paper and its predecessors inevitably lead to the conclusion that there are errors in the mathematics in the earlier works. We shall not dwell on these here.

The constructive message is that the inclusion of inflation in inventory control with a finite time planning horizon dramatically alters the character of the solution of the optimization problem. With or without shortages, under equitable hypotheses it has been shown that when the number of replenishment cycles is sufficiently large, the optimal solution involves the placement of token orders at the end of the planning period. In this context the concept of sufficiently large is relative. One cycle may be enough. Moreover, the property of the minimum value of the cost function being a strictly convex function of the number of replenishment cycles is lost.

Given the freedom to choose the number of replenishment cycles in any one of the CC, CS, SC or SS scenarios involving shortages, the above analysis nonetheless establishes that there is either a unique number of cycles or two consecutive numbers of cycles such that the overall optimal schedule is attained with the stated number of cycles and a unique timing of the periods of consumption and shortage, and the latter does have the property that all decisive moments are before the end of the planning period.

Further quantitative aspects of the present problem will be dealt with in a companion paper (Gilding, in preparation).
