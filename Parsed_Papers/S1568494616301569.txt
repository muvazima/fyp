                  This paper considers the order acceptance and scheduling problem in a single machine environment where each customer order is characterized by a known processing time, due date, revenue, and class setup time. The objective is to maximize the total revenue. Since the problem is computationally intractable, we first conduct a preliminary study of applying the basic artificial bee colony algorithm to address the problem under study. Specifically, we design appropriate neighborhood operators with respect to the problem. Based on the results of the preliminary study and the problem characteristics, an enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm is developed with a series of modifications. The extensive experimental results indicate that the enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm is both computationally efficient and effective for large sized problem instances.
