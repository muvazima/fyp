                  Predicting essential proteins is highly significant because organisms can not survive or develop even if only one of these proteins is missing. Improvements in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a large number of available protein–protein interactions. By taking advantage of these interaction data, researchers have proposed many computational methods to identify essential proteins at the network level. Most of these approaches focus on the topology of a static protein interaction network. However, the protein interaction network changes with time and condition. This important inherent dynamics of the protein interaction network is overlooked by previous methods. In this paper, we introduce a new method named CDLC to predict essential proteins by integrating dynamic local average connectivity and in-degree of proteins in complexes. CDLC is applied to the protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results show that CDLC outperforms five other methods (Degree Centrality (DC), Local Average Connectivity-based method (LAC), Sum of ECC (SoECC), PeC and Co-Expression Weighted by Clustering coefficient (CoEWC)). In particular, CDLC could improve the prediction precision by more than 45% compared with DC methods. CDLC is also compared with the latest algorithm CEPPK, and a higher precision is achieved by CDLC. CDLC is available as Supplementary materials. The default settings of active threshold and alpha-parameter are 0.8 and 0.1, respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Proteins undoubtedly play important roles in every organism’s cell. In particular, essential proteins are indispensable because deleting even one of them is lethal to an organism or renders it infertile (Winzeler et al., 1999; Kamath et al., 2003). Essential proteins can also be regarded as drug targets for new antibiotics because of their indispensability (Clatworthy et al., 2007).

To find essential proteins, researchers have used several experimental approaches, such as single gene knockouts (Giaever et al., 2002), RNA interference (Cullen and Arndt, 2005) and conditional knockouts (Roemer et al., 2003), to discover essential proteins. Although many essential proteins have been identified this way, the process is time consuming and expensive. Therefore, with the fast accumulation of available protein–protein interaction (PPI) data, studies on computational methods for predicting essential proteins are attracting increased attention.

In 2001, Jeong et al. pointed out that proteins highly connected with other proteins in PPI network have higher potential to be essential than randomly selected proteins (Jeong et al., 2001). This phenomenon is called the centrality–lethality rule (Jeong et al., 2001). In recent years, most investigators have proven the positive correlation between the essentiality of proteins and the topological centrality (Hahn and Kern, 2005; Batada et al., 2006; Vallabhajosyula et al., 2009; Estrada, 2006). Based on the latter finding, a variety of centrality measures for identifying essential proteins have been proposed. Among these centrality measures, Degree Centrality (DC) (Jeong et al., 2001), Betweenness Centrality (BC) (Freeman, 1977), Closeness Centrality (CC) (Wuchty and Stadler, 2003), Subgraph Centrality (SC) (Estrada and Rodriguez-Velazquez, 2005), Eigenvector Centrality (EC) (Bonacich, 1987) and Information Centrality (IC) (Stephenson and Zelen, 1989) are the most classic ones. Other useful centrality measures, such as Bottle Neck (BN) (Przulj et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2007), Local Average Connectivity (LAC) (Li et al., 2011) and Sum of ECC (SoECC) (Wang et al., 2012), are also designed to detect essential proteins. The performances of topology-based approaches are known to closely depend on the quality of PPI networks. However, many false positive and false negative interactions exist in PPI networks. To solve this problem, Li et al. (2010) constructed a relatively reliable weighted PPI network by taking advantage of gene annotations. In this weighted network, the performance of the topology-based methods could be optimized to a great extent. This result confirms that topological centrality is sensitive to the noise in PPI networks. To further improve the prediction precision, researchers attempt to combine biology information with network topology (He and Zhang, 2006; Zotenko et al., 2008; Chua et al., 2008). Consequently, several new methods have been proposed. For example, PeC considers both the edge clustering coefficient and gene expression data (Li et al., 2012), Co-Expression Weighted by Clustering coefficient (CoEWC) (Zhang et al., 2013) integrates clustering coefficient and gene expression data, and another integrated approach proposed by Luo and Ma (2013) combines edge clustering coefficient with complex centrality.

Existing methods for identifying essential proteins all regard the PPI network as a static graph. Given that interactions in static PPI networks are obtained at different time points and under different conditions, a static graph can not completely reflect the real network (Chen and Yuan, 2006; Przytycka et al., 2010). In fact, PPI networks change over time, in different environments, and at different stages of cell cycle, which means that dynamism exists in PPI networks (Przytycka et al., 2010; Han et al., 2004; De Lichtenberg et al., 2005). Based on this fact, Tang et al. (2011) constructed a time-course network with gene expression data and the result indicated that the performance of identifying functional modules based on the time-course PPI network is better than that based on a static PPI network. Wang et al. (2013) built a new dynamic PPI network using a method similar to that adopted by Tang et al. (2011) and concluded that the dynamic PPI network can contribute to the discovery of protein complexes. The main difference between the two approaches is the process of selecting the active threshold of proteins.

The discovery of functional modules and protein complexes is more effective when applying algorithms to a dynamic PPI network. Thus, we suppose that using a dynamic PPI network topology can enable better prediction of essential proteins than using a static PPI network. In other words, the effects of topology-based methods for discovering essential proteins can be improved by implementing these methods in dynamic PPI network. We elaborate the theoretical basis of our hypothesis as follows. At a certain time point, the dynamic PPI network can be represented as a temporal network (Tang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013). In these temporal networks, interactions form in the same situation and the included proteins are highly expressed (active). Therefore, dynamic PPI network is of higher quality. Given this high quality, topology centralities in dynamic PPI network are more reliable, which can contribute to a better identification of essential proteins. The proof of our hypothesis is shown in Section 3.6. Then to further enhance the effect of predicting essential proteins, we integrate dynamic network topology and biology information. The integration of dynamic local average connectivity and complex information is chosen to predict essential proteins and this new method is named Combine Dynamic LAC with Complex centrality (CDLC). To evaluate the effect of our CDLC method, we compare CDLC with five centrality methods (DC, LAC, SoECC, PeC and CoEWC). Considering that both LAC and SoECC can outperform all six classic methods (DC, BC, CC, SC, EC, and IC) (Li et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012), we select only DC for comparison because it is the most accessible among the six methods. The comparison results suggest that CDLC performs better than the other five methods (DC, LAC, SoECC, PeC, and CoEWC). Particularly, CDLC can achieve more than 45% improvement in prediction precision compared with DC. We also compare CDLC with the latest essential protein predicting approach named CEPPK (Li et al., 2014), and results show that CDLC outperforms CEPPK.

@&#METHODS@&#

The static PPI network is generally considered as an undirected graph G (V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. The nodes in graph G denote the proteins and the edges represent the interactions between proteins.


                        Tang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013) analyzed the feasibility of integrating the time-course gene expression data and the PPI data to build the dynamic PPI network. Both of their methods focus on the active time points of proteins and introduce an active threshold to judge whether a protein is in its active form at each time point. The difference between these two methods is the key to selecting the active threshold. Wang et al. (2013) also pointed out that it is reasonable to regard the time points with the highest expression value of a protein as the active time points, and the time points with expression values near to the highest one can also be considered as active time points since small differences are allowable and noise exists in data. Basing on that, we construct the dynamic PPI network in the following way, and the effects of different thresholds on several characteristics of the dynamic network will be introduced in Section 3.2.

Gene expression data are always in the form of a matrix. Thus, we use a matrix EXP with the size of m
                        ×
                        n to denote it, where m is the number of probes, which are used to obtain the expression value of each gene, and n is the total number of time points contained in the expression experiment. Let c be the number of cycles included in the expression experiment and n
                        c be the number of time points in each cycle yields n
                        =
                        c
                        ×
                        n
                        c. Considering the existence of unavoidable noise in the expression array (Wang et al., 2013), for each gene involved in the gene expression profiles, we regard the mean of its c expression values obtained at the same time points in each of the c cycle as the final expression value of this gene. In this way, we can obtain a new expression matrix EXP_new with the size of m
                        ×
                        n
                        c. Based on this new expression matrix, the procedure of constructing dynamic PPI network is described as follows:

Step 1. The expression value in each row of EXP_new is normalized by dividing each of the n
                        c expression values in row j (j
                        =1, 2, …, m) by the maximal value in the same row. Consequently, every expression value ranges from 0 to 1.

Step 2. A proper threshold to determine whether a gene is active at each time point is obtained. If the expression value of a gene at time point i (i
                        =1, 2, …, n
                        c) is greater than the active threshold, we say that the gene is active at time point i.

Step 3. n
                        c temporal networks corresponding to n
                        c different time points are constructed according to the activity of gene (proteins) and the static PPI network. For each time point, we determine each interaction in the static PPI network. If both genes (proteins) corresponding to this interaction are active at time point i (i
                        =1, 2, …, n
                        c), we add this interaction and this pair of proteins to the temporal network related to time point i. After considering all the interactions in the static PPI network, the construction of the n
                        c temporal networks is finished.

The purpose of defining the fixed active threshold in Step 2 is to filter out the genes whose expression level is not sufficiently high at some of the n
                        c time points. The set of the n
                        c temporal networks obtained in Step 3 refers to the abovementioned dynamic PPI network.

According to Hart et al. (2007) and Dezső et al. (2003), in many cases, essentiality of proteins is not a product of an individual protein function but that of complex function. Accordingly, Li et al. (2011) first proposed local average connectivity defined as Function (1). The local average connectivity of a node describes the closeness of its neighbors.

                        (w), which is called the local connectivity of w. Then, for a node u
                        ∈G, its average local connectivity (LAC(u)) is represented as the mean of local connectivity of its neighbors.

When calculating the dynamic local average connectivity, we should consider the times that each node appears in the dynamic PPI network because some nodes are not included in all of the temporal networks. The dynamic local average connectivity can be defined as the following function:

A protein complex is a set of proteins appearing at the same time and in the same location with certain structure and certain function. Studies on protein complexes can enhance our understanding of biological processes and contribute to the prediction of protein function (Li et al., 2008). Considering that many essential proteins are involved in forming protein complexes, the in-degree introduced by Radicchi et al. (2004) is used to describe the importance of a protein from the perspective of protein complex. The in-degree (degreein(u,C)) of a protein u in a protein complex C is defined as the number of interactions between u and other proteins in C. This definition is described in Function (3).

                        where CS is the set of protein complexes.

Given that a protein complex is a group of proteins appearing at the same time and in the same location with certain structure and certain function (Ren et al., 2011), the complex centrality should be calculated based on the dynamic PPI network in which the interactions are obtained in the same situation such that the character of protein complexes can be better reflected. We define the dynamic complex centrality as Function (5), which is similar to the definition of dynamic local average connectivity.

According to the experimental results of LAC algorithm, this algorithm is superior to the six typical centrality measures mentioned above. In addition, LAC considers the important modular nature of protein essentiality. Hence, we use the dynamic local average connectivity to represent the topology centrality of proteins. Meanwhile, Hart et al. (2007) pointed out that protein complexes highly correlate with essential proteins. Therefore, we choose the dynamic complex centrality as the biological part of our essentiality measure. Based on the analysis above, we select the integration of the dynamic local average connectivity and complex centrality to form our final essentiality measure of proteins. To combine these two parts, a harmonic centrality is defined as Function (6).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

There are four categories of data involved in our method: PPI data, gene expression data, protein complexes set and essential proteins set.

We choose the PPI data of S. cerevisiae to conduct our experiments, since its PPI and essentiality data are the most complete and reliable. The PPI data is downloaded from DIP database (Salwinski et al., 2004), updated on October 10, 2010, with a format “tab”. There are several types of interactions included in the PPI data, such as physical association, direct interaction and covalent binding. We extract the uniprotkb IDs of all the proteins involved in the PPI data and then use the “ID Mapping” function in UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) to transform the uniprotkb IDs to protein names we need. After deleting the self-interactions and the repeated interactions, the static PPI network consists of 5093 proteins and 24,743 interactions.

The gene expression data of S. cerevisiae is downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE3431 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3431), updated on June 08, 2012. It is in the form of a 9335×36 matrix. Each value represents the expression level of a gene obtained at a certain time points. This expression experiment contains 3 metabolic cycles of S. cerevisiae and each cycle includes 12 time points. There are 4981 common proteins between 5093 proteins in the PPI network and the gene products from gene expression profiles.

Protein complex set is gathered from three sources: MIPS (Mewes et al., 2004), SGD (Cherry et al., 1998) database and Aloy et al. (2004). By means of experiments, Aloy et al. (2004) selected 102 complexes from 232 yeast complexes characterized by tandem affinity purification (TAP). Those complexes that yielded more than 0.1mg of protein form 2L culture were selected. The final set contains 425 complexes and 1970 proteins in total.

The standard essential protein set is collected from four databases: MIPS (Mewes et al., 2004), SGD (Cherry et al., 1998), DEG (Zhang and Lin, 2009) and SGDP (Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project, 2014). This set includes 1285 essential proteins which share 1167 proteins with 5093 proteins in the static PPI network and 1161 proteins with 4981 proteins that belong to both the static PPI network and the set of gene products.

Selecting active threshold significantly influence the prediction precision of essential proteins. Apparently, the reliability of the dynamic PPI network evidently increases with increasing active threshold. As shown in Table 1
                        , the average GO similarity of the dynamic PPI network increases with increasing active threshold. However, higher active threshold means fewer proteins and fewer essential proteins contained in the dynamic PPI network (Fig. 1
                        ). The amount of proteins and essential proteins in the dynamic PPI network slowly decreases when the active threshold increases from 0 to 0.8 but rapidly decreases when the active threshold increases from 0.8 to 0.99. This result indicates that 0.8 is a demarcation point. Moreover, the dynamic PPI network still contains more than 93% of essential proteins in the static PPI network when the active threshold is 0.8. Therefore, the active threshold is set to 0.8 for the construction of a relatively reliable dynamic PPI network with enough proteins. This relatively high threshold is in accordance with what has been pointed out by Wang et al. (2013) that for each protein, the time points with its highest expression value and with expression value near to the highest one should be regarded as its active time points.

In this section, we calculate the number of active proteins and interactions included in each temporal network. The distribution of the number of active proteins that appear at a certain number of time points is also discussed. As shown in Table 2
                        , the number of proteins and interactions included differ among the 12 temporal networks. Although each temporal network only contains a fraction of the total proteins in the static PPI network, the total number of proteins in the dynamic network accounts for more than 86% of the total proteins. A fraction of the proteins is also not included in the dynamic PPI network because those proteins either do not have gene expression data or are not active at any time point. In addition, the time complexity of our method is acceptable because the number of proteins and interactions involved in each temporal network are not that high. Then, we count the number of active proteins appear in a certain number of temporal networks and the result (Fig. 2
                        ). Most proteins appear in not more than six temporal networks and only four proteins are included in all of the 12 temporal networks. This result is caused by the high active threshold.

Considering that the interactions in the dynamic PPI networks are simultaneously obtained under the same condition, we consider that these interactions have higher quality than those in the static PPI network. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is introduced to evaluate how strong two interacting proteins are co-expressed (Li et al., 2012), and GO similarity is selected to measure the functional similarity of interacting proteins. We compare the average PCC and the average GO similarity of four PPI networks which refer to the static network, our dynamic network, and two dynamic PPI networks constructed by the methods introduced by Tang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013), respectively. The four networks are obtained with the same PPI data. The results are shown in Table 3
                        . We can find that both the average PCC and GO similarity of the three dynamic PPI networks are higher than that of the static PPI network. But it is regrettable that the increase in GO similarity is generally low no matter which dynamic PPI network is compared with the static network. Nevertheless, the average PCC of dynamic networks constructed by our method and Wang’s method is much higher than that of the static network, and our dynamic network can achieve the highest PCC. Thus, we conclude that the quality of dynamic PPI networks is higher than that of the static PPI network, and the dynamic PPI network constructed by our method is relatively good.

Parameter α is a harmonic coefficient in integrating dynamic local average connectivity and complex centrality. Table 4
                         shows the effect of parameter α on the performance of CDLC algorithms, where k is the number of top ranked proteins. CDLC can predict the highest number of true essential proteins with α
                        =0.1. This observation suggests that the complex component is an excellent property for predicting essential proteins while the LAC component only has a little effect. This finding can be attributed to the fact that essentiality is a product of protein complexes rather than the individual protein, and protein complexes have a high collection of essential proteins (Hart et al., 2007). Nevertheless, comparing the result of CDLC with α
                        =0 and that with α
                        =0.1, we find that a better result can be achieved by the latter value of α. In addition, the protein complexes of some species are less completed than yeast. Therefore, deleting the LAC component may significantly reduce prediction precision. Thus, the LAC component is indispensable although it only has a little effect on the results for yeast dataset.

In the previous section, we hypothesized that identifying essential proteins in the dynamic network can optimize the performance of topology-based methods. To prove the validity of this hypothesis, we take three topology-based methods (DC, SoECC and LAC) as examples. These methods are selected because they can be used to predict essential proteins from different angles. DC bases on the number of neighbors of each current node, SoECC focuses on the importance of the edges connected with current node and LAC considers the significance of neighbors of current node. We compare the performance of DC, SoECC and LAC based on the static PPI network with that applied in the dynamic network. When implementing the three methods in the dynamic PPI network, for each protein, we first calculate the centrality scores related to each of those temporal networks that contain the protein. Then, we obtain the mean of these centrality scores and regard it as the final centrality score of this protein. The final score of a protein that is not included in any temporal network is set to 0. The proteins that are not included in the dynamic PPI network and the interactions related to those proteins are deleted from the static PPI network to achieve a fair comparison. Regardless of which method and which branch of the six types of top ranked proteins is considered, more essential proteins are correctly predicted from the dynamic network than from the original static network and the remaining static network (Fig. 3
                        ). Therefore, we can conclude that predicting essential proteins based on the dynamic network topology can achieve better performance. In addition, deleting the proteins excluded from the dynamic network only has minimal effect on the performance of the three methods. That is to say, it is the usage of dynamic PPI network that results in the improvement of prediction precision rather than the deletion of proteins.

In this section, we evaluate the performance of CDLC (α
                        =0.1) by comparing it with five previously proposed methods (DC, LAC, SoECC, PeC, and CoEWC). We test these methods with the same PPI data and gene expression data. Then, we delete from the static PPI network the proteins excluded from the dynamic PPI network and the interactions related to these proteins. The comparison results are shown in Fig. 4
                        . CDLC performs better than all the other methods. Moreover, for the 600 top ranked proteins, we find that the prediction precision can achieve more than 45% improvement when CDLC is compared with DC.

Additionally, CDLC is also compared with the latest approach CEPPK (Li et al., 2014) which predicts essential proteins based on a fraction of known essential proteins. CEPPK provides us with a new angle to effectively discover essential proteins and the results show that CEPPK is an effective method. CEPPK selects a fraction of known essential proteins as a “seed” to predict the essentiality of other proteins. The number of “seed” essential proteins has only little influence on the prediction precision of CEPPK. Therefore, we only randomly select 50 and 100 known essential proteins for 20 times as samples to compare CDLC with CEPPK, respectively. Here, prediction precision means the proportion of true essential proteins out of a certain number of top ranked proteins (Li et al., 2014). To achieve a fair comparison, these “seed” essential proteins are excluded from the top ranked protein list before calculating the prediction precision of CEPPK and CDLC. As shown in Fig. 5
                        , when 50 known essential proteins are selected to be seeds, the prediction precision of CDLC is higher than that of CEPPK no matter how many top ranked proteins are considered. Similar results can be found when 100 known essential proteins are selected to be seeds. In addition, the advantage of CDLC becomes more apparent with the number of known essential proteins increasing. So we can conclude that CDLC is more effective than CEPPK.

In this section, the sensitivity of two parameters (the active threshold and α in Function (6)) is test by jackknifing. The interactions in the original static PPI network are randomly divided into ten equal subsets. We leave out one subset and integrate the other nine subsets to obtain a new static PPI network, and the process is repeated ten times with each of the ten subsets being left out exactly once. After that, ten new static PPI networks are obtained. Then we start CDLC with each of the ten static PPI networks to discuss the values of the two parameters by the same method used in Section 3.2 and 3.5, respectively. The jackknifing process is repeated five times. The results of the active threshold are shown in Fig. 6
                         and Table 5
                        . We can see that the results are similar to those in Section 3.2. Therefore, it is reasonable to set the active threshold to 0.8. As shown in Fig. 7
                        , no matter which time of the five jackknifing is considered, CDLC achieves the highest precision with α set to 0.1, which accord with the results in Section 3.5. So we conclude that both parameters in CDLC are stable.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Essential proteins are of great significance for the survival and development of organism. Recent studies have exerted considerable efforts in predicting essential proteins. Many centrality measures have been proposed to identify essential proteins based on PPI networks. However, dynamics exist in the PPI networks. This important inherent property has been ignored by previously proposed methods. Basing on this fact, we take advantage of dynamic network topology to predict essential proteins and propose a new method named CDLC. CDLC predicts essential proteins by combining dynamic local average connectivity with in-degree of proteins in complexes.

We can draw the following four conclusions from the experimental results. First, the quality of our dynamic PPI network is higher than that of the static PPI network. Second, topology-based methods can achieve better effects when they are implemented in the dynamic PPI network than when they are implemented in the static PPI network. Third, CDLC can outperform five previously proposed methods (DC, LAC, SoECC, PeC, and CoEWC). Furthermore, the prediction precision can be improved by more than 45% when comparing CDLC with DC. Fourth, CDLC can achieve higher prediction precision than CEPPK which is the latest method for discovering essential proteins.

Although CDLC performs better than most previously proposed methods, our method for the construction of dynamic PPI network has limitations. The expression value of a gene is obtained by analyzing the level of mRNA related to it. However, the level of mRNA is just one of the factors which influence the level of protein in a cell. That is, the level of protein in a cell is not always correlated with the expression of the gene. Therefore, the dynamic PPI network in this study can not perfectly match the real one. This finding may partially account for the inaccurate prediction of essential proteins. The contents of dynamic data are expected to increase in the future. The performance of our method can be improved by integrating several types of dynamic data to construct a realistic dynamic PPI network. Further efforts can also be exerted to improve prediction precision from the aspect of the inherent property of essential proteins.
