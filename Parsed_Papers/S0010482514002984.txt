                  In this paper, we propose two reconstruction algorithms for sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). Treating the reconstruction problems as data fidelity constrained total variation (TV) minimization, both algorithms adapt the alternate two-stage strategy: projection onto convex sets (POCS) for data fidelity and non-negativity constraints and steepest descent for TV minimization. The novelty of this work is to determine iterative parameters automatically from data, thus avoiding tedious manual parameter tuning. In TV minimization, the step sizes of steepest descent are adaptively adjusted according to the difference from POCS update in either the projection domain or the image domain, while the step size of algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) in POCS is determined based on the data noise level. In addition, projection errors are used to compare with the error bound to decide whether to perform ART so as to reduce computational costs. The performance of the proposed methods is studied and evaluated using both simulated and physical phantom data. Our methods with automatic parameter tuning achieve similar, if not better, reconstruction performance compared to a representative two-stage algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique widely used for medical diagnosis and treatments [1]. Due to potential risk of inducing secondary cancers, it is desirable to reduce radiation doses of X-ray CT imaging (e.g. fewer projection views, less angular coverage and lower incident X-ray intensity) [2]. For CT reconstruction with limited data, iterative reconstruction (IR) methods have demonstrated their capability of producing high quality images [3,4]. Thanks to advances of computer hardware and reconstruction algorithms, IR for CT has become a realistic approach in clinic practice [5].

One advantage of IR methods is that prior information can be incorporated with the imaging models, which can further improve reconstruction qualities [6–9]. In the past few years IR methods regularized by sparsity priors have been investigated [10–12]. One common approach is to minimize the total variation (TV), which is based on assumption of image sparsity in the gradient domain [13]. The nonlinear TV regularization can reduce noise while somewhat preserving edges of CT images.

Many iterative algorithms have been developed for regularized CT reconstruction [9,14–16]. A two-stage reconstruction approach was utilized in [17] where the data fidelity condition and prior constraints were enforced onto images separately. The same strategy was also adopted in TV regularized reconstruction [18–20]. In these iterative approaches, data fidelity constraints were enforced using the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and the TV objective was minimized using steepest descent or other optimization methods. To balance the two operations, a set of empirical parameters were introduced to adjust the contributions of the ART and TV optimization in [18]. However, one disadvantage of these iterative methods is that the parameters, such as step sizes, usually need to be manually tuned to achieve quick and convergent reconstruction and good image quality under different imaging conditions. Since this manual tuning process is tedious and time consuming, an automatic determination of reconstruction parameters for predictable results is highly desirable, which is the focus of this work.

For this purpose, a non-parametric control method was proposed to adjust the TV step size according to changes in the projection domain [21]. In this work, we propose to determine all iterative parameters automatically from data to avoid tedious manual parameter tuning. In TV minimization, the step sizes of steepest descent are adaptively adjusted according to the difference from POCS update in either the projection domain (projection controlled steepest descent, “PCSD”) or the image domain (image controlled steepest descent, “ICSD”), while the step size of the ART in POCS is determined based on the data noise level.

Furthermore, in two-stage approaches, the projections of the reconstructed image need to compare with the observed data to determine certain parameters [18]. This requires one full forward projection in addition to the forward and backward projections of the ART for each iteration. In this paper we utilize a novel mechanism to reduce the computational cost of two-stage CT reconstruction by skipping the ART operation for the data fidelity constraint when the projection error is not greater than a predefined error bound.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The objective function for X-ray CT reconstruction is provided in Section 2. The new adaptive iterative reconstruction algorithms are proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated using both simulated and real data. Discussion and conclusion are given in Section 5.

Eq. (1) is an unconstrained convex optimization problem and can be solved by well-established optimization techniques, such as conjugate gradient [19] and the first order primal dual methods [22]. However, the solution of Eq. (1) varies depending on the value of 
                        β
                      that balances the contributions between TV and data fidelity terms. There is no straightforward way to determine its value for the optimal reconstruction other than trial-and-error tests. In this work, we focus on the parameter determination by treating sparse-view CT reconstruction as a constrained optimization as follows:

In this from, the objective is a TV minimization problem constrained by a data fidelity term in the projection domain. The parameter 
                        є
                      defines a certain amount of data error allowed between predicted and observed projection data due to noise and modeling errors, so called the “error bound” parameter. It is noted that there is an equivalence between the objective functions (1) and (4) when 
                        є
                      is not equal to zero. Nevertheless, the automatic determination of 
                        є
                      can be achieved using the projection data, thus avoiding the difficulty of the selection of 
                        β
                     . For a well-calibrated CT system and well-compensated projection data, 
                        є
                      is dominated by the photon counting noise obeying Poisson distribution. Thus, an appropriate value for 
                        є
                      can be determined using the method proposed in [23]. The method approximates the noise variance of the measurement y

The constrained optimization problem can be solved using a two-stage framework: (1) the enforcement of data fidelity and non-negativity constraints, and (2) the minimization of TV [10]. Two operations are iterated in alternation to achieve the optimal solution. Projection onto convex sets (POCS) is used at the first stage by treating constraint sets as convex sets and selecting a feasible image through projections onto these sets. Iterative methods such as steepest descent can be applied for TV optimization. Such TV-POCS approaches usually include two loops of iteration: a main loop of POCS and a sub-loop of TV optimization. The parameters that control the step sizes of POCS and TV minimization are important for a well-behaved iterative reconstruction. In this work, we proposed automatic approaches to determine these parameters to avoid tedious trial-and-error parameter tuning.

In the POCS stage, the feasible solution of data fidelity term can be obtained using the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). For the ith ray of X-ray CT, the original ART from an initial point x

                         is the relaxation parameter [24].

In this study we proposed to determine the relaxation parameter according to the noise level of X-ray photon detection, whose variance can be approximated as the inverse of the detected counts shown in Eq. (5) 
                        [25–27]. Specifically, the relaxation parameter can be defined as the normalized X-ray intensities,

The influence of the relaxed projection of ART on reconstruction is studied experimentally in Section 4.3.

To enforce the non-negativity constraint, the negative values in the reconstructed image are set as zero. POCS is the combination of non-negativity projections and the ART.

                           η
                         is the step size. However, TV-gradient descent cannot be implemented without the consideration of the constraints (achieved by POCS) for the reconstruction problem at hand. Otherwise it will lead to a solution of a non-negative flat image. The balance between TV-gradient descent and POCS can be achieved by making TV-gradient descent step size proportional to the change in the image due to POCS. Furthermore, the gradient descent step size needs to be non-increasing at every main iteration to ensure that the image constraints are satisfied at the end. The value of the step size during the wth main iteration was defined as a function of image changes in [10],

                         was image changes by the wth POCS operation. In the adaptive steepest descent (ASD) approach [18], more parameters were introduced for 
                           η
                         adjustment to balance the data fidelity and regularization terms. However, the reconstruction may not be stable when a complicated parameter scheme was used. The proposed step-size methods are inspired by [10] with the improvement that an adaptive relaxation scheme based on changes in the projection domain or in the image domain after each main iteration, thus avoiding the (unstable) arbitrary relaxation.

In our previous work of the consistency controlled steepest descent (CCSD) method [21], an automatic method was proposed to determine the step size

                            was the projection error after the first iteration where the initial 
                              η
                            was set to 1 and k was a scale factor with an unit 1/cm to match the physical dimensions of both sides of the equation. The factor is adjusted to compensate unit changes of image, e.g. k=1 with the attenuation unit of cm−1 and k=10 with mm−1. After the first iteration, the numerator in Eq. (13) becomes smaller than the denominator as 
                              Mx
                            is approaching the projection data p. The step-size is determined directly by intermediate estimation x
                           (w) and observed data p without artificial parameters.

In the CCSD method, the step size was the function of projection errors. Besides forward and backward projections in the ART, the CCSD method requires one additional forward projection for step-size control. In this study, we propose an improvement of CCSD to reduce the computational cost. In this improvement, a forward projection is implemented at the beginning of the main-loop iteration to estimate projection error

The iterative algorithm includes two loops of iterations. Lines (2) to (4) are the main-loop, which is composed of POCS and TV stages. Besides, the operations (a–c) under line (3) are a sub-loop for TV minimization. n

                            is the total iteration number of TV subroutine. Two operations are conducted alternately until the stopping criteria are satisfied. The stopping criteria include: (1) the current image satisfies the constraints; and (2) either a predefined iteration number or a predefined small value of the difference of images of two successive iterations is reached. For comparison of different methods, the same iteration number is used in the experiments, i.e. the algorithm is terminated after w

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The performance of the proposed methods is studied using both a digital phantom and a physical phantom. The experiments are conducted on projection data from low-dose X-ray CT settings. Specifically, we performed two sets of experiments, namely “sparse views” and “low incident X-ray intensities”. The former uses different numbers of projection views (that are fewer than the sufficient number for an analytical reconstruction) while keeping the incident X-ray intensity at a typical clinical dose. This is normally exploited in TV-based reconstruction for low-dose CT. The latter refers to different incident X-ray intensities (from a typical clinical dose to lower ones) at a fixed number of projection views adequate for an accurate TV-based reconstruction. The lowered incident intensity can further decrease the deposition of harmful X-ray radiation into the human body on top of sparse views. Reconstruction is evaluated quantitatively using the root mean square error (RMSE) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) [30,31]. Unless otherwise stated, images used in all experiments are reconstructed using 600 iterations of the main loop with 20 iterations of TV sub-routine for each main loop. The initial image was chosen as a constant image with the linear attenuation coefficient of water at 80keV.

Reconstruction of low-dose X-ray CT was investigated using a 256×256 Shepp–Logan phantom with 1×1mm2 pixel size. Its background is filled with water equivalent material with a linear attenuation coefficient of 0.2cm−1. The CT numbers of the phantom (using Hounsfield unit (HU)) are shown in 
                        Fig. 1. The region marked with a red rectangle is the region of interest (ROI) selected for CNR measure. The projection data were captured using a fan beam scanner with 720 bins under the Poisson noise assumption. The pitch of bins was set to 1mm. The source to detector distance (SDD) was 800mm, and the source to iso-center distance (SAD) was 400mm.

We first studied the performance of the proposed methods with sparse views and the incident X-ray intensity y
                           
                              0
                            of 1.0×105 photon counts per ray. Projection data from 24, 48 and 72 views were acquired. Besides results of two proposed methods, images of ASD-POCS [18] and CCSD-POCS methods [21] were also obtained for comparison. Original parameter settings of two methods were adapted for the experiments, unless otherwise specified. The reconstructed images are shown in 
                           Fig. 2 with a narrow dynamic range of [−100 100] HU. Images of ASD, CCSD, PCSD and ICSD are demonstrated from left to right. Results with 24, 48, and 72 views are shown from top to bottom, respectively. There are more artifacts on ASD and CCSD images from 24 views. No noticeable difference can be observed on reconstructed images of all methods from data with 48 and 72 views.

Reconstruction performance was evaluated quantitatively using RMSE, as listed in 
                           Table 1. RMSE values of both new methods are lower than those of ASD and CCSD methods. The RMSEs of ICSD are lower than those of PCSD. We also investigated the CNR of ROI for local image qualities of reconstructed images and listed these CNR values in 
                           Table 2. The proposed methods achieve the same levels of CNRs to other methods using 24 and 48 projections views. Their values are slightly higher using 72 projection views.

We evaluated different reconstruction methods at different noise levels by changing the incident X-ray intensity y
                           
                              0
                           . Projection data were captured from 60 views evenly distributed along a circular orbit. Results of four methods are shown in 
                           Fig. 3 with a narrow dynamic range of [−100 100] HU. Images of ASD, CCSD, PCSD and ICSD are demonstrated from left to right. Results with y
                           0=1.0×104, 5.0×104, 1.0×105 and 5.0×105 photon counts per ray are shown from top to bottom, respectively. Visual appearances of all results are close at high intensity levels. There are more artifacts in ASD and CCSD images than two proposed methods at low intensity levels (1.0×103 and 1.0×104 counts per ray), which can be clearly observed in the top two rows of Fig. 3. Results between two proposed methods are close to each other at all intensity levels. Note that the differences between images of PCSD and ICSD are generally small and become smaller as radiation intensity increases, as shown in 
                           Fig. 4.

Reconstruction performance was evaluated quantitatively using RMSE, as listed in 
                           Table 3. The RMSEs of two proposed methods are close to each other at all intensity levels and are lower than that of ASD and CCSD methods except for ASD at 5.0×105 counts/ray. We also investigated the CNR of ROI for local image qualities of reconstructed images. The results of CNRs are shown in 
                           Table 4. The CNRs of two proposed methods are larger than those of ASD and CCSD methods in general with the exception of ASD at 5.0×105 counts/ray.

The proposed methods were applied onto Cone-Beam CT projection data of a physical CatPhan600 phantom. The detector of the scanner is 512×384 with pixel size 0.776×0.776mm2. The SDD is 1500mm, and the SAD is 1000mm. Projection data of 364 views were collected over a 200-degree orbit. All data were used to reconstruct image by the FDK method as one transverse slice of the image is shown in 
                        Fig. 5 (with resolution 256×256). In our experiments, data of 24, 52 and 91 evenly distributed views were extracted from total data for TV-based iterative reconstruction methods. Images reconstructed by ASD, CCSD, PCSD and ICSD from sparse views of data are shown in 
                        Fig. 6. Generally, images of PCSD and ICSD show better contrast without boosting noise. For four low-contrast small bright objects labeled by blue arrows, PCSD and ICSD recover them very well, while ASD only partially recovers them with 24-view data and CCSD seems to suffer over-smoothing and fails to recover all of them even with 91 views. Another example of a small low-contrast dark object close to the outer ring (labeled by a yellow arrow) also demonstrates the superior image quality reconstructed by the proposed methods with automatic parameter tuning. Images of ICSD seem to be smoother than that of PCSD.

The RMSE changes of reconstructed images at different noise levels were plotted as curves of iterations for ASD, CCSD, PCSD and ICSD (
                        Fig. 7(a)). All curves become stable after 500 iterations. The CCSD method decays very fast at the beginning stage, but often sticks at some higher RMSE levels, especially for low incident intensities, compared to PCSD and ICSD. The two proposed methods achieve the best balance of speed (to reach stability) and image quality (denoted by RMSE). In Fig. 7(b), the time needed for 600 iterations of each method is plotted. Because PCSD and ICSD can skip a certain number of ART operations based on the data error bound, they can save as high as 25% of computational time. It is worth noting that the speeds of two proposed methods are quite close. The slight difference is likely caused by different TV step sizes. Fig. 7 also demonstrates that the different step sizes of TV minimization of the two-stage algorithms may lead to different solutions. For two proposed methods, the TV step-size of PCSD is adjusted according to errors between estimated projection data and observed projection data, while the step-size of ICSD is proportional to image changes caused by POCS update. We further investigated the corresponding step size changes along iterations for the results shown in Fig. 7. As shown in 
                        Fig. 8, the step size 
                           η
                         determined through image difference (ICSD) is slightly higher from that of PCSD, which corresponds to larger RMSEs of ICSD than PCSD. However, the difference of the step size becomes smaller at high intensity levels (low noise). As a result, differences between images of two methods are smaller at high intensity levels as shown in Fig. 4. Nevertheless, these results are pertinent to the current phantom and imaging settings and there may not exist a monotonic relation between TV step sizes of ICSD and PCSD due to different image contents and imaging conditions.

We also compared ART with the relaxed projection (“relaxed ART”) and with the pure projection (“pure ART”) using RMSE curves of Shepp–Logan phantom at different noise levels as shown in 
                        Fig. 9. Relaxed ART generally converges slower than pure ART, which is expected because the relaxation parameter is less than 1. However, relaxed ART can achieve better reconstruction (i.e. lower RMSE) when the noise is high (at 1×104 incident counts). As one goal of low-dose X-ray CT is to lower the incident intensity, relaxed ART is better than pure ART to alleviate the adverse effect of increased noise.

Finally, the proposed algorithms only perform ART when necessary. This leads to reduced numbers of forward and backward projections during reconstruction. The actual numbers reduced depend on specified imaging conditions and setting of algorithms. For 2D experiments (projection with 60 views) in Section 4.1, the actual numbers of ARTs executed by PCSD and ICSD are shown in 
                        Table 5. The average time of one PCSD iteration was 63ms on a Pentium i7 platform with 32GB memory, which included 28ms of ART. Thus, about 45% computational cost per iteration will be saved if ART is not conducted. For direct comparison, the computational time for the same number of iterations are shown in Fig. 7(b). The proposed methods reached the stable solution much faster than ASD. For the CBCT reconstruction of 3D CatPhan600 in Section 4.2, the proposed methods are more efficient. Since the system matrix for 3D reconstruction is too large to store economically, the computation of its elements on the fly takes more time for each forward and backward projection pair. In our implementation, the CBCT computation was accelerated by GPU computing using an NVIDIA GTX 760 GPU. For example, one full PCSD iteration of 54-view data takes 1.92s on average, which include 1.16s of ART. Thus, about 60% computation time can be saved if ART is not executed. The computational time of 3D CBCT reconstruction using different methods is shown in 
                        Table 6. The saving increases from 14% to 28% as the number of projection views increases.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we propose two non-parametric algorithms for CT reconstruction of data with sparse views and/or low incident intensity. Both algorithms adapt the two-stage TV-POCS strategy. In the TV stage, two automatic step-size determination methods are proposed to adaptively adjust steepest descent according to data fidelity fitting in the projection domain and the image domain, respectively. PCSD updates the step size using differences between estimated projections and observed data, while ICSD determines the step size using image changes before and after POCS. In the POCS stage, projection errors are estimated and used to compare with the error bound to decide whether ART will be conducted or not. It can reduce the computational cost significantly at low incident X-ray. In both methods, the step size of steepest descent is updated in the main-loop and used in the following TV optimization.

The feasibility of the proposed methods for CT reconstruction has been evaluated experimentally. The PCSD and ICSD require fewer parameters than ASD and achieve similar, if not better, reconstruction performance. For comparison, the ASD results in this work were obtained using original settings of parameters. We found that its performance can be improved by manually tuning parameters. For example, better performance (RMSE=50.1832 HU and CNR=17.5102) can be achieved for data with 60 projection views and intensity level 1.0×105 counts/ray if the TV step size reducing factor 
                        
                           
                              α

                              e
                              d
                           
                        
                      of the ASD method is changed from 0.95 to 0.89 by trial-and-error. Nevertheless, parameter selection of the ASD method is out of the scope of this paper and further details can be found in [18,20]. In contrast, all parameters in our algorithms can be determined from data without manual tuning and the reconstruction behavior is fully in control.

In addition, we found that the solution of two-stage algorithms (POCS+TV minimization) for constrained TV minimization may depend on the TV step size as demonstrated by Figs. 7 and 8. Strictly speaking, the solution of Eq. (4) should be unique as the TV minimum is tangential with the boundary of the feasible region. The alternation of POCS and TV minimization using different TV step sizes may lead to sub-minimal TV values inside the feasible region, which is not an exact mathematic solution of constrained TV minimization defined in Eq. (4) 
                     [18]. However, this effect seems not to cause any practical problems for reconstruction as shown by reconstructed images (Figs. 2, 3 and 6). In fact, it is corresponding to slightly change the error bound ε in Eq. (4) or β in Eq. (1). Although this interesting phenomenon deserves further investigation, we keep our focus in this work on developing practically automatic step-size determination methods for efficient low-dose CT reconstruction.

One assumption of TV is that target images are piece-wise constant. Although this prior enjoys the convexity for optimization, it restricts the performance of reconstruction methods on images with more textures. X-ray CT reconstruction using priors other than conventional TV has been investigated to improve preservation of fine details [20,32,33]. It is our future plan to extend proposed algorithms on such studies.
