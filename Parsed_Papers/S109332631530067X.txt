                  Humic substances are ubiquitous in the environment and have manifold functions. While their composition is well known, information on the chemical structure and three-dimensional conformation is scarce. Here we describe the Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeler, which is an online tool to generate condensed phase computer models of humic substances (http://somm.boku.ac.at). Many different models can be created that reflect the diversity in composition and conformations of the constituting molecules. To exemplify the modeler, 18 different models are generated based on two experimentally determined compositions, to explicitly study the effect of varying e.g. the amount of water molecules in the models or the pH. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the models, which were subsequently analyzed in terms of structure, interactions and dynamics, linking macroscopic observables to the microscopic composition of the systems. We are convinced that this new tool opens the way for a wide range of in silico studies on soil organic matter.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Soil Organic Matter (SOM) is a key part in the composition of soils and sediments, playing a significant role in adsorption and distribution of plant nutriments, pesticides, and pollutants, and in organic carbon stabilization [1]. However, the SOM composition varies spatially, due to geological and climatic conditions as well as plant cover and is heavily dependent on the utilization of the soil and the age of the soil layer [2–4]. Agriculture [5–8], and especially cover crop [9,10] has a significant effect on the quantity and quality of the SOM. Humic substances (HS) are the dominant constituents in SOM [11,12]. They are structurally very diverse, flexible molecules possessing multiple reactive sites and are crucial for numerous biogeochemical processes [13]. HS have been studied extensively regarding environmental, biochemical and therapeutic properties [14–22], and may also have an impact on atmospheric chemistry through the carbon cycle [11]. Challenges in the extraction and analysis complicate experimental molecular characterizations of HS [3,4]. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy are frequently used to characterize and quantify HS in soil samples [23–26]. As complete experimental data on the chemical and three-dimensional structures of HS are lacking, molecular modeling is an important potential source of such information [27]. Little molecular modeling has been performed on these substances, mostly because of their seemingly random composition [28,29]. However, it has been suggested that HS are formed during a controlled biological degradation of a limited number of compounds or abiotic reactions of biological degradation products [20,30]. The current consensus is that HS are supramolecular structures composed of relatively small molecules with similar characteristics and varying intermolecular interactions [31–33]. Some model compounds have been proposed [13,30,34–37], attempting to represent the HS ensemble by a single average structure. More flexible approaches to simulate humic molecules, taylored to experimental data, were not described so far.

Two automated building tools have previously been described: The SIGNATURE program [38] and a self-assembly algorithm for single, branched 3D molecules based on a fragment database [39]. Both approaches have in common that a single representative structure is to be created, with which computational studies can be conducted. So far, HS were mostly studied in vacuum simulations, or with very few water molecules attached [13,27,35,40–42]. Furthermore, quantum mechanical studies have been performed on proposed models representing typical functional groups or fragments of HS [35,43–46].

Here, we demonstrate the use of the GROMOS force field, optimized for condensed phase use, for molecular dynamics simulations of SOM. We have created an online tool, which uses a building-block database and assembles condensed-phase models representative of compositional data from experimental analyses of HS samples. Depending on the amount of available experimental data on the chemical composition, the modeler can aim to reproduce only the fraction of carbon vs. nitrogen in the models, or it can reproduce the experimentally determined abundances of various functional groups [3,47,48]. Condensed-phase systems are more representative of the aggregation state of HS than vacuum models [13]. The created model contains a user-defined number of HS molecules, water, and ions. The assembly of the selected building blocks is performed randomly; thus a multitude of systems can be created, which are all representative of the same experimental data. The initial building blocks were created based on previously proposed models [13,35,37] and additional building blocks can be readily added to the database. The generated models can subsequently be used to study e.g. thermodynamic properties at a molecular level in a multitude of ways.

@&#METHODS@&#

The modeler uses a database of currently 34 organic fragments called building blocks, to generate the SOM models. The concept of building blocks is commonly used in biomolecular simulations, which use amino acids as building blocks for proteins or nucleotides for DNA. The SOM building blocks were derived by splitting up model compounds described in the literature [13,35,37]. A list of the building blocks and their chemical structures can be found in the Supplementary material. They vary strongly in size and chemical composition. Some include aromatic ring systems, some include nitrogen and/or sulfur atoms. They can have one or more of the following functional groups: Carbonyl-C, Carboxyl-C, O-aryl-C, Aryl-C, Di-O-Alkyl-C, O-Alkyl-C, Methoxyl-C and Alkyl-C. The parameters that are needed to describe the interactions and dynamics of the building blocks, such as atom mass, partial charge and van der Waals interaction parameters, as well as covalent parameters such as bond length, angle width, and torsional profiles were derived from the GROMOS force field, parameter set 54A7 [49]. This force field was parameterized to reproduce the free energy of solvation in water and hydrophobic solvents for a variety of functional groups that are also included in the SOM building blocks [50]. As such, it is expected to appropriately describe both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in heterogeneous systems. The set of building blocks can readily be extended in future work.

The Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeler consists of two parts. The frontend web application is written in javascript and uses the AJAX technique to communicate with php scripts on the server without reloading the page. It is used to submit the input parameters for the model generation. The input is stored in a MySQL database and used by the modeler backend to generate the corresponding model, which will then be displayed in the results section of the web application. If a name and password are provided, the model can be accessed for two weeks. For the generated model, a GROMOS coordinate file as well as the corresponding topology file can be downloaded. Additionally, a pdb coordinate file of the model and a pdf file with a modeling report can be downloaded. The report shows the user-specified input in comparison to the actual properties of the generated model and gives a score on how well the modeler was able to represent the input with the available building blocks. The files can also be viewed online, together with a 3D representation of the generated model, excluding the ions and water.

The backend modeler is a php application which takes the input from the MySQL database and produces a model representing the input as well as possible. The modeling algorithm is as follows. Until the maximum amount of building blocks is reached, for each building block in the database, the difference between the input fractions and the fractions calculated for a model upon addition of the building block is determined and the building block with the lowest difference is taken. The user-specified pH is reflected by selecting the proper fraction of protonated and deprotonated carboxylic groups, assuming a uniform pK
                        a value of 4.7. After all building blocks have been selected, they are randomly connected to assemble the desired number of HS molecules and these molecules are subsequently energy minimized using GROMOS [51]. After the energy minimization, they are randomly placed in a cubic, periodic simulation box, avoiding overlap between the individual molecules. Additionally, the user-defined amount of simple point charge (SPC) water molecules [52] and a number of water molecules corresponding to the amount of counter ions required is placed in the simulation box. Finally, if counter ions are desired, the excess water molecules are replaced by the selected ion type to create a system with an overall neutral charge. The GROMOS coordinate file, the GROMOS topology file as well as the modeling report are then stored in the MySQL database and ready to be retrieved via the web application.

Using the Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeller, 18 models were created as outlined in Table 1
                         and subsequently subjected to molecular dynamcs simulations. All simulations were performed using the GROMOS11 molecular simulation package [51]. The initial models represent the requested systems under periodic boundary conditions and at an artificially low density of approximately 500kgm−3. An offline equilibration was performed in 18 discrete steps during which the temperature was slowly increased and the box volume reduced. In the first step, random velocities were assigned to all constituting particles, sampled from a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at 60K. The temperature was subsequently increased by 30K in following steps. At every temperature a 20ps simulation at constant volume was followed by a 500ps simulation at a constant pressure of 1atm, during which the box volume could adjust. For the last two equilibration steps, the temperature was kept at 300K and for the last step the simulation time was increased to 2ns. Production simulations were subsequently performed for 10ns, during which the coordinates were stored to disc every 0.5ps. A weak coupling with a relaxation time of 0.1ps for the temperature and 0.5ps for the pressure was used to keep the temperature and pressure constant at 300K and 1atm, respectively [53]. The isothermal compressibility was estimated at 4.575×10−4 (kJmol−1
                        nm−3)−1 
                        [54], and pressure scaling was applied anisotropically, i.e. using separate scaling factors for the x-, y- and z-directions. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain the bond lengths to their optimal values with a relative geometric accuracy of 10−4, allowing for a time step of 2fs [55]. A molecular pair-list was generated using a triple-range cutoff [56]. Nonbonded interactions up to a short range of 0.8nm were calculated at every time step from a pair-list that was updated every 5 steps. Interactions up to a long-range cutoff of 1.4nm were calculated at pair-list updates and kept constant in between. A reaction-field contribution [57] was added to the electrostatic interactions and forces to account for a homogeneous medium with a dielectric permittivity of 61 outside the cutoff sphere [58].

The simulations were analysed in terms of the structure and dynamics as well as the observation of molecular interactions, using the gromos++ set of analysis programs [59]. For complex, microscopically heterogeneous systems, structure is best described in terms of pair-correlation functions or radial distribution functions. The radial distribution function gIJ

The presence of hydrogen bonds was monitored using a geometric criterion. A hydrogen bond was considered to be formed if the hydrogen-acceptor distance was maximally 0.25nm and the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle was at least 135°.

Hydrophobicity was quantified by calculating the free energy of inserting a methane particle into the model systems. For this we used snapshots sampled at every 2.5ps of the 10ns simulations and the Widom particle insertion method [60]. The test particle was placed at 100,000 different random positions throughout a given snapshot of the simulation trajectory and the interaction energy, ES
                        , was determined. The solvation free energy is calculated according to Eq. (4) where kB
                         is the Boltzmann constant, and T and V are the temperature and volume of the system, respectively. The angular brackets involve an average over all insertion trials and snapshots.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeler is designed to create condensed-phase models of SOM in a two-step process. The first step being the online modeling tool and the second step an offline thermalization, compression, and equilibration of the model. Fig. 1
                      schematically describes the steps of the online modeling process. The user specifies the total number of building blocks, the number of building blocks per molecule and the amount of water molecules that the system should contain. Additionally, the user can specify whether counter ions should be added and if so, select sodium, calcium, or magnesium ions. These options define the size of the created model. To determine the composition, three different modes are available:
                        
                           1.
                           The basic input allows to specify the mass fraction of carbon and nitrogen in the model and the pH. A random seed needs to be provided, which will affect the order in which the building blocks are assembled into molecules as well as the placement of the molecules in the computational box.

In the advanced input the distribution of the carbon atoms over functional groups such as Carbonyl-C, Carboxyl-C, O-Aryl-C, Aryl-C, Di-O-Alkyl-C, O-Alkyl-C, Methoxyl-C and Alkyl-C, is additionally specified. Fractions can be explicitly set to zero, or if no experimental information is available wildcards can be used.

The random input does not allow to specify any criteria for the composition of the model and will produce a random model of the given size based on the specified random seed.

The generated model has, because of the automatic placement of the molecules, a very low density of about 500kgm−3, which can easily be increased in an offline equilibration. During these molecular dynamics simulations, the temperature is gradually increased and the size of the simulation box is reduced. The resulting system can then be used for further simulations, e.g. to study the structure and dynamics of the particular composition or adsorption processes.

In order to test the online modeling tool, eighteen models were generated with varying size, composition, molecular structure, and initial placement in the simulation box (Table 1). An example of a molecule created by the modeler is displayed in Fig. 1, and examples of complete systems are shown in Figs. 1 and 2
                        . The target compositions that were used as input as well as the resulting compositions for each of the final models are available in the Supplementary material, Table S1. The compositions 1 (input for models 1–5) and 2 (input for models 6–10) are based on the analyses of Ref. [3]. Composition 3 and 4 target a high carboxyl and a high aryl fraction, respectively. For the models r1 and r2, the random input method was used. Overall, the chemical composition of the models reproduce the target values quite well. An exception is the amount of methoxygroups, which remains significantly below the experimentally determined quantity. Apparently, the diversity of the current set of building blocks is not yet sufficient to fulfill this requirement. Still, the root-mean-square deviation from the target value amounts to 3.7% for composition 1 and 1.7% for composition 2, averaged over the models and the functional groups. Compositions 3 and 4 were artificially created to study the effect of high carboxyl or high aryl content specifically. It was not expected that these artificial target values could be met exactly, but increased levels of the functional groups are indeed observed in models 11 and 12. The effect of having the same building-block composition, but connected into different molecules, was tested with the models 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5, which vary only in the random seed used to assemble and place the molecules. The size of models ranged from 50 to 500 building blocks with an individual molecular size of 5 building blocks (except model 5, in which individual molecules consisted of 10 building blocks). The systems were solvated by 1000 water molecules, except models 9 and 10, where 3000 and 500 water molecules were used, respectively, to test the effect of different levels of solvation. In order to test the effect of different pH levels, the composition of models 7 and 8 reflected pH 1 and 10, respectively. The other models had compositions corresponding to pH 7. Finally, Ca2+ counter ions were added to the models to ensure neutrality.

All models were equilibrated to condense the simulation boxes, as described in Section 2. The total equilibration time was 5.18ns. Fig. 2A shows model 3 before and after the equilibration with increased density and reduced box size. The course of the density throughout the equilibration process is shown in Fig. 2B. The density rapidly increases and stabilizes after ∼4ns. Even though the density did not further increase, the system was equilibrated for an additional nanosecond allowing the molecules to adapt to the new box size. After the following production phase of 10ns, the systems were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bonds, diffusion, and solvation. Table 2
                         summarizes the volume and density of all systems. Additionally, the ratio between the number of water molecules and the total number of heavy atoms in the system, χ(H2O) is shown. The average density for models 1–5 is represented graphically as a function of χ(H2O) in Fig. 2C. For models at identical values of χ(H2O) the average values are given.

The models with the lowest density are models 1 and 4. While the low density of model 1 is not surprising as it is a very small system with a relatively large amount of water molecules, the low density of the large model 4 could indicate that the molecules were not able to interact as tightly as in the other models. As its composition is the same as model 5, which has a higher density, this may be an artifact of the random positioning of the molecules in the box, leading to a different distribution inside the box. Note, however, that the density of models 3.1–5, which have the same composition and only differ in the assembled molecules and their placement, shows remarkably little fluctuations. The average density of these models amounts to 1389kgm−3, which compares very well to experimental bulk density estimates for this composition [3] of 1.38×103
                        kgm−3. Similarly, model 6, which has a different chemical composition, but a comparable water content as models 3.1–5, shows a density of 1384kgm−3, with a similar experimental bulk density [3] of 1.38×103
                        kgm−3. The model systems with the highest density are models 10, 11, r1 and r2. Model 10 has a very low number of water molecules and model 11 is the model with a high carboxyl fraction. It is interesting that the randomly generated models converged to a higher density than most of the other models.

In order to analyze the interactions of the HS molecules, the average number of hydrogen bonds was determined as formed between the solute (HS) molecules and/or between the HS and water molecules, respectively. As a reference, each building block was simulated entirely solvated in water for 1ns and from these simulations, the average number of hydrogen bonds to water at infinite dilution was determined. This gives a maximum number of hydrogen bonds for each building block. Based on the composition of the models, the maximum number of hydrogen bonds per building block were summed up to give the maximum amount of hydrogen bonds to water that a system is theoretically able to form at infinite dilution. The results from the hydrogen bond analysis can be seen in Table 3
                        . In terms of hydrogen bonds to the solute, all systems show values proportional to their size. A significant difference in the average values can be observed between compositions 1 and 2. Models with composition 2 form on average 0.17 fewer hydrogen bonds per building block than models with composition 1. The values for the various instantiations of model 3 fluctuate less than the differences observed between the two compositions. Note that the random models r1 and r2 show the largest average number of solute–solute hydrogen bonds of the various models. This possibly offers an explanation for the tight packing and high density of these models. In terms of hydrogen bonds with water, the systems closest to the theoretical maximum are those with the highest amount of water, namely models 1 and 9. Model 10 shows, in agreement with the low water content, fewer hydrogen bonds to the solvent. An effect of the pH can also be observed as the model with a pH of 1 (model 7) shows a significantly lower amount of hydrogen bonds to water. This is due to the absence of deprotonated building blocks. The difference between the models at pH 7 and model 8 (pH 10) is less striking because the difference between pH 7 and 10 is in the order of one to two protonated groups.

Diffusion coefficients for water and calcium ions are shown in Table 2. Note that the diffusion coefficients span three orders of magnitude in the various simulations. The self-diffusion coefficient for pure SPC water is 4.2×10−9
                        m2
                        s−1 
                        [61]. The diffusion coefficient for water in the SOM models is higher if more water molecules are present in the system. Model 1, for example, has water diffusion coefficient in the range of pure water as the portion of the SOM component in this system is relatively small, but homogeneously dispersed through the simulation box. Similarly, models 2 and 9 show relatively high diffusion coefficients as χ(H2O) is still high. The model with pH 1 has also a relatively high diffusion coefficient, which is most likely due to the fact that there are no ions present in the model. The diffusion coefficients for the calcium ions are also proportional to χ(H2O). In the models with low χ(H2O) the ions cannot move as much as in the more diluted systems.

Radial distribution functions (gIJ
                        (r)) were calculated for each model for water–water, calcium–water, carboxyl–water, calcium–carboxyl, and carboxyl–calcium groups. From gIJ
                        (r), the amount of molecules in the first solvation shell was calculated. The results for models 1–5 are shown in Fig. 3
                        C and for the other models in Table S2. Models 1, 2, and 11 show for water a similar solvation as bulk water, with approximately 4 water molecules surrounding each water molecule. Similarly, the calcium ions and carboxylate groups are more solvated in these models, possibly also explaining the higher diffussivity of Ca2+ in these models. Owing to the low amount of solute in model 1, the carboxyl groups do not interact significantly with the Ca2+ ions. In contrast, the two largest models (4 and 5) as well as the model with very few solvent molecules (10) and the one with a large carboxyl fraction (model 11) show a high amount of carboxyl–calcium interactions. The number of carboxyl groups in the first solvation shell of the calcium ions is approximately twice the number of calcium ions in the first solvation shells of carboxylate groups. This indicates the formation of calcium-mediated bridges between (on average) two carboxylate groups. As the average number of carboxylate groups surrounding the calcium ions does not exceed 1.3, some calcium ions remain unbound to the humic substances as well. Details of a bridging and fully solvated Ca2+ ion are displayed in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. The values of NIJ
                         seem remarkably robust with respect to the composition (c.f. models 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5) and depend mostly on the water content of the systems.

The free energy of inserting a hydrophobic probe (methane) into the models (ΔGS
                        ) was calculated using the particle insertion method [60]. By comparing calculated values to the insertion of methane in pure SPC water, ΔGS
                        (water)=8.8kJmol−1, the adsorption free energy for methane can be computed, using Eq. (5). ΔGads
                         is given in the last column of Table 2 and can be considered as a measure for the hydrophobicity of the models.

The models 1, 2, and 3, with a relatively high value of χ(H2O), show positive adsorption free energies. This indicates, that the inserted hydrophobic particle is mostly in water. In these models, the HS molecules are rather diluted and form, if at all, scarce hydrophobic patches. The different placement of the molecules in models 3.1–5 due to the different random seed did not significantly influence the particle insertion with an average of ΔGS
                        (SOM)=9.2±1.0kJmol−1. The insertion of methane into models 4 and 5 shows favorable adsorption, indicating a mostly hydrophobic environment. This is explained by the fact that these systems have more HS molecules for the same amount of water molecules. Therefore, the HS molecules are packed more tightly, forming an attractive hydrophobic environment for nonpolar species. The charged and polar groups in the SOM gather most of the water molecules around them and form cation and water mediated bridges (see above).

Models 6–10 have a different composition of humic substances than models 1–5, which results in different adsorption free energies. For example, the low value for model 6 indicates that the composition provides a more hydrophobic environment than composition 1 with a similar value of χ(H2O) at the same pH (models 3.x). This implies that the HS molecules form more continuous hydrophobic areas with the water concealed to pockets. However, the favorable values of models 4 and 5 are not reached, because the systems have less HS content with the same amount of water. Model 7 has pH 1 and the adsorption free energy of methane increases to almost the value of pure water compared to model 6 with pH 7. Thus, at a very low pH, the HS molecules are not able to interact so tightly and are not as strongly hydrated as at a higher pH. Therefore, the water molecules are more distributed throughout the system leading to an unfavorable environment for methane. Model 8 with pH 10 is favorable for methane, suggesting that the deprotonated HS molecules are able to pack together more tightly forming an accessible hydrophobic environment. This is enhanced by the increasing amount of cation bridges formed between deprotonated HS species. All systems beside the one at pH 1 contain counter ions and carboxylate groups, which are directly involved in bridging between two or more HS species. This leads to a tighter packing of the HS content and the creation of hydrophobic areas in the systems. As the difference between pHs 7 and 10 is in the range of a few protonated molecules, the difference in the adsorption free energy of methane between models 6 and 8 is small.

Finally, the two randomly generated models r1 and r2 have a more hydrophobic environment than the compositions based on values from the literature. This indicates that both systems can favorably adsorb methane. As these systems include all building blocks from the database, unlike the other models limited by a specific composition in terms of carbon, nitrogen and functional groups, they have more possibilities to interact, leading to a higher density and hydrophobicity.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Previously, models of humic substances focused on the creation of a single average structure which represents the chemical properties of a wide variety of unknown molecules. By taking such models [13,35,37] to generate a set of building blocks, our modeling tool is able to create a large assortment of different molecules in a condensed phase system representing a composition derived from experiments. Therefore, multiple models of the same experimentally determined composition can be created and validated to achieve statistical significance. Additionally, variations in terms of composition, water and cation content, size, and pH can be easily introduced. The online tool offers a convenient and modern interface to the modeling program, which allows to queue multiple model generation requests, store previously generated models for some amount of time, as well as directly visually inspect the created model on the web page in terms of statistics and 3D structure. Model generation is relatively quick and takes in the order of a few minutes, depending on the size. The models that are generated by the modeler, represent initial structures at unphysically low densities, which can be compacted appropriately in subsequent (offline) molecular dynamics simulations. The modeler provides the necessary files to perform such simulations. Further application of molecular dynamics simulations allow for the generation of conformational ensembles, which may be used for statistical mechanical analyses of the average structures, interactions, and dynamics. As such, the Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeler opens new perspectives to apply modern molecular simulation techniques, commonly used in material sciences and computational biology, to realistic modeling of soil organic matter.

The analysis of the eighteen generated HS models demonstrated that the properties of the systems such as hydrogen bonds, diffusion, hydrophobicity or structure of the solvation shell are affected by the model parameters. Models with a high χ(H2O) showed diffusion and solvation similar to pure water. On the other hand, models with low water content showed slower diffusion properties and stronger bridging interactions of the HS moieties. In turn, the bridging interactions between the HS moieties directly influence the hydrophobicity of the models, resulting in different adsorption properties for small hydrophobic molecules. The achieved results with respect to differences in the models document that it is possible to shed light on diffusion or adsorption processes of pollutants or plant nutrients in SOM at a molecular scale. Additionally, the exact constitution of the HS molecules, which can be varied by changing the random seed, does not have a significant impact on the overall properties of the system.

Generally, numerous future studies can be envisioned, such as the direct calculation of adsorption properties of pollutants or studies addressing the interactions of SOM with soil minerals. The well-known ClayFF force field for minerals [62] is based on the same water model as used in the current simulations (Simple Point Charge (SPC) water), suggesting that the force fields may be compatible, although this will need to be evaluated in future work.

We are confident that this new tool can be used as starting point for a large amount of different in silico studies in the field of soil organic matter and in particular humic substances.
