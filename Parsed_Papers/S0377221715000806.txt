                  In selecting the preferred course of action, decision makers are often uncertain about one or more probabilities of interest. The experimental literature has ascertained that this uncertainty (ambiguity) might affect decision makers’ preferences. Then, the decision maker might wish to incorporate ambiguity aversion in the analysis. We investigate the modeling ambiguity attitudes in the solution of decision analysis problems through functionals well-established in the decision theory literature. We obtain the multiple-event problems for subjective expected utility, smooth ambiguity and maximin decision makers. This allows us to establish the conditions under which these alternative decision makers face equivalent problems. Results for certainty equivalents and risk premia in the presence of both risk and ambiguity aversion are obtained. A recent generalization of the classical Arrow–Pratt quadratic approximation allows us to quantify the portions of a premium due to risk–PLXINSERT-, and to ambiguity-aversion. The numerical implementation of the objective functions is addressed, showing that all functionals can be estimated at no additional burden through Monte Carlo simulation. The well known Carter Racing case study is addressed quantitatively to demonstrate the findings.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The modern decision making cycle, conceived by the seminal work of Howard (1966) sets forth a systematic sequence of transparent steps for the solution of decision analysis problems (see also Clemen, 1997; Howard, 1988a, p.680; Howard, 2007, chap. 3). A key-step is the development of a quantitative model (Dillon, Paté-Cornell, and Guikema, 2003). However, lack of data or conflicting expert opinions might lead decision makers to face ambiguity (Ben-Tal, Bertsimas, and Brown, 2010; Ellsberg, 1961; Nau, 2007, chap. 3). That is, a decision maker might not be able to specify a unique distribution for the involved uncertainties.

Moreover, psychological experiments, originated by the famous Ellsberg’s paradoxes (Ellsberg, 1961), reveal that subjects exhibit alternative attitudes toward ambiguity. These attitudes vary from aversion, to neutrality and, more rarely, to proneness (see Stecher, Shields, and Dickhaut, 2011; Trautmann, Vieider, and Wakker, 2011).

Research in decision theory has developed axiomatizations leading to corresponding functionals that capture these alternative attitudes (see Fishburn, 1989; Gilboa and Marinacci, 2013; Nau, 2007; Smith and von Winterfeldt, 2004; Wakker, 2008 for overviews). The works of Wald (1950) and Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) formalize the minimax functional, which leads to objective functions that capture the strongest aversion to ambiguity [we refer to Ben-Tal et al. (2010) for a thorough overview on robust optimization]. The classical subjective utility functional expresses ambiguity neutrality (Cerreia-Vioglio, Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Montrucchio, 2013). In between, we find axiomatizations for smoothly varying ambiguity attitudes leading to the so-called two-stage functionals (Anscombe and Aumann, 1963; Davis and Paté-Cornell, 1994; Ergin and Gul, 2009; Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji, 2005; Nau, 2006; 2007; Segal, 1987). Among these, the Klibanoff et al. (2005) functional stands out for several of its properties. Its tractability makes the functional widely used nowadays in applications (Hansen, 2007; Ju and Miao, 2012). It encompasses the minimax and expected utility functionals as limiting cases.

Consider now a decision maker facing a multiple event problem in a real life application. She builds an influence diagram or decision tree to support her selection. Following standard practice, in the case she is not capable of assigning a unique probability distribution, she assesses a prior (posterior) over the possible distributions and uses Monte Carlo simulation to quantify uncertainty and to obtain the expected utilities. However, because of ambiguity, she might feel that this modeling would not reflect her attitudes toward this problem fully. This is equivalent to posing comparative statics questions about what optimal policies result when ambiguity attitudes are factored into the analysis. Answering these questions requires solving the decision model by implementing a functional that takes ambiguity attitudes into account. This then leads to a series of implementation questions, concerning both practical and conceptual aspects, which range from result interpretation to determining whether the modeling of ambiguity attitudes nest naturally over current practice.

This work contributes in this direction by exploring the quantitative implications of modeling ambiguity attitudes in decision support models. Because our goal is a comparative statics, we do not develop a new model for ambiguity, but rather consider an analyst wishing to make a comparative exercise using functionals consolidated in the literature. We derive the multiple-event problems faced by a von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM), a subjective expected utility (SEU), smooth ambiguity averse (KMM), and a minimax decision maker. We show that vNM, SEU and smooth ambiguity problems coincide under ambiguity neutrality (a taste feature) and under independence in the second order probability distribution (a state-of-knowledge feature). However, these two conditions are not enough to guarantee that a maximin problem is equivalent to the first three problems.

In decision analysis, certainty equivalents and risk premia are often the quantities of interest. The literature has ascertained that, under ambiguity, decision makers may be willing to pay an ambiguity premium
                     (Hogarth and Kunreuther, 1992). We exploit a recent extension of the Arrow–Pratt quadratic approximation (Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Ruffino, 2013; Pratt, 1964), to obtain a general result that quantifies the ambiguity premium in multiple event problems.

Revisiting the classic Ellsberg’s paradox allows us to illustrate these findings analytically. Because in complex decision support problems are not usually analytically tractable, we also discuss the Monte Carlo estimation of the vNM, SEU, smooth ambiguity and minimax functionals. The proposed estimators permit to obtain these functionals from the output of subroutines built in common decision analysis software, thus, at no additional burden with respect to standard practice.

We then apply the findings to the well known Carter racing case study of Brittain and Sitkin (1989). The investigation shows that by modeling alternative ambiguity attitudes the decision maker gathers a wide range of additional managerial insights while in the presence of uncertainty in probability. She can critically question whether her choice is robust when full credit to the involved uncertainties and her attitude toward them are displayed in the model. Through the quadratic approximation the decision maker is enabled to quantify the premium she is willing to pay, should she opt for the option suggested by an ambiguity-averse functional.

The standard decision theoretic framework à la Savage (1954) consists of a state space S, an event algebra Σ defined over S, and the space X of consequences. States are ex-post verifiable, that is, they are observations (urns’ drawings, earthquakes, machines’ failures, and the like). Here we assume that consequences are real numbers, that is, 
                           
                              X
                              ⊆
                              R
                           
                         (the main example being amounts of money).

In Savage’s framework, acts are Σ-measurable maps

                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 
                                    f
                                    :
                                    S
                                    →
                                    X
                                 
                              
                           
                        from the state space to the consequence space that associates a consequence to each state. Denote by 
                           F
                         the collection of all acts. decision maker’s preferences among acts are represented by a binary relation ≿ defined over 
                           F
                        .

Consider then the measurable space (S, Σ) and let Δ(S) be the collection of all (countably additive) probability measures p: Σ → [0, 1]. Denote by σ(Δ(S)) the sigma algebra of subsets of Δ(S) generated by the maps p↦p(E) for each E ∈ Σ and each p ∈ Δ(S). We denote by Δ
                        2(S) the collection of all (countably additive) probability measures μ: σ(Δ(S)) → [0, 1]. In Savage’s theory, bets play a special role among acts because through them subjective probabilities are elicited. In particular, given any two consequences x≻y, denote by xEy the bet on event E, which pays the best consequence x if E occurs and y otherwise. Given any two events E and F, if the decision maker prefers lottery xFy over lottery xEy reveals that the decision maker considers F more likely than E.

The two stage structure foresees the decision maker posing two sets of probability models.

Suppose that the decision maker knows that observations s are generated by a probability model p ∈ Δ(S) that belongs to a given subset M of Δ(S). Each such p represents aleatory uncertainty, that is, the inherent randomness that observations feature. In other words, the decision maker posits a model space M in addition to the observation space S.

We can then take the “aleatory” information M as a primitive and enrich the standard Savage framework with this datum: the decision maker knows that the true model p that generates observations belongs to M. In terms of the basic preference ≿, this translates into the requirement that betting behavior is consistent with datum M. Let F and E be two events and p(F) and p(E) and xFy and xEy bets on events F and E, with x≻y. Then, assume that

                                    E
                                    y
                                 
                              
                           
                        That is, if all models in M deem F more likely than E, the decision maker accordingly prefers to bet on F than on E, that is, he deems F more likely than E.

                         A key feature of this model is that it achieves a separation between the perception of ambiguity, identified as a characteristic of the decision maker’s subjective beliefs, and the attitude toward ambiguity, identified as a characteristic of the decision maker’s tastes. Ambiguity aversion is captured by the concavity of ϕ, while ambiguity neutrality corresponds to a linear ϕ. In this latter case, criterion (7) reduces to the classical SEU representation (3).

As such, it can be seen as representing attitudes toward the epistemic uncertainty that decision makers experience when dealing with alternative possible probabilistic models p that may generate observations. The utility function u represents attitudes toward aleatory uncertainty.

Epistemic uncertainty cumulates with aleatory uncertainty that any nontrivial probabilistic model p features. This combination determines in criterion (7) the ambiguity that decision makers face in ranking acts. Attitudes toward ambiguity are captured by the function ϕ . In particular, attitudes toward aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are equal, that is, 
                           
                              u
                              =
                              v
                              ,
                           
                         if and only if ϕ is linear. In other words, their coincidence amounts to ambiguity neutrality. In contrast, the function ϕ is concave if and only if v is a concave transformation of u, that is, decision makers feature (as plausible) a higher aversion to epistemic than to aleatory uncertainty. In particular, the quantities

These observations highlight the analytical tractability of the Klibanoff et al. (2005) functional, which allows one to apply to the study of ambiguity the well developed machinery for dealing with risk(Ju and Miao, 2012, p. 564).

We consider a decision maker selecting the best course of action in a multiple event problem. The decision maker employs a decision support model for constructing the Savage mapping (1) and identifying the (plausible) scenarios that link acts to the end states (Kirkwood, 1993; Shachter, 2007). We write the expected utility of act f as

                     In multiple-event problems, the decision support model factorizes the probability distribution pf
                     (q) in conditional probabilities of the events that lead to the initial node to the end consequence (Kirkwood, 1993; Park and Darwiche, 2004). Fixed f, one calls scenario a combination of outcomes that lead from the initial node to the end-consequence. Once strategy f is selected, a consequence is reached after the realization of r random variables

The results in (19) and (20) encompass what is done in the practice, where we input the utilities and the conditional probability tables at their base case values and the decision support software computes the expected utilities (payoffs) of the available strategies after performing the necessary probabilistic manipulations (e.g., using the folding back method in decision trees). When regarded as a function of probabilities and utilities, the functional in Eq. (20) is a generalization of Bayesian network polynomials, called decision network polynomial in Borgonovo and Tonoli (2014). We refer to Borgonovo and Tonoli (2014) for a thorough discussion of associated mathematical properties.

Suppose that probabilities are not given. Then, we exit the vNM framework. However, the decision maker might be willing (and this is often done in the practice, see Felli and Hazen (2004)) to specify a second order probability distribution over p, namely, μ(p). Here, we enter the subjective (or Bayesian) expected utility theoretical framework [Section 2.2]. As for probabilities, Eq. (19) does not relate pf
                     (q) and its factorization into

                                              problems vNM, SEU and KMM are numerically equivalent.

Problem Maximin is never equivalent to a vNM nor to a SEU nor to a KMM problem.

Concerning assumption (i), we have the following sufficient condition (the necessary algebraic manipulations are in Appendix A).

                        Example 3
                        Consider the following decision problem. A decision maker has to decide whether to license a new plant. The plant failure probability can be computed from the logical configuration of two components in parallel, that is, we register system failure if both components fail, otherwise the system is capable to perform the required mission. The components are assumed to be identical. Then, the probability of the consequence

                           . Thus, assumption (i) is violated for this consequence and Theorem 1 does not apply. In particular, it is the assumption of independence at the epistemic (second order) distribution level which is violated, due to the fact that the two probabilities are perfectly correlated. The reason is that, if the two components are assumed to be identical, then the same number p has to be used to compute the system reliability in the presence of epistemic uncertainty, as per the seminal work of Apostolakis and Kaplan (1981).

As for assumption (ii), experimental evidence demonstrates that decision makers display preferences (aversion, usually) for ambiguity. Thus, the assumption

                      might not be realistic. Finally, item B in Theorem 1 suggests that a completely ambiguity averse decision maker faces a problem which is never numerically equivalent to that of either a vNM, or KMM or SEU decision maker.

The concepts of certainty equivalent and risk premium are central in decision analysis. Our goal, in this section, is to investigate them under smooth ambiguity aversion. “The certainty equivalent for an alternative is the certain(monetary)amount that is equally preferred to the alternative” (Kirkwood, 2002, chap. 2, p. 19). The corresponding risk premium is the difference between the expected value of the alternative and its certainty equivalent.

The expression in (9) defines the traditional certainty equivalent for strategy f under risk and distribution p. When p is not a singleton, the certainty equivalent that includes both ambiguity and risk aversion is defined as (Hansen, 2007; Klibanoff et al., 2005):

                     C(f) represents the overall certainty equivalent that accounts for both attitudes toward ambiguity, through the function v( · ), and toward risk, through the traditional u( · ). Observe that C(f) as well as c(f, p) have monetary units. Although a monetary representation of certainty equivalents is more meaningful, we can also define the certainty equivalent in utils as

As mentioned, C(f) in (28) expresses both the ambiguity and risk attitudes of the decision maker. We could then argue that the associated premium includes a portion related to risk aversion and a portion related to ambiguity aversion. To investigate this assertion, we consider a decision maker who is both risk and ambiguity neutral. We have the following (see Appendix A for the proof).

                     Π(f) is an overall premium that includes both ambiguity and risk aversion. To separate them, at least approximately, we can resort to a recent result generalizing the Arrow–Pratt certainty equivalent under ambiguity (Maccheroni et al., 2013). The quadratic approximation finds it motivation in Finance, as a generalization of Markowitz’s portfolio selection model. Here, let w be initial wealth and wf
                      the wealth added by investment f. As Maccheroni et al. (2013) show, under standard differentiability assumptions on the functions u and v, the certainty equivalent in (26) is approximated by:

The results in (32)–(34) offer a natural way to perform comparative statics between risk and ambiguity aversion. For quadratic risk-and-ambiguity premia in decision analysis problems we obtain the following result (the proof is in Appendix A; for notation simplicity, in the remainder we write λu
                      or λv
                      instead of λu
                     (w) and λv
                     (w)).

                     That is, Π(f) is determined by the sum of two terms, one proportional to the difference between the aleatory variance and epistemic variance through λu
                     , and one proportional to the epistemic variance through λv
                     .

To illustrate, we revisit the classic Ellsberg (1961) paradox from a decision analysis perspective. A decision maker is selecting among acts f, g, f′ and g′, whose payoffs depends on three mutually exclusive events R, B and Y that correspond to drawing a red or black or yellow ball from the same urn. Table 1
                      reports the payoffs incurred in each state.

The state space is

                     Typically, at this stage, we would perform a one-way sensitivity analysis to study the behavior of the preferred alternative as a function of p. Some simple manipulation shows that, for any possible value assigned to u(100) and u(0) with u(100) > u(0),

                        
                           (i)
                           alternatives f and g are dominated by f′ and g′ for all values of p;

if p < 1/3 (resp.,   > 1/3) then f′ has an expected utility greater (resp., smaller) than g′, while if 
                                 
                                    p
                                    =
                                    1
                                    /

                               then f′ and g′ have the same expected utility.

This analysis is usually displayed as a one-way sensitivity plot. The plot would indicate to the decision maker that, should she believe that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1/3, then f′ should be the preferred alternative, while g′ would be preferred, if she believed that 1/3 ≤ p ≤ 2/3. However, this analysis does not provide a definitive recommendation, because 
                        
                           p
                           ˜
                        
                      is not given.

Instead, the subjective expected utility, smooth ambiguity and minimax frameworks, allow us to identify the preferred alternative, provided that we assign a second order distribution over p. In Ellsberg’s problem, p coincides with a possible composition of the urn. If the decision maker does not favor some composition over the other, then, by a symmetry argument, she can regard all possible compositions as equally likely:

                     Thus, for a classical SEU decision maker, alternatives f′ and g′ are equivalent.

On the side, we observe that, by Theorem 1, this result would also be obtained by a vNM decision maker assigning

                      This occurs not because we are certain about the probabilities of B and Y, but because of the opposite sign of the covariance in (36) with respect to the individual variances that accompany the same consequences [the reader is referred to Appendix A for the analytical details].

In realistic applications involving uncertainty in distribution, analytical results such as those obtained for the Ellsberg paradox become soon out of reach. Then, uncertainty is propagated using Monte Carlo simulation (see Chick, 2001 for an overview).

The objective functions of interest are multivariate expectations (i.e., multidimensional integrals). Therefore, they fall naturally within the scope of Monte Carlo estimation, with the traditional estimation error decreasing at the rate

We present the estimators as part of the algorithmic procedure summarized in Table 2

                        As for step 1, as suggested by Pearl (1988), one can show that the procedure involved in the assessment of P[P(A)
                           
                              =
                            
                           p] is no different from that involved in the assessment of P(A) and, moreover, that the very information used for calculating P(A) is sufficient for calculating the confidence interval associated with the statement P(A)
                           
                              =
                            
                           p. Typically, one assesses a prior and, if possible, uses data or available evidence to update such distribution. This process is standard in several disciplines, among which the reliability and risk analysis one (Martz and Waller, 1991). Several methods have been developed for the consistent elicitation of probabilities. We recall the important class of scoring rules (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007; Jose, Nau, and Winkler, 2008; Nau, 1985). We also refer to Cooke (1991) and Aspinall (2010) for further discussion on expert elicitation.
                     
                  

First step of the analysis is to generate a sample that follows the second order distribution μ(p). The symbols pn

                      denote the realization of the second order distribution p and of one of its conditional probabilities in the nth Monte Carlo run, respectively. The second step is to evaluate the decision support model in correspondence of pn

The third step is to estimate the two stage functionals. For the subjective expected utility functional [Eq. (21)], we can introduce two equivalent estimators. The first estimator is

                     is the estimator of the predictive probability distribution. While conceptually equivalent, the estimators in Eqs. (40) and (41) lead to a different practical implementation, which matters if the code is using the folding back method. The estimator in (40) is directly applicable: it requires to execute the decision support model n times and then average its output. The estimator in (41), instead, requires to first evaluate

We observe that all data necessary to implement the above-listed steps are contained in a standard Monte Carlo simulation. Thus, they are produced by software tools traditionally used by decision analysts, such as Treeage, @Risk, Crystal Ball and others. Therefore, the estimators of these functionals demand no additional burden with respect to a traditional Monte Carlo analysis.

The problem we are to discuss numerically is the well known Carter Racing case study (Brittain and Sitkin, 1989). This case study is frequently taught in business school, either with an organizational or a decision analytic twist. The next description is made here in a decision analysis setup, reworking the description in Brittain and Sitkin (1989). John Carter, must make a decision under time pressure and considerable uncertainty. The future of his firm is at stake. If the next race (the last of the season) is a success, then, besides the current sponsor at 500 000 dollars, Carter racing will receive a new sponsor bringing in 1 million dollars, thus ensuring a cash position for the start of the new year at around 1 million dollars. In the case of an intermediate success, the old sponsor will remain with an inflow of 500 000 dollars, and with a cash position for the new year of around zero. In the case of engine failure, however, the season will end with a catastrophic cash position of 
                        
                           −
                           500
                           
                           000
                        
                      dollars, which would probably rule against the survival of the Carter racing team.

John Carter then starts brainstorming about the possible performance of the car in this last race. Given the most recent placements, a good finish seems likely. However, John is concerned about recent engine blowouts, which are the sort of engine blowouts that make advertisers cancel sponsorships (Brittain and Sitkin, 1989, p. 64).

John is provided with conflicting opinions by his experts. Paul Edwards, the team mechanic, deems an engine failure likely. Tom Burns, the team engineer, deems an engine failure unlikely.

The question is then: Run or Withdraw? Following the decision making cycle, the problem is represented in the form of a decision tree (Fig. 2
                     ).

The tree in Fig. 2 features two chance nodes, Engine and Classification.
                        6
                     
                     
                        6
                        While in some MBA courses the case is represented with a unique event and three branches, we prefer here to explicitly isolate engine failure, because the conflicting expert opinions make this event ambiguous.
                     
                  

In Brittain and Sitkin (1989), point values are assigned to the probabilities of all events. Inserting the numbers in the decision-tree of Fig. 2, we obtain 
                        
                           H
                           (
                           Run
                           ;
                           p
                           )
                           =
                           350
                        
                      and 
                        
                           H
                           (
                           Withdraw
                           ;
                           p
                           )
                           =
                           0
                           .
                        
                      Thus, the preferred alternative is to run. This result is numerically consistent with the initial survey usually obtained after a first presentation of the case, corresponding to statements such as “I think we should race, because racing is a business of risks ...” (Brittain and Sitkin, 1989, p. 65).

This first ”gut feeling” is then subjected to further examinations in the analysis of the case study, in which students are, step by step, asked to critically review their initial statements. From a quantitative viewpoint, the first item to note is that we are in a case of conflicting opinions and these make John uncertain about the probabilities. Let us model this fact.

The ambiguous event is engine failure. Paul Edwards’ opinion would make John Carter inclined to consider an engine failure likely. John Burns’ opinion, conversely, would make John consider the failure unlikely. To model John’s view after he has received Paul Edward’s opinion, we assign a beta distribution to the engine failure probability with parameters 2 and 6, so that the predictive probability [Eq. (4)] is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 ˜
                              
                              Edwards
                           
                           =
                           
                              3
                              4
                           
                        
                     . Tom Burn’s opinion, which is antithetic with respect to Paul Edwards’ indication, is modeled through a the symmetric distribution, i.e., a beta with parameters 6 and 2, so that the predictive probability 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 ˜
                              
                              Burns
                           
                           =
                           
                              1
                              4
                           
                        
                     . Combining the two experts’ opinions, John weighs obtains a predictive probability of engine failure given by

                     . In our next numerical calculations, we select

                      so that the predictive probability of engine failure, 
                        
                           
                              p

                      equals the point estimate engine failure probability in Brittain and Sitkin (1989), namely 
                        
                           
                              p

                           0.3
                        
                     . We then consider that John Carter assigns a 5/7 conditional probability of being in the first 5 given no engine failure (denoted by p
                     5). By 
                        
                           
                              p

                           =
                           5
                           /
                           7
                           ,
                        
                      one re-obtains the unconditional probability of ending in the first five as in Table 2, p. 70, in Brittain and Sitkin (1989).

Based on these numbers, also an SEU but risk-and-ambiguity neutral decision maker chooses the option to Run, even when uncertainty in the probabilities is modeled.

Consider now that John performs a Monte Carlo simulation, to understand the variability of the payoffs, provided by uncertainty in probability. Using the two-layer sampling procedure of Chick (2001), at a sample of size 
                        
                           N
                           =
                           
                              10
                              1
                           
                           8
                        
                      generated through from the Halton sequence (Owen, 2006) generator of Matlab, one obtains the results of the first graph in Fig. 3
                     .

Given the variability of the payoffs in Fig. 3, John might wish to question his decision further, asking whether, after factoring ambiguity aversion in the decision problem, Run remains the preferred strategy.

One immediately notes that a maximin decision maker selects Withdraw independently of her risk aversion, because in the worse case scenario this alternative leads to a prospect of 0, while Run has a negative worst outcome (see also the Dirac-δ distribution obtained in the fourth graph of Fig. 3). Then, if John acted as a minimax decision maker, he would chose Withdraw. This choice exposes John to the criticism of selecting a too conservative strategy, what might result inappropriate in a business context. However, John has the option to explore varying degrees of ambiguity aversion using the KMM functional (see Appendix A for details on numerical implementation). In particular, a one-way sensitivity analysis performed over the ambiguity aversion constant β [Eq. (39)] delivers the results in Fig. 4
                     .


                     Fig. 4 shows that, ceteris paribus, if John considers smoothly varying ambiguity attitudes, for β greater than a given threshold (β > 1/130 in this case), Withdraw becomes the preferred alternative.

While the value of the ambiguity aversion constant, per se, might not have a direct grasp for a decision maker, we can look at the same insights using certainty equivalents. For illustrative purposes, here we adopt a constant risk aversion with 
                        
                           α
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           1000
                           ,
                        
                      leaving 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           100
                        
                     . Fig. 3, second graph, shows the empirical density of the Monte Carlo distribution of the risk-averse SEU functional.

Applying Eq. (26), the KMM risk-and-ambiguity averse certainty equivalent is 
                        
                           C
                           (
                           Run
                           )
                           =
                           −
                           147.56
                           ,
                        
                      which leads to a risk-and-ambiguity premium 
                        
                           Π
                           =
                           497.56
                        
                     . Thus, if John is risk-and-ambiguity averse, he would chose Withdraw, paying the above-mentioned premium. Using the quadratic approximation, we can apportion the premium to John’s risk and ambiguity attitudes, respectively. In particular, we obtain 
                        
                           −

                           123.75
                        
                      leading to a risk premium equal to 226.25. From the quadratic approximation, we also obtain an ambiguity premium of

                        
                           (47)
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Π
                                    AM
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    Run
                                    )
                                 
                                 =
                                 286.65
                              
                           
                        
                     which refers to the portion of the risk-and-ambiguity premium referring to ambiguity. Thus, John is paying a premium equal to 286.65 to ambiguity.

Now, Π
                     AM(Run) is a function of β. If John reputes this ambiguity premium too high, he can repeat the analysis iterating on value of the ambiguity aversion constant till he finds a value of Π
                     AM(Run) which is acceptable to him.

Thus, using a quadratic approximation a manager has an idea about the price for ambiguity and risk she is paying. Then, she can use the findings to refine the analysis and be reassured about the decision she is to take.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The functionals that we have discussed namely SEU, KMM and minimax, accommodate alternative attitudes toward ambiguity, from neutrality to complete aversion. They can all be estimated either analytically or from Monte Carlo simulation. In Theorem 1, we have investigated the conditions under which an analyst is reassured that these functionals lead to the same numerical answers. Under these conditions, they identify the same preferred alternative. However, the assumptions under which this numerical coincidence occurs are quite restrictive, and readily violated in realistic applications (see Example 3). Then, exploring results obtained with alternative functionals, avoids the pitfalls of (i) not reflecting all relevant uncertainties and (ii) overlooking decision maker attitudes toward ambiguity. However, using multiple functionals raises the question of which indication to use when these functionals do not point to the same optimal strategy.

The KMM and minimax functionals lead to robust optimization problems that contain a higher degree of conservatism than the problem posed by an SEU functional. Whether this prudence is appropriate in a business context, where some risk-taking is often considered necessary to succeed, is at the discretion of the decision maker and must be established on a case-by-case basis. For instance, as in the Carter Racing case study, if a decision can have catastrophic consequences for the life of the firm, then retaining the option to model ambiguity averse attitudes is advisable.

Outside the business context, decision support models are often used to inform decisions in contexts where consequences might have highly negative societal impacts and ambiguity averse attitudes are necessary/recommended. Examples are the licensing of nuclear reactors, or the planning of space missions—the Carter racing case itself is based on the decision about authorizing the launch of a space vehicle, with particular reference to the Shuttle launch of 1986 (Brittain and Sitkin, 1989),—but also policy selection in climatic change applications (Millner, Dietz, and Heal, 2013). In this respect, the authoritative Stern review (Stern et al., 2006, p. 34) recommends the modeling of ambiguity averse attitudes as a direct way to quantitatively obey the precautionary principle.

Finally, we observe that the analysis stated in this work covers all those applications in which decision analysis problems can be expressed in normal form. The functionals can also be applied to any sequential decision analysis problem, provided it is reduced to in normal form first. If sequential decisions and learning are present, however, we know that the decision maker must establish whether she is up front committed to the results of all decision nodes. If such commitment is chosen, then dynamic consistency becomes a desirable property. In that case, the only functional presented in this paper that ensures dynamic consistency is SEU (or vNM in the absence of ambiguity). For the KMM functional, one needs to replace Eq. (7) with its dynamic version introduced in Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2009).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper has discussed the modeling of decision analysis problems in the face of risk and ambiguity. We have investigated the subjective expected utility, minimax and smooth ambiguity (KMM) functionals in addition to the classic vNM theoretical framework. We have determined the corresponding decision analysis problems and the conditions under which they become numerically equivalent.

The study of certainty equivalents for smooth ambiguity aversion has followed, with focus on the notion of risk-and-ambiguity premium. We have observed that this premium can be split into a portion related to risk aversion and a portion related to ambiguity aversion by exploiting a recently proposed quadratic approximation of smooth ambiguity certainty equivalents.

A rereading of the Ellsberg’s paradox in a decision analysis perspective has helped us illustrating our findings. The analysis of well known Carter racing case study has allowed us to propose a procedure to ambiguity modeling that naturally complements current practical approaches.

The findings show that by the explicit quantification of ambiguity attitudes, we are able to systematically evaluate the impact of alternative specifications of the decision maker tastes for ambiguity and risk, to appreciate the ambiguity premium, gaining a quantitative understanding about the impact of uncertainty and of our attitudes toward it.

                           To prove the inequivalence of Maximin with the other problems, we observe that, because the maximin problem is equivalent to a KMM problem with ambiguity aversion tending to infinity, ϕ cannot be linear and, therefore, assumption (ii) is violated by a Maximin decision maker.□

                     which, by simple manipulation, is equivalent to Eq. (B.10).

As opposed to Eq. (B.7), it is not possible to obtain a closed form expression for the KMM functional. However, Eq. (B.10) can be either implemented in a symbolic calculator such as Matematica or Mathcad, or estimated through Monte Carlo Simulation.

The authors explored both options, also for obtaining a cross-check of numerical findings. In particular, for Monte Carlo simulations, convergence in the estimates is obtained at reasonable sample sizes for all the estimates of interest. Confidence intervals have also been obtained using the bootstrap method Efron and Gong (1983). The subtourines are available upon request.

We then obtain the certainty equivalent for a KMM decision maker
