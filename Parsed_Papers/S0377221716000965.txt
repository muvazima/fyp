                  We present numerical approximations of optimal portfolios in mispriced Lévy markets under asymmetric information for informed and uninformed investors having logarithmic preference. We apply our numerical scheme to Kou (2002) jump-diffusion markets by deriving analytic formulas for the first two derivatives of the underlying portfolio objective function which depend only on the Lévy measure of the jump-generating process. Optimal portfolios are then simulated using the Box–Muller algorithm, Newton’s method and incomplete Beta functions. Convergence dynamics and trajectories of sample paths of optimal portfolios for both investors are presented at different levels of information asymmetry, mispricing, horizon, asymmetry in the Kou density, jump intensity, volatility, mean-reversion speed, and Sharpe ratios. We also apply the proposed Newton’s algorithm to compute optimal portfolios for investors in Variance Gamma markets via instantaneous centralized moments of returns.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Asymmetric information models assume that there are two types of investors in the market—informed and uninformed. The informed investor trades because he or she has non-public informational advantage, while the uninformed is a liquidity trader or hedger without an information advantage. The informed investor partially reveals information to the uninformed investor through trades. Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) and Easley and O’Hara (2004) provide evidence of the importance of information asymmetry in asset pricing. They find that prices and demand for the risky asset by uninformed investors fall as information asymmetry increases. Their results confirm that information asymmetry is priced, and imply that liquidity is a primary channel that links asymmetry to prices.

Mispricing

                      is the difference between the asset price and its fundamental value. It is modeled by a mean-reverting Orstein–Uhlenbeck process. Because of the exponential decay associated with mean-reverting processes, it has an associated half-life which is inversely proportional to its mean-reversion rate. Half-life is a measure of the slowness of a mean-reverting process, and is measured in trading days. It may be defined as the average time it takes the mean-reverting process to get pulled half-way back to its long-term mean. In this context, half-life gives an estimate of how long we should expect the mispricing to remain far from zero. Thus, a half-life of 10 days means that it takes 20 trading days on average for the mispricing to revert to zero. We define mean-reversion time as the inverse of the mean-reversion rate, and use it as an equivalent measure of mispricing. In other words, mean-reversion speed or mean-reversion time is a proxy for mispricing. In this paper, we combine the concepts of asymmetric information, mispricing, and mean-reversion, and apply them to the Kou (2002) jump-diffusion and Variance Gamma (VG) markets to study the impact on the optimal demand for the risky asset by investors having logarithmic preference.

                      have been extensively studied in various settings since the seminal work of Markowitz (1952). Recently, Buckley et al. (2014) show that optimal portfolios satisfy some nonlinear stochastic equations for both informed and uninformed investors in the asymmetric and mispriced Lévy markets. Usually there are no analytic solutions to these nonlinear equations. Numerical and analytic approximations are therefore critical for portfolio allocation problems. We solve our problem by presenting a simple but highly efficient approximation to our asset allocation problem in the asymmetric and mispriced Kou and VG market setting. In particular, we apply the theory presented in the recent studies by Buckley et al. (2012), Buckley et al. (2014) and Buckley et al. (2015) to compute numerical approximations of the optimal portfolios with the aid of Newton’s method, the Box–Muller algorithm, and the incomplete Beta functions.


                     Kou (2002) jump-diffusion model deals with a finite activity process in the sense that only a small number of jumps occur per unit of time. Empirical tests in Ramenzani and Zeng (2007) demonstrate that Kou’s double exponential jump-diffusion model fits stock data better than Merton’s normal jump-diffusion model. It is also very tractable, and therefore, is a natural candidate to apply our general numerical scheme. For the Kou markets, we derive analytic formulas for the first two derivatives of the underlying portfolio objective function presented in Buckley et al. (2014) which depends only on the Lévy measure of the process generating the jumps. Using the parameters in Kou (2002) and Ramenzani and Zeng (2007), we then implement our model by simulating paths of optimal portfolios for each investor at various levels of mispricing, information asymmetry, investment horizon, volatility, Sharpe ratio, jump probability, and jump size.

The Variance Gamma (VG) model introduced by Madan and Seneta (1990) and Madan, Carr, and Chang (1998) has found extensive applications in modeling stock returns, option pricing and structural credit risk models. It is of infinite activity, that is, there are infinitely many arrivals of small jumps per unit of time. We also employ our theory to the Variance Gamma (VG) Lévy markets to examine how asset mispricing and information asymmetry affect the optimal portfolio and maximum expected utilities of investors in this market. Cvitanic et al. (2008) report that jumps in asset prices lead to higher moments that must be captured when modeling returns and allocating portfolios. Following Cvitanic et al. (2008) and Buckley et al. (2014), we employ instantaneous centralized moments of returns (ICMR) in our analysis of the VG markets and then combine Newton’s method with the ICMR to produce numerical approximations of the optimal portfolios of the investors at different levels of mispricing, asymmetric information, jump intensity, volatility, and horizon.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report on the impact of mispricing and asymmetric information in the Kou (2002) and Variance Gamma markets, and therefore, contributes to the literature on mispricing and asymmetric information asset pricing models.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the model is briefly reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, Newton’s method is proposed to give numerical computation of optimal portfolios in the asymmetric Lévy markets. The Kou jump-diffusion market is introduced in Section 4. Newton’s algorithm depends on the first two derivatives of a non-trivial objective function G(.), which is a moment generating function. In this section, we also develop analytic formulas for said derivatives in terms of the cumulative distribution functions of incomplete Beta random variables. The mispriced VG market is introduced in Section 5, where an explicit formula is given for the optimal portfolio. We also report details of the VG market, including ICMR and their effects on mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the return process. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Numerical results for the Kou and VG markets under various levels of asymmetric information, volatility, mean-reversion speed, Poisson arrival rates and asymmetric distributions are reported in the Appendices.

In this section, we briefly review the model and the corresponding optimal portfolios in the asymmetric Lévy markets discussed in Buckley et al. (2014). The economy consists of two assets; a risk-free asset B, called bank account or money market, with price

                           H

                     . Note that we can use half-life H, mean-reversion rate λ and the mean-reversion time 
                        
                           τ

                      as equivalent measures of mispricing. Large values of the mean-reversion time  τ (equivalently, small values of λ) correspond to high levels of mispricing. Namely the mispricing process U takes a long time to revert to zero, which indicates that mispricing is persistent.

The optimal portfolios (please see Theorem 1) are basically fixed points of the first derivative of the function G(.), which is a moment generating function (the function G(.) generates instantaneous centralized moments of returns). Each optimal portfolio is the Merton optimal (for the symmetric market) plus an excess holding of risky asset which is inversely proportional to the diffusive variance (sigma squared) and directly proportional to G′(.), the growth rate of G(.) at the risky asset proportion level. The optimal portfolios are therefore very sensitive to information asymmetry, mean reversion speed, volatility, Sharp ratio and activity of the Lévy measure. For example, as the diffusive volatility increases, the agents basically hold the deterministic Merton optimal. The excess stock holding is positive or negative in lockstep with the sign and magnitude of G′(.); that is, whether G(.) is increasing or decreasing at that stock proportion.

By Remark 1 in Section 2, the exact unique optimal portfolio in a symmetric market is

It is well-known that asset return distributions have heavier left and right tails than the normal distributions. Jump-diffusion models since the pioneering work of Merton (1976) are among the most popular alternative models proposed to address this issue, and they are especially useful to price options with short maturities. Brownian motion and normal distribution have been widely used in the Black–Scholes–Merton option-pricing framework to model the return of assets. However, two puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations: the leptokurtic feature that the return distribution of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails than those of the normal distribution, and an empirical phenomenon called “volatility smile” in option markets. Kou (2002) argues that the existing models either do not explain the observed behavior of stock prices, or are too complex to yield analytical solutions for many American options.

Kou incorporates both of these properties by proposing a double exponential

                      jump-diffusion model which is both tractable and applicable for option pricing. Moreover, the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions for a variety of option-pricing problems, including European call and put options, interest rate derivatives such as swaptions, caps, floors, and bond options, and path-dependent options such as perpetual American options, barrier, and lookback options.


                     Kou (2002) assumes that the price of the underlying asset is modeled by two parts;   a continuous part driven by Brownian motion, and a jump part where the logarithm of the jump sizes have a double exponential distribution. Because of its simplicity, the parameters in the model can be easily interpreted, and the analytical solutions for option pricing can be obtained. Kou (2002) is a finite activity process in the sense that only a small number of jumps occur per unit of time. Empirical tests in Ramenzani and Zeng (2007) demonstrate that Kou’s double exponential jump-diffusion model fits stock data better than Merton’s normal jump-diffusion model. It is also very tractable, and therefore is a natural candidate market for application of the theory in Buckley et al. (2014).

                         we can use standard Riemann sums to approximate these integrals. In this section, we develop analytic formulas for the derivatives of G(π) in terms of the incomplete Beta functions (or equivalently, the cumulative distribution functions of Beta random variables). We show that G′(π) and G′′(π) can be expressed analytically in terms of incomplete Beta functions. Let α ∈ [0, 1] and η > 0. Define

The incomplete Beta function (or equivalently the Beta cumulative distribution function) is readily available in many statistical packages. It can also be directly implemented in MATLAB. Consequently, J(α, η) and D(α, η) can be computed directly from the incomplete Beta function.

The D(., .) function above are inputs for building the derivative of G, as the following result shows.

The behavior of G′(.), the growth rate at the risky portfolio holding, depends only on the Lévy measure. Theorem 2 posits that G′(.) is strictly increasing in the rate at which jumps occur, the probability of upward jumps, and the upward log-jump amplitude. It is strictly decreasing in the probability of downward jumps and downward log-jump amplitude.

To implement Newton’s algorithm for the Kou market, we also need the second derivative of G(.). An analytic formula for G′′(π) now follows.

                               presented in Theorems 2 and 3, we can use Newton’s algorithms proposed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 to numerically compute the optimal portfolios for both uninformed and informed investors in the Kou jump-diffusion market. The corresponding numerical results are reported in Appendix A.

We closely follow Madan (2010) and Madan and Seneta (1990) for a description of the Variance Gamma (VG) process. Application and further developments are reported in Angelos (2013), Carr and Wu (2004), Hirsa and Madan (2004), Madan et al. (1998) and Seneta (2004). Madan (2010) describes the Variance Gamma process X(t) as a Brownian motion with drift θ and volatility σ time changed by a gamma process with a mean rate of one unit, and variance rate ν. Thus, for a standard Brownian motion B(t), and a gamma process Γ(t; ν),

                         which must be estimated if an analytic formula is not available. In the sequel, we estimate G(α) by its kth degree Taylor series Gk
                        (α). We use the instantaneous centralized moments of returns Mj
                        , to approximate the function G and hence G′ and G′′, by a truncated Taylor series. The larger the value of k, the better the approximation of G. We have the following result which is general for all models where Mk
                         exists.

Observe from Theorem 4 that the optimal portfolios are basically fixed points of the first derivative of the function Gk
                        (.), which is a moment generating function (the function Gk
                        (.) generates instantaneous centralized moments of returns). Each optimal portfolio is the Merton optimal (for the symmetric market without jumps) plus an excess holding of risky asset. This excess consists of two parts. The first is purely random, and depends on information asymmetry, mean-reversion speed and volatility, while the second additive component is inversely proportional to the diffusive variance (sigma squared) and directly proportional to G′(.), the growth rate of G(.) at the risky asset proportion level. Consequently, the optimal portfolios are very sensitive to information asymmetry, mean reversion speed, volatility, Sharp ratio and activity of the Levy measure. For example, as the diffusive volatility increases, the agents basically hold the deterministic Merton optimal. The excess stock holding is basically positive or negative in lockstep with the sign and magnitude of 
                           
                              
                                 G
                                 k
                                 ′
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 .
                                 )
                              
                           
                        ; that is, whether Gk
                         is increasing or decreasing at that stock proportion.

The behavior of G′(.) depends only on the Lévy measure, which is driven by the parameters. To implement Newton’s algorithm for the VG market, we also need the second derivative of G(.). There are many independent parameters (in addition to functions thereof) involved in the respective derivatives, and only extensive simulation can provide a proper sensitivity analysis of the impact of these parameters on the optimal portfolios.

                           Remark 9
                           For the VG market with parameters C, G, M, the approximating polynomial Gk
                               is controlled by M, and we chose

Thus polynomials of degree k ≥ 25 may be used to approximate π using Newton’s method. However, it is best to use a smaller k value if Mk
                               is very small, for example if it is less than say,

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We apply the theory of mispricing models under asymmetric information developed in Buckley et al. (2012), Buckley et al. (2014) and Buckley et al. (2015) to estimate optimal portfolios in the mispriced Kou jump-diffusion market. We propose a simple numerical scheme using Newton’s method to compute approximate optimal demand at various levels of mispricing, information asymmetry, jump intensity, jump frequency, and investment horizon. In particular, we apply the proposed algorithm to the Kou jump-diffusion markets by first developing analytic formulas for the first and second derivatives of the underlying objective function

                      which depends only on the Lévy measure of the driving jump process. We also present numerical simulations of paths of optimal portfolios using the same input parameters in Kou (2002).

We also apply our theory to Variance Gamma markets in Madan and Seneta (1990). For these special markets, we obtain optimal portfolios and their approximations based on an in-depth study of the instantaneous centralized moments (ICMR), Mk
                     , for the return process, and its moment generating function,

                     . We show that the optimal portfolios are fixed points of functions and Taylor polynomials created from Mk
                     , the ICMR, which are dependent only on the Lévy measure of the jump process driving the market. Using the parameters in Carr et al. (2002), we simulate paths of optimal portfolios for each investor holding Bank of America stock.

We present sample paths of optimal portfolios for the asymmetric Kou jump-diffusion market using the proposed algorithms in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Information asymmetry is set at 0 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent. In each simulation, we assume that the market coefficients
