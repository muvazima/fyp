                  The issues of carbon emission and global warming have increasingly aroused worldwide attention in recent years. Despite huge progresses in carbon abatement, few research studies have reported on the impacts of carbon emission reduction mechanisms on manufacturing optimisation, which often leads to decisions of environmentally unsustainable operations and misestimation of performance. This paper attempts to explore carbon management under the carbon emission trading mechanism for optimisation of lot sizing production planning in stochastic make-to-order manufacturing with the objective to maximise shareholder wealth. We are concerned not only about the economic benefits of investors, but also about the environmental impacts associated with production planning. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant influences of carbon emission trading, pricing, and caps on the dynamic decisions of the lot sizing policy. The result highlights the critical roles of carbon management in production planning for achieving both environmental and economic benefits. It also provides managerial insights into operations management to help mitigate environmental deterioration arising from carbon emission, as well as improve shareholder wealth.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The vast majority of physical and biological systems on the earth have reportedly been affected by huge regional and global climate abnormalities resulting from excessive emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4).

The recent global assessment made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to provide an authoritative international statement of the scientific understanding of climate changes, shows that the anthropogenic global warming over the last three decades has posed discernible risks on our planet (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, Linden, & Hanson, 2007)


                        Archer and Pierrehumbert (2011), for example, reported the number of great inland flood catastrophes per decade between 1996 and 2005 was twice as large as between 1958 and 1980, while the resultant economic loses had to be increased by a factor of five.


                        Annamalai, Hafner, Sooraj, and Pillai (2012) stated that monsoon rainfall over South Asia has decreased while sea surface temperature over the warm pool increased during the last several decades, according to several sets of observations.


                        Sarkis and Cordeiro (2012) argued that the industry's air emissions have numerous deleterious environmental impacts at the global, regional and local levels, including global warming, acid rain, and smog.

In a review of urban transportation network design problem, Farahani, Miandoabchi, Szeto, and Rashidi (2013) emphasized the significance of considering CO2 emissions minimisation as one of the problem objective functions, due to the large emission amount involved in traffic and its dramatic impacts on health and global warming.

These problems of global warming and climate changes are largely attributable to the excessive emission of GHGs, especially its main component—CO2. Alarmed by their far-reaching adverse impingements, a great number of governments and international organizations have launched a series of programs to cut emission of GHGs. In 1992, for example, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) negotiated the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the goal of stabilizing GHGs concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. So far, 154 nations have signed the UNFCCC and agreed to reduce atmosphere concentrations of GHGs to achieve this long-term environmental objective. Later in 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC was adopted to set binding obligations on industrialized countries to reduce their carbon emissions into the atmosphere. In the most recent UN climate summit (UN Climate Summit 2014), the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, called for consensus of all member states on concluding a meaningful legal agreement in 2015.

All these efforts highlight the severity and urgency of the issues of carbon emission and global warming. In order to effectively execute their environmental responsibilities, numerous countries and regions have enacted and implemented various concrete measures to cut GHGs emissions, mainly including regulations and standards, taxes and charges, voluntary agreements, tradable permits and so forth, to curb the carbon emission of their home companies (Hahn, 2013). As a result, an increasing number of companies are required to monitor their carbon emission to evaluate the environmental impacts of their operations in pursuit of economic interests.

Despite the extensive concerns of carbon emission reduction mechanisms in industries, thus far the carbon emission problem in production planning has received little academic attention. Few studies have been reported on the production planning optimisation problem under the regulation of carbon emissions.


                           Absi and Kedad-Sidhoum (2009) attempted to incorporate constraints on carbon emissions into a multi-sourcing lot sizing supply chain environment, aimed at minimising the total cost expense and limiting the carbon emission per unit product. Four possible carbon emission constraints were proposed in their research, composed of the periodic carbon emission constraint, the cumulative carbon emission constraint, the global carbon emission constraint, and the rolling carbon emission constraint.


                           Yalabik and Fairchild (2011) conducted an economic analysis in order to examine the effects of customers, regulations, and competitive pressures on a firm's investments in environmentally friendly productions. Solving the model yielded that the regulatory pressure had the intended effect of reducing carbon emission as long as the firm's initial emission level was below a certain threshold. If the initial emission was above this threshold, the pressure might have an adverse effect and the subsidiaries supporting environmental innovation could be a better alternative.


                           Helmrich, Jans, Heuvel, and Wagelmans (2014) studied the generalisation of a lot sizing problem under the production environment with a carbon emission constraint, which was introduced as a condition imposed on an alternative cost function.

These studies incorporate the carbon emission problem into the traditional operations optimisation in the form of certain absolute emission constraints or cost constraints. It means that, in order to reach the emission reduction target, companies are obliged to trim down their productions, leading to a waste of investments and slowdown of economies.

Indeed, compared with these emission constraints, the market-based emission trading system (ETS) has grown to a more popular emission reduction measure over the world. It has been extensively adopted on a global scale to control carbon emission into the atmosphere. Programs already in effect encompass the European Union ETS, the Australian ETS, the New Zealand ETS, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the North-eastern United States, the California ETS, and the Tokyo ETS. A lot of other countries are on the verge of commencing operations (Mansell & Sopher, 2013).

Despite its widespread applications in the global market, ETS is rarely considered in operations management. Hua, Cheng, and Wang (2011) looked into an inventory model by combining the cap-and-trade system into the traditional EOQ model. Benjaafar, Li, and Daskin (2013) presented another inventory model under the emission regulation of the cap-and-trade system.

Up to now, we have not been able to find any paper on the study of the carbon emission problem in production planning under the market-based ETS mechanism. We therefore attempt to explore this problem for a stochastic make-to-order (MTO) production planning environment with the lot sizing policy, aimed at effective management of carbon emission under the ETS mechanism, associated with productions for maximisation of shareholder wealth.

First, the carbon emission problem is examined under the ETS mechanism, for it is now a well-established and popular marked-based emission reduction mechanism on a global scale. ETS, also known as the cap-and-trade system, establishes a cap on aggregate carbon emission by a source, and requires it to hold permits not larger than the cap or to purchase permits for the excessive carbon emission. The trading unit of ETS is the carbon credits. According to Carbon Trade Exchange (CTX), a carbon credit is defined as the right to emit one tonne of CO2 equivalent either removed, avoided, or sequestered (Mansell & Sopher, 2013). ETS helps reduce GHGs emission, promote renewable and low-carbon energies, as well as facilitate transfer of green technologies from developed to developing countries. Its market-based characteristic makes it more efficient than other carbon emission mechanisms.

Second, we study the production planning problem from the perspective of shareholders, rather than focusing merely on local optimisation objectives, such as times, costs, or profits. Indeed, the maximisation of shareholder wealth and sustaining a steady cash flow have become the top priority of most enterprises (Erasmus & Lambrechts, 2006; Madden, 2002; Young & O'Byrne, 2001). This has recently been entrenched as the overall principle of corporate governance on a global scale (Lazonick & O'Sullivan, 2000). Kolb (2008) argued that the principle of shareholder wealth maximisation was and ought to be the overall objective of all corporate activities. The most recent depression in the global economy has further highlighted the economic benefits of shareholder wealth maximisation.

Third, the proposed production planning model is examined in an MTO supply chain mode. A diverse variety of customer preferences and fierce market competition has been motivating a growing number of firms to adopt the MTO strategy to meet diversified market demands, as well as to avoid excessive inventory of finished products in the supply chain channel (Bowersox, Stank, & Daugherty, 1999). Recently, MTO has received much attention due to its major successes in high-tech companies and traditional manufacturing companies (Gunasekaran & Ngai, 2009).

By exploring the proposed model, we first intend to understand the role of the ETS policy in the carbon emission control. We are concerned about how effectively the ETS policy can curb the GHGs emission and eventually stabilize the carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

Besides the environmental consideration, the impacts of the ETS policy on the operations and interests of investors are another primary concern. Our research will not only illustrate the influences of carbon emission trading, pricing, and caps on the lot sizing policy in operations management, but also explore their impacts on the interests of corporate investors involved in the proposed production planning model.

The analytical and numerical results underline the critical role of the ETS mechanism for production planning in both the environmental conservation and the shareholder wealth advancement. It helps corporate executives gain a more in-depth understanding of the potential shareholder wealth drivers under the regulation of the ETS mechanism. Also, it may contribute to the corporate transition to a low-carbon economy through investment in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies.

Our paper has two limitations. First, we concentrate on the production planning problem with lot sizing, without considering other production planning problems. Second, due to our focus on the impacts of the ETS policy on carbon emission and benefits of investors, other problems related to ETS, such as carbon emission pricing, will not be involved in our research.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a stochastic lot sizing queuing network integrated with the objective function for maximising shareholder wealth is derived. The corresponding manufacturing planning mode under ETS is then formulated. Section 3 proves several analytical optimisation properties. In Section 4, numerical examples together with analysis of the optimisation results are conducted to validate the proposed model. Section 5 draws conclusions and provides several recommendations for the future research.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#


                              Fig. 1
                               illustrates an uncertain MTO manufacturing environment with stochastic interarrival of orders, where one type of product is being processed.

Individual orders randomly arrive at the manufacturing firm. When these orders accumulate to a batch of size Q, they are gathered and transferred to the setup stage for initial setup on a batch-by-batch basis. Subsequently, they are released to the processing stage to be processed and completed one by one. Finally, the completed orders are individually delivered to customers without waiting until the whole batch is finished.

The lot sizing policy, i.e., the determination of the optimal batch size Q immediately before setup, is pivotal to the entire production system. It is a crucial problem of identifying when and how many of a product to produce, such that certain performance objectives are achieved. Smaller lot sizes tend to cause frequent setups, leading to excessive setup times and costly setup costs. Comparatively, larger lot sizes reduce setups, but often result in higher work-in-process (WIP) inventory and WIP carrying costs due to the resultant longer waiting time for setup. The lot sizing decision, thus, impacts directly on a firm's system performance and its productivity, which are critical for its success in the fierce market competition.

The stochasticity associated with this production system refers to uncertainties of interarrival times of orders, setup times, and processing times. Demands or orders are typically uncertain for various reasons, such as changes in customer tastes and needs, entry or exit of competitors, seasonal demand fluctuations, and so forth. In addition, the system itself also faces uncertainty in production. This manufacturing uncertainty is mainly attributable to the day-to-day processing variations, equipment failure, changes in processing rates, and the like.

These uncertainties pose a tremendous challenge to production planning on account of the resulted difficulties with accurately projecting demand and production in the future. Ignoring these uncertainties could lead to unfilled orders, translating to a loss of market share.

How to tackle these stochastic factors is thus the core of uncertain production planning problems. We characterize them by their probabilistic merits—expected values and standard deviations, without any assumption on their distributions. This improves the generality and extendibility of the proposed model, for the factitious distribution assumptions are quite restrictive, often leading to impractical optimisation results (Morabito, Souza & Vazquez, 2014).

Several assumptions on the proposed production system are needed to make so as to ensure the exactness of the model formulation.

                                 
                                    •
                                    In the production system presented in Fig. 1, all the production stages are mutually independent.

Demands or orders are independent, and their interarrival times are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), forming a Markov chain.

Once competing for capacitated resources, all orders are served according to the first-come first-served principle. Order preemption is impermissible.

Without loss of generality, we further suppose that each order encompasses only one product.

The manufacturer is a price taker in either the perfect competition or monopolistic competition environment. It means that product prices are exogenous, completely determined by the aggregate demand and aggregate supply in market.

Neither decision variables nor state variables have any effect on the stochastic processes.

The production capacity is considered unchanged in our research, for our focus is put on the operational decision-making level, but not on the tactical or strategic level.

To solve for E(Wqs
                           ), we suppose that completed orders would not leave the processing stage one by one until the whole batch was gathered. By this way, the setup and processing stages may be simplified as a standard GI/G/1 queuing model, which is similar to the manufacturing environment illustrated in Fig. 1, except for an overestimation on the processing time, but without any effect on Wqs
                           . According to the conclusion to the GI/G/1 queuing model suggested by Bhat (2008),

As the service time E(Tb
                           ) for the above supposed GI/G/1 queuing model overestimates the real service time, we cannot use the GI/G/1 equations to estimate it. Instead, we attempt to figure it out by first solving for E(Ws
                           ), E(Wqp
                           ), and E(Wp
                           ) respectively and then summing them up.

Before the processing service, for a given batch, the ith (1 ≤ i ≤ Q) order has to wait for

We adopt cash flow return on investment (CFROI) to measure the full interests of equity holders, for it is widely accepted as a better measure of sustainable profitability, as well as a good representation of shareholders’ interests (Madden, 2002). CFROI is a real cross-sectional internal rate of return (IRR) estimated at a time point from a firm's aggregate data (Erasmus & Lambrechts, 2006). Its basic valuation is rooted in the discounted cash flow (DCF) (Madden, 2002). Therefore, the conceptions of IRR and DCF can be used to estimate CFROI, as in

                           where γ denotes the unit sales price and r the tax rate. s is the unit setup cost and h represents the unit WIP holding cost. Other variable costs, such as the purchasing cost and the sales cost, are not related to both the lot size and expected lead time, and thus are aggregated together and denote them by ω.

The only one non-cash expense we need to consider is the depreciation of the long-term asset investment. By the straight-line depreciating approach, it can be computed as

                            is the initial outlay invested in the depreciating assets, which is assumed to be depreciated straight-line to the salvage value of zero during the estimated life L of these long-term depreciating assets.

The pertinent constraint conditions involve the lot size and the traffic intensity. Under no circumstance would the lot size Q be less than one. In addition, the traffic intensity ρ has to be less than 100 percent for a realistic queuing model. Consequently, the relevant constraints on our proposed manufacturing model can be summarized as follows:

One crucial consideration is how to effectively manage carbon footprint for maximisation of shareholder wealth under the ETS system. The proposed manufacturing procedure, as represented in Fig. 1, involves two carbon emission sources—the manufacturing procedure and the WIP holding inventory.

Carbon emission in each production stage arises mainly from consumptions of fossil fuel and electricity to power vehicles and machines. The volume of carbon emission for production can thus be formulated as

                           where κ
                           0 denotes the fixed carbon emission factor, encompassing the carbon emissions from vehicles driven empty and machines run without processing products; κ
                           1 represents the variable carbon emission factor, measuring the surplus carbon emission per product, pertinent to manufacturing.

The WIP holding inventory consumes energy similar to the manufacturing procedure, since partially completed goods need to be frequently transferred from one place to another for storage. It is not only related to the order quantity, but is also closely linked to the inventory holding time E(W). Thus, the carbon emission due to the WIP holding inventory can be expressed as

where e represents the total GHGs emissions volume.

It should be noted that ϖ can be either negative or positive. A negative ϖ means the manufacturer has emitted more GHGs than the specified emission quota, and thus need to purchase carbon credits from the ETS market. In contrast, a positive ϖrepresents the carbon emission being less than the quota, enabling the manufacturer to sell its surplus carbon credits to make more profits.

Estimation of variable and fixed carbon emission factors can be done through a variety of carbon emission calculators (Padgett, Steinemann, Clarke & Vandenbergh, 2008). Manufacturing firms first need to keep track of accounting data of different carbon emission sources, such as vehicle and fuel use, power energy consumption, and so forth. Multiplying these data by a corresponding factor, the carbon emission volumes for different emission sources can be obtained respectively. For example, assuming that the power consumption is 12,000 kilowatt hours for this month with a conversion carbon emission factor of 0.68 kilogram/kilowatt hours from American Forests, we know that the resultant carbon emission is about 8 tonnes. Whether this figure should be classified as variable or fixed emission factors depends completely on its real use. If it is fuelled in warehouse to store products, for example, it is obviously part of the fixed carbon emission factor. In contrast, if it is used to drive machine stations, it should be put into the variable carbon emission category.

The benchmark model has yet to consider the impacts of ETS on CFROI. In order to examine both the environmental and economic benefits of considering carbon management in production planning, we need to take into account the carbon credits held by the manufacturing firm. Indeed, the carbon credits can be viewed as another cash flow source, for they can be freely traded in the ETS market for money. Thus, to account for the impacts of carbon emission on cash flows, Eq. (14) can now be transformed as

                           Eq. (21) assumes no additional tax levied on the earnings from carbon emission trading, which is the case in reality. If a tax is levied on these earnings, then the term cϖ would have to be adjusted for the tax to get the after-tax earnings (positive values) or expenses (negative values).

In order to examine the impacts of carbon management on the shareholder wealth and the environment, we take account of three different optimisation cases in this section, including carbon emission minimisation (CEM), shareholder wealth maximisation with carbon emission management (SWM-CE), and shareholder wealth maximisation without carbon emission management (SWM-NCE). Several optimal properties for these three optimisation cases are first proved to provide analytical results on the significance of carbon emission management in production planning.

For optimisation under CEM, we need to maximise the tradable carbon credit ϖ in (20), subject to the constraint conditions (17). The following two theorems state the characteristics of the optimal solution to this case.

This means that CEM has only one stationary point, that is, the only one possible globally optimal solution. Further considering the concavity of ϖ, we can come into the conclusion that this solution has to globally minimise the carbon emission volume for the proposed manufacturing model. The theorem is thus proven. □


                        Theorem 2 gives the optimal lot size for minimisation of carbon emissions. The optimal lot size in this case is merely related to the manufacturing environment. It has no relationship with the cost structure and sales price of the manufacturing firm.

The SWM-CE optimisation case aims to maximise CFROI represented by (13) under the constraints (17). The carbon credits have to be considered to account for the effects of carbon management, as in (21), instead of (14).

Indeed, considering the concavity of CFROI stated in Theorem 3, it follows from the necessary condition in Theorem 4 that there is only one globally optimal lot size to SWM-CE. It is not only related to the manufacturing environment, but also to the cost structure and sales price.

SWM-NCE is represented by (13) and (14) subject to the constraints (17). Indeed, SWM-NCE is a special case of SWM-CE when c → 0. We can thus readily give the following two corollaries for SWM-NCE.

Similar to SWM-CE, we can use Corollary 1 and Corollary 2 to obtain the only one globally optimal lot size for SWM-NCE. This lot size is not only dependent on the manufacturing environment, but also on the cost structure and sales price.

Several numerical experiments are conducted in this section to validate the proposed manufacturing model. The theoretical propositions, proven in the last section, are used to solve each of them for the globally optimal solution.

In these numerical examples, we choose all operational data from a real manufacturing environment, without any assumption on involved random variables (Lambrecht & Vandaele, 1996), in order to improve the persuasion power and practicability, that is, 1/λ = 1.0000  minutes, 
                        
                           σ
                           X
                           2
                        
                      = 0.5000, τ = 10.0000  minutes,
                        
                           σ
                           Y
                           2
                        
                      = 10.0000, 1/μ = 0.5000  minutes, 
                        
                           σ
                           Z
                           2
                        
                      = 0.0625. The financial parameters can be collected from the manufacturer's managerial accounting systems (Garrison & Noreen, 2000), as follows, A = $10 million, AN
                      = $8 million, ω = $2.5, s = $1200, h = $1.5, CF
                      = $2.0 million, L = 3 years, γ = $150, and r = 30 percent.

We further assume the carbon emission factors as some relatively smaller values, i.e. k
                     0 = 2 tonnes, k
                     1 = 20 kilograms, g
                     0 = 3 tonnes, g
                     1 = 10 kilograms, based on the analysis of the carbon emission calculator of American Forests mentioned by Padgett et al. (2008). The emission quota is typically set by the regulatory agency in the basis of the total emission allowance, and is assumed to be K = 3500 tonnes in our research.

The carbon credit price is intractable. Although the price can be fetched from the ETS market, it often fluctuates dramatically due to the unavoidable defects associated with such emerging exchange markets. For example, during the first trading period 2005–2007 of EU ETS, the carbon credit price plunged from a peak value of €30 per tonne in April 2005 to €0.1 per tonne in September 2007. Furthermore, the carbon credit price varies hugely among different ETS markets, as shown in Table 1
                     .

In this research, we adopt the mid-range value of these practical prices for the carbon credit price, that is, c =  (2 + 142)/2 = $72/tonne. To better reflect the practical trading case, we would also explore the impacts of ETS with different carbon credit prices, ranging from $0 to $150. In practice, however, manufacturers should pick up proper carbon credit prices based on the accessible ETS markets.

The first experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving the globally optimal solutions to the afore-mentioned three optimisation cases.

Substituting the parameter values into (28) of Theorem 2, we can figure out the optimal lot size to globally minimise the carbon emission, i.e.

                         is the only one global solution, corresponding to the maximum shareholder wealth of 21.80 percent and the carbon emission of 3164 tonnes.


                        Table 2
                         summarises these theoretical solutions to the three optimisation cases. These analytical derivations firstly demonstrate that the proposed approach is theoretically effective in solving for the globally optimal solutions.

In addition, compared with SWM_NCE, taking carbon management into account does not only increase shareholder wealth from 21.80 percent to 23.57 percent, but also reduces carbon emission dramatically from 3164 to 3103 tonnes. Obviously, these optimisation results highlight the critical implications of ETS to both the economic interests of business owners and the environmental conservation.

This win–win solution is vital to business management. From the perspective of business owners, incorporation of carbon management helps boost their core economic interests. More importantly, it enhances the firm's social responsibility for environmental protection and curbs the carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

The second study explores the impacts of ETS on the lot sizing policy, the shareholder wealth, and the carbon emission. Table 3
                         lists the optimal solutions to different combinations of carbon emission caps and carbon credit prices. All these solutions are reached by the way of the theoretical derivations used in the first study.

First, from Table 3 it follows that the higher trading prices of carbon credits result in decreases of carbon emissions, regardless of carbon emission caps, by adjusting the lot sizing strategy, as represented by Fig. 2
                        .

In contrast, any variation in carbon emission caps has no effect on the optimal lot sizing policy and thus the carbon emission volume. For example, the optimal lot size and the corresponding emission level remains unchanged when the carbon emission cap changes from 2900 to 3900 tonnes for each specific carbon credit price.

Moreover, Table 3 and Fig. 3
                         suggest that the impact of the carbon credit price on shareholder wealth relies on the carbon emission cap laid down by regulatory agencies. When the carbon emission cap is large enough, such as K = 3500 tonnes, the shareholder wealth would increase with the carbon credit price. However, if the carbon emission cap is a bit lower, such as K = 3100 tonnes, the shareholder wealth would have a negative relationship with the carbon credit price. Fig. 3 also demonstrates that given a specific carbon credit price, higher carbon emission caps may help increase the shareholder wealth for business owners.

These analysis results highlight the significance of ETS to production planning. The practical implications are also straightforward. As a matter of fact, the higher the carbon credit price, the more weight of carbon emission would be on production planning of a firm. As such, the firm would have to focus on operations optimisation, as well as concern more about its carbon emissions. Consequently, a higher carbon credit price produces less carbon emissions.

Also, increasing the carbon emission cap can directly raise the tradable carbon credits, leading to enhancement of shareholder wealth. Such effect becomes more remarkable in the case of higher carbon credit prices.

It can therefore be observed from these numerical results that the environmental regulators need to price carbon credits, as high as practicable, to motivate business management to pay more attention to their carbon emission problem involved in operations. Furthermore, the carbon emission cap has to be set above a base minimum, in order to avoid undermining business profitability that would likely lead to the owners’ inaction in manufacturing and subsequently economic depressions.

While in pursuit of shareholder wealth, a firm should also manage its risk factors, especially in unstable operations circumstances and market fluctuations. Management should focus mainly on the factors with higher risks, rather than on a myriad of trivial ones. As such, the last study analyses the environmental and economic hedging capabilities of the proposed model against risk factors.


                           Eq. (28) implies that the globally optimal lot size relies merely on the operational parameters for CEM, and has no relationship with other economic factors and ETS.

To test the environmental sensitivity to risk factors, thus, we only need to consider

                           , the operational stability in the gathering and processing stages has a much larger influence on the optimal lot size and thus on the resultant minimum carbon emissions than the setup stage. It suggests that the management should put more attention on batch gathering and processing of orders than batch setup, in order to effectively curb its carbon emissions.

The first derivatives are not feasible for the economic hedging capability analysis. We instead adopt a popular risk analysis method—the sensitivity analysis, to provide managerial guidance on the susceptibility of CFROI to risks.

We first need to determine which risk factors to change and by how much. We are interested in

K, c, s, h, and ω, due to their susceptibility to market and operations changes. The first three parameters denote the operational stability of the manufacturer, while K and c represent the ETS market. The remaining three factors represent the cost structure of the manufacturer.


                           Table 4 lists the base values of these risk factors for the sensitivity analysis. The CFROI is recalculated by changing one factor from its base value either to a higher value (10 percent higher than base value) or a lower case value (10 percent less than base value), using the analytical approaches applied in the previous two studies, with the results listed in Table 5.

It can be seen in Table 5 that the firm's shareholder wealth is most sensitive to changes in its cost structure and swings of the ETS market. There is a positive relationship between the shareholder wealth and the carbon emission quota K and the carbon credit price c. In contrast, there exists a negative link between the shareholder wealth and its cost structure, implying that higher costs can undermine the profitability of shareholders and verse versa. Also, larger uncertainties in operations may impose adverse impacts on interests of equity holders, even though such impacts seem insignificant.

The managerial implications of this study are straightforward. From the environmental perspective, management needs to focus more on its operations stability, especially those in the gathering and processing stages, such as machine breakdowns or inexperienced operators, to effectively curb the carbon emissions. Comparably, from the economic perspective, management should pay more attention to the ETS market and to its cost structure. Management should promptly adjust its operations strategies to the changes in these risk factors to achieve the best environmental and economic operations performance.

With the successive enactment and effective enforcement of laws and regulations pertinent to carbon emission, businesses have to consider carbon management in their production planning.

This paper explores optimisation of lot sizing with carbon emission management in a stochastic MTO manufacturing environment, aimed to maximise the shareholder wealth in terms of CFROI. The impacts of the ETS mechanism on lot sizing, carbon emissions, and shareholder wealth are examined. Several relevant numerical studies are conducted to validate the proposed manufacturing optimisation model and to highlight the important significance of carbon management in both manufacturing optimisation and environmental protection. Theorems are proved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving globally optimal solutions.

The numerical experiments reveal that incorporation of carbon management into production management does not only increase the shareholder wealth, but also helps reduce carbon emission dramatically. This highlights the importance of carbon management to both business interests and environmental protection. Thus, manufacturing management should focus more on the interaction between its carbon emission trading and operational decisions when the ETS is available.

More importantly, environmental regulators should price carbon credits as high as practicable to motivate manufacturing management to consider carbon emissions in production planning. Carbon emission caps seem to have no impact on both lot sizing and carbon emissions. However, they should preferably be set above some project-specific base lines, in order to avoid undermining profitability and thus businesses’ initiatives to mitigate carbon emissions.

Risk analyses test the susceptibility of shareholder wealth and carbon emissions to operations and market swings, as well as to highlight the importance of hedging capability against various risks. The result shows that the shareholder wealth is most sensitive to the ETS market and the manufacturer's cost structure, while the impacts of operational stabilities on the shareholder wealth seem negligible. In contrast, carbon emission volume is dependent merely on the manufacturing environment, and is not affected by the ETS market and other economic factors.

Several potential extensions to the current research work are being considered. The lot sizing model may be extended to cope with a multi-item, multi-machine stochastic manufacturing environment, while multi-stage stochastic programming may be adopted for periodic accounting purposes. In addition to the lot sizing policy, other criteria such as throughput rate may be incorporated for carbon management. Moreover, extending carbon management into an entire supply chain may be considered. Finally, the two limitations discussed in Section 1.3 would also be worth addressing in future research.
