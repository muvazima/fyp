                  Introduction
                  Paroxysmal versus persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) can be distinguished based on differences in the spectral parameters of fractionated atrial electrograms. Maximization of these differences would improve characterization of the arrhythmogenic substrate. A novel spectral estimator (NSE) has been shown previously to provide greater distinction in AF spectral parameters as compared with the Fourier transform estimator. Herein, it is described how the differences in NSE spectral parameters can be further improved.
               
               
                  Method
                  In 10 persistent and 9 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing electrophysiologic study, fractionated electrograms were acquired from the distal bipolar ablation electrode. A total of 204 electrograms were recorded from the pulmonary vein (PV) antra and from the anterior and posterior left atrial free wall. The following spectral parameters were measured: the dominant frequency (DF), which reflects local activation rate, the DF amplitude (DA), and the mean spectral profile (MP), which represents background electrical activity. To optimize differences in parameters between paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients, the NSE was varied by selectively removing subharmonics, using a threshold. The threshold was altered in steps to determine the optimal subharmonics removal.
               
               
                  Results
                  At the optimal threshold level, mean differences in persistent versus paroxysmal AF spectral parameters were: ΔDA=+0.371mV, ΔDF=+0.737Hz, and ΔMP=−0.096mV. When subharmonics were not removed, the differences were substantially less: ΔDA=+0.301mV, ΔDF=+0.699Hz, and ΔMP=−0.063mV.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  NSE optimization produces greater spectral parameter difference between persistent versus paroxysmal AF data. Quantifying spectral parameter differences can be assistive in characterizing the arrhythmogenic substrate.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fractionated atrial electrograms are useful to characterize the arrhythmogenic atrial fibrillation (AF) substrate for catheter ablation [1–4]. Since fractionated electrograms are complex, frequency analysis is often used for characterization [4]. It has been shown that there are significant differences in the spectral parameters of paroxysmal versus persistent AF electrograms. It would be desirable to maximize these differences to best characterize the arrhythmogenic substrate, which may lead to improved catheter ablation paradigms. A novel spectral estimator (NSE) has been shown to provide greater distinction in spectral parameters acquired from paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients, as compared with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method [3]. The NSE has additional advantages as a spectral estimator over the DFT for certain applications, including robustness to noise and phase jitter [1–3]. It has also been used to successfully discern ventricular tachyarrhythmias at onset in canine postinfarction studies [5]. However, the NSE suffers from the presence of significant cross-terms and subharmonics, which changes the spectral background level and is therefore undesirable during spectral parameter measurement. In prior work, these components were removed by imparting antisymmetry to all basis vectors used to form the NSE power spectrum [2,4]. In so doing, subharmonics were eliminated. This resulted in some improvement in the ability of NSE parameters to discern fractionated electrograms recorded from paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients. Yet, antisymmetry was imparted indiscriminately to all basis vectors used to generate the power spectrum. In the current study, we sought to determine whether selective impartation of antisymmetry could improve the ability of NSE to discern fractionated electrograms acquired from persistent versus paroxysmal AF patients.

The data used for this study was obtained retrospectively with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). Patients were referred to the CUMC cardiac electrophysiology laboratory for catheter ablation of AF, and electrograms were recorded from the distal bipolar ablation catheter. The data from nine clinical patients with paroxysmal AF, having normal sinus rhythm as their baseline cardiac rhythm, were studied. In these patients, AF was induced by burst pacing from the coronary sinus or from the right atrial lateral wall. For data collection, the AF episode was required to continue for at least 10min. Ten other patients had longstanding persistent AF without interruption for several months to many years prior to catheter mapping and radiofrequency ablation. For all patients, bipolar atrial mapping was performed using a NaviStar ThermoCool catheter, 7.5F, 3.5mm tip, with 2mm spacing between bipoles (Biosense-Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, USA). The electrogram recordings used for analysis were acquired from the distal ablation electrode using the General Electric CardioLab system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The analog signals were filtered at acquisition from 30 to 500Hz with a single-pole bandpass filter to remove baseline drift and high frequency noise. The filtered signals were digitally sampled at 977Hz and stored. Although the high corner of the bandpass filter was slightly above the Nyquist frequency, negligible signal energy resides in this range [1]. Only atrial recordings identified as fractionated electrograms by two cardiac electrophysiologists were included for retrospective analysis. Fractionated electrogram recordings were obtained from two sites outside the ostia of each of the four pulmonary veins. Recordings were also obtained from the mid-posterior atrial wall, and from the anterior ridge at the base of the left atrial appendage. A total of 204 recording sequences of length greater than 16s were analyzed from all patients.

                         of those NSE basis vectors with highest power are summed, the resulting reconstruction has less error as compared with the same number of Fourier basis vectors of largest magnitude used for reconstruction [1]. The Fourier basis is sinusoidal and antisymmetric, while NSE basis vectors are data driven. Due to the lack of antisymmetry, cross-terms and subharmonics can be present in the NSE power spectrum, which are sometimes significant. To eliminate subharmonics, the signal averages can be made antisymmetric. Suppose:

Hence, the presence of half frequency subharmonics are eliminated by making signal averages 
                           e
                        
                        
                           w
                         antisymmetric with respect to their second harmonic. Similarly, one-third frequency subharmonics can be eliminated by making all signal averages antisymmetric with respect to their third harmonic, and so on for elimination of higher harmonics [4].

A difficulty with the above implementation is that it does not discern the presence of actual second harmonics (i.e.,

In prior work, antisymmetry was imparted to all basis vectors that were used to form the NSE power spectrum [2,4]. However, by selectively adding antisymmetry only to those signal average vectors that are truly subharmonics, the NSE power spectrum is likely to be improved, because only redundant components are eliminated. This can be done by comparing

                           w/2 with a similarity function, and then using a threshold level of similarity to decide whether to impart antisymmetry to a particular signal average vector. The following similarity measure was used for comparison:

The following threshold levels of similarity were used to determine which signal average vectors should be rendered antisymmetric: T
                        
                           sim

                           sim

                        =2.5, to a first approximation, antisymmetry was added to all signal average vectors, since the maximum value of sim in Eq. (14) will rarely exceed 2.5. Among the range of threshold values, it was determined which provided the best improvement to NSE spectra, according to comparative tests of spectral parameters, which presumably would be the level at which actual second harmonics, but not other components, are removed by imparting antisymmetry to

To determine improvement in NSE spectra with respect to differing threshold levels T used to impart antisymmetry, the following spectral parameters in the electrophysiologic range of 3–12Hz were measured: the dominant frequency (DF), which is the frequency of the maximum spectral peak that is a fundamental frequency, the dominant amplitude (DA), which is the amplitude of this spectral peak, and the mean spectral profile (MP) which is the average spectral level after the magnitude is normalized to a range of 0–1 [4]. These parameters were measured at recordings from all six anatomical recording locations (four pulmonary vein antra and anterior and posterior left atrial free wall). Fractionated electrograms from two recording sites at each of the anatomical locations were analyzed over intervals of 8192 sample points (8.4s) from the 10 persistent and 9 paroxysmal AF patient data sequences. Means and standard deviations in parameter values were then calculated. The means, differences in means between paroxysmal and persistent AF patients, and the significance of the differences using the unpaired t-test, were determined. Statistical calculations were made using MedCalc (ver. 9.5, 2008, MedCalc Software bvba, Mariakerke, Belgium) with a value p
                        <0.05 indicating significance.

                      used for NSE power spectral estimation are shown in Fig. 1A. The data was generated from a fractionated electrogram recording acquired from the left superior pulmonary vein antrum in a persistent AF patient. The black trace does not have a strong second harmonic component as compared with the red trace. This is evident in panels B and C, respectively. In panel B, the two halves 
                        a

                        b
                     
                     
                        w/2, from Eq. (8), are very dissimilar. However in panel C, the two halves 
                        a
                     
                     
                        w/2 and 
                        b
                     
                     
                        w/2, from Eq. (8), are similar, i.e., there is a strong second harmonic component. Therefore it would be advantageous to impart antisymmetry to the red trace of panel A, and by so doing remove the evident second harmonic, but to not impart antisymmetry to the black trace. This was done in the study by optimizing the threshold level of similarity for antisymmetry impartation, as given by Eq. (14).

Mean values of NSE spectral parameters are shown in Tables 1 and 2
                     
                     . Values for persistent AF are shown in Table 1. The threshold level T is given in the left-hand column. The mean±standard deviation for DA, DF, and MP are noted. As given in the bottom row, mean values for all threshold levels are DA=1.764±0.110mV, for DF=6.246±0.024Hz, and for MP=0.336±0.044 normalized units. By comparison, mean values for paroxysmal AF spectral parameters are shown in Table 2. As given in the bottom row, mean values for all threshold levels are DA=1.437±0.084mV, for DF=5.585±0.057Hz, and for MP=0.394±0.047 normalized units. Thus on the average, persistent AF patients have larger DA, higher DF, and lower MP as compared with paroxysmal AF patients. This is in accord with prior work and reflects the greater instability in paroxysmal AF data [2,4].

In Table 3
                     , the differences in DA spectral parameter for persistent versus paroxysmal AF are shown. For clarity, differences are noted separately for all anatomical locations. The threshold level of similarity T, from Eq. (14) (unitless), for imparting antisymmetry is provided in the left-hand column, while the mean value of difference for all anatomical locations is shown in the right-hand column. Based on the mean value for all anatomical locations, a threshold level T
                     =0.20 or 0.30 provides for the best difference in this parameter (0.371mV). This means that on the average for this threshold level, the DA for persistent AF is 0.371mV greater than for paroxysmal AF. Similarly, in Table 4
                     , difference values are shown for the DF spectral parameter at all threshold levels T and all anatomical locations. Based on the mean value for all anatomical locations, a threshold level T
                     =0.40 provides the best difference in this parameter (0.737Hz). This means that on the average for this threshold level, the DF for persistent AF is 0.737Hz greater than for paroxysmal AF. Also, in Table 5
                     , difference values are shown for the MP spectral parameter at all threshold levels T and all anatomical locations. Based on the mean value for all anatomical locations, a threshold level T
                     =0.20 results in the best difference in this parameter (−0.096 normalized units). This means that on average, the MP for persistent AF is 0.096 spectral magnitude units less than for paroxysmal AF.

For better visualization, the mean differences in all spectral parameters (right-hand columns in Tables 3–5) are graphed in Fig. 2
                      to five decimal places. The maximum difference for each parameter occurs in the range of approximately T
                     =0.2–0.4, as was evident from Tables 3 to 5. Thus using a single threshold level of T
                     =0.3 for imparting antisymmetry would be expected to provide the best improvement in the difference in persistent versus paroxysmal spectral parameters. Tables 3–5 and Fig. 2 however, only account for differences in mean values of spectral parameters, not the standard deviation. To account for both differences in mean and standard deviation, the average significance of the spectral parameter differences based on the unpaired T-test for all anatomical locations and threshold levels T are plotted in Fig. 3
                     . Smaller value of P indicates trending toward significant difference at individual anatomical locations. Although differences in P values between individual locations were usually not significant, they trended toward significance (P
                     <0.2 at the global minimum value in each panel) for threshold levels T in the range 0.2–0.4 (Fig. 3). A trend toward significance, rather than actual significance, is attributable to the fact that there were only N
                     =20 persistent versus N
                     =18 paroxysmal recordings from all patients for each anatomical location (two recording sites at each location). Thus based on both means and P values, a threshold level of 0.3 for imparting antisymmetry would be expected to most improve the difference in persistent versus paroxysmal spectral parameters. Although not shown, differences at the right superior PV (all parameters) and at the left superior PV (DF and MP) were significant at the optimal threshold level (P
                     <0.05).

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this study parameters derived from a new spectral estimator were used to distinguish fractionated electrograms acquired from paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients. The parameters extracted were the DA, DF, and MP, which have been used successfully in prior studies to analyze differences in these two AF types [2,4]. In contrast to the DFT spectral estimator, which uses a sinusoidal basis that is naturally antisymmetric, the NSE basis is data-driven and is not initially antisymmetric. Antisymmetry can be imparted to the NSE basis, however, by removing an average signal 
                           m
                         from the signal mean vector 
                           e
                        
                        
                           w
                        . To impart antisymmetry so as to remove the second harmonic, as was done in this study, the two halves of the signal mean vector are averaged, and then this average vector 
                           m
                        
                        
                           w/2, having length w/2, is subtracted from each half of 
                           e
                        
                        
                           w
                        . Thus 
                           e
                        
                        
                           w
                        , which can be considered a subharmonic of 
                           e
                        
                        
                           w/2, can be substantially reduced in power. In prior studies [2,4], only two modes of NSE analysis were used: 1. antisymmetry was not imparted to any of the signal average vectors used to form the NSE power spectrum, and 2. antisymmetry was imparted to all of the signal average vectors used to form the NSE power spectrum. For the present study, it was hypothesized that an intermediate level of added antisymmetry might provide an improved discriminative capability to the estimator. Using a threshold level of similarity, varied in steps, the optimal threshold value was determined as that level which most increased the differences, and the significance of the differences, in NSE spectral parameters when comparing fractionated electrograms acquired from paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients. Using both the mean difference and the mean significance of the difference (P value), a global optimal threshold range was found to exist in the range T
                        =0.2–0.4 (Figs. 2 and 3) for the similarity measure that was developed during the study (Eq. (14)).

Fractionated atrial electrograms are a potential target for radiofrequency catheter ablation in AF patients [6]. The fractionated atrial electrograms tend to be observed at more spatial locations in those patients with persistent as compared with paroxysmal AF [6]. Thus the use of spectral analysis of fractionated electrograms for targeting arrhythmogenic regions may have greatest efficiency in persistent AF patients. It has be found possible to achieve modest long-term efficacy by ablating left atrial sites in persistent AF patients at regions with fractionated atrial electrograms [7]. This may help to eliminate the rapid electrical activity that can occur at the pulmonary veins, and the macroreentrant circuits that may be present in the left atrial free wall [7]. Elsewhere it has been found that the most fractionated atrial electrograms occur at the outer boundary of the area with highest DFmax 
                        [8]. This area with greatest presence of fractionated electrograms is also the area with the highest variability in the electrical activity pattern [8]. Therefore it may be that areas of sharp DF change, rather than the actual value of DF itself, are important to characterize AF, as is the case when mapping ventricular tachyarrhythmias [5]. Mapping at a higher spatial resolution in future studies may be of potential importance to identify such boundary regions with differing properties as measured by spectral parameters, which are potential target areas for ablation. Since the electrical activity is more variable at these regions, ablation there may be assistive in preventing the electrical impulse from traveling in random directions, so that the randomness of the atrial electrical activity during AF is reduced.

The intervals used for spectral analysis in our study, 8s, were in accord with prior observations for best time duration to analyze these signals [9,10]. The spectral parameters that were used, in addition to having the capability to discern electrograms by AF type, are in part correlated to electrophysiologic activity. The DF correlates well with, but does not specifically reflect, the rate of atrial electrical activity [11]. This may be due in part to the fact that the DF is significantly impacted by frequency variation over time, to variation in the amplitude of electrogram deflections, and even to the ordering of the time interval between the electrogram deflections [11]. Therefore, removal of extraneous influences on the power spectrum, as was done in the present study, is important to detect intrinsic differences in fractionated electrograms. The MP parameter is indicative of the background level of atrial electrical activity, and may reflect the degree of randomness in the far-field electrical activity, though this would need to be shown in future work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

By selectively imparting antisymmetry to the data-driven basis used to form the NSE power spectrum, it is possible to improve the ability of spectral parameters to distinguish fractionated electrograms acquired from paroxysmal versus persistent AF patients. The selection can be based on the ratio shown in Eq. (14). By varying the threshold for selection, efficacy at particular threshold levels can be tested. The best threshold is chosen as that level at which the mean difference in spectral parameters, and the mean significance of the difference, is maximized when comparing paroxysmal versus persistent AF fractionated electrograms (Figs. 2 and 3). With more observations, it may be possible to achieve significance in the differences at more anatomical locations, and therefore to more accurately assess the alterations in spectral parameters that occur at differing anatomical locations in the left atrium of AF patients. This is potentially useful for guiding the radiofrequency ablation catheter in AF patients undergoing electrophysiologic study and treatment.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

There was a relatively small number of fractionated electrogram signals that could be analyzed from each of the anatomical locations. This may have contributed to the limited number of significant differences at individual anatomical locations (Fig. 3). Increasing the number of observations can improve significance. Still, Fig. 3 indicates that there is a definite global minimum P value in the threshold range T
                        =0.2–0.4.
