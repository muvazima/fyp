@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The most commonly used and recommended scheme for the present and the future wireless communication applications is the Code Division Multiple access scheme (CDMA). The reason is its capability to offer various advantages like ability to support many users through use of the orthogonal spreading sequence, alleviation of cross-cell interference (CCI), mitigation of multi-path fading effect etc. Direct sequence (DS) spectrum techniques form the basis of CDMA and it uses the orthogonal spreading sequence to distinguish multi-user signals. This has been a topic for deliberation in various wireless standards like IS-95 CDMA Technology, Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS) and CDMA 2000. The superior BER performance of the Multi-Carrier (MC) DS-CDMA systems has been demonstrated by Kondo and Laurence [1], in interference limited wireless channels. Mohammed S. Aljerjawi and Walaa Hamouda have demonstrated its better performance for a single carrier multi-user MIMO assisted DS-CDMA when communicating over Rayleigh Fading Channels [2]. The performance of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) Multi- user detection (MUD), in MC-DS-CDMA systems has been addressed in [3]. Zhang and Hanzo [4] have elucidated and demonstrated the characteristics of a single and MC-DS-CDMA system. The validation of the performance of successive interference cancellation technique for DS-CDMA system with transmit diversity has been carried out by Li and Aaron in [5]. Improvisation to the BER performance of multi-user transmitter pre-processing (MUTP) assisted MC-CDMA can be done by using cooperative diversity despite the situation of a mobile station (MS) far away from the base station (BS) in the context of downlink transmission. This fact was studied and demonstrated in [6]. The greater performance of the relay aided downlink (DL) DS-CDMA system with MUTP in terms of achievable BER has been explicated by Murali et al. [7].

A significant improvement of the spectral efficiency of a wireless system is possible through increase in the number of antennas in the system without, however, any increase in the spectrum utilization and transmit power. A huge potential to enhance the capacity of a system is found in the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration that uses a sizable number of antennas distributed in space. The two interesting features offered by MIMO configuration are spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity. The vertical Bell laboratories layered space time (VBLAST) architecture [8], transmitting multiple data streams simultaneously over all antennas, is an example of spatial multiplexing. A high data rate can be provided by VBLAST-MIMO without increasing the bandwidth and also cost of substantial decoding complexity. But, inter-channel interference (ICI) and inter-antenna interference are causes for performance degradation in this system.

The space-time block codes (STBC) [9,10], deployed for achievement of maximum attainable diversity order is an example of spatial diversity. A full rate and diversity can be provided by the Alamouti orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) [9], for two transmit antennas. However, when the number of antennas is increased, the overall system performance is affected due to channel correlation properties. Channel correlation occurs due to small antenna spacing and rich scattering environment in the wireless channel [11]. Approximately tens of wavelengths antenna spacing in the base station (BS) [12], and about half-wavelength antenna spacing at the MS for an uni-polarized antenna are needed to achieve the desired gain for MIMO systems. Deployment of multiple antennas is not an easy task in communication environment. Due to spacing limitations however, this spacing issue is addressed by a dual-polarized antenna wherein, a single dual-polarized antenna replaces two spatially separated antennas. Thus a high degree of spectral efficiency is obtained by utilizing a smaller number of physically reliable antenna elements. In the dual polarized structure, the user can simultaneously transmit two independent symbols on the same carrier frequency and bandwidth through the orthogonal polarization technique. The signal energy present in the orthogonal polarization is very small when compared to the energy in polarization of the transmitting antenna, under general LOS channel conditions. SNR penalties and multiplexing deficits are incurred by single-polarized antenna array configurations of MIMO systems when compared with dual-polarized cases. This is particularly pertaining to LOS channel conditions and for random orientations of the mobile antenna. This causes a reduced signal power level at the mobile unit which significantly degrades the BER performance. The polarization diversity gain is evaluated for both LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) environments and is compared with space diversity, for different inclinations of the mobile antenna [13]. The mobile antenna inclination angle is reported as not having any effect on the polarization diversity gain, regardless of the polarization diversity scheme applied. The reduction of the installation cost and antenna element spacing is the main motivation for suing the dual-polarized antennas in multiple antenna system configurations.

Cross polar discrimination (XPD) and envelope correlation coefficient can be used to describe the characteristics of polarization diversity. The power imbalance between the co-polarized and cross-polarized pairs has been shown to be typically 6 - 14dB through experimental studies on the measurements of XPD [14,15]. The density of the obstacles in the propagation environment which causes depolarization of the signal influences the XPD parameter value. This depolarization causes coupling of certain energy into the orthogonal polarization. Observations show an increase in XPD for LOS environments and a decrease with increase in distance [14]. Even in a LOS scenario, the correlation coefficient is found to be lower than 0.7 [16]. Almost the entire energy lost due to antenna inclination angle on the vertical branches, can be recovered from the horizontal branch [17, Table-I]. Sub-channel power losses, are present in the MIMO configuration with dual-polarized antenna structure that causes a reduction in performance due to an imbalance of power between orthogonal sub-channels, for an inclination angle

                     . The performance of a dual-polarized MIMO-Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) using an iterative decoding algorithm has been explicated in [18]. The authors have shown that, a higher throughput can be obtained through consideration of the DSTTD system even with a reduced size of the mobile unit. In [19], the authors have investigated the capacity analysis for Uplink transmission in IEEE 802.22 cognitive Radio network standard. The authors in [20] have investigated the performance of IDMA using turbo code for the mitigation of multiple access interference(MAI) and CCI in the context of DL communication.

The performance of dual and triply polarized MIMO systems for SDMA has been investigated in literature [12]. In this paper, we make a study and analyze the performance of a triply-polarized MIMO–CDMA system over correlated frequency-selective channels. We also implement a channel encoder using turbo code at the transmitter and a turbo decoding algorithm which is based on Log- maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) that considers both extrinsic and intrinsic information to estimate the desired user's signals. Furthermore BER performance of a single cell multi-user coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system is evaluated with MMSE receiver, considering the realistic channel model based on the Stanford University Interim (SUI) and Long-term Evolution (LTE) channel specifications.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: System configuration is described in Section-II. The detection algorithm is illustrated in Section-III. The performance of the proposed system is discussed in Section-IV. Section –V details the conclusions.

In a wireless medium, transmitted signals reach the receiver through multipath reflections and the scattering effect. Hence, there may be coupling between orthogonal polarizations resulting in depolarization. Cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is a measure to evaluate the depolarization effects.

Then the XPD for the fading part of the channel [15] is expressed as

Defining δ, 0 < δ ≤ 1, as the parameter which denotes the part of the radiated power that is coupled from vertical to horizontal polarization and vice versa, perfect discrimination between the vertical and horizontal polarization is possible if δ → 0 and a leakage between polarizations occurs for 0 < δ ≤ 1. Hence the XPD and δare related through Eq. (15).

In this contribution, we have assumed that the channel matrix that connects kth MS and BS is frequency-selective. The channel model assumed in our work is based on Standard University Interim (SUI) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel model specifications. The power delay profile for SUI and LTE channel model are summarized in the Table-1. The impulse response connecting jthreceive antenna and ith transmit is defined as

                     MMSE-OSIC Non-linear MUD
                  

At each MS, we implement non-linear MUD based on MMSE-OSIC detection algorithm for detection of the corresponding user symbols. Applying the MMSE-OSIC rule, we rank a set of all possible symbol decisions to the pre-computation of weight vectors [21]. We assume the availability of the perfect channel state information (CSI) at each MS. As we consider the Gaussian noise variance factor, MMSE-OSIC suppresses the Gaussian noise in addition to multi-user interference. The weight matrix in this case can be expressed as

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The computer simulation results of the proposed MIMO–CDMA system with SUI [22] and LTE [23] channel specifications is presented in this section. The channel model parameters are summarized in Table 1
                      and simulation parameters in Table 2
                     . A Doppler shift of 0.5Hz and 2.5Hz with antenna correlation of 0.7 and 0.3 are considered for SUI-1 and SUI-5 channel models [22] respectively. We presume a Doppler shift of 70Hz and 300Hz and mobile moving at velocity of 40.8km/hr and 162km/hr for LTE-typical urban channel model and LTE-extended vehicular, respectively [23]. Further 10,000 channel realizations for each value of SNR is considered. We realize parallel concatenated convolutional encoder with a rate of ½. Further, we consider the value for η to be 0.4. We have considered the spreading length as 64 and 50 users for our analysis. We have realized three iterations for the turbo decoder. We have realized triply-Polarized channel matrix (3×3 MIMO profile) by incorporating XPD, receive and transmit correlation matrices and polarization leakage matrix based on the Eq. (23).


                     Fig. 2
                      demonstrates the BER performance of un-coded triply-polarized MIMO–CDMA system for SUI-1 channel model with MMSE-OSIC receiver. The figure shows the un-coded system requiring an SNR of 23dB for the acquisition of a BER of 10−2.


                     Figs. 3
                      and 4
                      depict the BER performance of a triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system for SUI-1and SUI-5 channel specifications. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system with MMSE-OSIC algorithm provides a better BER performance with less SNR as compared to un-coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system.


                     Fig. 5
                      indicates the BER performance of a uni-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system for SUI-1 channel model. From the Figs. 3 and 5, it is observed that to achieve a BER of 10−4, this considered system with a uni-Polarized antenna requires 3dB and a triply-Polarized antenna requires 7dB for a SUI-1 channel specification.


                     Fig. 6
                      illustrates the performance of our considered system for a LTE typical urban channel environment. From the figure, we observe that our considered system requires 5.5dB to provide BER of 10−4.


                     Fig. 7
                      elucidates the performance of our considered system for a LTE -extended vehicular channel model. Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrate the achievement of a commendable performance for our considered triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system with a turbo code despite multi-path fading effects by the transmitted signals.


                     Fig. 8
                      expounds the comparison of BER performance of our considered turbo coded triply-Polarized MIMO–-CDMA system and uncoded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system with an MMSE-OSIC detector for DL communication. The figure shows on observation that our considered turbo coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system provides superior performance than the uncoded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system in the context of DL transmission.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have investigated the BER performance of a turbo coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system for frequency-selective channels based on SUI and LTE channel specifications in the context of DL communication. It is observed that the path-dependent Doppler and angle spread with rich scattering can degrade the BER performance of the system. Further the presence of MSI both at the transmitter side and receiver side also causes errors in the system. It is discerned from the results that our considered triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system with turbo style of iterative decoding algorithm achieves better BER performance with less SNR irrespective of the channel conditions while offering higher data rate with reduced size of mobile stations.
