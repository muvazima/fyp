                  We propose a measure of information gained through biometric matching systems. Firstly, we discuss how the information about the identity of a person is derived from biometric samples through a biometric system, and define the “biometric system entropy” or BSE based on mutual information. We present several theoretical properties and interpretations of the BSE, and show how to design a biometric system which maximizes the BSE. Then we prove that the BSE can be approximated asymptotically by the relative entropy D(fG
                     (x)∥fI
                     (x)) where fG
                     (x) and fI
                     (x) are probability mass functions of matching scores between samples from individuals and among population. We also discuss how to evaluate the BSE of a biometric system and show experimental evaluation of the BSE of face, fingerprint and multimodal biometric systems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Biometric identification systems, which automatically identify a person based on his/her physical or behavioral features, are widely used for various applications. To be used for personal identification, the biometric features are desired to satisfy the following requirements.
                        
                           1.
                           Uniqueness: Biometric feature has to be unique to each individual.

Stability: Biometric feature has to be unchangeable for each capture.

However most biometrics do not strictly satisfy these requirements, because of the following reasons. Even if feature data are extracted from the same body part of a person, they vary with each capture due to aging, position errors, distortion, measurement errors, environmental noise, and many other factors. These factors make it hard to satisfy the stability. Thus, it is general to consider that two features match when they are similar enough to each other, even if not exactly the same. However this fuzziness causes false matches of features extracted from different bodies; the requirement of uniqueness is also hardly to be satisfied.

Since these requirements are hard to be satisfied strictly for most biometric modalities (e.g., fingerprints, faces, vein patterns, irises, and so on), biometric systems inevitably make errors in identifying persons. Therefore it is important to evaluate the identification performance of biometric systems quantitatively.

Two kinds of error rates are widely used to evaluate the performance: false match rate (FMR) and false non-match rate (FNMR). FMR is a probability that two feature data extracted from different bodies match, and FNMR is a probability that two feature data from the same person do not match. There is a trade-off between these error rates depending on a threshold parameter t, which is described by a 2-D curve parametrized by (FRT(t),1−FNMRT(t)), called ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve [2]. Though the ROC curve describes the identification performance precisely, it is not straightforward to understand the ROC curve intuitively or to compare some biometrics with other method such as PIN code by using the ROC curve.

On the other hand, there has been some efforts to define and evaluate the individuality of biometrics from the viewpoint of information content or entropy [3–5]. Entropy as a measure of identification performance has the potential to make it possible to compare a certain biometrics (e.g. fingerprints) not only with another biometrics (e.g. irises) but also with PIN, passwords, and many other authentication methods. It has also the potential to enable us to quantify the degree of privacy of biometrics and compare it with other personal identification information such as name, address, birthday, etc. However, no common measure or methodology to evaluate the biometric entropy have been established so far which could be practically applicable to any kind of biometrics.

In this paper, we propose a measure of personally identifying information gained through biometric matching systems, and discuss a methodology of evaluation applicable to any kind of biometrics.

This paper is an extension of a previously published conference paper [1]. The main enhancements are as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           We discuss the relation between the BSE and the password entropy [6,7] and clarify that both are special cases of a measure of personal identification information defined based on mutual information (Section 3). This clarifies the fact that the BSE can make it possible to compare biometrics with other personal identification information such as names, addresses and PINs.

In [1], we showed some information theoretical and statistical properties of the relative entropy D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ) between a genuine score distribution fG
                               and an impostor score distribution fI
                              , which is the asymptotic approximation of the BSE. In this paper, we present stronger results: we directly show the properties of the mutual information I(U;
                                 X
                              ) between the user identity U and the set of scores 
                                 X
                              , which is the original definition of the BSE, instead of the approximated version (Section 4). These properties clarify the information theoretical and statistical meaning of the BSE more directly.

We show a relation between the BSE and the lower bound of the identification error probability or the Bayes error. The relation indicates that a biometric matching system with larger BSE has potential to achieve lower identification error (Section 4.4).

We prove an interesting fact that the maximum of the BSE with respect to a biometric matching system is equal to the Adler's biometric information (BI) of a system [4]. Furthermore we show how to design a biometric matching system so that the BSE achieves the BI of a system (i.e. the maximum value) (Section 5).

In [1], we showed that the BSE is asymptotically approximated by D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ). In this paper, we additionally proved that D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ) also gives a minimum upper bound of the BSE for a fixed system S (Section 6.2). This would help us to understand the meaning of D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ) as an approximation of the BSE.

We introduce a method of directly estimating the approximated BSE D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ) without estimating fG
                               and f
                              I using the generalized k-NN estimator [8], and use it in our experiments (Sections 7.1(2), 7.2).

We experimentally evaluate D(fG
                              ∥fI
                              ) of multimodal biometric systems, in addition to the fingerprint matching system and the face matching system. The results support the property of the BSE of the multimodal biometric system: it is less than or equal to the sum of the BSEs of the subsystems, and depends on the fusion function (Section 7.2).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a brief review of the previous works. In Section 3, we propose a new measure of information gained through biometric systems: “biometric system entropy” or BSE. Theoretical properties and interpretations of the BSE are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, we derive an asymptotic approximation and minimum upper bound of the BSE. In Section 6, we show how to evaluate D(fG
                     ∥fI
                     ) of a biometric system and show experimental evaluation of the BSE of face, fingerprint and multimodal biometric systems. Section 7, we summarize our results and conclusions.

One of the works to evaluate the biometric entropy is Daugman's approach to estimate the entropy of human irises [3]. He investigated a statistical distribution of Hamming distances between different irises, and approximated it using a binomial distribution

He called the parameter N discrimination entropy, and estimated N
                     =249.

Hidano et al. [5] generalized the Daugman's discrimination entropy to the minimum distance entropy (MDE) based on the Rényi entropy [9] (or collision entropy). The MDE can be applied to any kind of biometric feature and statistical model of distance distributions.

Both the discrimination entropy and the MDE can be expressed as −log2
                     P, where P is the probability that two features from different bodies match exactly. If the probability distribution of a feature is uniform, then P
                     =1/
                     M where M is the number of distinguishable features, and MDE=log2
                     M. In this meaning, they can be regarded as an index of uniqueness of biometric features.

However, the probability of exact match would largely depend on representation parameters of features such as length of iris codes [3] and resolution (or discretization width) of fingerprint minutiae coordinates (x, y)∈
                     ℝ
                     2 
                     [10]. Such representation parameters would not be essential elements of the individuality of biometrics unless, for example, the resolution is too low. Furthermore, as mentioned above, two biometric features (e.g., iris codes) rarely match exactly even if they are obtained from the same body. Namely, the discrimination entropy and the MDE do not reflect the deviation among features from the same body.

Adler et al. defined the “biometric information (BI) of a person” as the decrease in uncertainty about the identity of the person due to a set of biometric measurements, and proposed to use the following relative entropy (or Kullback–Leibler divergence) [11] as a measure of the BI [4].

                     where qi
                     (
                        b
                     ) is a distribution of biometric features 
                        b
                     
                     ∈
                     
                        B
                      (
                        B
                     : feature space) from a person whose identity is i (intra-class feature distribution), and qall
                     (
                        b
                     ) is one from the population (inter-class feature distribution). Since D(qi
                     ∥qall
                     ) varies from person to person, they also defined the “BI of a system” as the mean D(qi
                     ∥qall
                     ) for all persons in the population.

To evaluate the BI, the relative entropy D(qi
                     ∥qall
                     ) has to be estimated from a finite number of biometric samples. In general, however, the feature space 
                        B
                      is high dimensional, requiring an exponentially large number of samples to estimate qi
                     (
                        b
                     ), qall
                     (
                        b
                     ) and D(qi
                     ∥qall
                     ), as well known as the curse of dimensionality 
                     [12]. This problem is serious especially when collecting the samples from the individual feature distribution qi
                     (
                        b
                     ), because in practice, only a limited number of samples of each individual are available. To address this issue, Adler et al. assumed that 
                        B
                      is an n-dimensional Euclidean space, and qi
                     (
                        b
                     ),qall
                     (
                        b
                     ) can be modeled as Gaussian distributions of a limited form (with almost diagonal covariance matrix). In practical cases, however, qi
                     (
                        b
                     ), qall
                     (
                        b
                     ) cannot always be approximated by such a simple model. And further, the structure of 
                        B
                      is often more complicated (e.g. the feature space of the minutiae representation of fingerprints does not have a fixed dimension because the number of minutiae varies from finger to finger) or even unknown (e.g. when the evaluation is performed by a third party).

Bhatnagar et al. [13] considered a biometric verification system as additive white Gaussian noise channels (AWGN), where the genuine and impostor matching scores follow Gaussian distributions N(μ

However, the AWGN models of matching scores are rather strong assumptions; in general, they do not follow such simple models.

The purpose of this section is to provide a new measure of information gained through biometric systems, which can be applied practically to any kind of biometrics, even if the feature distributions or the structure of the feature space is unknown. Firstly, we discuss and define a measure of personally identifying information such as names, addresses, PINs and passwords. Next, we introduce a black box model of biometric systems and discuss how information about the identity of a person is derived through the biometric system, and define a new measure named biometric system entropy (BSE).

Let a be some (discrete) information about U, such as names, addresses, personal identification numbers (PIN), age, sex and so on, and A be a discrete random variable whose realization is a. We define a measure of personally identifying information of A as the average decrease in uncertainty about the identity of U due to an observation of a: the mutual information as follows:

The entropy H(A) is sometimes used as a measure of password strength [6,7], and called password entropy.

                           1
                           There also proposed several measures of password strength such as guessing entropy and min-entropy 
                              [6].
                        
                     

Note again, that in this case, I(U;A)=
                        H(A) holds because H(A|U)=0, which means that the password a does not contain any uncertainty if U
                        =
                        ui
                         is fixed. On the other hand, when a contains uncertainty even if U
                        =
                        ui
                         is fixed, such as the case of biometrics, then H(A|U)>0 and I(U;A)<
                        H(A).

We can see from the above observations that the password entropy is a special case of the measure of personally identifying information using mutual information. This fact will make it possible to compare the BSE defined below with the password entropy.

Before we go further, let us discuss the model of biometric systems. Our goal is to provide a measure of information gained through biometric matching systems applicable to any kind of biometrics regardless of feature representations or matching algorithms, i.e., without any knowledge of internal process of the system. To this end, we model a biometric system S as a black box system taking two biometric samples 
                           b
                        
                        1, 
                           b
                        
                        2
                        ∈
                        
                           B
                         as input and outputs the score x
                        ∈
                        ℝ.

                                    :
                                    B

                                          S
                                          
                                             
                                                b
                                                1
                                             
                                             
                                                b
                                                2
                                             
                                          
                                          =
                                          x
                                       
                                    
                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

The biometric samples 
                           b
                        
                        1,
                           b
                        
                        2 may be feature data or raw data, and the score x may be the similarity or the distance between 
                           b
                        
                        1 and 
                           b
                        
                        2. 
                           X
                         is a set of possible scores. For example, if x is a binary decision result, i.e., x
                        =0(OK) or x
                        =0 (NG), then 
                           
                              X
                              =

                                 1
                              
                           
                        , and if x is an integer between 0 and 100, then 
                           
                              X
                              =

                                 1
                                 ⋯
                                 100
                              
                           
                        . Note that, any of the internal process of the system is unknown.

Now, let us consider a measure of personally identifying information gained through the biometric system S. Suppose that a biometric sample 
                           b
                         of an unknown person U is observed for identification. 
                           b
                         alone does not tell us who U is: we have to compare 
                           b
                         with a biometric sample 
                           bi
                           
                         of each ui
                        
                        ∈
                        
                           U
                         using a biometric system S. Therefore, the information available to identify U is not 
                           b
                         itself, but the sequence of the output of S:

                                    ,

Let 
                           X
                         be a random variable whose realization is x. From these discussions, we define a measure of personally identifying information (potentially) gained through a biometric matching system S with regard to 
                           U
                         as
                           
                              (9)
                              
                                 
                                    BSE
                                    
                                       U
                                       S
                                    
                                    =
                                    I
                                    
                                       U
                                       X
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        and call it biometric system entropy (BSE) of S with regard to 
                        
                           U
                        .


                        BSE(
                           U
                        ,S)can be calculated based on the distributions of matching scores, i.e. the outputs of the biometric system S without knowing the distributions of biometric features, unlike the Adler's BI (Eq. (2)). Therefore, we can evaluate the BSE of any kind of biometric system, even if the structure of the feature space 
                           B
                         is complicated or even unknown, as is often the case. This will allow third parties to evaluate the BSE of any biometric system without knowing the internal details such as sensor specification, feature extraction and matching algorithms.

Furthermore, as we mentioned above, the BSE makes it possible to compare biometrics with passwords or PINs from the viewpoint of entropy.

In this section, we will show some properties and interpretations of the BSE. These properties serve as the information theoretical basis for using the BSE as a measure of identification performance of biometric systems.

                              with equality if and only if U and X are independent.

This property can be understood as follows: if U and 
                           X
                         are independent, i.e., p(
                           x
                        |ui
                        )=
                        p(
                           x
                        ) for all ui
                        
                        ∈
                        
                           U
                        , we cannot tell a person from another person by observing 
                           X
                        
                        =
                        
                           x
                        , therefore no information about the identity of U can be derived through the biometric system S. Otherwise a certain amount of information is obtained through S.

Let us consider two systems S

                        2, using different biometric modalities, e.g., fingerprints and faces, or fingerprints of forefingers and middle fingers, whose BSEs are I(U;X
                        1) and I(U;X
                        2), respectively. Let

From Eqs. (15) and (16) the theorem holds.□

This property indicates that the BSE of the multimodal biometric system S, which depends on the fusion function m, is less than or equal to the sum of the BSEs of the subsystems S
                        1 and S
                        2. By choosing an appropriate function m, the BSE of S can be maximized.

As described before, the ROC curve is typically used to describe the trade-off between FMR and FNMR of a biometric system [2]. Here, we discuss the relation between the ROC curve and the BSE.

Let us assume that the sequence of the matching score x
                        1, x
                        2,⋯, xN
                         in Eq. (8) are conditionally independent given u
                        ∈
                        
                           U
                        , and each xi
                         has the same probability mass functions (or PMFs) fG
                        (xi
                        ) if U
                        =
                        u
                        1 and fI
                        (xi
                        ) if U
                        ≠
                        ui
                        .

                           3
                           These assumptions that the matching scores are conditionally independent and identically distributed are often used in biometric identification, e.g. in [15,16],and work well.
                         We call fG
                        (x) a genuine score distribution and fI
                        (x) an impostor score distribution.

Furthermore, let us assume that 
                           b
                         and 
                           b
                           i
                         are decided to be “matched” if a matching score (distance) x
                        =
                        S(
                           b
                        ,
                           b
                           i
                        )is less or equal to a certain threshold t
                        ∈
                        
                           X
                        . Then, the FMR and FNMR with regard to t can be represented as FMR
                        =
                        FI
                        (t) and FNMR

The following theorem shows that the BSE has close relation to the ROC curve.

This theorem would strongly support the reasonability of using the BSE as a (single-valued) measure of the performance of S from the information theoretical point of view.

                              (when U is uniformly distributed).

This inequality indicates that the BSE I(U;
                           X
                        ) of S is closely related to the lower bound of error probability of biometric identification system using S.

In this section, we will show how to design a biometric matching system S which maximizes the BSE(
                        U
                     ,S). We first prove an interesting fact that the maximum of the BSE(
                        U
                     , S) with respect to a biometric system S is the Adler's biometric information (BI) of a system 
                     [4] reviewed in Section 2. We then provide a biometric system S whose BSE(
                        U
                     , S) achieves the maximum.

First of all, we formulate the Adler's BI of a system. We denote the Adler's BI of a system by BIsys
                        . Then, it can be written as follows:

This theorem states that if a biometric system S is designed so that a matching score S(
                           b
                        , 
                           b
                           i
                        ) can be mapped to the intra-class feature distribution qi
                        (
                           b
                        ) of u
                        i through some function λ, the BSE is maximized. In the following, we will show some examples of such a biometric system S.

Thus, in this case, if we design a biometric system S so that a matching score S(
                           b
                        , 
                           b
                           i
                        ) is the Euclidean distance between 
                           b
                         and 
                           b
                           i
                        , and 
                           b
                           i
                         is equal to 
                           μ
                           i
                        , then the BSE is maximized.

However, 
                           b
                           i
                         is not always a good estimation of 
                           μ
                           i
                        . Thus, if multiple biometric samples can be obtained from ui
                        , we can use their sample mean as 
                           μ
                           i
                        .

                                 i

                              , Σ) (Σ is a within-class covariance matrix [12] and can be estimated from multiple biometric samples from multiple users). Then, qi

In the same way as Example 1, if multiple biometric samples can be obtained from ui
                        , we can use their sample mean as

                     I(U;
                        X
                     ) directly as a measure. Firstly, it depends on the set of users 
                        U
                     
                     ⊂Ω. Remember, our goal is to provide a measure of information which can be derived through S; a measure depending only on S is preferable. Secondly, the mutual information I(U; 
                        X
                     ) itself is hard to calculate, especially when N is large.

To make the measure easy to evaluate, in this section, we consider an asymptotic approximation and a minimum upper bound of the BSE by accepting some assumptions.

Let 
                           U
                         be an arbitrary subset of Ω with cardinality N, and 
                           x
                        
                        =(x
                        1, x
                        2,⋯, xN
                        ) be the sequence of the output of S with regard to 
                           U
                        . The first assumption is that x
                        1, x
                        2,⋯,xN
                         are conditionally independent given u∈
                        
                           U
                        , and each xi
                         has the same PMFs fG
                        (x) if U
                        =
                        ui
                         and fI
                        (x) if U
                        ≠
                        ui
                        . This is the same assumption as in Section 4.3. Furthermore, we assume that fI
                        (x)>0 for all x
                        ∈
                        
                           X
                         i.e. 
                           X
                         is the support of fI
                        .

The second assumption is that the prior probability of U is uniform: p(ui
                        )=1/
                        N for all ui
                        
                        ∈
                        
                           U
                        .

Under these assumptions, from the symmetry of ui
                        
                        ∈
                        
                           U
                        , it is clear that BSE(
                           U
                        , S) depends only on N, i.e. the cardinality of 
                           U
                        , and S. Thus we denote BSE(
                           U
                        , S) by BSE(N, S). Now, we can prove the following theorem.

                        Fig. 2
                         shows the relationship between N and BSE(N, S) in the case with Bernoulli distributions: fG

                        p)1−
                           x
                        , fI
                        (x)=
                        qx
                        (1−
                        q)1−
                           x
                        , (x
                        ∈{0, 1}). Three curves correspond to different sets of parameter values: (p, q)=(0.9, 0.1), (0.95, 0.05) and (0.99, 0.01). Each curve exhibits that BSE(N, S) converges to D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ) as N increases. This shows that if the cardinality of 
                           U
                         is sufficiently large, BSE(N, S) can be approximated by D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ).


                        Theorems 6 and 7 show that the BSE(N, S) can be asymptotically approximated and upper bounded by the relative entropy of fG
                        (x) with respect to fI
                        (x). As fG
                         and fI
                         are one dimensional PMFs, it is not difficult to evaluate D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ). Therefore, we propose to use D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ) as a measure of information gained through S, and define

                        ∥fI
                        ) was also proposed by Sutcu et al. [21] as a measure of biometric information, at the same time as ours [1] (the preliminary version of this paper). However, they do not explain any meaning or theoretical foundations of using D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ) as a measure of biometric information. On the other hand, we define the BSE as a mutual information I(U; 
                           X
                        ), and explain the meaning from the viewpoints of information theory, statistics and comparison with the password entropy.

Before we go further, it may be worth discussing on the definition and approximation of the BSE in the continuous case where the matching score is a real number, i.e. 
                           
                              X
                              =
                              ℝ
                           
                        . Even in this case, we can define the BSE in a form consistent with that of discrete case (Eq. (4)).

Similarly, in the case of the BSE with continuous scores, it is easily confirmed that the discrete mutual information of U and the quantized scores fI
                         converges to the following value:

                           x
                        |u) is a conditional PDF of 
                           x
                         given u. Thus we can define the BSE(N, S) by the right hand of Eq. (58) in the continuous case. Eq. (58) corresponds to the last form of Eq. (4), and can be considered as a mutual information of the discrete random variable U and the continuous random variable 
                           X
                        .

We can prove the Theorems 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the case where 
                           X
                         is continuous. However, the detailed proof cannot be included here for lack of space. (Refer to [1] for the proof of Theorem 4 in the continuous case.) As for the Proposition 1, however, the proof in [17] is done only in the discrete case. Although the proposition would hold when 
                           X
                         is continuous, because I(U; 
                           X
                        ) in Eq. (58) is the limit of the discrete mutual information I(U; 
                           X
                        
                        Δ)—note that Proposition 1 holds for I(U; 
                           X
                        
                        Δ) for any Δ>0, the rigorous proof is beyond the scope of this paper.

Here we describe the evaluation procedure of the approximated BSE of a biometric system. The evaluation protocol consists of two steps: (1) data collection and (2) estimation of D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ).
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Data collection: This step follows the same procedure as general method of accuracy evaluation, e.g. described in [2].

Firstly, biometric samples from a sufficient number of subjects are collected. Let N be the number of subjects. From each subject, at least two samples, one for a template and the other for a verification sample, are collected. Let {
                                    b
                                 
                                 1
                                 
                                    t
                                 ,⋯,
                                    b
                                 
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 } be the set of templates and {
                                    b
                                 
                                 1,⋯,
                                    b
                                    N
                                 } be the set of verification samples. To increase estimation accuracy of D(fG
                                 ∥fI
                                 ), N should be as large as possible. The sufficient number N may depends on relative entropy estimators and the properties of the distributions fG
                                  and fI
                                 .

Relation between the number of samples and the accuracy of estimation is studied experimentally e.g. in [22–24,8].

                                 Estimation of D(fG

                                 . Let us assume that each x
                                 ∈
                                 XG
                                  is sampled independently from an unknown genuine distribution fG
                                 (x) and each x
                                 ∈
                                 XI
                                  is sampled independently from an unknown impostor distribution fI
                                 (x). Let N and M be the size of the score sets XG
                                  and XI
                                 , respectively.

If the score x is n-valued discrete variable and n is small, fG

                                 (x) can be easily estimated using histograms, and

                                  can be calculated numerically. For example, if x is a binary decision result 0 (match) or 1 (non-match), the distributions can be estimated as follows:

                         follows certain parametric models such as Gaussian and binomial distributions, it is not difficult to estimate the distributions using, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimation, and calculate D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ) analytically or based on numerical calculations.

However, in most cases the distributions of biometric matching scores do not follow simple parametric models. Thus, non-parametric estimation would be more reasonable. It should be noted that non-parametric entropy and diversity estimation from finite samples is a challenging problem, and many researchers in the field of machine learning have been studying on this problem [25]. Though it is not our present purpose to explore this area, we will present a brief overview of estimation approaches in the followings.

The traditional approach is to use histograms with equal-size bin to estimate the distributions and calculate the relative entropy numerically. Several studies take an approach of improving the histogram-based estimator by, e.g., adaptive partitioning [26] and data-dependent partitions [22].

On the other hand, Kozachenko and Leonenko [27] proposed a simple and sophisticated estimator of differential entropy with mean-square consistency using nearest neighbor (NN) method. Since then, several studies have been made on the NN entropy estimators such as [28,29]. These methods were generalized to relative entropy estimation in many studies such as [23,30,24] and shown to be powerful nonparametric techniques. Recently, Wang et al. [8] proposed the k-NN diversity estimator with asymptotic unbiasedness and mean-square consistency. Furthermore, the authors generalized the k-NN estimator and showed that it have better performance than other methods.

                        ≈0.577 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. It can be seen from Eqs. (63) and (64) that we can directly estimate D(fG
                        ∥fI
                        ) without estimating fG
                         and fI
                         by using the generalized k-NN estimator.

In our experiments, we used this generalized k-NN estimator to evaluate the approximated BSE.

We estimated the approximated BSE of the fingerprint and face matching systems of the NIST BSSR1 (Biometric Score Set—Release 1) database [31]. This database contains the face scores from two algorithms (“C” and “G”) and the fingerprint scores from the left and right index fingers, which is obtained from 6000 fingers. We used the face scores from the algorithm “C” and the fingerprint scores from left index fingers.

Furthermore, we considered multimodal biometric systems combining face and fingerprint matching systems. The score fusion function was constructed by (log) likelihood ratio as follows:

                        1 and x
                        2 are independent, the fusion function is optimal in the Neyman–Pearson sense as described in Section 4.2. We used (1) parametric method and (2) non-parametric method to estimate the distributions. As a parametric method, we used Gaussian distribution model and maximum-likelihood estimation. As for a non-parametric method, we used kernel density estimation (KDE) with Gaussian kernels and cross-validation bandwidth selection [12].


                        Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                         show the frequency distributions of the face and fingerprint matching scores. As the figures indicate, the scores, especially of the fingerprint matching, seems not distributed according to simple Gaussian distributions. Thus, we can expect that the multimodal system with KDE-based score fusion will have more approximated BSE than that of with Gaussian-based score fusion.


                        Table 1
                         shows the evaluation results of the BSE. From this result, we can say that the amount of information gained through the face matching system is more than that of 4-digit PIN (log2(104)=13.3bit) and less than 5-digit PIN (log2(105)=16.6bit). As for the fingerprint matching system, it is more than 5-digit PIN and less than 6-digit PIN (log2(106)=19.9bit).

Furthermore, as described in Section 4.2, the approximated BSE of the multimodal system is less than or equal to the sum of the ones of the subsystems, and depends on the score fusion function m. The experimental results support this fact. Furthermore, as we expected, the approximated BSE of the KDE-based multimodal system is larger than that of the Gaussian-based multimodal system.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we proposed a measure of information gained through biometric matching systems applicable to any kind of biometrics. Firstly, we defined the “biometric system entropy” or BSE of a system S as the average decrease in uncertainty about the identity of a person due to biometric verification using S. Then we proved that the BSE can be approximated asymptotically by the relative entropy D(fG
                     (x)∥fI
                     (x)) where fG
                     (x) and fI
                     (x) are PMFs of scores between samples from individuals and among population. We showed several theoretical properties and interpretations of the BSE. We also discussed how to evaluate D(fG
                     ∥fI
                     ) of a biometric system and showed a numerical example of face, fingerprint and multimodal biometrics systems.

The measure has the potential to make it possible not only to understand intuitively the identification performance of biometric systems from the viewpoint of information content, but also to compare biometrics with other authentication method such as passwords, or personal identification information such as name, address, birthday, and so on.
