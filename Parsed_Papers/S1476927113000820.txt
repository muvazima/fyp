                  The importance of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is becoming increasingly appreciated, as these interactions lie at the core of virtually every biological process. Small molecule modulators that target PPIs are under exploration as new therapies. One of the greatest obstacles faced in crystallographically determining the 3D structures of proteins is coaxing the proteins to form “artificial” PPIs that lead to uniform crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. This work compares interactions formed naturally, i.e., “biological”, with those artificially formed under crystallization conditions or “non-biological”. In particular, a detailed analysis of water molecules at the interfaces of high-resolution (≤2.30Å) X-ray crystal structures of protein–protein complexes, where 140 are biological protein–protein complex structures and 112 include non-biological protein–protein interfaces, was carried out using modeling tools based on the HINT forcefield. Surprisingly few and relatively subtle differences were observed between the two types of interfaces: (i) non-biological interfaces are more polar than biological interfaces, yet there is better organized hydrogen bonding at the latter; (ii) biological associations rely more on water-mediated interactions with backbone atoms compared to non-biological associations; (iii) aromatic/planar residues play a larger role in biological associations with respect to water, and (iv) Lys has a particularly large role at non-biological interfaces. A support vector machines (SVMs) classifier using descriptors from this study was devised that was able to correctly classify 84% of the two interface types.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Unraveling of the underlying principles governing protein association is central to the understanding of protein networks that define cell biology (Edwards et al., 2002; Aloy et al., 2004). Protein–protein associations found in extant structural data can be broadly categorized into two major categories: biological and non-biological. Biological associations are those that occur in nature, i.e., under more or less normal conditions, while non-biological associations are those that result from scientific intervention, e.g., under crystallization conditions with specific buffers and relatively high concentrations of only the protein of interest, and do not otherwise occur – at least lastingly – in nature.

According to Thornton, biological interfaces can be further classified based on their composition, affinity and/or lifetimes (Nooren and Thornton, 2003). Based on composition, protein–protein interfaces can be classified into homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes. Homo-oligomeric complexes are formed between two or more identical polypeptide chains and are usually symmetric, whereas hetero-oligomeric complexes are formed between polypeptide chains of different sequences (Goodsell and Olson, 2000). Another way of categorizing biological protein–protein interfaces is whether they are obligate or non-obligate. Obligate complexes are those where the protomers forming the complex are not found as stable structures on their own in vivo. Another definition is that, in obligate complexes, the involved protomers fold together to form the final complex, while in non-obligate complexes the protomers pre-fold before association.

Based on their lifetimes, non-obligate protein–protein complexes can be further classified into transient and permanent. In contrast to a transient interaction, which constantly associates and dissociates in vivo, a permanent interaction is usually very stable and the involved protomers only exist in their complexed form. Since the stability of any complex depends on the surrounding environment, a continuum exists between transient and permanent interactions. For example, an interaction that is mainly transient in vivo might become permanent under certain cellular conditions (Nooren and Thornton, 2003), e.g., ligand or cofactor association. Of importance for this report, this observation also can be construed to suggest that non-biological interactions are transient – only stabilized by crystallization.

It has been of great interest over the past two decades to examine and understand the differences between these various protein–protein interfaces. They have been subjected, thus, to many structural and computational analyses (e.g., Phizicky and Fields, 1995; Jeon et al., 2012; Grosdidier and Fernández-Recio, 2012). X-ray crystallography has been the tool of choice for most structural studies, as the size of protein–protein complexes is usually larger than what can be handled by NMR, although cryo-electron microscopy is also playing an increasingly important experimental role in understanding protein–protein interactions (Förster and Villa, 2010; Ritchie, 2008; Jones and Thronton, 1996; Keskin et al., 2008; Tuncbag et al., 2008). Even with this array of experimental methods, it is especially challenging to experimentally detect and characterize ephemeral biological transient complexes (Ozbabacan et al., 2011). Without adequate experimental data for design and training of computational methods, tools for prediction are, as a consequence, far from robust enough to predict protein–protein structures for these transient complexes. Indeed, a paramount goal of computational studies is to gain the requisite understanding of protein–protein structures of all classes so that predictive algorithms can be designed and implemented (Janin et al., 1988; Jones and Thronton, 1995; Conte et al., 1998; Mintz et al., 2005; Jones, 2012).

At the most basic level, analysis of the stability of discrete monomers extracted from complexes can give clues whether the resulting protein–protein complex is permanent or transient (Gunasekaran et al., 2004). However, other classifications of protein–protein interface types can be made with computational analyses that have focused on what can be learned from the sequences and folding of the interacting proteins. Using only the amino acid composition of a protein–protein complex, Ofran and Rost (2003) were able to statistically predict interface classes correctly in a high fraction of the studied cases. In fact, tools using only protein expression information have been shown to predict complex type even in the absence of a 3D structure (Jansen et al., 2002; Tirosh and Barakai, 2005; Zanivan et al., 2007).

There are differences in secondary structure between obligate and non-obligate complexes, including increased overall flexibility and fewer β-sheets in the latter, but more cysteine–cysteine disulphide bonds in the former (De et al., 2005). Salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds are more frequently found, and thus stabilize, transient complexes (Ozbabacan et al., 2011), while the contact area of interfaces in non-transient complexes is larger and they are more hydrophobic (Ozbabacan et al., 2011; De et al., 2005). The relative mobility of surface amino acids between bound and unbound states can be correlated with the interface type, size and obligate nature of the complex (Zen et al., 2010). Interacting protein subunits with similar surface roughness are more likely to form obligate complexes with better geometric complementarity between protomers (Bera and Ray, 2009). It is also possible, as shown by Garma et al. (2012), to identify quaternary fold families and categorize protein–protein interfaces on that basis.

Machine learning approaches have also been applied to this classification problem. Zhu et al. (2006) showed that biological interactions can be differentiated from non-biological (crystal lattice) contacts and that obligate can be differentiated from non-obligate interactions with support vector machine (SVM) classification with the NOXclass algorithm that utilizes six different attributes: (i) interface area, (ii) ratio of interface area to protein surface area, (iii) amino acid composition of the interface, (iv) correlation between amino acid compositions of the interface and of the overall protein surface, (v) interface shape complementarity and (vi) conservation of the interface. Other SVM-based classifiers purported to predict protein–protein interface types have fared more poorly (Ding et al., 2011), but using linear dimensionality reduction in conjunction with SVMs has had recent successes in these classifications (Aziz et al., 2011; Maleki and Rueda, 2011; Banerjee et al., 2012; Vasudev and Rueda, 2012). Lastly, atomic contact vectors representing the physicochemical characteristics of protein–protein interfaces have been used as metrics in machine learning algorithms to differentiate between transient recognition complexes and permanent oligomeric complexes (Mintseris and Weng, 2003).

All structure regimes, from primary (sequence) to quaternary, encode valuable information regarding the association of proteins to form protein–protein complexes, whether they are transient or permanent. Computational tools to analyze these structures, particularly those derived from X-ray crystallographic structure models, have been reasonably successful in retrospectively classifying interface types. However, all of the aforementioned studies have virtually ignored a key component of the reaction between protomers: the solvent. Just as exploiting water as a component in designing inhibitors for a single protein or enzyme target has become a consistent theme in structure-based drug design, proper understanding of the roles of water molecules in protein–protein complexes may lead to improved design of small molecule interaction inhibitors or modulators of these complexes, which is a burgeoning field (Robineau et al., 2000; Ravelli et al., 2004; Vassilev et al., 2004; Kar et al., 2012; Bienstock, 2012; Carry and Garcia-Echeverria, 2013; Walter et al., 2013; Azzarito et al., 2013; Szilágyi et al., 2013). Limited research to date has been devoted to studying the importance of water molecules in the function and association of protein–protein complexes. Of note, Baker has designed protein–protein interfaces incorporating explicit water molecules (Joachimiak et al., 2006; Meenan et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2008), and Janin has analyzed hydration (Janin, 1999; Dey et al., 2010; Rodier et al., 2005) in protein–protein structure and interactions. Exploitation of water has been suggested to be an alternative strategy used by proteins to achieve optimum association (Keskin et al., 2005; Keskin and Nussinov, 2007). A number of studies by Pisabarro and colleagues have begun to illustrate the roles played by solvent at protein–protein interfaces (Samsonov et al., 2008, 2009; Teyra and Pisabarro, 2007). While approaches for including water explicitly and implicitly in protein–ligand docking protocols (Jiang et al., 2005; van Dijk and Bonvin, 2006; Li and Lazaridis, 2007; Graaf et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 1998; Zuo et al., 2010) and in predicting positions of waters in protein systems (Young et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Goodford, 1985) have been reported, only very tentative steps for inclusion of water in protein–protein docking have been reported (Samsonov et al., 2011; van Dijk and Bonvin, 2006).

Hydropathy, i.e., the polarity/lipophilicity of biological molecules, is the major factor that stabilizes protein–protein association; thus, surface complementarity plays a selective role in defining which proteins may associate (Larsen et al., 1998). Not surprisingly, water – the key player in hydropathy – has significant and varied contributions to protein–protein binding mechanisms (Antonyuk et al., 2013). The most basic and obvious role is to bridge polar interactions that are either too distant or energetically unfavorable. But, because of entropy, water molecules are also important even when they are displaced! Water molecules were also found to be crucial in predicting hot spots (residues accounting for disproportionate binding free energy) in protein–protein complexes due to their displacement, which is a consequence of the hydrophobic effect (Oshima et al., 2011). Similarly, a recent review of polyproline recognition by protein–protein interaction domains showed that combining hydrophobic interactions with strong networks of water-mediated hydrogen bonds is a mechanism that has often been exploited to favor the adaptability and plasticity of different families of proteins (Zafra-Ruano and Luque, 2012).

In a recent study from our laboratory (Ahmed et al., 2011), a dataset of 179 high-resolution (<2.30Å) X-ray crystal structures composed of mainly biological hetero-protein–protein complexes with all hydrogens in optimized orientations, we reported that, of the 4741 interfacial water molecules: (a) 21% were involved in (bridging) interactions favorable with both proteins, (b) 53% were favorably interacting with only one protein, and (c) 26% had no favorable interactions with either protein. This trend was independent of crystallographic resolution, which supports the assertion that the majority of even the water molecules unfavorable with respect to both proteins are not crystallographic assignment errors or artifacts. It was also shown that the interactions of water molecules with residue backbones are consistent for all classes, accounting for 21.5% of all interactions, and that interactions with polar residues are significantly more common for bridging waters while interactions with non-polar residues dominate the last group. Water molecules that interact favorably with both proteins stabilize, on average, the protein–protein interaction by −0.46kcalmol−1, but overall, the average contribution of a single water molecule to the protein–protein interaction energy is negligible (+0.03kcalmol−1). Perhaps most interestingly, analysis of the waters without favorable interactions with either protein suggests that this is a conserved phenomenon: 42% of these waters have SASA ≤10Å2 and are thus largely buried within the protein–protein interface, and 69% of these are within predominantly hydrophobic environments or what we term “hydrophobic bubbles”. Such water molecules may have an important biological purpose in mediating and/or lubricating protein–protein interactions as previously suggested (Jones and Thronton, 1996).

These results were so fundamental and intriguing that we have expanded the investigation to a larger and more themed dataset in order to better understand roles of water molecules in forming the interfaces of, in this report, the two main classes of protein–protein complexes: biological and non-biological. This work describes a detailed analysis of interfacial water molecules found in 252 X-ray crystal structures of protein–protein complexes extracted from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (Keskin et al., 2008). Of the 252 structures, 140 are from biological homo-protein–protein complexes, while the remaining structures are from non-biological protein–protein interfaces, i.e., protein–protein interaction surfaces that are likely formed as a result of crystallization.

From a global perspective, we are comparing the exquisite “engineering” of Nature with man-made constructs. As motivation, Janin suggests that understanding and being able to predict non-biological associations could be key to discriminating inappropriate protein–protein binding that leads to disease (Bahadur et al., 2004). The surface structures of proteins were designed to achieve multiple goals such as giving them appropriate solubility, as well as providing recognition sites and surfaces for interaction. Does this set of properties give rise to unintended consequences when proteins associate in non-biological ways? In these contexts, our investigations of the role of water with respect to biological vs. non-biological protein–protein interactions should prove valuable.

The protein–protein complex dataset was obtained from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (Keskin et al., 2008) by applying search filters for several structural criteria. First, the structures were required to have only two separate identical protein entities in the asymmetric unit, where each contained at least 100 amino acids. Structures with either DNA or RNA were excluded, as were structures with sequence identity similarity >50% to another protein complex in the set. The dataset was restricted to structures with resolutions 2.3Å and better. This set of PDB structures consisted of protein complexes with both biological and non-biological interfacial interactions. Further screening of the structure description coded in the coordinate files isolated candidate protein–protein complexes for individual inspection; in particular, biological complexes were separated from non-biological complexes based on REMARK 350. Finally, 252 structures were randomly selected from this set for the present analysis. See Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2, for the list of the protein structures used in this study.

Then, using SYBYL-X 2.0 (Tripos LP, 2013, www.tripos.com, St. Louis, MO, USA), hydrogen atoms were added and minimized (Tripos forcefield, with Gasteiger–Hückel charges and distance-dependent dielectric) to a gradient of 0.01kcalmol−1
                        Å−1, while the positions of the non-hydrogen atoms were held fixed. Water molecules that were within 4.0Å from atoms on both of the interacting proteins were retained from each protein–protein complex as the water dataset of interest, which contains 4913 unique water molecules.

The surface composition analysis was performed with MOLCAD (in SYBYL-X 2.0). For the determination of interfaces’ atom composition, a MOLCAD separating surface was created between the two protomers of each protein–protein complex. Atoms within the Van der Waals radius (r
                        
                           vdW
                        ) of this surface were considered interfacial atoms and any amino acid with at least one atom within r
                        
                           vdW
                         of this surface was considered an interfacial amino acid. Interface areas were computed as the areas of the MOLCAD separating surfaces.

Each model contains two proteins and an array of solvents, and was analyzed with HINT (Kellogg and Abraham, 2000; Sarkar and Kellogg, 2010) by computing intermolecular scores between the proteins and the interfacial solvent arrays. The HINT score (H
                        
                           TOTAL

                         is a logic function assuming +1 or −1 values, depending on the polar (Lewis acid or base) nature of interacting atoms. HINT parameters and controls were as in previous studies (Spyrakis et al., 2007; Marabotti et al., 2008; Amadasi et al., 2006): partition calculations were performed with the “dictionary” method for the proteins with “essential” hydrogens, where polar hydrogens are treated explicitly and non-polar hydrogens are “united” with their parent non-polar heavy atom; the HINT option that corrects the S
                        
                           i
                         terms for backbone amide nitrogens by adding 30Å2 was used in this study to improve the relative energetics of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving these nitrogens. Water molecules are partitioned as a “solvent set” with analogous HINT parameters. Previous work (Cozzini et al., 2004; Burnett et al., 2001) has indicated that approximately 500 HINT score units correspond to −1.0kcalmol−1 of free energy.

Each crystallographically observed water's orientation was optimized by an exhaustive protocol (Kellogg and Chen, 2004) that maximizes the HINT score with respect to its surrounding environment by evaluating its interactions with a “receptor” created from atoms within 6.0Å. For water molecules, this optimization rewards hydrogen bond and acid/base interactions while penalizing acid/acid and base/base interactions and those with hydrophobic entities on either of the two protein surfaces. Hydropathic interaction analysis was then performed with HINT for each of the optimized water molecules with respect to the two proteins with which it interacts. Tables S3 and S4 in Supporting Information list each water molecule and its thus optimized score. The resulting data were tabulated by frequency and strength of interactions with each amino acid residue type. In cases where a water molecule had significant interactions (>|10| HINT score units, approximately |0.02|kcalmol−1) with more than one residue on a protein, that water's count was fractionally distributed to interacting residues based on the absolute values of the relative HINT scores for those residues that interact with it. Thus, the weighted counts (W) or frequency of observation for each residue type (i) are given by:

Similarly, the fractions of interactions with interfacial water molecules arising from backbone and sidechain atoms were calculated by weighted counts, with

Heat maps for frequency and interaction scores and map clustering were calculated and drawn with the gplots package (Warnes, 2013) in R (R Core Team, 2013, www.R-project.org). We used complete-linkage agglomerative clustering with the “Euclidian” distance type.

Rank represents the weighted number of potential hydrogen bonds for each water molecule with respect to a pseudo-receptor of atoms from the target molecule(s) surrounding the water. Rank is calculated as:

                         is the distance between the water's oxygen and the target's heavy atom n (n is the number of interaction hydrogen bond donor/acceptor (doneptor) targets up to a maximum of 4). This is scaled relative to 2.8Å, the presumed ideal hydrogen bond length. θ

                           nm

                        =
                        n to number of valid targets). The algorithm thus allows a maximum number of 4 doneptor targets (≤2 donors and ≤2 acceptors, i.e., like H2O). To properly weight the geometrical quality of hydrogen bonds, targets that have an angle less than 60° with respect to other (higher quality) targets are rejected (Kellogg and Chen, 2004) (See Tables S3 and S4.)

This relationship was derived for protein-ligand complexes with the expectation that water molecules with Relevance ≥0.5 would be conserved and those with Relevance <0.5 would be non-conserved because the waters analyzed in developing the training set were, by their nature, binary – either conserved and present in the ligand-bound complex or non-conserved and absent in the complex (See Tables S3 and S4.)

To see if a predictive model for interface class could be constructed from metrics within our analyses, the dataset was processed with the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA, v. 3.6.5), which is a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing tools including several algorithms for classification (Hall et al., 2009). All attributes that we collected were filtered using the “CfsSubsetEval” evaluator to estimate the value of an attribute subset by considering the individual predictive ability of each attribute along with its redundancy, and selected using the “BestFirst” attribute search method–a greedy hill climbing algorithm with augmented backtracking. All available WEKA classification methods were tested on our dataset. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) was found to perform best. Another round of attribute selection, optimized for SVM, using “ClassifierSubsetEval” with default options was performed. Attributes from the automated selection process were normalized and the SVM classifier was trained by an implementation of John Platt's sequential minimal optimization algorithm (Platt, 1998), which generates a soft-margin model. The following parameters were used for training: the C parameter was 1 and not optimized, the “Polynomial” kernel was used with an exponent of 1, and the epsilon for round-off error was 10−12.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The roles that water molecules play in life are multitudinous. Water is the key molecule of life – from complex interdependent ecosystems to being a key component of nearly every biological reaction and interaction on the molecular scale. While protein–protein interactions are a topic of increasing relevance in the quest for new approaches to treat disease, much of the underlying mechanism of these interactions is poorly understood, not the least of which are the roles of the many discrete water molecules observed at structurally characterized protein–protein interfaces. As it is known that many protein–protein interactions observed in X-ray crystal structures are not biological in origin, but are, in fact, a consequence of crystallization, the primary and significant question is what are the characteristics of such “biological” and “non-biological” interfaces and are there differences in the roles that water molecules play in these two cases?

Previous studies of water in the interface between interacting proteins have generally relied solely on interatomic distances in non-protonated crystallographic models to mark interactions between waters and proteins. This approach, however, often poorly represents the complex and subtle energetics and geometric preferences of hydrogen bonding. In a previous report (Ahmed et al., 2011) and in this study we use all atoms after exhaustive optimization of all water orientations (Kellogg and Chen, 2004) to surmount local minima in our models. Our hydropathic minimization procedure rewards favorable polar interactions, i.e., hydrogen bonds and acid/base, and penalizes unfavorable polar, i.e., acid/acid and base/base, and hydrophobic-polar interactions (desolvation), by maximizing the HINT score (Kellogg and Abraham, 2000; Sarkar and Kellogg, 2010) for each water in its environment. The HINT forcefield is a non-covalent free energy scoring function based on the experimental measurement of the partition coefficient (P
                     
                        o/w
                     ) for solute transfer between 1-octanol and water, two solvents that represent limiting case nano-environments in the biological environment. Log
                     P
                     
                        o/w
                      is actually a free energy that encodes electrostatic interactions, desolvation, hydrogen bonding, entropy, and other effects because the dissolution of a solute in these two solvents is governed by these factors (Kellogg and Abraham, 2000). Analogously, all biological interactions that take place in water – very few do not – involve these same factors. There is a large collection of experimental Log
                     P
                     
                        o/w
                      data for small molecules, and there are numerous algorithms to estimate these values for arbitrary small molecules (Sarkar and Kellogg, 2010). HINT, which exploits this data more or less intact in its forcefield, has been used in a large number of computational studies on many systems: protein–ligand (Fornabaio et al., 2004; Amadasi et al., 2006; Porotto et al., 2006; Bayden et al., 2009; Da et al., 2012), protein–protein (Burnett et al., 2001; Ahmed et al., 2011), DNA–ligand (Cashman et al., 2003), DNA–protein (Spyrakis et al., 2007; Marabotti et al., 2008), etc. Finally, the HINT calculations can be rapidly performed, a major consideration in this study with its large dataset.

The average interface area of biological interfaces was found to be significantly higher than that of non-biological interfaces in our data set (2660Å2 
                     vs. 1510Å2, respectively, significance level p
                     <0.05), which is in agreement with previous analyses (De et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2006; Teyra and Pisabarro, 2007). However, the “wetness” of the two interfaces (average number of water molecules per 1000Å2) was calculated to be very similar: 8.5 and 9.6 for biological and non-biological interfaces, respectively. As an illustration, the biological interface for the chloroperoxidase T enzyme from Streptomyces aureofaciens (pdbid: 1a8u) is shown in Fig. 1
                     . There are 671 water molecules in this structure, but only 9 are at the interface between chains A and B, which has a contact area of 830Å2. Table 1
                      lists the calculated properties (Rank, HINT score, Relevance and solvent accessible surface area) for each of these latter water molecules. In Fig. 2
                     , a typical non-biological interface, the non-biological “dimer” of cytochrome P450 (CYP119) of Sulfolobus solfataricus (pdbid: 1io7), is shown. This structure has 476 total waters, with 15 at the interface (1408Å2) (see also Table 2
                     ). These examples immediately suggest the key observation that there is more interleaving of the two proteins in biological interfaces, whereas the non-biological cases appear to involve more casual contact.

We are reprising the scheme we described previously (Ahmed et al., 2011), in which there are three Relevance classes of water: those interacting favorably with both proteins, i.e., having a Relevance ≥0.25 with each, which we are terming Relevance Two waters; those interacting favorably with only one member of the protein pair, which we are terming Relevance One waters; and waters with Relevance <0.25 with both proteins (Relevance Zero waters). We examined the percentage distribution of these different relevance waters across our biological vs. non-biological data set (see Fig. 3
                     ). Of note, the results for the (homo-oligomeric) biological set of complexes are virtually identical (±1%) to that in our previous report (Ahmed et al., 2011) for hetero-oligomeric biological complexes. Although the results are not dramatic, with both types of interfaces having more or less the same percentages of Relevance One and Relevance Two waters, there is a tendency for the biological interfaces to have a larger fraction of “stabilized” (Relevance One and Two) waters and the crystallographic interfaces to have a larger fraction of “non-stabilized” (Relevance Zero) waters. Normalizing the number of waters in each Relevance class by the interface areas of the complexes yielded the plot in Fig. 4
                     . These differences between biological and non-biological interfaces were found to be statistically significant for Relevance Zero waters (p
                     <0.05). Together, the two observations of: (1) high similarity between the biological set in this study and the Ahmed et al. (2011) hetero-oligomeric results and (2) the difference, albeit fairly subtle, between the biological and non-biological sets in this study, suggest that there is a discerning structural role for water and that detailed analysis of these interfaces may identify it (see Supporting Information, Tables S1–S4, for specific information about each protein and each water used in this study).

To analyze the role of water at these interfaces, we must first review the observed frequencies of the amino acid residues at protein surfaces. The preferences for residues in monomeric proteins, both overall and on the surface, as reported by Miller et al. (1987) and Soga et al. (2007), are listed in Table 3
                        . The earlier work showed that hydrophobic residues are less likely to be found on surfaces than overall, and more polar, especially charged, residues are more likely to be found on the surface than overall. The latter results are for the most part similar. For comparison, we calculated residue preferences at both biological and non-biological interfaces in our dataset. Generally, polar residues are found more often at interfaces, while more hydrophobic residues are found less often. Arg and Glu are about 2% more abundant at the interfaces than on a free protein surface. Ala is about 2% less abundant, and Gly, Ser, Thr and Val are about 1% less abundant at the interfaces. There are interesting differences between the biological and non-biological interfaces too: the non-biological interfaces are considerably more polar, based on the residues present, than the biological interfaces. Ala, Gly, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr, Trp and Val are less frequently observed in non-biological interfaces, while Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Lys, Ser and Thr are more frequently observed. Only Cys, His and Pro do not follow this trend, and these residues are rare at surfaces.

Next, the HINT scores and water preferences for each residue type were calculated for both datasets (see Table 3). Residues have similar preferences when interacting with water in the two types of interfaces with the exceptions of His, Met, Phe and Tyr, where the preferences for interaction with water are as much as doubled in the biological dataset. These residues, along with Cys and Trp, occur infrequently on protein surfaces, and their enhanced presence in water-mediated biological interactions would seem to purpose-driven. Also fairly dramatic is the increase in preference for Lys interacting with water at the non-biological interfaces (6.69% vs. 4.91%), which may be due to Lys's high charge density and sidechain flexibility, which allows it to opportunistically interact with water molecules over a fairly large volume.

To explore these observations more quantitatively, in terms of energetics, HINT score values were calculated for each water molecule in the dataset. The average water at a biological interface has a HINT score of 20 (−0.04kcalmol−1), while at the non-biological interface it is −14 (+0.03kcalmol−1). Thus, as before (Ahmed et al., 2011), the average water contributes essentially nothing. For each of the twenty amino acid types, these scores were summed and averaged in two ways: first by averaging over all waters in the data set, and second by averaging over all waters interacting (by weighted count) with that residue type. The average over all water molecules reveals the magnitude and the nature of interaction; i.e., whether it is energetically favorable (HINT score>0) or unfavorable (HINT score<0) for each residue with water. The second average, which is weighted by the frequency of interactions with that particular residue interaction, represents the score that would be expected if a “typical” water molecule interacted with a typical representative of just that residue, thus revealing the specific costs or benefits of interacting with each amino acid residue type. Tracking with the frequency results noted above, the average HINT scores for His and the hydrophobic residues Phe and Tyr are, for the biological dataset, more than twice those of the non-biological dataset. These are three of the four residue types capable of π-stacking (the other being Trp), which is one of the reasons that they are less commonly found on protein surfaces. The weighted HINT scores (Table 3) indicate that, as expected, hydrophobic residues have unfavorable interactions with water, while polar residues, with hydrogen bonding functional groups on their sidechains, have favorable interactions with water. The trends in differences between water molecules found at biological interfaces compared to those found at non-biological interfaces mirror, for the most part, what was seen in the unweighted average scores.

We performed similar analyses on subsets of water molecules based on their Relevance classes, Zero, One and Two, as described above. Our intent was to discern differences between the interfaces in biological and non-biological complexes based on the roles of the waters trapped in those interfaces. Table 4
                         shows the residue preferences and the average HINT scores for Relevance Zero, Relevance One and Relevance Two waters, respectively. In the case of Relevance Zero waters, the more hydrophobic and π-stacking residues (with the exception of Ile) are found preferentially in water interactions at biological interfaces, where Nature may have engineered a role for these non-stabilized water molecules. Likewise, the most polar residues, Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys, along with Ser, are present in more interactions with water at the non-biological interfaces. These residues are often found at surfaces and their involvement in water-bridged non-biological interactions with other proteins may be simply opportunistic. Interestingly, Relevance Zero waters have the same average HINT score (−285, +0.55kcalmol−1), dominated by hydrophobic-polar interactions (see supporting information Fig. S1A), for both biological and non-biological interfaces. One observation of note in Table 4 is the differences between residue-weighted HINT scores for biological and non-biological waters for interactions with Trp and Tyr. Trp interacts favorably with water (−0.31kcalmol−1) at biological interfaces, but is energetically neutral with respect to water at non-biological interfaces. Tyr interacts favorably with water (−0.25kcalmol−1) at biological interfaces but unfavorably (+0.20kcalmol−1) at non-biological interfaces. These Zero Relevance waters are more buried in biological interfaces, as 32% have solvent-accessible surface areas ≤5Å2 compared to 26% for the non-biological (see Fig. 5A). This difference may be partly attributable to the fact that biological interfaces have larger contact areas than non-biological interfaces, which would, all other considerations aside, place more interfacial waters in the fringe or ring region of the interface.

There are some, likely insignificant, differences between the water roles at biological vs. non-biological interfaces in the Relevance One cases (Table 4). The surprisingly limited energetic contribution of Lys, for both types of interface, is an artifact of its dual nature – i.e., having a very polar amine functional group and a long hydrophobic chain; thus, on average, these two contributions cancel out. The average HINT scores for Relevance One waters for the biological and non-biological datasets are −33 (+0.06kcalmol−1) and −5 (+0.01kcalmol−1), respectively. This is seemingly a little unexpected; however, analysis of the types of interactions (Fig. S1B) reveals that Relevance One waters in the biological dataset have a larger contribution of unfavorable hydrophobic-polar interactions. Our hypothesis is that native interfaces, by design, have a larger hydrophobic contact area (Table 3), which would be manifested as more hydrophobic-polar interactions involving water. The SASA analysis (Fig. 5B) shows that a higher fraction of Relevance One water molecules are buried in biological complexes, which is a reversal of what was observed for Relevance Zero waters. The differences between the two types of interfaces for Relevance Two waters are also not dramatic. Relevance Two waters in biological interfaces have higher preferences (∼2-fold) for His, Met, Phe and Tyr, which again may be related to the relative paucity of these residues on regions of a protein surface not engineered for biologically-relevant interaction. Biological and non-biological interfaces have nearly the same average HINT scores, 205 and 203 (−0.40kcalmol−1), respectively, dominated by hydrogen bonding and acid-base interactions (Fig. S1C). As for the Relevance One waters, a higher percentage of Relevance Two waters are buried in biological interfaces (Fig. 5C).

We next separated the residue's contributions to interactions with water into those arising from main chain (backbone) atoms, i.e., C, O, N and CA, and their bonded hydrogens, and those arising from the sidechain atoms. This may help us understand better the differences between residue interactions in the two datasets. We previously saw (Ahmed et al., 2011) that the average interaction score for a water molecule with a backbone atom is favorable, while the average interaction with sidechain atoms is unfavorable, although the identity of the sidechain plays an obvious major role. We expected to see differences in modes of interaction with water for residues in biological vs. non-biological complexes. Fig. 6A shows the HINT score averaged by number of water molecules for the backbone atoms in the biological and non-biological datasets (see also supporting information, Tables S5 and S6.) It appears that, with the exceptions of Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gly, Met, Ser, Trp and Val residues have higher average water-mediated HINT scores with backbone atoms in biological complexes than in non-biological complexes. Of these residues, Lys, Pro, Gln, Gly, Ile and Tyr, are significantly higher (p
                        <0.05), which explains many of the apparent discrepancies found in Table 3. One explanation is that backbone atoms are more likely to be exposed in surface regions designed for interaction with other proteins. Our analysis found that 21% of the atoms at biological interfaces were backbone atoms (C, CA, N, O, OXT); while in the non-biological set only 16% were backbone atoms. Fig. 6B shows the HINT score averaged by number of water molecules for the biological and non-biological dataset for interactions with the sidechain atoms. Somewhat surprisingly, polar residues such as Asp and His have better HINT scores in biological complexes. In particular, His has an unfavorable average HINT score in non-biological interfaces while it has a favorable average HINT score in biological interfaces. Also, hydrophobic residues like Ile and Trp have better average HINT scores in biological complexes. However, of these, only Asp and His were found to exhibit significant differences (p
                        <0.05). The average scores, as weighted by residue type (Fig. 6C and D), show very similar trends.

We calculated two-dimensional heatmaps illustrating the frequency of Res1-H2O-Res2 interactions in the two datasets. These are provided in Supporting Information, Fig. S2. There a few salient observations: Glu is more involved in Relevance Two non-biological Res1-H2O-Res2 interactions, while Asp is less involved; and weakly polar residues like Asn, Gln, Gly, Ser and Tyr are more likely to be found in Relevance One interactions in the biological interfaces than in the non-biological interfaces.

We also calculated two-dimensional heatmaps based on weighted (by frequency) HINT scores for Res1-H2O-Res2 interactions (see Fig. 7
                        ). The top left maps of Fig. 7A and B (biological and non-biological, respectively) show these normalized HINT score heatmaps for all residue pairs interacting with waters. They illustrate the propensity and energetics of water molecules “bridging” between the specified residue types; the deeper blue cells represent more favorable situations, e.g., Glu-H2O-Glu or Asp-H2O-Tyr, while the deeper red cells represent highly unfavorable situations, e.g., Ile-H2O-Val. The heatmaps appear to be similar with only subtle differences between biological (A) and non-biological (B) cases. The differences (biological–non-biological) for each cell are illustrated in Fig. 7C (top left); the deeper blue cells represent positive differences where the water-mediated biological interaction is more predominant, e.g., Phe-H2O-Tyr, while the deeper red cells represent the opposite case, such as Cys-H2O-Cys.

To understand these phenomena further, we performed similar heatmap analyses on the Relevance Class water subsets. Heatmap analyses of the Relevance Zero waters (Fig. 7A–C, top right maps) indicate that Trp-H2O-Trp and His-H2O-Asp have the highest average HINT scores in both biological and non-biological interfaces, although Trp and His are relatively rare as surface residues. More interesting, perhaps, is the observation that water-mediated interactions involving Tyr, which have mostly favorable HINT scores in biological interfaces, are found to have unfavorable interactions in non-biological interfaces. This is clear in the difference map (Fig. 7C). The presence of Tyr on a surface and its involvement in water-mediated biologically-relevant interaction suggests that it has been engineered to take advantage of Tyr's unique combination of properties of Tyr, i.e., its hydrogen-bonding via the OH donor/acceptor or the aromatic ring acceptor, while still being largely hydrophobic. Phe and Trp show similar trends, but lack the hydrogen bond donor capabilities of Tyr. Similarly, the sulfur-containing residues, Cys and Met, are also more favored in biological than non-biological interfaces. As expected, the water-mediated interactions involving Ala, Ile, Leu, Pro, Met and Val generally have the lowest average HINT scores for both interface types. It is interesting, however, that these interactions are more intensely disfavored in the non-biological interface case, while Leu-H2O-His has the largest difference in the map. All these factors show that the environment surrounding Relevance Zero waters is somewhat harsher in non-biological (B) interfaces than in biological (A) interfaces.

Heatmaps for Relevance One waters (Fig. 7A and B, lower left maps) show a few modest differences between the two datasets; e.g.: (1) Tyr-H2O-Met and Tyr-H2O-Trp are completely absent in our set of non-biological interfaces, while they result in favorable interactions in biological interfaces; (2) Trp has higher average HINT scores in the non-biological interfaces, especially when interacting with the same water as His, Phe or Trp; (3) the difference heatmap (Fig. 7C, lower left) shows that most of the differences are found with Cys, which has higher average HINT scores in the biological interfaces when interacting with Arg, Met and Val, but lower average HINT scores in the biological interfaces when interacting with most other residues and itself. Lastly, heatmaps for Relevance Two waters (Fig. 7A–C, lower right maps) show several residue pair-H2O interactions that have favorable average HINT scores in the biological dataset but are completely absent in the non-biological dataset. Relevance Two waters are the most rare, only comprising 19% of the non-biological data set, and has by far the largest number of “absent” X-H2O-X interactions (black cells). These absences are generally associated with the hydrophobic residues, probably because the only way a pair of hydrophobic residues could interact through water as Relevance Two would be via their backbones, and backbone atoms are less frequently surface accessible at non-biological interfaces compared to biological interfaces, and therefore a pair of them would be highly unlikely. Most, if not all, other absences in the heatmaps arise from the rarity of those residues on surfaces (or overall), e.g., Cys in Fig. 7B (lower right). For this case, the difference map (Fig. 7C, lower right) accentuates some surprising observations. Three of the most negative differences (indicating more favorable non-biological interactions) are seen in Ala-H2O-Ala, Ala-H2O-Val and Val-H2O-Val, which can only be explained by backbone exposure, with concomitant hydrogen bonding to water, for these cases in the non-biological interfaces. Ala and Val are very common residues and have the smallest sidechains in the hydrophobic set, but this is still a puzzling observation.

Clustering of the weighted count heatmaps (Fig. 8
                        ) clearly highlights substantive differences between biological and non-biological interfaces: in the biological interfaces (Fig. 8A), all charged polar residues (with the exception of His, which has a pK
                        a of 6.5) are dramatically separated from the other residues. Cys, Met, Phe and Trp, are in a second distinct cluster whose commonality is difficult to understand, while the remaining twelve residue types are in very flatly defined clusters with mixed electronic properties for the member residues. However, in non-biological interfaces (Fig. 8E), the clean distinction between charged and uncharged residues is no longer seen, as Asp, Glu, Arg and Lys cluster with the uncharged polar residues Asn and Ser, and surprisingly, Gly. The backbone of Gly contains both a good hydrogen bond acceptor (O) and donor (N+H) and is more exposed than the backbones of all other residues, but is also the most hydrophobic backbone–possessing a methylene at CA. The remaining thirteen residue types are distributed in two clusters that are even flatter than those observed for the biological interface case, but with similar content. The corresponding dendograms for Relevance Zero waters, Fig. 8B and F, shows little distinction between polar and hydrophobic residues in both biological and non-biological interfaces, and in fact are quite flat and featureless. The dominant Relevance Zero interactions with water are hydrophobic-polar, and the similarity-driven clustering may be more a consequence of exposed CH
                           x
                         surface area than anything else. In the clustering analysis for Relevance One waters, Fig. 8C and G, there is a clear delineation of Asp and Glu having the most similar properties for waters in the biological interfaces (Fig. 8C), but this distinction is less clear for the non-biological interfaces (Fig. 8G), where Asp and Glu are clustered with Arg, Asn, Gly, Lys and Ser. Finally, the dendograms for Relevance Two waters, Fig. 8D and 8H, are ‘textbook’ in their discrimination of residue-type roles in interacting with bridging water molecules. Asp and Glu are cleanly separated from all other residue types, but are then clustered with Arg and Lys at biological interfaces. In the non-biological interfaces Arg and Lys are clustered with other polar, but uncharged, residues Gln, Asn and Ser.

We also clustered the average HINT score heatmaps (see Fig. 9
                        ). The all water dendograms are quite similar between biological (Fig. 9A) and non-biological (Fig. 9E) interfaces. The appearance of His in a cluster with Asp and Glu in the latter dendogram is interesting, and probably arises from our observation of several strong Trp-H2O-His interactions. The Relevance Zero dendograms (Fig. 9B and F) are also quite similar, with both showing a noteworthy differentiation between hydrophobic and polar residues, and almost no differentiation amongst the polar residues with respect to charge or polarity. Fig. 9C and G, for Relevance One waters, are remarkably similar. Lastly, Fig. 9D and 9H, for Relevance Two waters, both show clear differentiation for Asp and Glu, and for the more basic residues (Arg, Asn, Gln, His and Lys) from the others. The non-biological interface has the surprising isolation of Leu and Ala from all others, which may be due to the rarity of these residues in water-bridged interactions: the Ala-H2O-Leu interaction in the non-biological dataset has the worst average HINT score in both datasets. Difference dendograms are shown in Fig. 9I–L for All, the Relevance Zero, One and Two cases, respectively. They generally follow the trends discussed above concerning Fig. 7C heatmaps by highlighting where there are notable differences in average HINT score between biological and non-biological interfaces.

Classifiers previously reported, e.g., by Zhu et al. (2006) and Banerjee et al. (2012), indicate performance metrics of 90% and higher accuracy, with descriptor sets that largely if not completely ignored the role of water. Thus, with our additional water-based understanding of the properties of biological and non-biological interfaces, we were intrigued with the possibility of building a machine learning classifier that could correctly differentiate between the interface types using descriptors from our study. Our Initial descriptor set included>8000 attributes, where the only interaction type descriptors were those derived from our analyses; after removing constant descriptors and descriptors with low variability across the data set, and performing attribute selection (see Section 2), a set of 420 descriptors was identified. The SVM (support vector machine) classifier algorithm within the Weka machine learning algorithm collection (Hall et al., 2009) was selected based on its performance with our data set, and applying it reduced this set to the final 21 descriptors (see Table 5
                         for their definitions) in our model. The model we created correctly predicted (with 10-fold cross-validation) 84% of the interface types in the dataset of this report, only from, in effect, the point of view of water. These attributes reflect some of the significant differences between the biological and non-biological complexes: (1) the qualitative and quantitative contributions of carbon atoms on the interface are represented (Table 5) by CG2, CD2, CD1_int_den, CB_int_den, Carbon_ratio_int_to_comp and Carbon_int_den, which confirms the hydrophobicity of the interface plays a central role in the classification because biological interfaces are more hydrophobic than non-biological interfaces; (2) residue-water interactions on the interface are represented by HIS_min_hint, MET_max_hint as well as some Res1-H2O-Res2 interactions such as ALA-HIS_avg_hint, GLN-PRO_avg_hint, etc.; and (3) the role of Lys, which is represented by LYS_min_hint. There is certainly reason to believe that building a classifier that includes direct protein–protein interaction descriptors (vide infra) rather than just the water-mediated set in this study would be a successful strategy.

The conditions of crystallization force protein chains to bind together in conformations/arrangements that may not always be, at first look, favorable. The conditions of crystallization clearly affect both biological and non-biological complexes, and result in bringing the binding partners together. One view is that these “non-biological” crystallographic interactions are simply transient biological interactions that have been stabilized by crystallization conditions (Derewenda, 2011). Such associations may be unfavorable for some of the water molecules involved (i.e., Relevance Zero waters); however, they lead to a globally favorable energetic minimum for the whole complex. In this case, the total energetic contribution of water ranges between −23.16 and 44.52kcalmol−1 (average 2.10kcalmol−1) for biological protein–protein interfaces, and between −5.18 and 13.54kcalmol−1 (average 1.46kcalmol−1) for non-biological interfaces (see Table 6
                        ). Only Relevance Two waters are energetically stabilizing to a greater extent in biological protein–protein associations compared to non-biological associations. As noted above, the fractions of waters within each Relevance class (Fig. 3) and densities of waters by Relevance class (Fig. 4) have variances between biological and non-biological interfaces. It also must be acknowledged that some of the water molecules in our study may, in fact, be misassigned ions or other crystallographic errors. It is evident, however, that water plays a complex role in crystallographic interfaces by both facilitating crystallization by forming bridges between the proteins and interfering by getting trapped between hydrophobic moieties.

Our analysis in the present work indicates that, although biological interfaces are more hydrophobic than non-biological interfaces, as suggested by Li et al. (2012), they are better designed to accommodate small polar molecules like water by engaging more of their hydrophobic residues’ backbone atoms in less unfavorable interactions with water molecules. Also, some polar residues interact better with water molecules in biological interfaces than in non-biological interfaces. Non-biological interfaces, on the other hand, are not designed to interact optimally, which often leads to unfavorable interaction with water – even though they are more polar than biological interfaces. Specific residue type, e.g., Tyr, are more frequently found involved with water at biological interfaces compared to non-biological interfaces. Tyr's unique hydropathic properties – hydrophobic, π stacking, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor – can easily be envisioned as ideal for a key surface residue in specific protein–protein interactions, but this role for Tyr can easily be subverted in non-biologically relevant associations. In contrast, Lys is involved less frequently at biological interfaces than at non-biological interfaces, possibly because its natural role on a surface is likely restricted to solubilizing the protein, but its flexibility and hydrogen bond donor ability makes it an ideal scavenger for many interactions. Our work suggests that one or more mutations that place Lys on a protein's surface may both increase solubility and the likelihood for crystallization. This is seemingly an opposite approach to the reductive lysine methylation suggested by Derewenda (2010), Fan and Joachimiak (2010) and Sledz et al. (2010) as a method for improving crystallization probability, but counterintuitively, methylation actually increases the charge density on the two remaining NH protons. Clearly, the art of crystallization is molecule-dependent, and what works in some cases may not be appropriate for others.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This analysis of water molecules at biological and non-biological protein–protein interfaces has revealed new information about the structure of these interfaces. Our analysis was anchored by the HINT free energy forcefield and the Relevance metric. The former characterizes the types and qualities of interactions between the interface waters and proteins, while the latter is a simple parameter that was previously shown to identify water molecules conserved/non-conserved in ligand binding sites (Amadasi et al., 2008). This work on homodimer complexes, differentiating between biological (largely obligate) and non-biological interfaces, extended a previous study (Ahmed et al., 2011) of heterodimer complexes that were generally transiently formed.

First, from the perspective of water, there are surprisingly few differences between the earlier heterodimer and the present homodimer datasets. The broadest classification scheme we employed, by Relevance, showed the same distribution of waters (within 1%) amongst the Relevance Zero, One and Two classes. This was somewhat surprising, as we expected that homodimer formation would be using bridging waters more profitably than heterodimers. Clearly, water is more than ubiquitous in protein–protein systems: it is pervasive. Second, even the differences between biological interfaces and crystallographic (non-biological) interfaces are relatively modest at the Relevance class level: there are 5% more Relevance Zero waters at the non-biological interfaces, resulting in 3% and 2% fewer Relevance One and Zero waters, respectively, at non-biological interfaces. Again, this is somewhat surprising, as we expected a significantly larger fraction of Relevance Zero waters for the artificial constructs of crystallographic contacts, and a much larger fraction of Relevance Two waters for the obligate/biological interfaces where folding and association are more or less simultaneous, i.e., engineered by Nature. Third, looking much deeper into the differences by analyzing the roles of different residues at these interfaces revealed a few notable observations: (i) non-biological interfaces are more polar than biological interfaces, yet there is better organized hydrogen bonding at the latter; (ii) biological associations rely more on water-mediated interactions with backbone atoms compared to non-biological associations; (iii) aromatic/planar residues play a larger role in biological associations with respect to water because these residues would not normally be found on the surface unless there was a planned role for them; and (iv) Lys has a peculiar role: it is often found on protein surfaces with its main role apparently solvating the protein, but because of its flexibility and reach, plays an out-sized role in forming non-biological interfaces as it can often find a direct or water-mediated hydrogen-bonding partner.

The Relevance Zero waters remain fascinating: we showed in our previous analysis of transient protein–protein complexes that these water molecules are fairly commonly found (7.4%) in “hydrophobic bubbles” (Ahmed et al., 2011), and proposed that such conserved waters may have a role in lubricating or aggravating interfaces that Nature did not intend to be permanent. In the case of biological interfaces 7.95% of Relevance zero waters were found in “hydrophobic bubbles” while in the case of non-biological interfaces 7.98% were found in “hydrophobic bubbles”. Certainly, hydrophobic bubbles may contribute to instability of non-biological complexes and prevent them from forming complexes under non-crystallographic conditions. However, the role for these waters in biological interfaces, in this set of obligate complexes, is more difficult to ascertain. Perhaps they are lubricants for the folding process or contribute to the formation of gaps between protein partners to keep them at optimal distance for their intended biological function.

Biological protein–protein interfaces were engineered in a well-ordered manner to serve a large number of biological purposes. We, by optimizing crystallization conditions, etc. have fashioned new protein–protein interfaces that were not intended by Nature. However, they are in many regards amazingly similar. From the perspective of the interfacial water they have only modest distinguishing characteristics. As the science of protein engineering continues to advance, the engineering of protein–protein complexes that rationally utilize water molecules as nano-scale crystallization enhancers, while taking advantage of site-directed mutagenesis of surface residues that support water-mediated association, may become an emerging strategy. Similarly, expanding our knowledge about the roles of water molecules at protein–protein interfaces may be exploitable in developing inhibitors for protein–protein complexes. In this regard, special attention should be paid to displacing Relevance Two waters since their binding sites are very well suited for hydrogen bonding, acid/base and/or Coulombic interactions with small molecules that would interfere with binding of the protomers.

Our long-term overarching goal is to develop tools for estimating the energetics of protein–protein associations and de novo predict their structure. This work represents a small piece of that effort. Another consideration for accurately modeling and energetically evaluating protein–protein interfaces is proper assignment of ionization states for acidic and basic residues, both wet and dry, at or near the interface. Clearly, such ionizable residues are major players in these interfaces. To this end, we are adapting our Computational Titration procedure (Bayden et al., 2009), a tool originally designed for modeling (e.g., Spyrakis et al., 2004) and virtual screening of protein–ligand systems. In practice, Computational Titration exhaustively models each set of ionization states (protonated or deprotonated, nominally dependent on pH and pK
                     a for isolated residues) for the ensemble of considered residues, i.e., all Arg, Asp, Glu, His, Lys and possibly Cys and Tyr. While this is practicable for small systems, the number of such residues at an interface is much too large for exhaustive sampling and we are installing a genetic algorithm front end to rationally sample the many potential ionization state ensembles present. We pointed out earlier (Ahmed et al., 2011) that water has unique properties as a nano-buffer in that it can maintain water-mediated interactions under pH stress, i.e., by simply rotating, a water can change from a hydrogen bond donor to an acceptor. Thus, these two effects – accounting for water mediation and ionization state optimization – are intimately linked. We are also interested in examining in more detail other types of interfaces, e.g., obligate, non-obligate and transient with respect to their energetics – with and without water mediation. In this regard, once we have ionization-state optimized models for protein–protein interfaces, and can confidently evaluate direct residue-residue interactions, we are envisioning a more robust interface classifier that can differentiate amongst this full range of interface types, by including descriptors that represent the direct as well as indirect (water-mediated) contributions to protein–protein interactions.
