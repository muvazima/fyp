                  The main goal of this paper was to develop an integrated simulation-design of experiments (DOE) model to optimize a petrol station queuing system and sales rate. Initially, the petrol station operating system was simulated using Witness 2014 simulation software©. Then, the responses of simulation were deployed as the input of DOE. Two-level full factorial experiments with center points were performed where the simulated model parameter studied were number of pump, number of cashier and inter arrival times (IATs). The response variables analyzed were queue length and sales rate. The obtained model from experimental design revealed that number of cashier and inter arrival time were significant in determining the queue length while all the factors and their interaction were significantly affecting the sales rate.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Service industries recognized that improving and optimizing their service level is extremely required to increase the efficiency in competitive markets [1]. Customer satisfaction has been announced as one of the most significant parameters of making competitive advantage in service industries [2–5]. Many people use petrol stations’ services in their daily life. Petrol companies can increase their profit through satisfying their customers. In this industry, competitive advantage can be translated into three perspectives of petrol quality and service speed as well as price. Since the quality and price are commonly comparable in majority of the markets, speed service and consequently queue length can be considered as the most influential factor on customer satisfaction and correspondingly the revenue [6].

Simulation modeling, mathematical programming and statistics can be considered as useful tools for all managers, researchers and practitioners to analyze dynamic systems without interrupting their operations [7–9]. In addition, simulation modeling of real world cases and its integration with DOE models is a challenge for many practitioners, managers, and researchers [10–14].

Since the DOE is an active statistical technique, its integration with simulation can be used to predict a model which can evaluate the effect of significant factors on queuing system. Proposing a simulation-DOE model for the aim of assessing petrol station queuing system and correspondingly sales rate can be beneficial because; (i) Making critical decisions is a serious challenge to top management in different service industries, (ii) Performance of service industry should be exactly assessed due to numerous restrictions in time, cost, labor and different sources of energy, and (iii) Using different tools to optimize processes deprived of interrupting the system operations and evaluate their influence before implementation [15–17].

Although the application of simulation in service industries has been discussed by many authors [18–22], only a very few attempts have been made to integrate it with design of experiments. Based on our best of knowledge, there is no integration on evaluating the performance of petrol station queue system.

This study contributes to integrate simulation modeling with DOE in order to analyze and optimize a petrol station performance. It introduces a new idea for using computer simulation and proposing different scenarios as the input of DOE. This approach provides a valuable contribution because it is impossible to stop the operating system or change the layout due to constraints of cost, time, labor and many other factors. The novelty of this study lies on integration of simulation and design of experiments in a petrol station which will lead to obtain a predictable model in order to optimize the best scenario for a petrol station considering two perspectives of queue length and sales rate.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Simulation has been practiced to numerous segments including services, manufacturing, healthcare, defense and public services [23–27]. It is known as one of the most proper commonly used approaches in the field of operations management [28–32]. The appropriateness, suitability and relevance of simulation methods is a significant issue to study in applied real-world applications, chiefly as there is a rising necessity to address the difficulties of the entire enterprise [19,33–36].

In any service organization, managers are mostly concerned about the customers and their profit simultaneously [13,37,38]. The important structures of a standard queuing system contain line structure, demand group, entrance and service procedures, and queue discipline [36,39,40]. The majority of existing studies in service industry focus on maximizing the customer satisfaction. The type and quality of demand or quantity of customers, serving priority, the tolerable queue length, the bearable waiting time are the major factors which can affect customer satisfaction. The waiting time and queue length are two important issues that play significant roles in customer insight about the service quality. Though, to have an optimal service configuration, both the customer satisfaction and enterprise revenue should be considered simultaneously. Consequently, numerous decisions should be evaluated to attain the best likely scenario which is tolerable from both the customer's and service provider's view point [41–44].

Different approaches have been applied to progress service quality and subsequently customer satisfaction in petrol service industry. Previously, Cornillier, Boctor [45] developed an exact algorithm for the petrol station replenishment problem. Moazzami et al. [9], focused on simulation, modeling and analysis of a petrol station where a petrol station behavior was simulated as one of the most significant sections of service industry.

Design of experiments (DOE) is a mathematical, statistical and systematic technique in order to determine the relationship between affecting process factors and the output of that process. In other words, it is utilized to find cause-and-effect and interaction between parameters where in one-factor-at-a-time approach not possible. Analysis of DOE results is essential to manage process inputs in order to optimize the process output [46–48].

Cheng and Kleiinen [49], established optimal DOE with simulation models of nearly saturated queues. The application of computer simulation have been suggested and executed to solve the problems of variation in incorporated manufacturing systems. Though, a simulation model merely acts as a device in investigating performance. Tsai [31], focused on assessment and optimization of joined manufacturing system operations with the aim of experimental design in computer simulation. The results show that this approach can consider the assessment and optimization of operating situations in multifaceted systems concurrently.

A comparison of experimental designs for simulation-based symbolic regression of manufacturing systems was provided by Can and Heavey [50]. The objective was to identify a robust sampling approach. In a very recent study, Li et al. [13] developed a Simulation-based experimental design and statistical modeling for lead time quotation. This work developed a simulation-based statistical method to offer high-quality and responsive forecast of a new job's flow time through the system, that reduces the ability of precisely quoting lead times in real time. The method incorporated analytical queuing analysis, design of experiments, and statistical modeling.

Previous studies on this field show that the simulation results can be used as an input to design of experiment. Simulation and DOE are some tools to analyze the behavior of a system. In this study the behavior of the petrol station queuing system was simulated and the model outputs were used as the raw data of DOE.

According to the previous literature, this is the first attempt to analyze a petrol station queuing system using an integrated simulation-DOE model. Trying to fill the gap in the literature, this paper proposes an integrated simulation-DOE model to analyze and optimize the queuing system of a petrol station by considering different scenarios, in order to assist managers to efficiently manage their enterprise.

The case study is located in Skudai, Johor, Malaysia. It consists of two main platforms. Each of these platforms comprises four fuel dispensers. Every fuel dispenser comprises two nozzles that pump two types of Octane 95 and Octane 97 fuels. There is also a supermarket in which customers do their shopping (if any) while refueling their cars. Two cashiers work in this station; one of them performs customers’ payments for those who just do the refueling process. The other cashier performs the shopping related affairs as well as payments for the fuel. Customers have the chance of paying the fuel price (Octane 95 or 97) either by cash or with a credit card.

The petrol station layout is shown in Fig. 1
                        . ‘D1–D8’ indicates the number of pumps. Conceptual model is used to map the whole process. The whole process and inputs flow through the output is depicted in the process map as Fig. 2
                        . The process commences with cars arrival to the station and chooses the desired pump among 8 available options. Their selection would be influenced by the least quantity of cars in the queue and distance to the counters if they cannot find an empty queue.

The next process is the payment task which involves paying money refers to desired fuel type (petrol 95 or 97). Once the cashier received the payment, the pump will be replenished exactly as the payment quantity (Octane 95 or 97). Refueling process starts once the drivers comeback to the selected pump and pick the desired nozzle (Octane 95 or 97). Afterward, the pump will refill the fuel tank equal to payment. Once the refueling process ended, drivers put the nozzle back and leave the system.

The problem in this case can be classified into two categories: first, it is related to the service level which petrol station provide to the customers and the second one, refers to the pumps and cashiers idle times. In addition, based on the observations, the IATs, fuel and payment choice varies depending on the time and the type of cars. This problem worsens in unusual times such as rush hours or holidays. Consequently, top managers may be dissatisfied with the efficiency of the petrol station due to its crowdedness or under capacity usage. In addition, managers have to pay for maintenance, cashiers and many other expenses which can be avoided by optimizing the petrol station queuing system.

Following assumptions are considered in simulation modeling:

                           
                              •
                              All customers have 4 choices to select from; petrol types (Octane 95 or 97) and payment method (by cash or credit card).

No customer leaves the system after entering the Queue.

Shopping from petrol station supermarket was considered in the system.

There is no jockeying in the system (changing the Queue lines).

The observation process (data collection) was completed in numerous days of the week and different hours of the day.

Some fluctuations in the petrol rates were ignored.

The required data was collected and recorded regarding to the process map. Stop-Watch technique was deployed for collecting and recording the required data. All data were collected in 4 h periods (from 4:00 A.M. to 11:59 P.M.) during 4 weeks. This long-term period was helpful to consider the rush hours (weekends, holidays and etc.) and consequently the normality of gathered data. After gathering enough sets of interrelated data, a probability distribution was fitted to prove the process randomness. The process of data collection did not interrupt the operating system.

The inter arrival time is the time between each car arrival into the petrol station and the next. The cars were followed to check whether they refuel Octane 95 or 97 to record their IATs, to be distinctly considered in simulation model. Cashier time is the next element of the model. There were two cashiers in the model. Their process time was recorded to be used in cashiers’ elements of model. Refueling time is the duration time when the drivers pick the nozzles till put it back. The cycle time of each pump is founded to be a dependent variable of refueling quantity and independence of total required time of leaving the system. Therefore, the fuel consumption data was collected accordingly. Each fuel type sales quantity (based on liter) was collected to be used for verification process (see Section 6).

EASYFIT© software was used for data analysis and fit the proper probability distribution. The collected data of each activity was put into EASYFIT© and tested for numerous dissimilar continuous probability distributions. Chi-square, Anderson–Darling and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used simultaneously to analyze the data to fit the proper probability distribution. Table 1
                         tabulates the best probability distributions of each element.

Different components of the model and their interactions were constructed in Witness© 2014 software. The model sequence and process was checked with process mapping to demonstrate the precise relations, orders of different elements and actions. The model elements include their fitted distributions supplied by EASYFIT© to run the whole model in Witness© environment. The scheme of the simulated model in Witness environment is depicted in Fig. 3.
                        
                     

Verification aims to check the accuracy of developed model. It compares the software representation of the model with the real world operating system. Subsequent to construction of model, its behavior was checked visually, to be reasonably similar to real-world condition [51].

Total number of operations was selected to inspect the model's reasonableness and verification. Initially, it was computed manually and subsequently compared to the result of simulation model. Table 2
                      illustrates that the variation percentage is less than 5% (the satisfactory level) which is desirable.

Validation is apprehensive with construction of the precise model. It is used to conclude that a model is a precise illustration of the actual system [52]. Validation is typically attained by calibrating the model. This procedure is repetitive till the accuracy of model to be satisfactory. The required number of replications was found by Eq. (1) which was proposed by Ahmed [53] prior to the model validation. The number of replications to obtain a desirable accuracy is four replicates or greater.

Model validation was done after determining the required number of simulation replicates. The actual daily sales rate was compared with the results of the five simulation replicates. Table 4
                      tabulated the data for validation. It shows that the average variation percentage of five simulation replicates is 3.12681 (less than 5%) which is satisfactory.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

The obtained results of simulation modeling were used for further analysis by design of experiments technique. In this case DOE is deployed as a mathematical and statistical method in order to analyze, model and optimize the performance of the simulated petrol station. The petrol station investigated in this research belongs to one of the largest and most reputable petrol companies in Malaysia. The Company's management board decided to improve their service level by investigating their queuing system and maintain their competitive edge. Initially, the company's managers and executives agreed to analyze different factors that could potentially lead to a better queuing system and improve the customer satisfaction. The potential factors were extracted from previous literature and customer feedbacks. Next, all these factors were investigated and finalized to be reviewed using a survey. Finally, by distributing a survey and discussing its results, managers agreed to consider three mostly influential factors involved number of cashiers, number of pumps as well as IATs. Here, a full factorial design involving three factors with two (high and low) levels (23, 3FI) was used to explore the significance effect of parameters on queue length and sales rate. Five center points as the original simulated model were considered in order to test the linearity assumption. In order to evaluate the performance of the petrol station refer to sales rate and queue length, the number of pump, number of cashier and inter arrival times (IATs) were investigated as three factors in the design. The number of pumps and number of cashiers in current simulated model was 8 and 2 respectively, where the range of each factor for new design sets as +20% upper for high level and −20% lower for low levels. Table 5
                      tabulated the mentioned factors and levels. The response variables investigated were queue length and sales rate. The IATs has different nature from the others factors and should be determined for each entrance type separately, so the IATs values in various levels have been defined as a statistical distribution. The IATs in high level dedicates a lower arrival time of customers while in low level dedicates a faster arrival time. Table 6
                      illustrates the high and low levels of IATs for each element enters to the system separately. In order to verify the accuracy of collected data, 5 replicates have been considered for each run. Based on the factorial design, 8 more models (according to the mentioned runs in Table 7
                     ) were necessary to simulated in order to supply the input data of DOE. In addition, current simulation model results were used as the center point data. Design Expert version 9 software© was utilized to develop the factorial design and analyze the collected data. Table 7 illustrates the factorial design and measured queue length and sales rate as the response variables.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Table 8
                      depicts the ANOVA table for response of queue length. The value of “Prob> F” for model is less than 0.05 that indicates the model is significant, which is desirable and considerably affect the response surface of queue length. In the same manner, the main effect of number of cashier-(B), inter arrival times (IATs)-(C) and the two-level interaction of number of cashier and IATs (BC) are significant model terms. Other model terms can be expressed to be not significant. These insignificant model terms can be removed and may result in an improved model.

The resulting ANOVA table after model reduction (where the insignificant terms are eliminated from the regression model) is presented in Table 9
                     . Here the F-value of 61.17 for the model indicates that the model is still significant, which is desirable. The lack of fit statistics defined as the ratio of lack-of-fit mean square over the pure error mean square [54]. The value of lack-of-fit should be insignificant. Here the lack-of-fit ‘F-value’ is 0.12 which is insignificant and correspondingly desirable. An R-square value of 0.8210 indicates that the model is able to explain about 82.10% of the variation on the response. The Adj-R
                     2 and Predicted-R
                     2 are in reasonable agreement with each other (difference less than 0.2). ‘Adeq. precision’ measures the signal to noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable [55]. Ratio of 16.204 indicates an adequate signal. According to the ANOVA results it can be concluded that this model can be used to navigate the design space.

The significance curvature implies that there is a nonlinear relationship between factors and queue length. Thus, four further experiments have been added to the previous design for obtaining a second-order regression model in order to justify the available curvature. Four axial points on the center of significant factors edge were augmented. Since the number of pump-(A) is insignificant the values for the runs considered as the center value. The experiments design for augmentation and the related result tabulated in Table 10.
                     
                  

These four runs were added to the previous 9 runs and the ANOVA was tested again. The result after insignificant model terms reduction (not including those required to support hierarchy) is tabulated in Table 11
                     . The Prob.>F of parameters indicates that the second order effect of number of pump (A)2 is added to the previous significant terms in quadratic model. As before, the associated statistics such as R-square, Adj.-R
                     2 and Predicted R
                     2, and ‘Adeq.precision’ all are desirable. The empirical model was determined based on the significant factors and is presented in terms of coded and actual factors as follows:

The same procedure is applied on response of sales rate. The ANOVA table result depicts in Table 12
                     . Here, the Prob.>F values revealed that the main effects of number of pump-(A), number of cashier-(B), IATs-(C) and two way interaction of AB, AC, BC and three way interaction of ABC have significant effects on sales rate. Since all the main effect and their interaction are significant on response surface of sales rate, so the model reduction procedure is neglected. Here, the F-value of 83.36 for the model indicates that the model is significant, which is desirable. Since the model reduction was unnecessary, the lack-of-fit statistics are removed from the results. An R-square value of 0.9419 indicates that the model is able to explain about 94.19% of the variation on the sales rate. The Adj. R
                     2 and Predicted-R
                     2 are in reasonable agreement with each other (difference less than 0.2). ‘Adeq. precision’ ratio of 22.903 indicates an adequate signal. According to the ANOVA results it can be concluded that this model can be used to navigate the design space.

Hence, the curvature in this response is insignificant, it can be concluded that the relationship between the factors follow a linear relationship and the obtained linear regression model are able to predict accurately. The empirical model was determined based on the significant factors and is presented in terms of coded and actual factors as follows:

                     Fig. 4(
                     a) depicts the normal probability plot of residual for response surface queue length. It is visible that the residual are generally fall on a straight line which is desirable and implies that the error are distributed normally. Hence, the residual versus predicted plot is shown in Fig. 4(b) which has no obvious pattern and the data are scattered randomly. As well, the diagnostics plots of normal probability and residual versus predicted value for response of sales rate are shown in Fig. 5(
                     a) and (b). The data in both responses are desirable and it can be concluded that the proposed models are adequate and there is no need for any further violation assumption.

                      (a) and (b) illustrates the 3D surface and counter plots for queue length response surface at center level for number of pump (8 pumps). The curvilinear is visible in both plots which is in accordance with the obtained quadratic model. The counter plot revealed that at any particular levels of number of cashier the best surface finish is obtainable when the number of pump is at somewhere at the center of number of pump range. This is compatible with the fact that (number of pump)2 term is significant. As well Fig. 7
                      (a) and (b) depicts the 3D surface and counter graphs for response surface of sales rate. It can be obtained from these graphs that at any different levels of factors the curvature is insignificant and the obtained regression model is adequate to justify the very slight curvilinear.


                     Fig. 8
                      (a) and (b) illustrates the cube plots of responses queue length and sales rate respectively based on the obtained models. It is visible that the optimum value of 1.68 ∼ 2cars for queue length is obtainable when the factors; number of pump and IATs are at low level while number of cashier is at high level. Hence, the optimum value of 13759.2 l for sales rate is obtainable when the factors; number of pump, number of cashier is at high level and IATs is at low level.

The overlay plot can be developed by imposing the counters for the various responses. The upper and lower limits have been defined for both queue length and sales rate response surface and the shaded area of the overlay plot, as illustrates in Fig. 9. Commonly the limits for the responses will be selected based on the other constraints. In this case according to the petrol station executive management, the desirable queue length and sales rate defined within the range of 2–6 and 10,000–13,000 l, respectively.

In order to verify the adequacy of the developed models, 5 more confirmation run were designed and the model elements was simulated as Table 13. The 5 runs conditions have been selected from those runs that were not previously used but are within the range of levels defined before. The point prediction tab from the design expert© software was used in order to predict the responses for queue length and sales rate with the 95% prediction intervals. The predicted values and the actual values through simulated models were compared and the percentage error range for queue length and sales rate are as follows: QL ∼ 0–16.66% and SR ∼ 2.63–4.95% where the values particularly for sales rate are less than 5% and acceptable.

It can be proposed that the empirical models developed were reasonably accurate. All the actual values for the confirmation run are within the 95% prediction interval. The 95% prediction interval is the range in which we can expect any individual value to fall into 95% of the time [56].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This research contributes to incorporate simulation modeling with DOE to investigate and optimize the performance of a petrol station. Its novelty lies on integration of computer simulation and suggesting diverse scenarios as the DOE input. The proposed research framework offers a valuable contribution since it is infeasible to stop/change the layout of an operating system due to cost, time, labor and other constraints. This simulation-based design of experiments presented the finding of an empirical survey into the influence of factors; (A)-number of pump, (B)-number of cashier and (C)-inter arrival times on the queue length and sales rate of a simulated petrol station. The procedure starts with simulation modeling of a petrol station and finally the obtained data were used as the input of DOE. The ANOVA results express that the IATs is the most effective factor on both queue length and sales rate. The significances of (number of pump)2 provides a nonlinear contribution to the investigated parameters on queue length. The obtained regression models were reasonably accurate and can be used for prediction. The minimum amount of queue length is obtainable when the number of pumps and IATs distribution were 6 and the low levels for each simulated elements respectively, and number of cashiers was 3. As well, the maximum amount of sales rate is achievable when the number of pumps and number of cashiers was 10 and 3, respectively, and the IATs distribution was in low level for each elements based on Table 6. Although this research aimed to investigate the behavior of the real system, small parts of data were removed from analysis due to unpredicted issues (e.g. human errors while collecting the data). This can be interpreted as the limitation of study. As a direction for future research, the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to other service industries in order to optimize their services level.
