                  Ouyang et al. (2009) consider an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity. Basically, their inventory model is practical, but there are some defects from the logical viewpoints of mathematics. In this paper, the functional behaviors of the annual total relevant costs are explored by rigorous methods of mathematics. A complete solution procedure is also developed to make up for the shortcomings of Ouyang et al. (2009). In numerical examples, it is proved that the new solution procedure could avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In practice, suppliers usually offer some credit periods to the retailers in order to stimulate the demand for the products they produce. Within the allowable delay period, they do not charge any interest on the outstanding amount if the retailers settle the account with them. Stokes (2005) indicates that trade credit represents one of the most flexible sources of short-term financing available to firms principally because it arises spontaneously with the purchase of customers. In addition, trade credit brings some economic advantage to the retailers as they earn some interest from the revenue realized during the period of permissible delay.


                     Haley and Higgins (1973) introduce the first model to consider the economic order quantity (EOQ) model under conditions of permissible delay in payments. From different viewpoints, Goyal (1985) develops the EOQ model when the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments. Adopting the viewpoints of Goyal (1985), Chang, Teng, and Goyal (2008) propose a review article about the inventory lot-size models under trade credit.

Recently, two additional problems for inventory models under trade credit have been studied extensively by many researchers. One considers that the supplier offers the retailer a permissible delay in payments depending on the order quantity. The other considers deteriorating items in such inventory models, in which deterioration refers to the damage, spoilage, dryness, vaporization, etc. of the products. Research on the inventory problems for deteriorating items is started by Whitin (1957), who considers fashion goods deteriorating at the end of a prescribed storage period. An exponentially decaying inventory was developed first by Ghare and Schrader (1963). The details could be found in the review articles of Nahmias (1982), Raafat (1991), and Goyal and Giri (2001).


                     Khouja and Mehrez (1996) first discuss the problem that the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments only when the order quantity is larger than a predetermined quantity. Chang, Ouyang, and Teng (2003) establish an EOQ model for deteriorating items, in which the supplier provides a permissible delay for the purchaser if the order quantity is greater than or equal to a predetermined quantity. Related articles include Chung and Liao (2004, 2006), Chung, Goyal, and Huang (2005), Liao (2007), Chung (2009), and Chang, Ouyang, Teng, and Cheng (2010). Furthermore, Huang (2007) considers the case of conditionally permissible delay to assume that the supplier offers a partially permissible delay in payments if the order quantity is less than a predetermined quantity. Yang (2010) further adopts the concept of Huang (2007) to consider the inventory models for deteriorating items in discounted cash flow analysis under alternatives of conditionally permissible delay in payments and cash discount.


                     Ouyang, Teng, Goyal, and Yang (2009) incorporate the concepts of Ghare and Schrader (1963), Goyal (1985), Khouja and Mehrez (1996), and Huang (2007) to consider an economic order quantity model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity. Their inventory model is practical. However, they do not explore the functional behaviors such as the continuity, decrease, increase, and convexity of the annual total relevant costs. The solution procedure has some defects from the logical viewpoints of mathematics. This paper intends to make up for the shortcomings of Ouyang et al. (2009) by rigorous mathematical methods. A complete solution procedure is also proposed to avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties.

The following notation and assumptions are used in the whole paper.

Replenishments are instantaneous.

Demand rate, D, is known and constant.

Shortages are not allowed.

The inventory system involves only one type of inventory.

Time horizon is infinite.

If Q ≥ W, then fully delayed payment is permitted. The retailer pays cQ after M time periods from the time the order is filled. Otherwise, a partially delayed payment is permitted. Hence, if Q < W, i.e.
T < W/D, the retailer must first make a partial payment to the supplier, 
                                 
                                    (

                              , when the order is filled. And the remaining balances, αcDT, would be paid off at the end of the trade credit period.

During the time period when the account is not settled, generated sales revenue is deposited in an interest-bearing account.

The inventory level decreases owing to demand as well as deterioration. Thus, the change of inventory level can be represented by the following differential equation:

This completes the proof of Lemma 1(K).

Combining the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Lemma 1.

By Lemma 1, we could explore the functional behaviors of the annual total relevant costs in each case.

                           Eq. (72) reveals TRC'4(T) > 0 if T > M. So, TRC4(T) is increasing on [M, ∞).

(C) The proof is the same as that of Lemma 2(C).

Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Lemma 3.

                           Eq. (72) reveals TRC'4(T) < 0 if 0 < T < T
                           0. Of course, TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T
                           0].

Based on the above lemmas, in this section, theorems are proposed to find the optimal replenishment cycle time in each case respectively. For the sake of convenience, each theorem is described by table.

                        Theorem 1
                        
                           For T
                           0 > M ≥ TW, the optimal replenishment cycle time T* that minimizes TRC(T) is given as 
                           Table 1
                           .

                           2 < 0, and Δ
                           3 ≤ 0, with Lemma 2[A(ii), B(iii), C(ii)], we have

(a1) TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, TW
                           ).

(a2) TRC2(T) is decreasing on [TW, M].

(a3) TRC1(T) is decreasing on [M, T

                           1, ∞).

Then, (a1)–(a3), Eqs. (10)–(12), and (6)(a–c) imply

(B)–(E): Following the similar arguments as in Theorem 1(A), we can demonstrate that the cases (B)–(E) hold. Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Theorem 1.

                           0 ≥ TW

                           6 ≤ 0. With Lemma 3[A(ii), B(i), C(ii)], we have

(a1) TRC3(T) is decreasing on [0, M].

Note that when Δ

(a11) TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, T
                           3] and increasing on [T

(a14) TRC1(T) is increasing on [TW

By (18)(a–d), (a11–a14), (16), and (103), it can be found that the annual total relevant cost function TRC(T) is decreasing on (0, T
                     3] and increasing on [T
                     3, ∞). Consequently, we could conclude that

With the similar argument used in [A(a1)], we can demonstrate that [A(a2)]–[R(r4)] hold. Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Theorem 3.

Based on the lemmas and theorems proposed in this paper, we could discuss the shortcomings of the theoretical results and solution procedures of Ouyang et al. (2009) in this section.

                        
                           (1)
                           Theorem B [Second Derivative Test (Varberg et al., 2007, p. 164)] can be stated as follows:

Let f' and f'' exist at every point in an open interval (a, b) containing c, and suppose that 
                                 
                                    
                                       f
                                       ′
                                    
                                    
                                       (
                                       c
                                       )
                                    
                                    =
                                    0
                                 
                              .
                                 
                                    (i)
                                    If f''(c) < 0, then f(c) is a local maximum value of f.

If f''(c) > 0, then f(c) is a local minimum value of f.

Consequently, the Eqs. (A4) and (B4) in Ouyang et al. (2009) can only ensure that T
                              1 and T
                              3 are local minimum points of both TRC1(T) and TRC3(T), respectively. Many examples (Varberg et al., 2007) show that Theorem B cannot draw a conclusion about the maxima or minima without more information in general. Although the conclusions of Lemmas 1–8 and Theorems 1–3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) are correct, the processes of the proofs have some mathematical shortcomings. This paper explores the functional behaviors such as the continuity, decrease, increase, and convexity of the annual total relevant costs function to propose the correct ways of discussions about the minimum points T

                              Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (36) and (37) hold. Lemma 1(A, B) in this paper overcomes these shortcomings.


                              Eqs. (59) and (65) in this paper reveal that Eq. (26) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong. The correct formulation of Δ
                              6 should be Eq. (68) in this paper. Furthermore, Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (69) and (70) hold. Lemma 1(A, B, H) in this paper overcome these shortcomings.


                              Eqs. (59) and (83) in this paper reveal that Eq. (30) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong. The correct formulation of Δ
                              9 should be Eq. (84) in this paper. Furthermore, Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (87) and (88) hold. However, Lemma 1(A, B) and Eqs. (84)–(86) imply that Eqs. (87) and (88) hold.

Since Eq. (30) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong, it should not be true in general that Δ
                              9 ≥ Δ
                              7 and Δ
                              7 ≥ Δ
                              5. Therefore, the validity of Theorem 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) is questionable. Theorem 3 in this paper proposes the correct conclusions about Case 3.

From the discussion about Case 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009), we have

                                       )

                                       4
                                    
                                    
                                       (
                                       
                                          T
                                          0

                              . However, if TRC5(T
                              0) ≠ TRC4(T
                              0), then TRC(T
                              0) ≠ TRC5(T
                              0). Hence, if TRC5(T
                              0) ≠ TRC4(T
                              0), Eq. (15) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is invalid. The correct formulations of TRC(T) for Case 3 should be Eqs. (18)(a–d) in this paper.

In this section, we will discuss two numerical examples to illustrate the results. Both of these two examples indicate that the solution procedure proposed in this paper is simpler and more accurate than that of Ouyang et al. (2009).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

For the economic order quantity (EOQ) model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity, Ouyang et al. (2009) suggest two solution approaches to solve the problem. One solves ten subcases described in Ouyang et al. (2009) by standard nonlinear programming software. The other solves the complex problem by the algorithm developed with the characteristics of Theorems 1–3 in Ouyang et al. (2009). However, there are some defects in each solution approach.

                        
                           (I)
                           The approach of standard nonlinear programming software: Referring to Eqs. (6)(c), (13)(b), and (18)(b) in this paper, we find that the valid domains of TRC3(T) for Case 1, TRC4(T) for Case 2, and TRC5(T) for Case 3 should be (0, TW
                              ), [M, TW
                              ), and (T

                              ), respectively. So, problems S-3 (Case 1), S-5 (Case 2), and S-8 (Case 3) in Ouyang et al. (2009) will be modified as follows:

                     . However, many examples reveal that the second derivative test cannot draw a conclusion about maxima or minima without more information in general. This paper adopts rigorous mathematical methods to explore the functional behaviors of

                     . A complete solution procedure is also proposed to avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties. In numerical examples, it is proved that the new solution procedure could improve that of Ouyang et al. (2009).
