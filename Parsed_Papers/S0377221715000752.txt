                      appears in many real situations. Two important proposals on how to share the cost are the egalitarian and the proportional solutions. In different situations a combination of both distributions provides an interesting approach to the cost sharing problem. In this paper we obtain a family of (compromise) solutions associated to the Perron’s eigenvectors of Levinger’s transformations of a characteristics matrix A. This family includes both the egalitarian and proportional solutions, as well as a set of suitable intermediate proposals, which we analyze in some specific contexts, as claims problems and inventory cost games.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A (cost-surplus) sharing problem consists of the division of a certain amount M among a group of n agents. We assume that each agent i (i = 1, 2, …, n) is identified by means of a (numerical) characteristic ci
                      relevant in the distribution of the total amount M. We may find many real situations covered by this simple model. Let us observe, for instance, the following ones:

                        
                           [1]
                           A typical example is how to allocate the total cost M of a facility (for instance, a water supply system) among the n towns that will share it. The characteristic ci
                               may be, in this example, the proportion of the total population living in each of these towns. A cost allocation is a vector x = (x
                              1, x
                              2, …, xn
                              ) such that x
                              1 + x
                              2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + xn
                               = M. The two more popular ways to share the total cost M are the egalitarian and the proportional ones (see, for instance, Moulin, 1988).

Another example comes from analyzing costs in one-to-many distribution systems. This kind of problem has a logistic feature, namely the distribution cost (see, for instance, Turkensteen and Klose, 2012). A single facility, whose location is yet to be determined, serves geographically dispersed demand points (consumers). Once the location of the facility and the distribution cost (the cost of the optimal delivery route) M has been obtained, the problem to be analyzed is how the cost M is allocated to consumers. Again, there are two focal positions: the cost is allocated in an egalitarian way, so any costumer pays (per unit) an equal part of the total distribution cost; or, the cost is allocated in a proportional way with respect to the characteristic ci
                              , that in this example could represent the distance between the facility and the consumer i, or the cost of a direct delivery from the facility to the consumer.
                           

The so-called claims problem 
                              (O’Neill, 1982) involves n agents identified by some claims ci, i = 1, 2, …, n on an estate M that is not sufficient to cover the aggregate claim 
                                 
                                    C
                                    =
                                    
                                       ∑
                                       
                                          i
                                          =
                                          1
                                       
                                       n
                                    
                                    
                                       c
                                       i
                                    
                                    ,
                                 
                               that is C > M. The problem is how to allocate the estate M among the claimants by taking into account the claims ci
                               the agents have on it. Among the many rules defined in this class of problems, two prominent solutions are the proportional and the egalitarian ones.

In a recent paper, Karsten and Basten (2014) present a model on how to share the benefits in pooling of spare parts between multiple users. As they mention, “important savings may be obtained if pooling is taken into account. While promising this does raise the question on how the [users] should share the benefits”. In order to construct their model, they use the proportional rule to divide the costs (in this case, proportionality is with respect to the demand rate of each individual). Instead of using proportionality, an egalitarian allocation could also be considered. A similar situation may be found in Meca, Timmer, García-Jurado, and Borm (2004) (see also Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera, 2011) where an inventory cost game is presented in order to allocate the benefits of cooperation. They use a proportional approach in order to define a solution that is proved to be on the core of the cooperative game.

All of the above situations may be expressed by the abstract model:

                        An amount M must be shared among agents i = 1, 2, …, n by considering the individuals’ characteristics ci
                           .
                     
                  

As mentioned, the proportional and the egalitarian solutions are two focal approaches to solve this model. In many situations, a combination of these solutions could make sense. For instance, if we go back to the water supply system example, it is clear that the population (the characteristic) of each town affects the size of the system. Then, a proportional (with respect to the characteristics) distribution of the cost seems reasonable. But, on the other hand, most of the cost does not depend on the supplied population, so an egalitarian share (regardless of the characteristics) could be as reasonable as the proportional division. As consequence, a combination of both distributions provides an interesting approach. Our proposal is within this perspective.

One possibility is to consider convex combinations of these two solutions. This idea has been recently developed in the context of claims problems (situation [3]) where the characteristic ci
                      represents the individual is claim (see Giménez-Gómez and Peris, 2014). In that article they propose the α
                     min solution by using a specific convex combination of the egalitarian and the proportional solutions with the idea of guaranteeing a minimal amount to each individual (regardless of their claims) and allocating the remaining in a proportional way.

We propose an alternative approach to obtain intermediate solutions: instead of taking convex combinations of the egalitarian and proportional solutions, we use eigenvectors of some suitable matrices. In so doing, we define the characteristics matrix of a problem as the matrix whose rows are all identical to the vector of individuals’ characteristics ci
                     . By using this matrix A, we get an alternative way of obtaining the main solutions. In particular, the egalitarian solution corresponds to the right eigenvector of matrix A and the proportional solution corresponds to the left eigenvector (or, equivalently, to the right eigenvector of the transpose matrix At
                     ). Then, we present our family of compromise solutions for the sharing problem, as the ones associated to the Perron’s eigenvectors of each convex combination of the characteristics’ matrix and its transpose (Levinger’s transformation). The egalitarian and proportional solutions are obtained for α = 0 and α = 1, respectively. We analyze the main properties of these compromise solutions as functions of the parameter α that defines the convex combination.

When analyzing some particular situations, we realize that the egalitarian solution could propose inadmissible allocations. For instance, in situation [2], if ci
                      represents the cost of the individual delivery, rationality implies that no agent should pay more than this amount. In situation [3] the characteristic ci
                      denotes the claim that individual i has on the endowment. Then, it is obvious that no agent should receive more than her claim. Finally, in situation [4] the proposal should give an allocation in the core of the cooperative game. As in the egalitarian case, other solutions associated to Perron’s eigenvectors of Levinger’s transformations could be inadmissible proposals. However, we will show that it is always possible to find some admissible ones.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical model we are going to use, and defines the characteristics matrix associated to a cost sharing problem. In Section 3 we obtain the main properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the convex combinations of the characteristics matrix and its transpose. Finally, in Section 4, we analyze some particular situations (claims problems and inventory cost games).

A cost sharing problem with relevant characteristics is defined by a finite set of agents N = {1, 2, …, n}, the total cost M to be allocated to the agents, and the characteristics vector

                        2, …, cn
                        ], identifying each agent. The issue is how to share the total cost M among the agents.

                           Although we consider cost sharing problems, our reasoning could be immediately applied to surplus sharing situations.

The most popular sharing rules are the egalitarian (Egal) and the proportional (Prop) ones. Equal division establishes that each agent is allocated the same part of the total amount,

Given a square positive matrix A (aij
                         > 0, for all i, j), Perron’s theorem (Perron, 1907) ensures the existence of an eigenvalue of A, λ(A), which is strictly positive and has associated a positive eigenvector v* > 0 such that Av* = λ(A)v*, and λ(A) = ρ(A), the spectral radius of this matrix.

                           A stochastic matrix (also termed probability matrix, or Markov matrix) is a square matrix such that each of its entries is a non-negative real number representing a probability (so, each row sum is 1). See, for instance, Berman and Plemmons (1994) for formal definitions and main properties of stochastic matrices.

Moreover, given these allocations, it is clear that any convex combination of the eigenvectors, v = αvpr

                         = αv(1) + (1 − α)v(0) defines a new distribution that provides an intermediate proposal among those.

An alternative approach to obtaining intermediate (compromise) proposals could be to compute convex combinations of the matrices A and At
                         and proposing the Perron’s eigenvector of this convex combination as the way of defining the new allocation. In other words, we want to use the Perron’s normalized eigenvector associated to Levinger’s transformation of the characteristics matrix A,

                         For each α the eigenvector v(α) defines a solution x(α) = Mv(α) to the cost sharing problem (M, c). We are interested in analyzing the properties of these allocations as functions of the parameter α that defines the transformation. First, we show that λ(α) is a symmetric function that achieves its maximum at 
                           
                              α

                         and moreover we will prove that it is a concave function. However, our main interest is the analysis of the behavior of the normalized components of the positive associated eigenvectors v(α) as nonlinear functions of the parameter α, since these components provide the compromise solution.

                               are identified by the population (in thousands) living in each city, that we suppose [d
                              1 = 200, d
                              2 = 240, d
                              3 = 380, d
                              4 = 460, d
                              5 = 720]. Then, the egalitarian solution gives the cost sharing Egal = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20). The proportional (with respect to the population in each city) solution proposes the cost sharing Prop = (10, 12, 19, 23, 36).

The population in each city (normalized so that the total sum of the population is equal to 1) is ct
                               = [0.10, 0.12, 0.19, 0.23, 0.36]. Then, the characteristics matrix is

If we now consider the convex combination given by α = 0.3282, the Perron’s eigenvalue is λ(α) = 1.0453 and the cost allocation defined by the Perron’s eigenvector is x(α) = (16.86, 17.49, 19.69, 20.94, 25.02), which is a compromise between the egalitarian and the proportional approaches. Note that this result is different from the one we obtain by considering the convex combination (for α = 0.3282) of the egalitarian and proportional solutions: αProp + (1 − α)Egal = (16.72, 17.37, 19.67, 20.98, 25.25). In fact, there is not α ∈ [0, 1] such that the proposal given by x(α) could be obtained as a direct convex combination of the egalitarian and the proportional solutions.

In Theorem 1 we obtain the expression of the dominant eigenvalue λ(α) and its main properties. Part of this result is a particular case of a result stated without proof by Levinger (see Fiedler, 1995; Levinger, 1970). We provide an elemental proof.

As we can observe, the eigenvalue function is as indicated in Theorem 1. On the other hand, the components of the eigenvector functions do not intersect and have a monotone behavior (some of them increasing and the remaining ones decreasing). More interesting is the behavior of the second derivative of the eigenvector functions: each component changes from concave to convex, or vice-versa, but all of them do this change at the same value of α. We will prove later that these properties are true in general (see Theorems 3 and 4).

In the following result we show that, for a fixed α, the components of the positive eigenvector v(α) are increasingly ordered. This fact is useful in their application to distribution problems, since the characteristics ci
                      often represent some rights or duties and then a desirable property is that more rights (duties) deserve more revenues (payments), which are given by vi
                     (α).

The proof is based on the fact that we can compute the positive eigenvector v(α) by using the power method (see, for instance, Berman and Plemmons, 1994)

As an immediate consequence, we obtain that our compromise solutions satisfy the (desirable) property of characteristic monotonicity. When applied to claims problems (situation [3]) it means that greater claims obtain greater allocations. In cost sharing problems (situations [1], [2], [4]) greater demands imply greater cost.

                           Let us consider a cost sharing problem (M, c). Then, the compromise solutions x(α) are characteristic monotonic:

In the case of a cost sharing problem, the above result splits the set of agents into two groups: those who have characteristics greater than the average (

Our last result analyzes the concavity/convexity of the vi

The meaning of this solution will depend on the model of situation we have. From the mathematical point of view, as the increase of a component in vector x(α) involves decrease in other (others) component, there is no optimal way (for all individuals) to select one of these compromise solutions.

                               point gives a (mathematically) coherent compromise solution.

                                 Remark 3
                                 Nevertheless, this particular solution could yield a “non-admissible” allocation in some situations. For instance, if we have a claims problem (situation [3]) with endowment M = 100, and agents’ claims ct
                                     = [15, 18, 28.5, 34.5, 54], the characteristics matrix coincides with the one in Example 1, so the αg
                                    -compromise solution coincides. Then, agent 1 is allocated x
                                    1 = 16.86 that is greater than her claim, and this solution is not admissible in claims problems. This trouble is caused because the egalitarian solution itself Egal = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20) is not admissible. A similar consideration could be made with respect to situation [4] in which the proposals are usually required to belong to the core of the cooperative game and, in general, the egalitarian solution does not fulfill this condition. We discuss this kind of situations in the next section.

As mentioned, an egalitarian allocation is not always an admissible solution, in the sense that it is not rational, or does not belong to the core. However, we could be interested in finding an allocation “as egalitarian as possible”. As we have shown, our compromise solutions x(α) provide a family of intermediate proposals from the egalitarian (α = 0) to the proportional (α = 1). Then, we can find suitable values of α in order the allocation x(α) to be admissible and then to find the most egalitarian compromise solution among the admissible ones.

Although the notion “as egalitarian as possible” can be defined in any context, we analyze the problem in two particular situations: inventory cost games and claims problems.

The inventory cost game is defined by associating to every inventory cost situation (N, a, (mi
                        )

                        This minimal value always exists since x(1) coincides with the proportional solution (the SOC-rule) and x(α) is continuous with respect to α.

In order to illustrate the range of values of α such that x(α) gives an allocation in the core of the game, we use the following example taken from Meca et al. (2004) slightly modified.
                           6
                        
                        
                           6
                           In the original example the egalitarian allocation is in the core.
                        
                        
                           We consider three airline companies, L1, L2, L3 that operate in the same country. [...] Over time, each firm has learned how much taillights are used on the average in a year: L1 needs 50 taillights per year, L2 needs 400, and L3 needs 500. The holding cost to store one light for one year is, respectively, 11, 10 and 9.6 dollars. The cost of placing an order for taillights equals 600 dollars.
                        
                     

This situation defines the inventory cost game with function:

                        Then, the allocation x(α) is in the core of the game for all α ∈ [0, 1], such that α ≥ αeq
                        ≊0.35545, and this value determines the most egalitarian compromise solution in the core. The allocation proposed by this compromise solution is xeq
                         = [812.4, 1221.2, 1316]. The SOC-rule proposes the allocation SOC = [197, 1433, 1719.6], that coincides with the compromise solution for α = 1. Note that, being the compromise solution as egalitarian as possible, agent 1 is allocated their maximum rational amount, c({1}). Proposals x(α) with αeq
                         < α < 1 provide intermediate proposals between xeq
                         and the SOC solution.

                         provides the most egalitarian compromise solution among the admissible ones.
