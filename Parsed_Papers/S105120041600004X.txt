                  This paper introduces a new variation of the p-norm detector, which is designed for application to coherent multilook detection in compound Gaussian clutter with inverse Gamma texture. By applying what is termed a compensator, enhanced detection performance can be achieved independently of the number of looks used. This is particularly useful in the case of a fast scan rate radar where the number of looks may be quite small. Conventional coherent detectors tend to experience saturation in such scenarios, and so this new detection process complements recent advances in this area. Further validation is provided by applying this new decision rule to synthetic target detection in real X-band radar clutter.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coherent multilook radar detection is a topic of considerable importance in radar signal processing, and many researchers have investigated the development of appropriate detection schemes under the assumption of clutter modelled with a compound Gaussian distribution [1–7]. In particular, there is much interest in the case where the texture has an inverse Gamma distribution, resulting in a Pareto intensity model [8–11]. Such a clutter model is appropriate for high resolution maritime surveillance radar at X-band [12,13]. Many recent publications have explored coherent detection under such a clutter model, and have introduced a generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, a normalised matched filter (NMF) detector, as well as direct adaptation of the whitening matched filter (WMF) to the Pareto scenario [10,14]. One of the issues arising with the GLRT and NMF is that the number of looks must be sufficiently large in order to avoid detector saturation [14,15]. In an attempt to rectify this [15] introduces an alternative NMF (ALTNMF) using a fixed scaling factor. However, it has been found that the ALTNMF can still experience significant detection loss for a small number of looks.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a new coherent detection process that works well regardless of the number of looks used. The detection process on which this is based is the norm of the return. Such a detector is known in statistical signal processing as an energy detector, which was first introduced in [16] in the context of noncoherent detection of deterministic signals embedded within Gaussian noise. Further work has extended this energy detector to the case of detection of random signals in Gaussian noise [17,18]. In order to improve on the performance of the energy detector, [19] develops a new version of it, which is based upon the 
                        
                           
                              L
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                      norm [20], which will be referred to as the p-norm detector. Although these norm-based detectors are developed for noncoherent detection, they can be applied to the coherent detection case. As will be demonstrated, such detectors do not perform well in practice, as they do not account for the clutter covariance or normalised Doppler frequency. Nonetheless it is possible to construct a coherent detection process, based upon that in [19], using some observations from [14], which has superior performance to each of the coherent detectors listed above. Additionally, improved performance is achieved regardless of the number of looks.

A sine qua non underlying the work discussed in this paper is the validity of the compound Gaussian model for X-band maritime surveillance radar clutter. Additionally a priori knowledge of the model's texture parameters and speckle covariance matrix is required. The paper begins by presenting the general formulation of coherent multilook detection problem in compound Gaussian clutter in Section 2. Energy/norm based detection schemes are outlined in Section 3, where their probability of false alarm and threshold relationships are derived. The performance of these new detection schemes is then examined in Section 4 via simulated clutter. Finally Section 5 examines the performance of the detectors in real clutter.

The general coherent multilook detection problem is formulated in this Section, based upon that in [2,14,15]. In the approach applied here assumptions are imposed on the clutter covariance matrix, which then permits a whitening scheme to be applied to the detection problem.

The compound Gaussian clutter is modelled as a spherically invariant random process (SIRP) [22,23] defined by 
                        c
                        =
                        S

                     , where 
                        G
                      is an 
                        N

                        1
                      zero mean Gaussian process (the speckle) with covariance matrix Σ. It is often necessary to assume this covariance matrix is known [10,14]. For whitening to be permissible, it is also necessary to assume that its inverse is definite positive. Hence we suppose a Cholesky Factorisation exists for

                     , so that there exists a matrix A such that 
                        
                           
                              Σ

The random variable S in the definition of the compound Gaussian model is nonnegative and univariate, known as the texture, and determines the form of the resultant marginal intensity distribution of the clutter [23]. For the case of inverse Gamma texture, S has density given by

                      This detector has been analysed in [2] and [4]. It turns out that the detector (9) has its threshold set via (10) independently of the texture distribution [22]. Consequently, this detector has the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the texture distribution. However, this detector experiences considerable difficulty in a number of scenarios examined in [15], and hence an alternative NMF (ALTNMF) has been proposed, specialised to the case of inverse Gamma texture.

Suppose 
                        κ
                        >
                        0
                      is a fixed constant, which is independent of both texture parameters. Then the ALTNMF is

To demonstrate the performance of these detectors, and to illustrate their issues, Fig. 1
                      plots simulated performance with a synthetic Swerling 1 target model, in typically spiky clutter conditions, with a probability of false alarm (Pfa) of

                     ; the data used here will be discussed in subsequent sections. The underlying Pareto intensity model has a shape parameter of 
                        α
                        =
                        4.7241
                      and scale parameter 
                        β
                        =
                        0.0446
                     . The probability of detection (Pd) is plotted as a function of the target signal to clutter ratio (SCR). The left subplot shows the case where the number of looks is 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                     , while the right subplot is for the same detectors operating with the number of looks reduced to 
                        N
                        =
                        16
                     . As can be observed, for 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                      looks the four detectors perform reasonably well, with the WMF having the worst performance. In the right subplot the NMF has saturated due to the reduced number of looks, while the GLRT is experiencing a significant detection loss relative to the WMF. The ALTNMF is still performing well, although its performance has reduced slightly. By contrast the WMF has experienced only a slight loss in performance. When the number of looks is further reduced to 
                        N
                        =
                        8
                     , the GLRT also saturates and the ALTNMF performs worse than the WMF. When the number of looks is subsequently reduced to 
                        N
                        =
                        4
                      only the WMF has the capacity to yield a detection decision (figures omitted for brevity). In all these examples the ALTNMF has applied 
                        κ
                        =
                        
                           
                              10
                           
                           
                              4
                           
                        
                      based upon the guidelines in [15].

It is hence of interest to determine whether an alternative to the WMF, GLRT, NMF and ALTNMF can be produced, which improves on their performance, especially when the number of looks is relatively small. The next Section introduces the energy or norm-based detectors, and postulates a new decision rule using the idea of a compensator.

This Section introduces the p-norm energy detection processes and determines its Pfa and threshold relationship, when specialised to the case of compound Gaussian clutter with inverse Gamma texture. Due to the fact that this p-norm detector does not have outstanding performance in a number of scenarios, the idea of a compensator is used to enhance its performance.

These decision rules can be applied to the coherent detection problem, but since they do not account for the covariance matrix it is to be expected that their performance will not be ideal.

Determining the threshold for (14), via an expression for the corresponding Pfa, is clearly a more complicated exercise.

                               and unity scale parameter. The complexity now is apparent because we require the distribution of a sum of independent and identically distributed Weibull random variables. However an approximation can be applied to this sum; [26,27] justify the application of a generalised Gamma distribution approximation to Weibull sums. In particular, W can be approximated by a distribution with density

As will be observed in the numerical analysis to follow, the decision rules (13) and (14) tend to not work very well when applied to target detection, except in the case of a small number of looks. The primary reason for this is that the decision rules do not use sufficient information from the coherent detection framework. Observe that all the decision rules introduced in Section 2 are functions of the WMF. Hence this lead to the idea of a scaling up of the p-norm detector via an additive function in an attempt to enhance its performance. Suppose 
                           C
                           (
                           r
                           )
                         is a known function of the return r. Then one can consider the detector

The next Section will analyse all the coherent detectors from Section 2 relative to the decision rules (13), (14) and (27).

The motivation for the development of a new coherent detection process has been to produce a decision rule that yields meaningful detection decisions for a small number of looks in real data. The data of interest is Defence Science and Technology Group's Ingara radar clutter. Ingara is an experimental imaging X-band radar system that is fully polarimetric. Details of the radar can be found in [28]. During August 2004 a trial was conducted, where Ingara was deployed in an aircraft, in the Southern Ocean, approximately 100 km south of Port Lincoln in South Australia. The radar operated in a circular spotlight mode, surveying the same patch of ocean at different azimuth and incidence angles. For each incidence angle, a series of runs were produced. Each run consists of roughly 72 data sets corresponding to increments of 5° in azimuth, to cover the full 360° spectrum of azimuth angles. No targets were present in the sea, and so the data consists of pure clutter. During the trial, Ingara operated with a centre frequency of 10.1 GHz, with a LFM bandwidth of 200 MHz, and a pulse width of 20 μs. The incidence angle for the data to be discussed here was 51.3°. The data set used for the analysis to follow is designated run 34 683. This data set is discussed extensively in [26,29,30]. The upwind direction was at roughly 225° azimuth. The Pareto intensity fit to the Ingara data has been documented in [13].

For the purposes of assessing detector performance in the Ingara data, the texture parameters are estimated from the full data set. Additionally, the clutter covariance matrix has been estimated using the algorithm in [31]. It has been found that the Ingara data admits a Cholesky factorisation of the inverse of its estimated covariance matrix, and so the whitening approach is valid.

For the purposes of consistency, one particular run is selected for the numerical analysis to follow. This run corresponds to an azimuth angle of 225°, and so is approximately in the up wind direction. Such data represents the most spiky scenario. Additionally, attention is focused on the horizontal transmit and receive (HH) case, as well as the vertical transmit and receive (VV) scenario. Results for cross-polarisation tend to fall between these two in terms of performance, and hence are omitted for brevity.

The run under analysis consists of 1024 range compressed samples of 821 pulses, at a range resolution of 0.75 m. Consequently, the data set consists of 840,704 clutter measurements. Texture parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimators. It was found for the HH-polarised case, the texture shape parameter is 
                           α
                           =
                           4.7241
                        , while the scale parameter is 
                           β
                           =
                           0.0446
                        . In the VV-polarised case, the estimates are 
                           α
                           =
                           11.3930
                         and 
                           β
                           =
                           0.3440
                         respectively. Details of the resultant clutter covariance matrix estimates are omitted for brevity, since these will depend on the number of looks and hence can be quite large.

Before examining detector performance in simulated clutter it is useful to consider the selection of the parameters of the p-norm detector with compensator.

It is possible to determine an appropriate selection of p and λ in (27) by applying the Detector Comparison Lemma introduced in [14]. This Lemma allows two decision rules to be compared, and it is possible to specify when one improves on the performance of the other, when they operate in an environment with the same Pfa. Here we compare the WMF and the detector (27), since the WMF has the most reliable performance over all possible number of looks and polarisations [14]. The motivation is that if we can arrange for (27) to improve on the WMF, then it will also outperform the other decision rules when the number of looks is small.

                         It is hence of interest to know whether selections of p and λ can be made so that condition (33) holds for all r. Clearly the case where 
                           λ
                           >

                         will result in the condition being met. It is also possible to search for values of p and λ which reduce the right hand side of (33) to zero, or at least a reasonably small value. To explore this, it is necessary to examine the behaviour of the ratio of thresholds as p and λ are varied.


                        Figs. 2–5
                        
                        
                        
                         plot the right hand side of (33) as a function of the norm parameter p, for a series of selections of the compensator parameter λ. For brevity, (33) is referred to as the lower bound in the figures. For the given number of looks, the texture parameters and 
                           u
                         are estimated from the given Ingara data set. These are then used to determine the two thresholds for (33).


                        Fig. 2 is for the case where 
                           N
                           =
                           4
                        , with the left subplot for horizontal polarisation, and the right subplot for vertical polarisation. For the sample of values for p, 5 potential choices for λ are plotted. The x-axis is termed the Zero Reference line in the legend for convenience. It is clear from this figure that it is appropriate to select λ much smaller than unity, and also to select p small. In both subplots the curves where λ is either 0.01 and 0.001 map almost onto the x-axis. However, as will be explained in the performance analysis of detectors, selecting λ too small can result in difficulty in obtaining a solution to (29) numerically.


                        Fig. 3 repeats the same scenario with the number of looks now increased to 
                           N
                           =
                           8
                        . From this plot it is clear that selection of 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                         should be suitable for any λ. The case of 
                           N
                           =

                         is shown in Fig. 4, from which it can be observed that the increase in the number of looks has slightly increased the admissible range of p-values. It is interesting to note that larger λ can be coupled with smaller p to ensure that the inequality (33) certainly holds.

Finally, Fig. 5 illustrates the scenario with 
                           N
                           =
                           32
                         looks. The left subplot suggests that it may not be possible to achieve a significant improvement in the case of horizontal polarisation, while the right subplot suggests the opposite.

What can be concluded from these figures is that one can select 
                           p
                           ≈
                           1.9
                         and 
                           λ
                           ≈
                           0.1
                         to ensure there is an improvement in performance of (27) relative to the WMF. However, it is also clear from these figures that the size of N is having an impact on the choice of an appropriate λ. To examine this further, Fig. 6
                         plots the lower bound (33) as a function of λ, for 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                         and for N ranging over the cases considered. The left subplot in Fig. 6 is for horizontal polarisation, while the right subplot is for the vertically polarised case. This figure shows that for smaller number of looks it is necessary to select λ less than unity to ensure improvement in detection performance. As N increases, it is clear that a larger λ will result in improvements in performance. As an example, when 
                           N
                           =
                           32
                         one can select 
                           λ
                           =
                           1
                         for either polarisation to ensure detection gains. However, choosing arbitrarily large λ will result in the detector (27) becoming unstable and consequently numerical inversion of (29) may not yield useful results. Hence, in practical application of the detector (27), for a given Pfa and N one can select 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                         and then produce a plot similar to that in Fig. 6 to determine an appropriate λ, observing that the choice must be such that numerical inversion of (29) is achievable.

The next subsection examines detection performance in simulated clutter.

Performance analysis is now undertaken where the clutter is simulated with parameter estimates taken from the Ingara data set under investigation. In all cases the Pfa is set to 
                           
                              
                                 10
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 6
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 D
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.5
                        , while 
                           κ
                           =
                           
                              
                                 10

                         is selected for the ALTNMF. The clutter covariance matrix is estimated using the algorithm in [31]. All detectors thus operate under the assumption of a priori knowledge of the clutter parameters and clutter covariance matrix. For convenience, each of the detectors analysed are summarised in Table 1
                        . A synthetic Gaussian target model (referred to as a Swerling 1 target model in the spirit of [10]) is also used throughout. Monte Carlo simulation is used to produce each detector's Pd as a function of the SCR, using 106 runs in each case.


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the performance of the four detectors from Section 2 together with the norm detectors (13) and (14). The latter uses 
                           p
                           =
                           0.1
                        , which will be used throughout. It was found through numerical investigation that in all cases such a selection resulted in (14) always performing better than (13).

The left subplot in Fig. 7 is for horizontal polarisation, while the right subplot is for the vertically polarised case. The detector (27) uses 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                         and 
                           λ
                           =
                           0.1
                        . Both these plots show the new decision rule (27) improves significantly on the WMF in both polarisations. The GLRT, NMF and ALTNMF all saturate due to the small number of looks, while the norm-based detectors are marginal to the WMF.

In Fig. 8
                         the number of looks is now increased to 
                           N
                           =
                           8
                        , and consequently the ALTNMF begins to improve in performance, while the new detector (27) is still performing better than the WMF. The two norm-based detectors perform better than the ALTNMF in vertical polarisation only.


                        Fig. 9
                         examines the performance when N is increased to 16. Due to the larger number of looks the only detector that saturates is the NMF. In both polarisations (27) has the best performance. For horizontal polarisation, the ALTNMF is marginally better than the WMF, and (27) is a marginal improvement on the ALTNMF. The GLRT performs as well as the norm detector (13), while (14) is marginally better than (13). In the right subplot the detector (27) has a larger gain on the WMF, while the latter is marginally better than the ALTNMF. The GLRT experiences a large loss relative to the ALTNMF, but is marginally better than (14). The detector (13) has the worst performance.

As a final example, Fig. 10
                         plots the detector performance curves for 
                           N
                           =
                           32
                         looks. It was found to be beneficial to increase λ to unity for (27), which is consistent with Fig. 5, while retaining 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                        . This change in λ was done so that (29) yielded a meaningful result for the threshold during inversion. Here we observe that, due to the increased number of looks, all the decision rules from Section 2 perform reasonably well. In the case of horizontal polarisation, the ALTNMF is marginally better than the GLRT, which is in turn also marginally better than the WMF. Detector (27) outperforms each of these detectors. The norm-based detectors clearly have very poor performance as the number of looks increases.

The right subplot in Fig. 10 is for the vertically polarised case. Due to the larger number of looks and the polarisation the ALTNMF and WMF match, outperforming the GLRT and NMF. Interestingly the new detector (27) has a significant gain on the WMF. As for the horizontally polarised case, the two norm-based detectors have the worst performance.

A number of conclusions can be made based upon the numerical results presented in the Section. The p-norm plus compensator detector can improve significantly on each of the decision rules considered here with appropriate selection of p and λ. If the number of looks is smaller than 16, one was able to apply 
                           p
                           =
                           1.9
                         and 
                           λ
                           =
                           0.1
                         to achieve enhanced performance. As the number of looks increases (
                           N
                           >
                           >
                           32
                        ) it is necessary to select a slightly larger λ to ensure stability of decision rules and enhanced performance.

The next Section will examine the case where these decision rules are applied directly to the Ingara data with a synthetic target as before.

To further assess the performance of the p-norm plus compensator detector it has been run directly on the Ingara data set under consideration. This has been implemented by applying it across each range line sequentially, allowing for Monte Carlo estimation of the Pd to be undertaken. The estimates of texture parameters and speckle covariance are obtained as in the previous Section. The approach applied means that, given the data set consists of 840,704 complex returns, the available Monte Carlo run length is this figure less the number of looks. Consequently, for 
                        N
                        =
                        4
                     , the run length is 840,700, for 
                        N
                        =
                        8
                      it is 840,696, for 
                        N
                        =
                        16
                      it is reduced to 840,688 and finally for 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                      it is 840,672. A synthetic Swerling 1 target model has also been applied, as for the case of simulated clutter. All of the other decision rules considered in this study have also been included. It was found advantageous to select 
                        λ
                        =
                        0.15
                      for 
                        N
                        ∈
                        {
                        4
                        ,
                        8
                        ,
                        16
                        }
                      while retaining 
                        p
                        =
                        1.9
                      in the p-norm plus compensator detector. In the case where 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                     , it was found useful to select 
                        λ
                        =
                        0.3
                      with the same p. These choices have been based upon the need to ensure estimation of thresholds can be achieved via (29). The reason for an increase in thresholds is due to a reduction in the available sample size for Monte Carlo estimation of the Pd. These choices are also consistent with the analysis in Figs. 2–5.


                     Figs. 11–14
                     
                     
                     
                      repeat the scenarios of Figs. 7–10. Comparing Figs. 11 and 7, it is very difficult to perceive any difference between the simulated and real performance in the horizontally polarised case. However, in the vertically polarised case there is a slight drop in the p-norm plus compensator detector's performance relative to the WMF when applied to real data. Overall, there is very little change for the case of 
                        N
                        =
                        4
                      looks.

The case where 
                        N
                        =
                        8
                      can be found in Fig. 12, and comparing this with Fig. 8, we see that in horizontal polarisation there is very little difference in performance. There is a slight difference that can be observed between the p-norm detector and the ALTNMF. In the vertically polarised case, the results are also very similar except a slight detection loss when the p-norm plus compensator detector is applied to real data. Nonetheless, for the 
                        N
                        =
                        8
                      looks case, the results are not significantly different.


                     Fig. 13 shows the results for 
                        N
                        =
                        16
                      looks, which can be compared to those obtained in the simulated case in Fig. 9. In the case of horizontal polarisation, there is a prima facie slight improvement in the p-norm plus compensator relative to the ALTNMF. However, this is likely due to the difference in Monte Carlo sampling sizes. There is also a slight difference between the standard norm detector and the GLRT, which is also attributable to Monte Carlo sample sizes. In the case of vertical polarisation, there is a slight detection loss in the p-norm plus compensator relative to the WMF, and there are also small changes in the performance on the standard norm, p-norm and GLRT when run on real data. However, all these changes are small.

As a final comparison, Fig. 14 is for the case of 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                      looks. Comparing this with Fig. 10 it is clear that the results are consistent in both polarisations. For the horizontally polarised case, the p-norm plus compensator has consistently better performance than the ALTNMF. There are slight changes in the performance of the WMF, GLRT and NMF when run on real data, but as shown these changes are very small. The standard norm and p-norm detectors perform comparably in real and simulated clutter, but have overall very bad performance. In the vertically polarised case the results are fairly consistent. The apparent slight improvement in the p-norm plus compensator detector in real data is again likely due to the Monte Carlo sample size difference.

In summary, it is more challenging to apply these detection processes in a real clutter situation. However, the guidelines on the choices of p and λ in Subsection 4.2 have been used and have resulted in improved performance with (27).

This paper was motivated by the need to produce a coherent multilook detection scheme that worked reliably for a small number of looks. Through the introduction of a compensator, the p-norm detector was improved, such that it provided improved detection performance independently of the number of looks. Analysis of detection performance in real data demonstrated consistent performance.

Further work will examine alternative selections for the compensator, to investigate whether further improvements can be achieved. Additionally, it is of interest to investigate whether a compensator can be selected so that the decision rule (27) possesses the CFAR property with respect to the texture distribution.
