               Abstract
               
                  This paper focuses on the architecture and FPGA implementation aspects of a kind of assistive tool for disabled persons with motor neuron diseases, specifically with muscle atrophy. The tool, called a communication interface, allows such persons to communicate with other people by means of moving selected muscles, e.g., within the face. The application of MEMS accelerometers have been proposed as muscle movement sensors. Four different FPGA implementation methods of signal processing from MEMS sensors, i.e., manual HDL coding, usage of the Matlab HDL coder and Vivado HLS as well as embedded microcontroller exploitation, have been investigated. The communication interface can be used either as an input switch for, so called, virtual keyboards or as a stand-alone tool, which allows disabled persons to write a text by means of the Morse code.
