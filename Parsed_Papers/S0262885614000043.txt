@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The recent years have witnessed the continuously explosive growth of the web images, how to annotate these countless web images effectively has become a critical research issue. Usually, images are represented by different types of features, so feature selection is widely used to improve the web image annotation performance. Facing the large-scale web images, traditional feature selection algorithm such as Fisher Score [1] and ReliefF [2] become less effective and efficient because they select features one by one. Recently, sparse feature selection has received a lot of attention in web image annotation [3–6] for achieving better performance. In this paper, we exploit the latest mathematical advance in sparse feature selection to boost web image annotation performance.

Recently, sparse feature selection has received mushroom development. The most well-known sparse model is l
                     1-norm (lasso) [7] and Cai et al. have used an l
                     1-regularized regression model to select features jointly [8]. In spite of the computational convenience, sparse feature selection methods based on l
                     1-norm model select features insufficiently sparse sometimes. Much works [9–12] have extended the l
                     1-norm to the l
                     p-norm (0<
                     p
                     <1). In [13] and [14], Xu et al. have proposed that when p is 1/2, the l
                     p-norm, i.e., l
                     1/2-norm regularization has the best performance. However, all of the above methods neglect the useful information of the correlation between different features. In [15], Nie et al. have introduced a joint l
                     2,1-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization for feature selection, which realizes sparse features selection with the correlation between features. In [16] Ma et al. have proposed l
                     2,p-norm (0<p<2) and apply it to the multimedia event detection to remove the shared irrelevance and noise for obtaining a more discriminative event detector. The lower p is, the more correlated are the concept classifier and the event detector. Because l
                     p-norm (0<
                     p
                     <1) can select more sparse features than l
                     1-norm, Wang et al. [17] recently have proposed an idea to extend l
                     2,1-norm to l
                     2,p-matrix norm (0<
                     p
                     ≤1) so as to select joint, more sparse features, at the same time this method has better robustness than l
                     2,1-norm. In this paper we propose a novel sparse feature selection method based on l
                     2,1/2-matrix norm and apply it to web image annotation.

It is very time-consuming and labor-intensive to label a large number of training data manually, so how to utilize a small number labeled data to annotate large-scale web images becomes a challenging problem. In [18], Yang et al. have proposed to exploit the information shared by multiple related tasks for multimedia content analysis to overcome the limitations of small number labeled data. This work is based on the assumption that the multiple tasks are correlated. However, automatic evaluation of the correlation among multiple tasks is an open problem. Because the unlabeled data are easy to be acquired and are capable of improving the annotation performance, many semi-supervised learning approaches to exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data have been proposed [19–21]. On one hand, the semi-supervised learning can save human labor cost for labeling a large amount of images, on the other hand, which can make full use the unlabeled data to improve the performance. In this paper we apply semi-supervised learning into large-scale web image annotation by exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data.

In [22], Zhu has reviewed different approaches for semi-supervised learning. Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning has obtained most research interest and whose key technique is the graph construction. Jebara et al. [23] have proposed to construct the graph by using b-matching, but this method has high computational complexity and is not suitable for large scale web images. Because of the simplicity, the KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning is widely used and many related methods have been proposed for web image annotation. In [6], Ma et al. have proposed a semi-supervised framework built upon feature selection for automatic image annotation. In [19], Yang et al. have proposed a new framework for web image annotation by integrating shared structure learning and graph-based learning into a joint framework. In [20], Tang et al. have proposed a novel kNN-sparse graph-based semi-supervised learning approach to harness the labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously for noisily-tagged web image annotation. In [24], Wang et al. have used the sample reconstruction method to construct a graph for web image annotation. In this paper, we apply KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning into our sparse feature selection framework to build our model.

In this paper, we propose a new sparse feature selection framework based on l
                     2,1/2-matrix norm and KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning for web image annotation. We call it sparse Feature Selection based on Graph Laplacian (FSLG). By using the l
                     2,1/2-matrix norm model, FSLG can select more sparse and discriminative features. Additionally, our method utilizes Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to exploit small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data for achieving better web image annotation performance. Extensive experiments are performed on NUS-WIDE [25] dataset and MSRA-MM 2.0 [26] dataset and the results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms for web image annotation.

The main contributions of our work are as follows:

                           Sparse Feature Selection based on Graph Laplacian framework is proposed, which utilizes the l
                              2,1/2-matrix norm to select the most sparse and discriminative features and uses the graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to simultaneously exploit small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data to annotate large-scale web images;

A fast iterative algorithm for optimizing the objective function is proposed, and the convergence of the algorithm is proven;

Several experiments are conducted on two web image datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review related works, including sparse feature selection, graph based semi-supervised learning and web image annotation. In Section 3, we describe the details of the proposed model FSLG followed by the proposed solution. In Section 4, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the promising performance of our method for web image annotation. The conclusion is given in Section 5.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In this section, we briefly discuss three related works about our method, which are sparse feature selection, graph Laplacian semi-supervised learning and web image annotation.

Sparse feature selection is aim to use a variety of sparse model to select the most discriminative features and achieve the sparse representation of the data. Sparse feature selection can not only boost the image annotation performance, but also can reduce the computational cost.

The most well-known sparse model is the l
                        1-norm, which is widely used to reformulate sparse feature selection as a convex problem, but it can't select features sufficiently sparse sometimes. Recently, in order to obtain more sparse representation, many works have extended the l
                        1-norm model to the l
                        p-norm (0<
                        p
                        <1) model. In [13,14], Xu et al. have proposed that the l
                        1/2-norm regularization has the most sparsity and the best performance when p belongs to (0, 1]. However, the above methods neglect the correlation between the features. In [15] Nie et al. have proposed the robust l
                        2,1-norm, which can achieve the sparse features selection across all data points. In order to conduct more effective feature selection across all data points, Wang et al. [17] have proposed l
                        2,p-matrix norm and point out when p is 1/2, the l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm regularization can obtain the best performance and sparsity across all data points.

Obviously, l
                        2,p-matrix norm is reduced to l
                        2,1-norm when p
                        =1. When p is belongs to (0, 1), the l
                        2,p-matrix norm becomes a better sparse model than l
                        2,1-norm because l
                        p-norm can find more sparse solution than l
                        1-norm. In addition, for any p belongs to (0, 1), the noise magnitude of distant outlier based on l
                        2,p-matrix norm is no more than that based on l
                        2,1 norm. So the l
                        2,p-matrix norm is expected to select more robust features [17]. Note that l
                        2,p-matrix norm (0<
                        p
                        <1) does not admit the triangular inequality and l
                        2,p-matrix norm (0<
                        p
                        <1) is not convex. In [17], an efficient approach to solve the l
                        2,p-matrix norm problem (0<
                        p
                        ≤1) has been proposed.

When p is 1/2, the l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm regularization has the best performance and sparsity across all data points [17]. So we apply l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm regularization into Eq. (1) for sparse feature selection

Semi-supervised learning can exploit both labeled and unlabeled data, so it is very suitable for web image annotation with only a few available labels. On one hand, the semi-supervised learning can save human labor cost for labeling a large number of training data. On the other hand, it can exploit unlabeled data which are easy to be acquired to improve annotation performance. Because of the simplicity, the KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning has obtained much research interest and many related methods have been proposed for web image annotation [19,20].

The graph-based transductive algorithms have been applied to many multimedia applications, such as content-based multimedia retrieval [30,31], image annotation [32,6,19], and video annotation [33].

Different from previous semi-supervised learning algorithms [34–37], here we minimize the prediction error with respect to the label prediction matrix to exploit the unlabeled data [38]. Inspired by [29], we design a robust loss function of Eq. (1) as follows

Usually, an image is represented by different types of features, so image annotation exploits the correspondence between different features and semantic concepts of the images. Nonetheless, not all the features are useful to image annotation and the irrelevant and/or redundant features should be reduced. Because feature selection can extract important features and reduce the noise to better represent the images, much work [3–6] has focused on optimizing the feature selection process in their annotation frameworks. Facing the countless and complex web image resources, the sparse features selection becomes more important because it can select the most discriminative and sparse features with good robustness. Moreover, many of the web image resources are unlabeled, so utilizing the semi-supervised learning method to exploit small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data is helpful to improve the web image annotation performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel sparse feature selection framework which selects the most discriminative features based on l
                        2,1/2-matix norm and graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to boost the web image annotation performance.

In this section, we propose a sparse feature selection framework for web image annotation, namely sparse Feature Selection based on Graph Laplacian (FSLG). We first introduce the formulation of FSLG and then design an effective algorithm to solve the objective function of FSLG.

The basic idea of our method is to realize the sparse feature selection based on l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm with graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning.

In the above function, the regularization term λ‖G‖2,1/2
                        1/2 guarantees our model can select the most sparse and discriminative features with good robustness. The predicted label matrix F introduced by the graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning can simultaneously satisfy the smoothness on the ground truth labels of the training data and the graph model S. This makes our method exploit the small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data well for selecting more important features.

It is worth mentioning that our framework is different from [29] and [6]. The method in [29] is dedicated to classification and dimensionality reduction and not to feature selection. Though the method in [6] is able to select features across all the data points, the selected features are less sparse and robust than our method. Moreover, the way to obtain G of our framework differs from [29] and [6]. In [29] 
                        G is calculated easily in a closed form. We also can't directly adopt the algorithm in [6] because the l
                        2,1/2-matrix makes our framework non-convex. To efficiently solve our model, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain G in the next Section.

As our problem involves the l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm, which makes Eq. (9) non-convex. As a result, we solve this objective problem of Eq. (9) as follows.

By setting the derivative of Eq. (9) w.r.t b to zero, we have

3: Return G.

Here we briefly discuss the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. At the training stage, we need compute the graph Laplacian matrix L and the decision rule matrix U, whose computational complexity is 
                           O
                        (n
                        2). Learning the optimized projected matrix G involves calculating the inverse of a few matrices, the largest complexity is 
                           O
                        (n
                        3). Thus, the complexity of training process is about 
                           O
                        (n
                        3). At the test stage, once G is obtained, we need to perform c
                        ×
                        d
                        ×
                        n
                        test times multiplications to predict the concepts of the testing images. Here n
                        test is the number of the test images. For large scale datasets, n
                        test
                        ≫
                        c and n
                        test
                        ≫
                        d. Therefore, the image annotation complexity of our framework is approximately linear with respect to n
                        test, making it suitable to annotate large-scale web images.

The proposed iterative approach in Algorithm 1 can be verified to converge to the optimal G by Theorem 1. Before that we introduce two lemmas.

The lemmas and the convergence of Algorithm 1 can be proved following the work in [5,15], and [17].

In our method, the FSLG model satisfies the linear assumption of the sparse feature selection. In order to do with the non-linear sparse feature selection, we extend the FSLG model to a nonlinear algorithm via the kernel tricks.

To this end, we project original space data to a high-dimensional kernel Hilbert space ℋ with a kernel mapping function. Here, ϕ(X) and ϕ(Y) is the mapped representation of the training features and the labels in the kernel space ℋ. Then, the nonlinear FSLG model for web image annotation can be written as follows:

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on two web image datasets to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm for large-scale web image annotation.

In our experiments, we have used two web image datasets, i.e., NUS-WIDE dataset [25] and MSRA-MM2.0 dataset [26] to test the performance of our method.

The NUS-WIDE dataset was created by the Lab for Media Search in National University of Singapore in 2009 and it includes 269,648 real-world images with 81 concepts. Three types of visual features including 144-dimension normalized color correlogram (CORR), 128-dimension normalized wavelet texture (WT), and 73-dimension normalized edge direction histogram (EDH) are combined here to form 345-dimension feature for representing each image in this dataset.

The MSRA-MM2.0 dataset was created by Microsoft Research Asia in 2009 and it consists of 50,000 images with 100 concepts. Three types of visual features including 144-dimension normalized color correlogram (CORR), 128-dimension normalized wavelet texture (WT), and 75-dimension normalized edge direction histogram (EDH) are combined to form 347-dimension feature for representing each image in this dataset.

The model FSLG is compared with some related sparse feature selection algorithms for web image annotation. The compared methods are simply listed as follows.
                           
                              •
                              Sparse multinomial logistic regression via Bayesian l
                                 1 regularization (SBMLR) [39]: It realizes sparse feature selection by using a Laplace prior based on Bayesian l
                                 1 regularization.

Feature selection via joint l
                                 2,1-norms minimization (FSNM) [15]: It employs joint l
                                 2,1-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization for joint feature selection.

Structural Feature Selection with Sparsity (SFSS) [6]: a recent sparse feature selection algorithm. It utilized semi-supervised learning with the l
                                 2,1-norm for feature selection.

Feature Selection with Shared Information among multiple tasks (FSSI) [18]: a recent multi-task feature selection algorithm, which can borrow the knowledge from other related tasks for feature selection.

In our experiments, our method FSLG, method SFSS and method FSSI can simultaneously realize feature selection and classification. For FSNM and SBMLR methods, we first use them to perform feature selection, and then use regularized least square regression to learn classifiers from the selected sparse features.

In the experiment, a training set that comprised 3000 images is randomly sampled for each dataset and the rest of the images are used as testing set. The training set includes n labeled samples and n is set to 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% of the total training set respectively. We observe the performance variation according to the number of labeled training data and record the corresponding results. The experiments are conducted five times independently and the average results are reported.

There are several parameters need to tune in our experiments. The number of nearest neighbors to compute the Laplacian matrix k is set to {10, 15, 20, 25}. Two regularization parameters μ and λ in Eq. (9) are in the range of {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000} and the best results are reported. Parameter p is implemented from {0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1} in l
                        2,p-matrix norm based optimization problems.

In the experiments, we use three evaluation metrics to evaluate the annotation performance, i.e., Mean Average Precision (MAP), MicroAUC and MacroAUC. MAP is the well-known evaluation metric widely used for web image annotation [5]. AUC is a better evaluation metric in classification problems [40,41]. [42] indicates that microAUC can measure the global performance across multiple classes and macroAUC can measure the average performance of all classes. In microAUC, the class indicator vectors of different classes are concatenated as a long vector, and then, the average AUC is computed. In macroAUC, the mean AUC of each class is first computed, then, the mean AUC values of all the classes are averaged.

                        Fig. A
                         illustrates some annotation results of five images in each dataset. The top three or four keywords are selected as the labels of these images respectively. Though there are some wrong annotation results, Fig. A still indicates the FSLG algorithm suitable for web image annotation.

We compare our FSLG algorithm with other algorithms when the labeled data are at different percentages. Fig. B
                         shows the annotation results with the metric MAP and Tables A.1–A.4
                        
                        
                        
                         shows the annotation results with the metrics MicroAUC and MacroAUC. Five times independent experiments are conducted and the average results are reported. The results illustrate that our method FSLG outperforms the other algorithms on both datasets.

We have the following observations from Fig. B and Tables A.1–A.4: First, our method FSLG has the best performance in terms of MAP, MicroAUC and MacroAUC on the two datasets. The observations indicate that the proposed FSLG can effectively select the most discriminative sparse features to boost the annotation performance and has the ability to annotate large-scale web images with comparatively small amount of labeled training data. Second, as the number of labeled training images increases, the performance of our method FSLG gradually improves. For example, for NUS-WIDE image dataset, the MicroAUC of FSLG is 0.888 with 10% percentage labeled training images while 0.901 when the percentage of labeled training images increases to 25%.

There are two main reasons for the good performance of FSLG for web image annotation. First, it can select the most discriminative sparse features with good robustness based upon l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm. Second, our method use the graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to exploit the small number labeled data and the large number unlabeled data by introducing a predicted label matrix F which can simultaneously satisfy the smoothness on the ground truth labels of the training data and the graph model S.

As the number of selected features can affect the effectiveness and computational efficiency for web image annotation, we perform an experiment to study how the number of selected features affects the performance. At the same time, we compare our method FSLG with method SFSS on two datasets. Here the number of the selected features is set to 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and all respectively. We use 10% percentage labeled training data and metric MAP. Parameter μ and parameter λ are set to 1 and k is set to 15. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. C
                        .


                        Fig. C shows that the performance of our method FSLG and method SFSS varies when the number of selected features changes. From Fig. C we have the following observations. 1) When the number of selected features is too small, MAP is lower than that with all features. This could be attributed to the loss of some useful information. 2) MAP arrives at the peak level with 200 features for FSLG method while with 250 features for SFSS method on NUS-WIDE dataset. MAP arrives at the peak level with 150 features for FSLG method while with 250 features for SFSS method on MSRA-MM dataset. These indicate FSLG can obtain better performance with the fewer features compared to method SFSS. We conclude that our method can select the more sparse and discriminative features and reduce noise to achieve the better annotation performance.

Here we also conduct an experiment to study how many features of each type are selected in terms of annotated labels (labels with their preferred features). Fig. D
                         shows three images with the corresponding labels and the selected features from two datasets respectively. The total number of the selected features of each image is 200 for the NUS-WIDE dataset and 150 for the MSRA-MM dataset. From Fig. D we can see the number of selected features of each type is different in terms of different images with the corresponding labels. For example, for the image with labels “flower” and “plants” from NUS-WIDE dataset, the selected features are 128-dimension WT, 63-dimension CORR and 9-dimension EDH, which indicates the WT features are preferred to be selected. For the image with labels “wedding” and “flower” from MSRA-MM dataset, the selected features are 6-dimension WT, 118-dimension CORR and 26-dimension EDH, which indicates the CORR features are preferred to be selected.

As our method uses semi-supervised learning to exploit both labeled and unlabeled data, an experiment is especially designed to discover the impact of the unlabeled data on the annotation results. One case is that only the labeled training data are used to learn the FSLG model, the other case is that all the training labeled data and unlabeled data are used to learn the model. Then we compare the results of the two cases and find the influence of the unlabeled data on the annotation results. The training labeled data are set to 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% percentage respectively. In addition, we compare our method FSLG with SFSS in this experiment. The results are illustrated in Fig. E
                        .


                        Fig. E illustrates that using all training data including unlabeled data and labeled data achieves better results than only using the labeled data on two datasets. That implies using unlabeled data is able to enhance annotation performance. At the same time, we can see our method FSLG yields better annotation results over SFSS with only labeled training data as well as with all training data. This again indicates our method FSLG has a better ability to annotate web images by exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data.

Our method FSLG can realize the better sparse feature selection based on l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm. The l
                        2,1/2-matrix norm is the special case of l
                        2,p-matrix norm when p is equal to 1/2. In order to demonstrate the influence of parameter p on annotation results, typical p belongs to (0, 1] are tested in this experiment. Here we implement the optimization problem with different p, which is set to 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 respectively. Table B
                         shows the annotation results according to different parameter p on NUS-WIDE dataset and MSRA-MM2.0 dataset. The results in bold indicate the best performance.

We conduct this experiment with 10% percentage labeled training data and use the metric MAP. The experiment produces different annotation results corresponding to different parameter p. From Table B we have the following observations. 1) The best annotation results are produced when p is 0.5. 2) When p belongs to (0, 0.5), the closer to 0 the p is, the worse the performance is. This indicates the features should not be selected too sparse, otherwise much useful information is lost. 3) If p is near 1, the model is almost SFSS. To sum up, the results of this experiment show that our method FSLG (p
                        =0.5) can achieve the best web image annotation performance with the most discriminative features.

An experiment is conducted here to learn about the sensitivity of regularization parameters μ and λ in Eq. (9). They are set to 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 respectively. Following the above experiment, 10% percentage labeled training data is used and MAP is taken as the metric.


                        Fig. F
                         demonstrates that the MAP varies with μ and λ on the two datasets. Here we set k to15 and use 10% percentage labeled training data. From Fig. F we obtain the different annotation performance corresponding to different values' combinations of μ and λ. When μ and λ is approximately equal, the annotation performance is better than the case when they are different too much. When μ
                        =
                        λ
                        =10 the annotation performance is best for NUS-WIDE dataset, while when μ
                        =

                        =1 the annotation performance is best for MSRA-MM 2.0 dataset.

An experiment is conducted to test the influence of parameter k, which is the number of the nearest neighbors to compute the Laplacian matrix. Following the above experiment, 10% percentage labeled training data is used and parameter μ and parameter λ are set to 1.


                        Table C
                         shows that the performance varies with parameter k. The number of k nearest neighbors is set to 10, 15, 20 and 25 in this experiment. We observe from Table C that the annotation performance of FSLG varies slightly with different k on two datasets. So, the number of the nearest neighbors to compute the Laplacian matrix k is set to 15 in other experiments of our paper.

As proved before, the objective function value shown in Eq. (17) monotonically decreases until convergence by using the iterative approach Algorithm 1. Here we conduct an experiment on two datasets to show the convergence and the convergence curves are shown in Fig. G
                        . We conduct this experiment on a personal computer (2.90GHz, 4Gb RAM) with Matlab (2010b).


                        Fig. G shows the convergence curves of our method FSLG on NUS-WIDE and MSRA-MM datasets. For NUS-WIDE dataset, it can be observed from Fig.G.1 that the objective function value converges via 6 iterations and the convergence time is 4.60s. For MSRA dataset, we can observe from Fig.G.2 that the objective function value converges via 16 iterations and the corresponding convergence time is 18.5s. This experiment illustrates our method FSLG has good convergence, which indicates FSLG can select more sparse and discriminative features and is capable to annotate large-scale web images.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we propose a new sparse feature selection framework FSLG for web image annotation. This model can select more sparse features based on l
                     2,1/2-matrix norm, meanwhile it exploits both labeled and unlabeled data via graph-based semi-supervised learning. By using the l
                     2,1/2-matrix norm, FSLG can select most sparse and discriminative features with good robustness to enhance the large-scale web image annotation performance. Additionally, the Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning can save human labor cost of labeling a large amount of images and improve the web image annotation performance by exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data. Although the objective function of the FSLG model is non-convex, an effective algorithm to obtain the optimal solution is introduced and the convergence of the algorithm is proven. Extensive experiments are performed on two web image datasets. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and is suitable for large-scale web image annotation.
