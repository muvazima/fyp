                  In this article, we derive a solution for a linear stochastic model on a complex time domain. In this type of models, the time domain can be any collection of points along the real number line, so these models are suitable for problems where events do not occur at evenly-spaced time intervals. We present examples based on well-known results from economics and finance to illustrate how our model generalizes and extends conventional dynamic models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In many business disciplines, especially in economics and finance, researchers are interested in modeling dynamics of variables whose current values are influenced by their own expected future values. Perhaps the best known example of such a model is the Cagan (1956) model of hyperinflation. In that model, the current price level depends on how economic agents form expectations about the future price level. In finance, the current price of an asset can be modeled as a function of a future price of that asset.Generally, such models are expressed as

                     , which can be either a deterministic or a random variable.

This type of model served as a building block for many seminal works. Lucas (1973) employed this type of model to study output-inflation tradeoff. Sargent and Wallace (1975) used it to study the effectiveness of various monetary policies. Sargent (1977) and Taylor (1979) studied econometric methods for estimating a dynamic model with expectations. These works and many others shaped modern macroeconomics.

Theoretical and empirical aspects of this model continue to receive attention in the literature. Blanchard and Kahn (1980), Broze, Janssen, and Szafarz (1984) and Gourieroux, Laffont, and Monfort (1982)
                     analyzed solutions to general versions of this model which can include expectations of multiple future values and lags of y. Christiano (1987) discussed econometric issues pertaining to this type of model.

In this paper, we generalize the model in (1.1) by allowing the time period between the current period and the period for which expectation is formed to be of any arbitrary length. A related work by Tucci (2004) takes a step in this direction by restating Cagan’s model using m-period future expectations:

                     The principal difference between the models in (1.1) and (1.2) is in how they approach timing of events. The time domain of (1.1) is a set of integers, so events in this model occur at evenly spaced time intervals. The time domain of (1.3) can be any collection of points on

                      can be a function of its expected value at any arbitrary point in the future, and the interval between point t and the next point on the time domain can vary over time. The models in (1.1) and (1.2) are special cases of the model in (1.3). Thus, the model in (1.3) is a generalization of existing models in the literature.

In the next section, we present the theory behind the dynamic model used in this paper and derive the solution for the model in (1.3). Then we discuss two examples to draw parallels with existing models and to show how the model proposed in this paper contributes to the literature on dynamic modeling.

With the help of these definitions we derive the general solution for the model (1.3) where f may be a linear or a nonlinear function. We then illustrate how our model and its solution generalize the existing results in the literature (Broze, Gourieroux, & Szafarz, 1985; Broze et al., 1984; Broze & Szafarz, 1984; Gourieroux et al., 1982; Pesaran, 1981). In the statement of the next theorem, we use the notation given in the paper (Merrell et al., 2004), and we drop the variable t of

Therefore, the solution shown in (3.9) retains the familiar structure of this type of models while offering greater flexibility for modeling timing of events. For example, consider the following two time scales:

Although the above example is simple, it highlights the strengths of the model proposed in this paper:The model explicitly takes into account timing of events. In the context of Cagan’s model of hyperinflation, by varying 
                           
                              T
                           
                        , we can amplify or diminish the effect of future monetary injections on the price level by simply adjusting their timing.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Since the publication of the pioneering paper on rational expectations by Muth (1961), a lot of research addressed mathematical and economic aspects of the theory. The central ideas behind the rational expectations models is that expectations are formed rationally, that the agents are using all available information to form expectations, and that forecast errors are orthogonal to agents’ information set.

We contribute to the literature by developing a model of rational expectations on the time domains where events can occur at unevenly spaced time points. The key advantage of our model is that, unlike conventional models in which events are assumed to take place at evenly spaced intervals, the intervals between events can be of any arbitrary length. We present two examples to demonstrate how the model presented in this paper offers a generalization of conventional discrete time models by allowing greater flexibility in modeling timing of events.
