                  In a paper published in Management Science in 1984, Korhonen, Wallenius, and Zionts presented the idea and method based on convex-cone dominance in the discrete Multiple Criteria Decision Making framework. In our current paper, we revisit the old idea from a new standpoint and provide the mathematical theory leading to a dual-cone based approach to solving such problems. Our paper makes the old results computationally more tractable. The results provided in the present paper also help extend the theory.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The purpose of Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods is to find the most preferred solution(s) or rank the alternatives based upon decision-maker’s preferences. We consider a finite number of given alternatives characterized by a small number of criteria. We assume that the decision-maker can compare two alternatives at a time. Without loss of generality, we assume that for all criteria, more is better. The problem has been studied by many scholars. We reference here the most important studies, which have addressed the problem in the same setting: finite number of alternatives. Keeney and Raiffa (1976) developed the theory and methods for eliciting multi-attribute value and utility functions. Roy (1973) and other representatives of the ``French school” pioneered the outranking methods. Saaty (1980) developed the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Greco, Matarazzo, and Slowiński (2001) pioneered the rough sets approach to solving MCDM problems. Korhonen, Köksalan, Wallenius and Zionts used the interactive optimization methods for solving discrete MCDM problems (Köksalan & Sagala, 1995; Korhonen, 1988; Korhonen, Wallenius, & Zionts, 1984; Zionts, 1981). For a good book discussing at length decision aids for such selection problems, see Olson (1996).

Our approach to solving the discrete MCDM (selection) problem is based upon an implicit quasi-concave value function, corresponding to convex-to-the-origin indifference contours. This approach was first introduced by Korhonen et al. (1984). Quasi-concave value functions encompass a wide class of functions, including the concave functions, differentiable pseudoconcave functions (Bazaraa & Shetty, 1979), and locally Lipschitz nonsmooth pseudoconcave functions (Soleimani-damaneh, 2007). The main idea in the Korhonen et al. (1984) approach is to use decision-maker’s pairwise preference comparisons and the properties of quasi-concave functions to construct convex dominance cones, consisting of the inferior alternatives (to a known alternative). Linear programming is then used to check whether alternatives would lie in or under such dominance cones. See also, Prasad, Karwan, and Zionts (1997), Ramesh, Karwan, and Zionts (1988), Korhonen and Karaivanova (1999), and Karsu (2014).

The current paper revisits the old idea underlying the convex dominance cones. More specifically, we develop the theory for such cones utilizing the dual cones. The dual cone approach leads to an algorithm for checking the dominance of given alternatives utilizing some simple inner products of vectors, resulting in considerable computational savings (with respect to the average running time) compared to the old approach

                        In 1984 paper, Korhonen, Wallenius, and Zionts were aware of the dual formulation. They also outlined the so called ``modified” efficiency program to detect dominated alternatives using the dual formulation. However, they did not further pursue the dual cone theory.
                     . Illustrative examples are also provided. Section 2 contains required preliminaries. Sections 3 and 4 provide the main results. Section 5 concludes the paper.

The ``convex-cone method” (Korhonen et al., 1984) is an interactive algorithm, where steps of computation alternate with steps of decision-making. During the decision-making steps, which guide the algorithm towards better alternatives, the DM will provide preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons. The computing steps take the DM’s preference information into account by generating convex cones, defining regions consisting of dominated alternatives. Alternatives which lie under such cones can be eliminated, since they do not contain the most preferred alternative. Then additional preference information is sought, and new cones are generated. Again, new dominated alternatives are eliminated. The process finally eliminates all but one alternative, namely the most preferred alternative.

Assume that we have m decision alternatives defined by p criteria. We denote the alternatives by

                           . In the MCDM context, each objective function is called a criterion and each feasible point is called an alternative.
                     . It is assumed that there are no duplicate alternatives. The main idea of the ``convex-cone method” (Korhonen et al., 1984) is to construct polyhedral convex cones utilizing the pairwise judgements made by the DM. The constructed cones are used as reference cones to recognize and eliminate dominated alternatives. The alternatives which are determined dominated by the constructed convex cones can be eliminated, since the most preferred alternative is not among them.

Based on the above discussions and the results given by Korhonen et al. (1984), one way for checking the dominance of some given alternatives is solving LP (6) once for each alternative. Since the number of alternatives (|Θ| which is denoted by m) is usually large, the number of LPs which have to be solved can be very large, and hence utilizing this traditional approach might be computationally expensive. In the following, we provide a dual-based technique which is able to check the dominance of the alternatives without solving LP problems. In fact, it is done by checking some simple inner products. In the following theorem, the v vectors are row-vectors.

                         Note that this number indicates the number of operations (additions, multiplications and comparisons) required for solving LP problems in the most optimistic case, in which the problems can be solved using only one iteration. In practice, we may have to do several iterations.

Since the number of constraints and variables in V is usually a very small number, obtaining the extreme generators of V is not difficult from a computational standpoint. Thus, the main part of Algorithm 1, computationally, is due to Steps 2–8. The following theorem concerns the computational complexity of these steps.

The proof of Theorem 3 is in Section 4. Due to Theorem 3 
                        Eq. (7) and Theorem 3, the number of operations required for using the LP-based method in the most optimistic case almost equals to that of using Steps 2–8 of Algorithm 1 in the most pessimistic case. We compared the two methods by applying them to some sample problems with randomly-generated data. The speed of Algorithm 1 in comparison to the LP-based approach for the studied problems has been reported in Table 1
                        . For each sample, both methods have been run ten times and the average running time for both methods has been documented. The running time of Algorithm 1 has been calculated for Steps 1–8. The relative speed (RS) (speed-up) for each sample problem has been calculated as

                         For the studied problems, Algorithm 1 works considerably (much in some cases) better than the traditional LP-based method. As mentioned before, the number of criteria, p, is usually small, and in our case in all samples it was equal to 5. The number of alternatives included in the pairwise comparisons, t, is usually greater than p, though it is very small compared to the number of alternatives, m. In samples

                         which are small/medium-sized problems, we have considered 
                           
                              t
                              =

                         for all of them and

                         and 5000, respectively. Since p and t are small, obtaining extreme generators of V is computationally easy. From Table 1, in samples 
                           #
                        1–6 by increasing m while p, t are fixed the RS increases. It is due to the fact that increasing m leads to an increasing number of LPs which must be solved in the LP-based approach, while in our approach it only increases the number of columns in the matrix multiplication. Holding p, m fixed and doubling t in samples

                         are obtained. It is seen that Algorithm 1 is still much faster than the LP-based method, although the relative speed decreases compared to samples 
                           
                              #

                        . This is due to Step 1. Increasing t increases the size of V, and accordingly increases the computations required in obtaining the extreme generators of V. Samples 
                           
                              #

                         consider two large-scale problems. These large-scale problems also verify the computational power of the dual cone method compared to the traditional one.

As a final remark, although in real-world problems p, t are very small compared to m, consider p, t big numbers. Then the number of alternatives with known dominance situation increases, the number of points which should be evaluated decreases, and thus in such a situation the running time of Algorithm 1 might be close to that of the LP-based method (also due to Step 1). Although such a situation is rare in practice, trying to decrease the computational burden in the presence of large p, t values may be a worthwhile problem for future research. Decomposition approaches and column generation methods (Bazaraa et al., 1990) might be usful in this direction.

It can be shown that, if v is an extreme generator of V, then

                            is an extreme feasible solution to LP (7). Conversely, if 
                              
                                 v

                            is an extreme feasible solution of LP (7), then it is an extreme generator of V. On the other hand, if an LP, in which all variables are nonnegative, has an optimal solution, then it has an extreme optimal solution (Bazaraa et al., 1990). Therefore, we get

                            hyperplanes are active at the origin as well. Therefore, v

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we have presented a dual-cone approach for convex cone dominance. The presented mathematical results led to an algorithm for checking the dominance of the given alternatives utilizing some simple inner products. The results established in the present paper make the convex cone dominance idea more understandable and operational. Also these results can be helpful in extending the theory and connecting MCDM with recent developments in mathematical programming. Additional efforts for reducing the computational complexity of the problem and extending the results to a wider class of value functions can be worth further study; see e.g. Soleimani-damaneh, Korhonen, and Wallenius (2014) for a recent study about nonsmooth value functions.
