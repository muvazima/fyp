                  The aim of the study was to investigate thermo-physiological comfort of three back protectors identifying design features affecting heat loss and moisture management. Five volunteers tested the back protectors in a climatic chamber during an intermittent physical activity. Heart rate, average skin temperature, sweat production, microclimate temperature and humidity have been monitored during the test. The sources of heat losses have been identified using infrared thermography and the participants answered a questionnaire to express their subjective sensations associated with their thermo-physiological condition. The results have shown that locally torso skin temperature and microclimate depended on the type of back protector, whose design allowed different extent of perspiration and thermal insulation. Coupling physiological measurements with the questionnaire, it was found that overall comfort was dependent more on skin wetness than skin temperature: the participants preferred the back protector with the highest level of ventilation through the shell and the lowest level of microclimate humidity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Winter sports are high-energy outdoor activities that involve inherent risks, resulting in numerous falls and collisions with approximately 1.5/1000 traumatic injuries skier/day (Burtscher et al., 2008). The increasing number of skiers and snowboarders makes the development of high performance protective equipment crucial: back protectors have a fundamental role, shielding the spinal cord livers and other underlying organs thus protecting the skier from severe injuries. Historically, protectors had a hard-shell construction consisting of a hard outer shell made of a thermoplastic material combined with an inner soft padding foam. The shock attenuation technology was derived from motorcycling industry and was based on the concept of dissipating impact energy over a wide area (Smith et al., 2005). Recently, the market has seen an increasing number of products based on the soft-shell technology, made of polymeric foams with a pseudo-dilatant nature (Palmer and Green, 2005). Soft-shells are capable of reacting like a hard and rigid material when hit by a high-speed impact and like a soft and viscous material when hit by a low-speed impact. This behaviour enables a high level of protection as well as flexibility and comfort during use (Nicotra et al., 2014). Soft foams allow manufacturers to create perforated structures improving temperature control and ventilation (Nicotra et al., 2014).

Although mechanical properties are important in the development of back protectors, thermal comfort also plays a significant role in the design of such protective devices. Previous studies (Pezzoli et al., 2010, 2012, in press) have demonstrated that garments have a significant effect on sport performance: downhill skiing is particularly demanding because of the intermittent nature, alternating high-intensity phases (skiing) and resting phases (chairlift). These conditions, combined with the insulating and heavy clothing worn during skiing, makes the body sweat and exposes it to large temperature fluctuations. However, body temperature has to be kept as stable as possible and moisture needs to be expelled to avoid condensation and maintain thermal comfort (Huang, 2016). Back protectors are made of thick and bulk materials acting as a barrier against heat and moisture management. One of the reasons why athletes sometimes do not use protective devices is related with thermal discomfort provided by the use of protectors (Wardiningsih et al., 2014). Therefore, it is crucial to design back protectors with improved thermal comfort to convince the largest number of skiers to use this important safety equipment.

Thermal comfort of clothing has been investigated with simulations in climatic chambers in many works (Wardiningsih et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012; Renberg et al., 2014; Schindelka et al., 2013; Kofler et al., 2015; Bulut et al., 2013; Deren et al., 2012). In a recent paper (Wardiningsih et al., 2014), the influence of impact protective garments on thermo-physiological comfort has been investigated using a thermal manikin. It was found that the protective garment has a high dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance. Colonna et al. (2014) have recently measured directly on athletes, in real and simulated conditions, the temperature and moisture management of different ski boot liners. The study has been conducted using small wireless sensors that do not significant affect the athletic performances. The authors have demonstrated that tests in a climatic chamber can simulate real skiing in outdoor conditions.

The aim of this work was to investigate the performances in terms of heat and moisture management of three commercial soft-shell back protectors to identify design parameters affecting thermal comfort during winter sport activities. This goal has been pursued through wear trials of five testers who performed a controlled intermittent physical activity on a treadmill in a controlled environment to simulate the metabolic rate of skiing.

Back Protector 1 (BP1) fits on the body with adjustable strings and an elastic band around the hip, Back Protector 2 (BP2) has a tight waistcoat with an elastic band around the hip and Back Protector 3 (BP3) is made of an oblong shell covering the lower back and has a double elastic band around the hip (Fig. 1
                     ).

The flexible shells have also different shapes: BP1 partially covers the spine from the neck to the waist, while BP2 and BP3 protect the spine up to the sacrum.

Back protectors characteristics are shown in Table 1
                     . The weight of the shock-absorber shell is 60% of the overall weight for BP1, 50% for BP2 and 47% for BP3. Thus, the vest represents a variable and non-negligible portion of the whole back protector mass. BP2 is the lightest due to the low density of the shock absorber material and the high density of holes in its structure.

The tests have been performed inside a climatic room (54 m3volume) where the average air temperature (Ta) was 12.83 ± 0.38 °C, the relative humidity (RH) was 65.07± 1.12% and the air-flow in the climatic room was set to 0.2 m s−1. Even though back protectors are normally worn under the ski jacket, in this work the back protector was worn as external layer, as shown in Fig. 2
                     : this configuration allowed to assess back protectors performance without the interference of any additional clothing layer attenuating any difference. As the back protector alone did not guarantee protection against cold, a mild temperature of 12 °C was set in the climatic room.

Back protectors were worn by five volunteers (three women and two men) with average age of 33.0 ± 3.8 and average weight of 57.38 ± 2.87 kg. The number of participants is comparable with other literature works investigating thermal comfort of apparel and sports equipment (Splendore et al., 2011; Havenith et al., 2008; Dai, 2011; Öner et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2008; Hofer et al., 2014). The participants were informed about the type of test and freely decided to participate in the experimentation. The experimental procedure was conform to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Each volunteer wore all three back protectors and did the same physical activity in three different days at the same hour, to avoid the effect of circadian cycles. Apart from the back protector, the volunteers wore the same outfit: long sleeved shirt and underpants of a typical ski outfit. Both shirt and underpants were made of a double layer fabric with the inner layer made of 100% polypropylene and the external layer of 75% polyamide and 25% Elastan.

The physical activity was preceded by a 10-minute acclimatization phase and followed by a 30-minute recovery phase (see Fig. 3
                     ), during which the subject was at rest. Acclimatization and recovery are common in this type of trials, independently of the type of activity simulated (Hofer et al., 2014; Kenny et al., 2011). The aim was to make environmental conditions uniform for all subjects before the test starts and to monitor physiological conditions at the end of the test. While doing no physical activity in a mildly cold environment, the body temperature dropped during the acclimatization phase; thus, to avoid uncomfortable cold sensations, the acclimatization duration was short. Differently, the recovery phase duration was longer because metabolic heat, which was still to dissipate after the end of the physical activity, kept the subject comfortable even in a cold environment for a longer time.

The volunteers were weighted (precision of ±5 g) before and after the test to evaluate the amount of sweat evaporated from the body during the test. The heart rate was monitored to confirm the test repeatability. Each volunteer was equipped with eleven miniaturized wireless sensors Hygrochron – Maxim–Dallas (RH resolution 0.04% and temperature resolution 0.0625 °C) with a sampling rate of 30 s (Fig. 4
                     ).

Eight sensors were located on the chest, elbow, scapula, deltoid, hand, forehead, calf and thigh, according to ISO 9886:2004 (2004) to evaluate the Average Skin Temperature (TASK) through the formula:

Torso skin area was estimated by averaging the four skin temperatures of the torso area only. A new average temperature, which was named Average Torso Skin Temperature (TATSK), has been defined in this work as follows:

The same weight (0.25) was given to chest and scapula temperature in Eq. (2), similarly to Eq. (1), in which scapula and chest contribute to the average skin temperature with the same weight.

Using the thermo-camera Thermo Tracer TH9100MW (NEC Avio Infrared Technologies Co., Japan), thermographs of the volunteers' back (320 × 240 pixels with resolution of 0.02 °C) were taken during the test.

To catch the evolution of subjective sensations, a questionnaire was filled-out by the participants four times during the test: after acclimatization (t10′), at the end of physical activity (t30′), after 15 min of recovery (t45′) and at the end of the test (t′60). The questionnaire is shown in Table 2
                     : Q1 and Q2 were focused on the volunteer's overall thermal sensation, Q3 and Q4 on thermal and humidity sensations perceived on the skin and Q5 on thermal insulation (Q5a), breathability (Q5b) and touch sensation of the BPs (Q5c and Q5d). For each question, a numerical scale was associated to the answers (in brackets in Table 2). Then, each score was multiplied by the answer frequency and summed, providing a single numerical value. The value of each question score was then normalized to 10.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Heart rate (HR) of one volunteer is shown as an example in Fig. 5
                        : The four peaks correspond to the four repeated cycles with variable speeds and inclinations shown in Fig. 3. The three curves show a similar pattern, confirming that the volunteers did a similar and repeatable effort while testing each back protector.

The mean and maximum heart rates averaged over all participants are shown in Fig. 6
                         and the P-values of the ANOVA in Table 3
                         confirmed that the mean and maximum heart rate did not show significant differences (the confidence interval was set to 95%).

Sweat evaporation shows great variations among participants as shown in Fig. 7
                        .

Sweating does not begin simultaneously all over the body: at the onset of sweating, perspiration appears on the forehead initially, followed in order by the upper arms, hands, tights, feet, back and abdomen (Gebhart, 1989). An increase in sweat secretion can be achieved by increasing the number of participating glands and by increasing the output of each active gland (Gebhart, 1989). Moreover, the primary response to heating of a local skin area is increasing the output of individual glands, rather than stimulating larger number of glands to sweat (Houdas and Ring, 1982). The use of back-protectors, which are strongly insulating, will likely stimulate a strong local physiological response in terms of sweat output of the back sweating glands. We will see further that the BP shells cause a sudden increase of microclimate temperature and that humidity microclimate is close to saturation in the back region. These observations suggest that localized sweating under the BP occurs. Thus, back-protector design should maximize breathability to quickly evaporate abundant amount of sweat from the back area: possible strategies include the perforation of the shell to the maximum extent without compromising shock absorption capacity or the formation of a thin air layer between the back protector and the underlying garments to develop a stack effect. This thin air layer can be formed by appropriately designing the shell shape and curvature.

Average skin temperature averaged over the five volunteers is shown in Fig. 8
                        . Heat loss in the cold environment was not compensated by heat produced by metabolism during the first 15 min and the average skin temperature decreased. From minutes 15 to 30, TASK showed a wavy trend due to the intermittent physical activity; TASK stayed low from minute 20 to 30 because of evaporative cooling. After the end of physical activity, TASK increased due to less ventilation and less sweating and remained quite constant during the recovery phase.

The TASK curve of BP1 was lower compared to those of BP2 and BP3. This result was a consequence of BP1 design, the only BP without a vest covering the chest area (see Fig. 1). Without the vest additional layer, chest temperature when wearing BP1 was much lower with respect to BP2 and BP3. Thus, without the vest, the back-protector will cause local temperature gradients in the torso area, as the chest will be much colder than the back. This can potentially be a problem in thermoregulation because the jacket worn on top of the back-protector could be too light for the chest area or too thick for the back one.

To compare quantitatively the three BPs, the ANOVA was carried out on the following parameters: the average skin temperature at the end of the acclimatization phase (

                        ). The same analysis was carried out for the average torso skin temperature and the P-values of the ANOVA are shown in Table 4.
                     

Average skin temperature when wearing BP1, BP2 or BP3 shows no significant difference. This results can be explained by considering that average skin temperature is based on the local temperatures of eight skin districts, five of which were not covered by the BPs (see Fig. 1). A different scenario was observed when torso skin temperature (TATSK) was investigated, with TATSK of BP1 about 2 °C lower than that of BP2 and BP3 (Fig. 9
                        ). As mentioned above, local temperature gradients make difficult to find the right combination of BP and jacket and will negatively affect the overall thermal comfort sensation, as confirmed by the subjective assessments presented later in the paragraph. Thus, the vest is a positive element in terms of thermal comfort and ergonomic comfort as well, as the strips of BP1 were judged uncomfortable by most subjects with respect to the vest.

During the acclimatization phase, TATSK decreased for BP1 while it grew slightly for BP2 and BP3, suggesting that overall thermal insulation was greater for BP3, than BP2 and BP1. By comparing the graphs of Figs. 8 and 9, it can be observed that the average skin temperature decreases in the first 10 min while locally torso skin temperature was even increasing for BP3. Thus, average skin temperature gives an idea of overall thermal loss from the whole body but it might fail to identify differences between items of clothing covering the body only partially. To complete the picture of local temperatures under the shells, microclimate temperature has been monitored and the results will be discussed in the next section.

Due to limited shell flexibility, an air gap was formed between the tee-shirt and the back protector in the low back area. The air gap layer is confirmed by the thermographs of Fig. 12, which shows the thermal print of the volunteer back after the back-protector is just taken off (last row): the areas where the back protector is in direct contact with the skin are warmer than the ones where the back protector is not touching the underlying tee-shirt. The effect of the extent of back-to-back protector contact is discussed in the thermograph section.

The temperature of that air buffer named microclimate (TMC) was monitored during the test and the trends are shown in Fig. 10
                        .

It is worth commenting that microclimate temperature shows a very different trend with respect to skin temperature. As microclimate stagnant air is a good insulator, microclimate temperature did not clearly show the wavy trend of skin temperature, which is promptly altered by vasodilatation and evaporative cooling. Due to the thermal insulation provided by the back protectors' shells, the microclimate temperature under the shell displayed a growing trend for all BPs, to decrease after the end of the physical activity, more steeply for BP2. This means that metabolic heat accumulated in the back area is dissipated slowly through the shell, resulting in an evident local microclimate temperature increase. Heat loss by conduction is poor because of the shell thickness and the insulating nature of the foams the shells are made. That is why heat dissipation is more likely based on evaporative cooling and pumping effect than conduction. As BP2 is more perforated than the other BPs, it is more prone to forced ventilation and vapour diffusion through the shell and this results in a less steep temperature increase and quicker temperature decrease after the end of the physical activity. This hypothesis is confirmed by the observation that temperature growth was steeper during the acclimatization phase (t0–t10) than during the physical activity (t10–t30). Due to lower metabolic heat production, one should expect a gentler temperature increase during the acclimatization phase than during the physical activity. However, during the acclimatization phase, sweating and body movements were negligible and this minimized the opportunities to remove heat by forced convection through the shell and by sweat evaporation from the skin. Thus, the design of number and position of holes in the structure is a key factor for thermal comfort: the more perforated the structure, the more breathable the BP, within the limit of not compromising the protective features of the shell. For all BPs, microclimate temperature increase was quick (from the initial values of approx. 31 °C to approx. 35 °C in less than 30 min) while the decrease after the end of the physical activity was slow despite the environmental temperature was as low as 12 °C and no jacket was worn over the back-protector itself. The slow decrease during the recovery phase was determined by the balance between heat generated and discarded: when physical activity stopped, metabolic heat production dropped but evaporative cooling was still effective because plenty of sweat produced during the physical activity was still to be evaporated. However, despite the holes in the structure, evaporative cooling could not be exploited to the maximum extent because forced ventilation was far less intense during the recovery since the subject was stationary on the treadmill. Thus, thermal comfort of such protectors is a true challenge and efforts should be dedicated to improve heat flow through these exceptional thermal insulators.

The considerations about microclimate temperature are confirmed by the microclimate humidity shown in Fig. 11
                        .

At the beginning, relative humidity decreased as a consequence of microclimate temperature increase. When sweat started to be produced, generally between 20 and 24 min, the microclimate relative humidity increased steeply and it stayed between 80 and 90% during the recovery phase. Only for BP2 a decrease in microclimate humidity was observed during the recovery, reaching a value of about 60% at the end of the test. This trend suggests that ventilation through BP2 was greater as a consequence of the high density of holes in the shell with respect to the other two BPs.

In Table 5
                         the P-values of the ANOVA analysis of the microclimate temperature and humidity are shown: while no significant differences are evident for microclimate temperature, some differences can be highlighted for microclimate humidity, especially at the end of the test.

In fact, at the end of the acclimatization phase no significant difference could be detected among BPs but, when the volunteers started sweating on the treadmill, the behaviour of BP2 became significantly different from the others, as shown in Fig. 11. In general, the importance of monitoring the microclimate air layer must be emphasized as microclimate is the environment in direct contact with the body: in particular, heat transfer and sweat evaporation from the body are regulated by the driving forces (TSK–TMC) and (Pa,SK–Pa,MC) respectively, where Pa is the water vapour partial pressure, calculated from the temperature and humidity of the skin and of the microclimate (Parsons, 2003). Thus, the greatest the microclimate temperature and humidity, the lowest are the driving forces for heat and mass transfer from the body to the surrounding environment. Besides the temperature and vapour pressures driving forces, heat and mass flow are dependent on the heat and mass exchange coefficients. These two coefficients are maximised in case of forced ventilation through the shell. These considerations again confirm that the best design for back protectors is based on the strategy of maximizing ventilation through the shell to exploit forced convection and evaporative cooling to the greatest extent.

The thermographs provided insight on the heat removal mechanism from the body. Thermographs of one volunteer's back during the tests are shown in Fig. 12
                        . In the last row, the thermograph of the inner side of the BP just taken off by the tester is shown. BP1 is characterized by clear partitions of high temperature and low temperature areas, due to the shell variable thickness and big rectangular-shape holes located along the thinner channels (see Fig. 1). Thus, heat is transferred through the shell by conduction (in the areas in contact with the body surface) and convection (through the holes). The thermograph of BP1 inner side reveals quite a uniform temperature, meaning that the back protector is completely adhering to the volunteer back.

In terms of shell design, BP2 is of uniform thickness with holes evenly distributed on the whole surface with the exception of a cross formed on the upper-back, two vertical bands along the spinal column and two side bands (see Fig. 1). Due to the high density of holes, a less clear distinction of hot and cold areas is visible in the thermographs. Nevertheless, the thermal images reveal that BP2 shell temperature was higher in the upper-back area than in the lower-back area during the whole test. This situation was attributed to the air gap formed on the low back: while BP1 has a small shell completely adhering to the back, BP2 and BP3 have an elongated shape covering the whole back. The thermograph of BP2 inner side shows a cold band in correspondence of the back concavity, which is a sign that BP2 was not adhering to the body in that area. BP3 is thicker than the others (see Table 1) and it is expected to be more thermally insulating. Indeed, the thermographs show a cold outer side and a hot inner side, confirming that BP3 has the highest conductive resistance. The inner side temperature is homogeneous to testify that BP3 shell structure was adhering to the back also in the area of back concavity. In fact, the shell profile is arched and the shell width is reduced in correspondence to the back concavity to increase flexibility.

To summarize, thermografies showed that holes in the structures are effective in conveying heat out from the shell: the areas without holes are colder on the exterior side with respect to the areas with holes, testifying delay in heat transfer. Small and close holes, like in case of BP2, produce a more uniform heat exchange from the shell with respect to large holes, like in case of BP1.

As far as the optimal distance between the shell and the body is concerned, a large distance does not help in heat exchange, as it is well depicted in case of BP2, where the bottom exterior area is colder than the upper part because of the large air gap formed in the low back region. Ventilation through the holes occurs in case of body movement even without a large air gap between the body and the shell while, on the contrary, the air gap acts as an insulating air pocket.

As mentioned above, low conductivity is a limiting factor of BP thermo-physiological comfort. Thus, besides the shape of the shell and the position of the holes, foams with the maximum shock absorption capabilities and the greatest thermal conductivity should be selected or developed to reduce shell thickness and increase heat flow by conduction.

The questionnaire was answered four times during the test and the scores of each question were averaged over the four questionnaires to have a single numerical value quantifying the BP appreciation during the whole test. This strategy also allowed to check consistency and reliability of the volunteers. The results are reported in the radar plot of Fig. 13
                        : the higher the score, the more positive the sensorial feedback of the subjects. BP2 seems the most appreciated and BP1 the less appreciated in terms of Overall Score (Q8).

Fukazawa and Havenith (Fukazawa and Havenith, 2009) found that moisture on skin was more correlated to thermal discomfort than skin temperature. It was proved that un-evaporated sweat remaining on the skin surface was the major factor causing discomfort (Galbraith et al., 1962). The design of BP2, that guarantees a drier microclimate, seems to be the winning strategy to achieve better thermal comfort. In terms of thermal sensations (Q3 and Q5c), BP3 obtained the highest grades while BP1 obtained low scores. BP1 might have been penalized by the lack of the vest, as during cold exposure of the whole body, local warming of the chest and abdomen produced the strongest comfort feeling (Nakamura et al., 2013). However, BP1 was appreciated for its lightness (Q5a) even though it was not the lightest (see Table 1) probably due to its structure without vest which permits free movements.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The aim of the work was to investigate how back protectors for skiing perform in terms of moisture and heat management. This objective was pursued through in-vivo trials during which several physiological parameters (sweat production, mean skin temperature, mean torso temperature and microclimate temperature and humidity) were recorded to have an overall view of the volunteer thermal stress. The information gathered from the physiological parameters were coupled with insight on heat dissipation phenomena obtained through infrared acquisitions and subjective sensations collected through a questionnaire. The outfit configuration did not include a ski jacket covering the torso of the volunteer so the results do not mimic the real outfit of a skier. On the one hand, this choice represented a limitation of the study but, on the other hand, it allowed to stress different performances of the three back protectors due to their different designs.

The analysis of the objective and subjective data highlighted that differences existed among back protectors. All physiological parameters were consistent and provided a general picture of the heat and mass transfer phenomena through the shell, with the following major findings:
                        
                           -
                           Thermal conductivity of all shells is poor and, to improve thermal comfort, evaporative cooling and forced ventilation must be exploited to the maximum extent. Close and tiny holes in the BP shell structure allows the greatest heat dissipation This observation was confirmed by thermography and microclimate measurements.

The overall and torso skin temperatures depends mainly on the vest, whose presence is appreciated by the wearers because of an embracing ergonomic fit and a more uniform thermal feeling.

Moisture management was found to be the main factor determining back-protector appreciation. A according to the questionnaire, the top-ranking back protector was the one giving the best sensations in terms of breathability and humidity, while temperature sensation seemed to play a secondary role in thermal comfort feeling.
