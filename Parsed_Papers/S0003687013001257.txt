                  Ten men (non-firefighters) completed a 110 min walking/recovery protocol (three 20-min exercise bouts, with recovery periods of 10, 20, and 20 min following successive bouts) in a thermoneutral laboratory while wearing firefighting personal protective equipment over one of four base layers: cotton, modacrylic, wool, and phase change material. There were no significant differences in changes in heart rate, core temperature, rating of perceived exertion, thermal discomfort, and thermal strain among base layers. Sticking to skin, coolness/hotness, and clothing humidity sensation were more favorable (p < 0.05) for wool compared with cotton; no significant differences were identified for the other 7 clothing sensations assessed. Separate materials performance testing of the individual base layers and firefighting ensembles (base layer + turnout gear) indicated differences in thermal protective performance and total heat loss among the base layers and among ensembles; however, differences in heat dissipation did not correspond with physiological responses during exercise or recovery.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by firefighters is designed to protect against thermal injuries, products of combustion, scrapes and abrasions and falling objects. The personal protective clothing (PPC), or turnout (TO) gear, is specifically designed to protect against thermal injury and includes a thermal layer and a moisture barrier layer to prevent hot water passing through the material to the firefighter. The turnout gear that firefighters wear is typically manufactured to meet specific industry standards (NFPA, 2006) for thermal protection and evaporative heat transfer. Paradoxically, the equipment designed to afford protection also contributes to the physiological and perceptual strain experienced by the firefighter. The increased physiological strain associated with working in PPE is well documented (Cheung et al., 2010; Duncan et al., 1979; Nunneley, 1989; Sköldström, 1987; Smith and Petruzzello, 1998; Smith et al., 1995), with both the added mass of the gear, and the gear's insulating and encapsulating properties, and the positioning of the added mass contributing to the strain (Haisman, 1988).

Current standards for thermal protection and moisture transfer of firefighting clothing only apply to the turnout gear worn by the firefighters. However, the entire clothing ensemble, including the base layer or undergarment, would be expected to influence both thermal protection afforded and the transfer of moisture through the garment. Furthermore, some newly developed technical textiles are designed to wick moisture away from the skin and enhance evaporative cooling, whereas others may attenuate increases in temperature through the absorption of heat using phase change materials (Mondal, 2008). In addition to physiological and perceptual benefits, it is possible that different base layer textiles may be sensed as being more comfortable than standard fabrics.

The performance of different base layers under protective gear has been examined by several researchers. Wickwire et al. (2007) determined that a snug-fitting synthetic shirt with moisture-wicking properties worn under a bulletproof vest did not enhance cooling compared with a 100% cotton shirt. Similarly, van den Heuvel et al. (2010) observed no differences in measures of physiological or perceived strain among five different base layer configurations when worn under a standard combat uniform and body armor. Under a combat uniform alone, Fogarty et al. (2009) detected no differences in core temperature (T
                     co), skin temperature (T
                     sk), heart rate (HR) or psychophysical variables between a 100% cotton t-shirt and polyester shirt.

Previous studies (Fogarty et al., 2009; van den Heuvel et al., 2010) that investigated the effect of a base layer worn under PPE have relied on continuous workloads where the participants wore the ensembles throughout the protocol. We are unaware of any data on the effect of different base layers on physiological and perceptual measures when the wearer is able to doff the protective clothing during planned recovery cycles. This is particularly relevant for firefighting because firefighters are encouraged or mandated to take breaks that include doffing their PPC during “rehabilitation” with the goal of reducing heat strain and hastening physiological recovery. If base layers could facilitate cardiovascular, thermal or perceptual recovery during planned cooling periods, the cumulative strain experienced by a firefighter over a specific time period could be lessened or the firefighter might be able to extend their time to fatigue.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of different base layers worn under firefighting PPE on physiological and perceptual strain during an alternating work/recovery exercise protocol, to describe individual sensations to different base layers, and to assess the materials performance of the base layers individually and with turnout gear.

@&#METHODS@&#

Ten healthy, physically active men from the college community were recruited for this study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Skidmore College and all participants provided written informed consent prior to testing. Additionally, each participant underwent a medical evaluation and received clearance to participate.

Clothing ensembles were comprised of full firefighting PPE and one of four base layers: cotton (COT), modacrylic (MOD), wool blend (WOOL) or phase change material (PCM). The PCM consisted of a proprietary blend of modacrylic, rayon, p-aramid and spandex. Material characteristics of the base layers are presented in Table 1
                        . All base layer shirts were loose fitting, athletic style t-shirts that had been washed and dried three times on normal cycles prior to wear. Participants and testers were blinded to the fabric in the shirts. Firefighting PPE included flash hood, gloves, boots, helmet, turnout pants and coat (G-Xtreme; Globe Manufacturing Co, LLC, Pittsfield, NH), and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) (Fig. 1
                        ). The fabric weight of the turnout coat was 697 g m−2 and the thickness was 2.1 mm. Average mass of the PPE, including SCBA, was 19.2 kg. Nomex station pants (Topps Safety Apparel, Rochester, NY) were worn in all trials over boxers made of the same material as the t-shirt worn that day.

In order to test the physiological and perceptual responses to intermittent exercise, the study employed a repeated measures design. Participants completed four experimental trials consisting of a 110-min alternating work/recovery protocol on a treadmill while wearing a different clothing ensemble. In each trial, participants wore full firefighting PPE (see Section 2.2) over a different base layer giving the following ensembles: COT + TO, MOD + TO, WOOL + TO, PCM + TO. Ensembles were presented in random order. All exercise testing was conducted in a thermoneutral laboratory (21.1 °C; 58.6% relative humidity [RH]).

Participants underwent 6 days of progressive acclimation in firefighting PPE prior to the start of the experimental protocol. The 110-min alternating work/recovery protocol consisted of three 20-min bouts of exercise, with bouts followed by successive seated recovery periods of 10, 20 and 20 min. Participants walked at a 5% grade on a treadmill and the speed was varied to maintain a constant relative intensity of 70–75% maximal HR on each of the 6 days. The treadmill speed achieved at the end of the acclimation period was used to establish the workload for the participant during the subsequent experimental protocol. During recovery periods, some (Recovery 1) or all (Recovery 2 and 3) PPE was doffed and fluid ingestion was standardized.

For the experimental trials, all participants consumed a standardized meal (EAS Myoplex drink, EAS, Columbus, Ohio) 1 h prior to testing and testing was performed at the same time of day. All participants were tested in a euhydrated state (urine specific gravity < 1.020; Schueco Clinical Refractometer 5711-2020, Tokyo, Japan). Trials were separated by at least 24 h and completed within a 1-week period. In preparation for the T
                        co measurement, participants ingested a telemetric pill (VitalSense ingestible capsule, Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) 7 h prior to testing.

The 110-min protocol was identical to the protocol followed during the acclimation period with the exception of using a constant workload for all trials. Treadmill grade was held constant at 5% and the walking speed was the speed determined on Day 6 of the acclimation period. Thus, all participants walked at the same relative workload (∼70–75% maximal HR). Average treadmill speed for the trials was 4.8 ± 0.2 km h−1. During the first recovery period, participants removed the SCBA, turnout coat, helmet, flash hood and gloves. During the second and third recovery periods, the entire PPE ensemble was removed. During each recovery period, a fan (1500 CFM; Air King, West Chester, PA) was placed 3 m distant and directed at the participant. Fluid ingestion was standardized during the recovery periods, with 500 mL of water consumed during the first two recovery periods and 591 mL of Gatorade consumed during the last recovery period.

Descriptive characteristics were obtained before the acclimation period. Stature was determined using a stadiometer (Seca, Hanover, MD) and body mass was measured using a standard physician's scale (Befour, Inc., Saukville, WI). A total body scan using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Lunar, enCore 2010, Madison, WI) was used to assess body composition.

                            was determined using indirect calorimetry (TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement system, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah) as the participant completed a graded exercise test (Bruce protocol) to volitional fatigue on a treadmill.

Heart rate was monitored continuously using a Polar watch (Polar FS1, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) and recorded at 2-min intervals. Likewise, core temperature (T
                           co) was monitored (VitalSense, Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) and recorded every 2 min. Every 5 min participants rated thermal sensations (TS), thermal discomfort (TD), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) by pointing to a number on a standard visual scale.

Clothing and sweating sensations (Wickwire et al., 2007) were rated immediately following the last exercise bout and recovery period using printed scales. Ratings from 1 to 5 were used for overall comfort, sticking to skin, wetness, coolness/hotness, chaffing and prickliness. Ratings from 1 to 10 were used to classify sweating sensation, skin wettedness, clothing humidity sensation and clothing comfort sensation. For all questions, responses were on a continuum with the highest number indicating the least favorable response.

The participant's nude body mass and the mass of the clothing and gear were measured before and immediately following each experimental trial. Following removal, the base layers were sealed in a plastic bag to avoid evaporative losses prior to weighing. Base layer masses were measured to the nearest gram. Sweat loss was calculated by subtracting body mass at the end of the trial, which was adjusted for fluid intake during the trial, from body mass at the beginning of the trail. Neither insensible loss due to respiration nor the amount of sweat absorbed by drying towels was taken into account; therefore, sweat evaporated is not reported.

In addition to the physiological experiments, we also characterized the materials performance properties of the individual base layers and of the clothing ensembles used in the experimental trials. Thermal Protective Performance, which reflects the tolerance time of human skin to second degree burn, was measured for non-conditioned (i.e., no wash/dry cycles or temperature controlled exposure) samples according to NFPA (2006) standards. Samples tested included the base layers (COT, MOD, WOOL, and PCM), TO gear, and the multi-layer ensembles, which consisted of a base layer and TO gear (COT + TO, MOD + TO, WOOL + TO, PCM + TO). Prior to mounting on a sample holder, mass and thickness of a 152 × 152 mm sample were obtained. For a multi-layer ensemble, materials were placed in the holder in the sequence necessary to simulate exposure to the heat source when worn.

The TPP test employs a testing apparatus that supplies a convective heat source from the flames of two gas burners that converge beneath the sample and a radiant heat source from a series of quartz tubes. A copper sensor instrumented with thermocouples placed on the opposite side of the sample as the heat sources is used to measure heat flux through the sample. Prior to testing, the apparatus and copper sensor were calibrated to confirm an exposure of 2.0 cal (cm2 s)−1 from the convective and radiant heat sources. The sample was exposed to the heat sources and the rate of heat transfer through the sample was recorded. The rate of heat transfer was compared with the Stoll curve (Stoll and Chianta, 1969), which illustrates the blister threshold of human skin as a function of heat and time, and the TPP rating was determined. The time (s) to second degree burn is obtained by halving the TPP rating. Three tests were run for each sample and additional tests were run if results differed by more than the specified criterion.

The THL test measures the thermal and evaporative resistance of the clothing and combines these measures to yield a single number, the THL, to indicate the capability of the sample to dissipate heat. Testing adhered to NFPA (2006) guidelines. Ensembles tested matched those of the TPP tests. Sample sizes were 508 × 508 mm.

Testing apparatus consisted of a sweating hot plate that included a test plate, guard section, and bottom plate. The guard section and bottom plate prevent heat loss in downward and lateral directions, respectively. Prior to testing of the sample, environmental conditions including air temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity were adjusted to meet specified criteria, and the testing apparatus was calibrated. The sample was positioned on the dry test plate, with positioning of multi-layer samples on the plate matching the sequence encountered when worn on the human body. The average intrinsic thermal resistance of the sample (R
                              cf) was measured and recorded for three different samples of the same ensemble. The coefficient of variation was determined and if it was greater than 10%, additional tests were run. Similar procedures were followed for the measurement of average apparent intrinsic evaporative resistance

To examine potential differences in the physiological (HR, T
                        co) and perceptual (RPE, TS, TD) outcomes among the ensembles, general linear models were used to conduct separate repeated measures analysis of variance for each exercise and recovery period. For each model, ensemble, time, and the interaction of ensemble × time were treated as within-subjects effects and compared the beginning and end of each period. To examine potential differences in the clothing/sweating sensations immediately following the last exercise bout and recovery session, MOD + TO, WOOL + TO, and PCM + TO were compared with COT + TO using paired sample t-tests. For TPP and THL comparisons, one-way ANOVA (clothing configuration) were used to detect differences among the individual base layers and among the ensembles. When a significant F-ratio was obtained, a post-hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was used to identify differences. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures were used to examine body and clothing mass changes between the beginning and end of the protocol among conditions; post-hoc analysis employed a Bonferroni correction. Values are mean ± standard deviation unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

As shown in Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        , HR and T
                        co were remarkably similar both in terms of response at each time point and change over each exercise and recovery periods (p > 0.05). Furthermore, TS, TD, and RPE among the ensembles did not differ (p > 0.05; Figs. 4–6
                        
                        
                        ).

Clothing sensation measures for each combined ensemble (base layer + turnout gear) are presented in Table 2
                        . Compared with COT + TO, WOOL + TO had lower ratings for sticking to skin, coolness/hotness, and humidity sensation immediately after Exercise 3. Following Recovery 3, WOOL + TO continued to be perceived as sticking less to the skin than COT + TO. As evident from Table 2, differences among the ratings on all sensation measures were not large, even where statistically significant differences were noted.

The ensemble worn had no effect on sweat loss (F = 1.4, p = 0.264); however, sweat absorbed by the base layer differed among ensembles (F = 22.9, p < 0.001). Moisture gain for COT (209 ± 59 g) and PCM (191 ± 48 g) differed from both MOD (150 ± 41 g) and WOOL (153 ± 39 g) but not from each other (Table 3
                        ).

                         illustrate the differences in TPP and THL, respectively, among the individual base layers as well as among the ensembles including base layers and turnout gear. The TPP rating of COT (14.3 ± 0.4 cal cm−2) was significantly greater than that of the other individual base layers (p < 0.001). Additionally, WOOL had a higher TPP rating than MOD (8.3 ± 0.7 vs. 6.6 ± 0.5 cal cm−2; p < .05). In comparisons among ensembles, a greater TPP for COT + TO compared with MOD + TO was detected (p < 0.05).

Among the base layers, THL was 409.7 ± 1.2, 420.7 ± 3.4, 767.0 ± 6.4, and 895.1 ± 62.6 W m−2 for MOD, WOOL, COT and PCM, respectively. Total heat loss for PCM was higher than each of the other base layers (p < 0.05), and THL for COT was higher than the WOOL and MOD base layers (p < 0.05). For the ensembles, the THL of MOD + TO (216.5 ± 4.1 W m−2) was lower than COT + TO (234.7 ± 7.0 W m−2; p < 0.05) and WOOL + TO (250.8 ± 6.3 W m−2; p < 0.05). Additionally, the THL of PCM + TO (230.5 ± 6.3 W m−2) was less than WOOL + TO (p < 0.05).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The main finding of the present study is that the base layer worn under firefighter PPE has no significant effect on physiological or perceptual responses during work and recovery periods of an alternating work/recovery protocol despite differences in THL revealed in material performance tests. However, several clothing sensations were perceived as more favorable when wearing WOOL compared with COT. Additionally, the base layer had only a small effect on the thermal protection afforded by the ensembles, as the only difference observed was a greater TPP for COT + TO than MOD + TO.

Thermoregulatory equilibrium depends on a balance between heat production from metabolism and heat gain from the environment and heat loss through convection, conduction, radiation and evaporation. Wearing PPE disrupts thermoregulatory balance by causing an increase in heat production as well as a reduction in evaporative efficiency (Gavin et al., 2001; Havenith, 1999). Removal of the PPE, as during a recovery period, removes a barrier to heat transfer and enhances evaporative cooling. Exposure of a technical base layer, designed to enhance evaporative efficiency or regulate temperature, could allow the properties of the base layer to be realized rather than overwhelmed by the protective gear, thereby leading to attenuated physiological strain and greater comfort.

As expected, the base layer had no effect on physiological or perceptual responses during exercise. This finding is consistent with previous studies in which participants wore different base layers under military PPE while performing moderate-intensity exercise in hot-humid conditions (∼34 °C; 62% RH) (Fogarty et al., 2009) or hot-dry conditions (∼41 °C; 30% RH) (van den Heuvel et al., 2010). In the studies of Fogarty et al. (2009) and van den Heuvel et al. (2010), the military PPE was not removed during the trial. In contrast, during the recovery periods of the present study, participants removed most (Recovery 1) or all (Recovery 2 and 3) PPE. Removal of the firefighting gear during recovery was meant to mimic practices routinely employed by firefighters during incident rehabilitation periods of emergency operations. Firefighters typically work for approximately 20 min, which corresponds to the use of one cylinder of air. Furthermore, the duration of the recovery sessions was designed to reflect recovery times experienced during emergency operations, where the first recovery is relatively short and subsequent recovery periods are recommended to be 20 min. Thus, we used a shorter duration of recovery after the first exercise session as this was intended to reflect a period when firefighters changed their air cylinder but did not report for rehabilitation. Although the base layers were exposed to the ambient conditions during the recovery periods, the outcome measures did not differ among the conditions. Body mass losses reflected no difference in sweat loss among the conditions, but the amounts of sweat absorbed by COT and PCM were greater than for MOD and WOOL.

The findings from the present study are similar to those of Gavin et al. (2001), who compared participants' responses while wearing three different clothing configurations: semi-nude (lycra racing swimsuit), a cotton t-shirt and cycling shorts, and a synthetic t-shirt designed to promote sweat evaporation and cycling shorts. The protocol included 30 min of running at 70%

                     sk, mean body temperature or HR were found among configurations. Additionally, no difference in sweat loss was observed; however, the cotton shirt retained more sweat than the synthetic shirt.

Other research suggests that clothing fabric influences thermoregulation. Kwon et al. (1998) examined physiological parameters and subjective ratings during an intermittent exercise/rest protocol when clothing ensembles with different regain properties were worn. Participants completed six sessions of cycling for 15 min, with the first five sessions followed by 5 min of rest and the last by 20 min of rest. A wind of 1.5 m s−1 was applied commencing with the fourth cycling session. Differences in HR, T
                     co, T
                     sk, and clothing microclimate changes were observed, primarily during the latter session of the intermittent work/rest protocol during exposure to a slight wind. As the work and rest cycles were not analyzed separately, it is difficult to determine whether the differences observed during the exercise sessions were simply maintained during recovery periods or whether differences were augmented during recovery. The polyester ensemble caused greater sweating than the wool/cotton and cotton ensembles, but retained less sweat. Differences in regain existed among all ensembles. In contrast to our study, but as expected based on textile properties, Kwon et al. observed the greatest moisture regain for the wool/cotton ensemble.

More recently, Brazaitis et al. (2010) found that compared with a cotton long-sleeve t-shirt, a polyester fabric designed to promote evaporation did not alter thermo-physiological responses during intermittent, high-intensity exercise but it did influence some responses during recovery. Eight young, active men completed three 20-min bouts of treadmill running at 8 km h−1 and 1% grade separated by two 5-min rest periods and followed by 60 min of seated rest. Mean T
                     sk based on an 8-site weighted average and TS were both lower in cotton than polyester following 60 min of recovery. Body mass changes (i.e., sweat loss) did not differ between ensembles. Sweat absorbed was greater in cotton than polyester, whereas sweat evaporated during recovery was greater for polyester than cotton. Differences in sweat evaporation were noted during the first 30 min of recovery, and although sweat loss was greatest in the second 30 min of recovery, there was no difference between shirts for this time period.

In the present study, participants indicated that the WOOL + TO ensemble stuck less to the skin, was cooler and had a lower humidity sensation than the COT + TO ensemble immediately following Exercise 3. Following Recovery 3, WOOL continued to be perceived as less sticky than COT. Although COT absorbed more sweat than WOOL, no difference for the sensation of wetness was reported nor was there a difference in overall comfort. Moisture gain was greater for COT than MOD, yet this outcome did not lead to significant differences in clothing sensations between the two conditions. Sweating sensation between COT and MOD approached significance (p = 0.055); however, it is likely that the variability in the responses contributed to non-significant differences. Previous studies present mixed findings for clothing sensations and associations with sweat loss. Using the same test battery of clothing sensations, Wickwire et al. (2007) reported lower values of skin wettedness and sweating sensation for participants wearing a synthetic t-shirt designed to wick sweat away from the skin compared with a cotton t-shirt under a bulletproof vest during moderate-intensity exercise in hot conditions. The researchers did not report sweat losses.


                     Gavin et al. (2001) reported no differences in sweating sensation, which corresponded to the similar sweat losses among clothing configurations. In contrast, Kwon et al. (1998) found no difference in clothing sensation, sweating sensation, and skin wettedness, yet sweat and absorption amounts differed among ensembles. It has also been shown that perception of clothing wettedness did not differ despite differences in regain, yet between 30 and 60 min post-exercise sweating sensation differed but sweat loss did not (Brazaitis et al., 2010). Thus it appears that clothing and skin wettedness sensations do not always reflect actual sweat losses or sweat absorption.

The results of the material performance tests suggest that differences in THL could lead to differences in physiological and perceptual responses among the ensembles during exercise and recovery; however, this was not the case. Total heat loss was lowest for MOD + TO, which differed from both COT + TO and WOOL + TO. If the MOD + TO allowed for less heat loss, heat storage would be expected to be greater while wearing MOD + TO than COT + TO and WOOL + TO, thereby leading to differences in T
                     co and HR as well as perceptual responses. The lack of differences among ensembles during the exercise portion of the protocol may be explained by the high thermal load associated with work in PPE (van den Heuvel et al., 2010). Additionally, differentiation in markers of heat stress may be limited by the masking effects of the air layers in the TO gear.

Among the individual base layers, THL ranged from 409.7 W m−2 for MOD to 895.1 W m−2 for PCM. One could anticipate that the disparity among heat dissipating abilities of the base layers would manifest as differences in thermoregulatory and perceptual responses among the base layers when they were exposed during recovery periods in the protocol. Despite indications from the materials testing that MOD and WOOL are able to dissipate 46% and 47% less heat than PCM, thermoregulatory responses did not differ among the base layers during recovery periods in the experimental protocol. These apparently conflicting findings may not be surprising, given that it has been reported that THL values obtained in material performance tests do not necessarily represent performance in the field as clothing fit, movement and environmental conditions affect insulation and water vapor permeability (Havenith, 1999; Holmér, 1995; Lotens, 1989).

Wool and cotton have similar properties in terms of regain and moisture wicking, yet the THL value for WOOL was significantly lower than for COT. Additionally THL values for WOOL and MOD were similar. Wool's characterization as a good insulator stems from its resilience, whereby its fibers maintain their original volume of trapped air even when wet (Gonzalez, 1988). Modacrylic is also resilient, and this attribute may account for the equivalent THL values of the fabrics as well as their lower values than PCM and COT. The trapped air could result in greater intrinsic thermal and evaporative resistance, which would cause THL to be lower.

Interestingly, the differences in THL among the base layers do not correspond to the differences in THL among the ensembles. Fewer differences existed among the combined ensembles and when THL values are ordered from high to low, the base layers are not in the same sequence for the individual layers and the ensembles of base layer and turnout gear. A marked difference exists for PCM, whose highest THL was 213% greater than WOOL but when combined with TO was 92% that of WOOL + TO.

Typically THL and TPP are inversely related, which poses a dilemma when trying to optimize performance of firefighting PPE. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the inverse relationship was not evident, most notably for COT, among the base layers. The TPP of COT was greater than for the other base layers. Nevertheless, the high TPP rating for COT is consistent with expectations, as TPP typically increases with fabric thickness. Among the full ensembles, the only difference detected was a higher TPP for COT + TO compared with MOD + TO.

It may be advantageous to characterize the material performance of all layers of clothing worn by the firefighter rather than to just consider the turnout gear. In addition, measures for the base layer alone provide useful information as TO gear is typically doffed during rehabilitation periods. While we recognize that differences in TPP and THL are more dependent on fabric thickness and weight than fiber composition for single-layer materials, the inclusion of materials performance tests within this study provides evidence for considering all clothing worn by the firefighter as part of the protective ensemble.

In this study participants performed exercise at a moderate intensity in firefighter PPE in a thermoneutral laboratory. Firefighters wear their PPE during numerous situations such as motor vehicle accidents, search and rescue, and overhaul that do not involve the extreme temperatures encountered during fire suppression. Furthermore, studies that measured physiological responses during simulated firefighting exercises in temperate (15–20 °C) (Carter et al., 2007; Romet and Frim, 1987) or hot (live-fire, >45 °C) (Rossi, 2003; Smith et al., 2001, 2011) environments reported increases in core temperature that were similar to those reported in this study (∼0.7 °C). Thus, although the environmental conditions employed did not replicate those encountered during fire suppression, we believe the heat strain experienced by our participants was similar to what has been reported with simulated firefighting activities. The increase in variability in T
                     co following Exercise 1 could be a consequence of using a telemetric pill to provide the measurement. The telemetric pill has been shown to provide a valid measure of T
                     co during exercise-induced heat stress (Easton et al., 2007; O'Brien et al., 1998); however, accuracy may be transiently influenced by fluid ingestion (Wilkinson et al., 2008).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In summary, this study provides evidence that the base layer had no impact on physiological or perceptual responses during exercise and recovery periods of an alternating work/recovery protocol of moderate intensity. However, some clothing sensations (sticking to skin, coolness/hotness, and humidity sensation) were found to be slightly more favorable when wearing WOOL than COT. Additionally, materials performance tests indicate differences in TPP and THL among the base layers; however, the differences in THL did not impact physiological responses when the clothing was worn in an alternating work/recovery protocol in which firefighting PPE was worn over the base layer during exercise. The added TPP provided by the addition of a base layer provides support for the concept of considering the base layer and the clothing worn over it as part of a total firefighting ensemble that provides protection to the wearer. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that there is no clear-cut advantage to any one base layer over the others investigated in this project.
