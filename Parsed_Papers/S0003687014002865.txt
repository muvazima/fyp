                  This paper reports on novel ventilation design in sports T-shirt, which combines spacer and mesh structure, and experimental evidence on the advantages of design in improving thermal comfort. Evaporative resistance (R
                     e) and thermal insulation (R
                     c) of T-shirts were measured using a sweating thermal manikin under three different air velocities. Moisture permeability index (i
                     m) was calculated to compare the different designed T-shirts. The T-shirts of new and conventional designs were also compared by wearer trials, which were comprised of 30 min treadmill running followed by 10 min rest. Skin temperature, skin relative humidity, heart rate, oxygen inhalation and energy expenditure were monitored, and subjective sensations were asked. Results demonstrated that novel T-shirt has 11.1% significant lower i
                     m than control sample under windy condition. The novel T-shirt contributes to reduce the variation of skin temperature and relative humidity up to 37% and 32%, as well as decrease 3.3% energy consumption during exercise.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Different from daily wear, sportswear tends to accumulate more sweat during exercise, which leads to heat stress and affects sport performance of athletes. Hence, thermal comfort is an important consideration when designing active sportswear.

It has been recognized that efficient dry and evaporative heat transfer through clothing is critical to thermal comfort during exercises (McCullough et al., 1983; Fan, 1989). Past research revealed that air exchange between clothing microclimate and external environment has a significant effect on the wearer's evaporative and dry heat loss (Bouskill et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2012; Havenith et al., 1990). For a sweating man, the convection current accelerates the rate of convective heat transfer and the rate of evaporative cooling by wind or by pumping during body motion (Breckenridge, 1977; Oliveira et al., 2011). Therefore, in order to maintain thermal comfort of the body, it is important to improve ventilation cooling by use of ventilation features at appropriate positions of garments (Ruckman et al., 1999; Havenith et al., 2003).

Mesh opening, as a method to increase ventilation, has been widely applied in garments in order to maintain wearer comfort. Previous research showed that mesh opening design increases the total heat loss considerably during body movement (Bakkevig and Nielsen, 1995; Ho et al., 2008). However, the fabric still tends to stick to the skin (particularly in the chest, shoulder and upper back area of the body) after heavy sweating, which creates “clingy” discomfort and hinders the convection around the body. Ho and Fan (2011) developed a ventilation garment with mesh opening and additional arch-shaped spacer parts to address this problem. However, the additional spacers tend to create tactile discomfort for its undesirable big size and heavy weight, especially during exercises. Hence, it is desirable to develop a novel sportswear with ventilation features without affecting tactile comfort.

In this study, a knitted fabric that combining spacer and mesh opening was fabricated and used at the chest and back area of the ventilation sports T-shirt to prop the garment up, thus improving air flow by reducing the contacting area between the fabric and human skin. We hypothesized that the novel sports T-shirt contributes to sweat evaporation and thermoregulation. Both manikin tests and wearer trials were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the garment in terms of thermal comfort, as well as the sweat accumulation, which is related to the potential of post-exercise chill.

Three different kinds of fabrics were knitted by circular knitting machine using polyester and nylon core-spun yarn (Fabric composition is 20% nylon and 80% polyester). The appearance of the fabrics is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The fabrics were tested in accordance with ASTM: D1776 by the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES). Some of the physical characteristics of the three fabrics are listed in Table 1
                        . Fabric 1 is a regular single jersey fabric. Fabric 2 is a single jersey based fabric with spacer structure. Fabric 3 is a fabric combining of mesh opening and spacer structure. The spacer structure was knitted by successive float on a single needle. While mesh opening was achieved by float plating technique with elastic yarns. The spacer structure lifts up the fabric to reduce the contact area and creates a gap between the fabric and skin surface, while mesh offers some ventilation holes which allow the exchange of warm air in the clothing microclimate and cool air in the environment.

The material used for the three garment samples (Fig. 1) is same, their size and weight (104 ± 2 g) are also similar, except for different fabric structures. Sample A is made of a single jersey fabric (Fabric 1), which was used as a control sample. Sample B is a combination of Fabric 1 and Fabric 2, where Fabric 2 was designed at upper trunk area of the garment. Sample C is the novel T-shirt which is made of Fabric 1 and Fabric 3, where Fabric 3 was located at the chest, shoulders and upper back area.

A sweating thermal manikin-Walter (Fan and Chen, 2003; Fan and Qian, 2004) was used to measure the thermal property of different T-shirt samples (Fig. 2
                        ).

Samples A, B and C were all used in sweating thermal manikin test. Before testing, all samples were laundered and air dried to eliminate any finishing chemicals in the fabric. In order to maintain consistency during testing, the same pair of gym shorts, made by 100% polyester knitted fabric, was used for all experiments.

The tests were carried out in a climatic chamber controlled at a temperature of 20 ± 0.5 °C and a relative humidity of 65  ±  2%, aiming to simulate the indoor thermal environment of a gymnasium. They were conducted at three air velocities of 0.2 ± 0.1 m/s, 1.0 ± 0.1 m/s, and 2.0 ± 0.1 m/s, respectively. Since the effect of body movement on clothing thermal properties bears resemblance to the effect of wind on clothing thermal properties, as both increase convective air exchange, from the effect of air velocity, we can also understand the effect of exercise level on clothing thermal properties (Qian and Fan, 2006). The mean skin temperature of the manikin was set at 35 °C; all samples were conditioned in the chamber for 24 h before testing. All tests were repeated for three times, the samples were put off and on again between repetitions.

The thermal insulation of the garment samples was calculated by using the following formula:

Seven healthy male college students volunteered to take part in this study. Their physical characteristics were as follows: age of 22 ± 3, weight of 76 ± 8 kg and height of 1.74 ± 0.03 m. Before recruited, all subjects were informed of the purpose of the study, the procedure of the experiments, their rights, the potential risks and benefits as well as the privacy and confidentiality clauses by a face-to-face dialogue and a written information sheet. And then the subjects gave their individual consent to participate this research on an informed consent form.

The novel T-shirt (Sample C) and control sample (Sample A) were selected as testing samples to investigate the effect of spacer and mesh structure on wearer comfort by recording the physiological changes and human subjective sensations during exercises. The same pairs of gym shorts, socks and shoes were used for all wearer trials. All garments were conditioned in the climatic chamber for 24 h prior to the wearer trial.

A couple of temperature (RS, Platinum Sensing Resistor-Pt100, UK) and humidity (Honeywell, HIH-4000, US) sensors were attached on the chest, shoulder and upper back area of the volunteers to record the thermo-physiological changes every 10 s during the whole test period. The sensors were connected to the Compact Field Point System (National Instrument), which automatically received the data and recorded it on a computer by the data acquisition interface (LabVIEW, v.8.5, National Instrument, US). A chest belt and a mask with volume sensor were worn to monitor the heart rate and respiratory parameters during the period of running using cardiopulmonary diagnostic system (Meta control 3000, Germany). Both direct and indirect test data regarding heart rate (HR, bpm), oxygen inhalation (VO2, ml/min), and energy expenditure (EE/kg, kcal/d/kg) were saved to the computer by CORTEX MetaSoft®.

During the experiments, the subjects were asked to report their thermal sensation, moisture sensation and clingy sensation in different experimental phases, and both local body sensation and overall sensation were recorded. Overall comfort, as an important assessment index, was also included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire is shown in Fig. 3
                           .

The wearer trials were carried out in a climatic chamber at 20 ± 0.5 °C and 65.0 ± 5% RH. The testing conditions were designed to mimic the real situation of heavy exercise, where the air flow passes through the garment, the sweat and post exercise chill occurred. The test was divided into two periods, including 30 min run and 10 min rest. During the running period, the subjects ran on a treadmill (Fig. 4
                           ) with a speed of 6.0 km/h and an air velocity of 0.8 ± 0.1 m s−1 to simulate the body movement during exercise. During the rest period, the subjects sat in the chamber with an air velocity of 0.1 ± 0.1 m s−1 to simulate the static condition.

Before experiment, the subjects were pre-conditioned by sitting in the climatic chamber for 30 min. Then randomly selected garments were worn by the subjects, and the recording instruments were attached. During the experiment, core temperature was measured by a digital ear infra-red thermometer before running and on 30th min, 35th min and 40th min, respectively. All subjects were asked to evaluate the subjective perceptions during the course of the experiment (before running and on 10th min, 20th min, 30th min, 35th min and 40th min, respectively).

Since individual physiological characteristics vary every day, it will affect the temperature and perspiration levels. The change of skin temperature and humidity during the experiment was recorded and used to investigate the effect of ventilation design. The recorded skin temperature and humidity were used to calculate the change of temperature and humidity in percentage by using the formula below:

All the statistical data analyses were carried out with SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, v.19.0, IBM, US). One-Way ANOVA analysis was carried out to compare the different clothing thermal insulation, evaporative resistance and moisture permeability index on different air velocities. Repeated-measures ANOVA were employed to examine the differences in physiology parameters when dressing two samples. Paired t-test was also used when investigating the results of questionnaire. All the statistical analyses were performed at a level of 95% statistical significance.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The thermal insulation (R
                        c), evaporative resistance (R
                        e) and moisture permeability index (i
                        m) of the three samples under different air velocities are shown in Table 2
                        . Sample C had the lowest R
                        c value among the three samples under the air velocity of 0.2 m/s and 1 m/s, however, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). On the other hand, there were statistically significant differences (F
                        2,12 = 6.3, p = 0.013) of R
                        c value under the wind velocity of 2 m/s between the three samples. At this speed, the R
                        c values of Sample C appear to be higher (p = 0.004) than that of Sample A, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.108) between Samples C and B. The fabrics for T-shirt were thin and light; therefore, R
                        c value of the samples was very small especially under higher wind speed. Hence, there was no significant decrease of R
                        c value, even if the wind speed continuously increased. However, with the increase of wind speed, the single jersey fabric tended to cling to skin surface, the contact area was increased and led to the increase of heat conduction. Furthermore, Fabric 3 was a little bit thicker than fabric 2. It explains that the thermal insulation of Sample A was significantly lower than that of Sample C, but not significantly lower than that of Sample B under the air velocity of 2.0 m/s.

On the air velocity of 0.2 m/s, there were no significant differences (F
                        2,9 = 2.6, p = 0.129) for the R
                        e values among the three samples, although Sample C had a lowest R
                        e value. However, under the wind velocity of 1 m/s, the differences of R
                        e value of the three samples were statistically significant (F
                        2,12 = 4.3, p = 0.039). The results of post hoc t-tests revealed that Sample C had significant lower R
                        e values compared to Sample A (p = 0.02) and Sample B (p = 0.036). Under the wind velocity of 2 m/s, there were no significant (F
                        2,12 = 3.2, p = 0.076) differences for R
                        e value among the three samples, however, the results of the post hoc t-tests showed that the R
                        e value of Sample C was also significant lower (p = 0.029) than that of Sample A. It means that the spacer structure slightly improved the moisture vapour transfer at upper trunk, and the combination of spacer and mesh knitted structure further enhanced the evaporative heat transfer.

The differences in i
                        m values for the three samples were not significant (F
                        2,9 = 0.1, p = 0.889; F
                        2,12 = 0.4, p = 0.673) under wind speed of 0.2 and 1 m/s, but significant (F
                        2,12 = 6.8, p = 0.11) under speed of 2 m/s. The post hoc t-tests further revealed that i
                        m value of Sample C was significantly higher than that of Sample A (p = 0.003) and Sample B (p = 0.043). Moisture permeability index (i
                        m) provides a measure for the ratio of the actual evaporative heat flow capability between the skin and the environment (Woodcock, 1962). Higher i
                        m value means that the clothing system is more breathable under the same thermal insulation. The results showed that the combination of spacer and mesh structure improved the moisture transfer of the clothing effectively at wind speed of 2 m/s.

As the results showed above, the effect of spacer and mesh structure on evaporative heat loss becomes more significant with the increase of air circulation. When there is no air circulation, more warm and moist air may be trapped by the increased air space between the fabric and skin, and it is difficult for them to be released from the mesh via natural convection (Ho et al., 2011). However, when air is moving, it is easy to ventilate from inside to outside due to the increase of the gap between the fabric and skin. Mesh in Sample C further enhances convective heat and moisture transfer. Moreover, with the acceleration of the air flow, the impact of ventilation parts on evaporative heat transfer is getting increasingly apparent.


                           Table 3
                            shows the mean temperature and the mean relative humidity on the chest, shoulder and upper back during run and rest periods for Samples A and C. One-way ANOVA results show that the two samples have no significant difference (p > 0.05) on the mean temperature and the mean relative humidity on the three locations during both on run and rest periods. Since the skin temperature and perspiration levels of individuals are affected by the changeable psychological and physiological characteristics, the effect of ventilation design may be easier reflected in the variations of temperature and perspiration during whole test period. Figs. 5 and 6
                           
                            show the variation of temperature and relative humidity with time on chest, shoulder and upper back parts of the subjects for the two samples during run and rest conditions. Repeated-measures ANOVA results show a significant effect (F = 920.35, p < 0.001) of ventilation design on temperature change of the chest (Fig. 5a) during the whole testing period. At shoulder (Fig. 5b), the temperature also presented a significant lower growth (F = 1508.2, p < 0.001) during the experiment. Meanwhile, the ventilation parts also resulted a significant lower (F = 842.8, p < 0.001) humidity growth (Fig. 6a) on the chest during the testing period. The shoulder presented a similar tendency on the variation of humidity (Fig. 6b) with chest. The analysis of the results shows a significant (F = 108.8, p < 0.001) effect when dressing the sample with ventilation parts to do exercise. It was found that temperature increased with time after running for 10 min on chest and shoulder area during the running period, but decreased during the rest period, regardless of the type of samples. It may be because, with increasing running time, heat was constantly produced by the body, then the skin temperature increased due to the accumulation of heat. Hence, the lower temperature growth showed that the ventilated parts reduced the heat accumulation effectively, the gap and openings contributed to heat escape by the body movement.

At back area, the temperature tended to decrease and was lower than the initial value most of the time, which can be attributed to the profuse sweating during exercises (Fig. 5c). It was found that the decrease in temperature is significantly (F = 1294.5, p < 0.001) smaller when dressing Sample C. The ventilation parts reduced the decrease in temperature at the back during the experiment, and the effect was highly significant. The tendencies of humidity changes in the two samples (Fig. 6c) were parallel to the changes in temperature. In addition, there were significant (F = 59.9, p < 0.001) differences in moisture accumulation. The results showed that the spacer structure can slightly regulate the skin temperature to reduce the chilly discomfort as a result of the fabrics (especially the wet fabrics) being stick to skin by perspiration, both during and after exercise.

The results indicate that the spacer and mesh structure tended to moderate the changes in the skin temperature. It avoided high skin temperature increase and decrease. Meanwhile, the spacers lifted the fabrics away from the skin surface, which caused the moist air escape easily via the mesh. The ventilation parts reduced the accumulation of moisture in fabrics, which regulated the relative humidity of the microclimate around the body.


                           Fig. 7
                            shows the results of subjective evaluation on thermal, moisture, fabric clingy sensations and overall comfort perception. It can be seen that there is a big change of thermal sensation (Fig. 7a) during the experiment when the subjects were dressed in Sample A. They felt cool before exercise and after 10 min rest, but they felt hot after 30 min running. On the other hand, the thermal sensation was changed between the normal and warm levels when the Sample C was dressed. Meanwhile, the clingy sensation (Fig. 7c) had a same tendency on two samples. It can be seen that the subjects can hardly feel any fabric sticking to their skin when wearing Sample C. However, the results of paired t-test show that there was no significant difference between the two samples on all evaluation of thermal and clingy sensations. Compared to Sample C, the subjects felt more moist when wearing Sample A (Fig. 7b), especially after running for 20 min. It showed a significant difference (t = −2.521, p = 0.045) after 30 min running. Two samples caused a similar overall comfort perception (Fig. 7d) at the beginning, but the comfort value decreased with time when the subject dressed Sample A. Although the value slightly increased during the rest period, the comfort of Sample A was still lower than that of Sample C. Particularly after the run, the comfort value of Sample C was significantly higher (30th min: t = 3.286, p = 0.017; 35th min: t = 2.521, p = 0.045; 40th min: t = 2.521, p = 0.045) than that of Sample A. It was worth noting that subjects felt hotter, wet and clingier when they just finished exercise. Because of that the comfort had a slight reduce at that moment when dressing the regular T-shirt. The ventilation design effectively controlled the increase of moisture after 30 min running, and efficiently regulated the wearer's comfort level in the post-exercise phase.

                            shows the variation of three selected physiology parameters during treadmill exercise for Samples A and C. Repeated-measures ANOVA results show a significant effect (F = 30.8, p < 0.001) of ventilation design on energy expenditure (EE) (Fig. 8(a)), although time has no significant effect (F = 0.4, p = 0.996) on EE. The volume of O2 consumption (VO2) showed a similar result (Fig. 8(b)). It was significantly lower (F = 28.0, p < 0.001) when wearing ventilation design, and there was no significant difference (F = 0.3, p = 1.00) over the time. However, no significant difference in the heart rate (F = 0.021, p = 0.886) (Fig. 8(c)) between the two samples can be found.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

According to the results of sweating thermal manikin test, the effects of mesh and spacer on thermal comfort were examined. Under the air velocity of 1 m/s, the evaporative resistance (R
                     e) of Sample C is 6% and 5.7% lower than that of Sample A and Sample B respectively. Under the air velocity of 2 m/s, the evaporative resistance (R
                     e) of Sample C is 6.2% significant lower than that of Sample A, though the thermal insulation (R
                     c) is 3.4% higher than that of Sample A. Moreover, the moisture permeability index (i
                     m) of Sample C is 11.1% and 6.7% significant lower than that of Sample A and Sample B, respectively. The results indicated that a larger space between the garment and the body skin surface with additional ventilation channels will decrease thermal insulation (R
                     c) and evaporative resistance (R
                     e) when the wearer in motion or under windy conditions (McCullough et al., 1983; Fan, 1989; Havenith et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2004; Qian and Fan, 2009; Ho et al., 2011).


                     Ho (2011) developed a ventilation T-shirt by adding spacer blocks and mesh at upper trunk in order to create extra air gaps and ventilation channels. When the T-shirts was made of 100% polyester, the results of the manikin test showed that the average thermal insulation (R
                     c) and evaporative resistance (R
                     e) of the ventilation T-shirt was 7.94% and 11.82% lower than that of control one under the air velocity of 2 m/s. However, the discreteness of results was so large that they were not statistically significant. Moreover, when the mesh was added at two sides of the ventilation T-shirt, the thermal insulation (R
                     c) and evaporative resistance (R
                     e) decreased significantly, but the same results can be achieved for normal T-shirt if mesh was placed at vertical side panels, so the effect of the spacer blocks design on the decrease of thermal insulation (R
                     c) and evaporative resistance (R
                     e) was not clear (Ho et al., 2008). The thickness of spacer blocks designed by Ho was 1.5–2 cm, and the weight of the ventilation T-shirt with spacer blocks was 249.3 g, which increased 40% compared to that without spacer blocks. By contrast, the spacer structure of the novel T-shirt (Sample C) is only 2 mm thick and the weight is nearly unchanged (104 g) compared to the control one (Sample A). Hence the design of Sample C is benefit for motion and comfort.

The results of wearer trials indicated that the ventilated design reduced the variation of skin temperature and humidity. Compared to the conventional one (Sample A), the novel T-shirt (Sample C) can regulate the temperature and relative humidity of the microclimate around the body during exercise and rest periods. There are 25% and 37% less skin temperature increase at the chest and shoulders while 37% less skin temperature decrease at the upper back; the skin relative humidity increase reduced 32%, 28% and 10% at the chest, shoulders and upper back, respectively. Hence, the subject, who doing exercises by dressing novel T-shirt (Sample C), felt less wet, less clingy and more comfort over time, especially in the post-exercise phase. There was no significant difference on heart rate (HR) for the subjects when wearing the two samples. However, the energy expenditure (EE) of Sample C slightly decreased 3.3% during exercise.

Clothing materials and constructions are the two key parameters that affect the sweat rates, sweat accumulation and thermoregulation during strenuous exercises (Gavin, 2003; Dai et al., 2008). Compared to the sports T-shirt made of cotton, the skin temperature of wearer can quickly reduced to the pre-exercise level and demonstrating a lower thermal and shivering/sweating sensation rate after exercise when polyester one was used (Marius et al., 2010), which was presented during a higher intensity exercise trials when the core temperature exceed 38.2 °C (Gavin, 2003; Dai et al., 2008; Marius et al., 2010). The main fabric of Samples A and C is polyester, which has superior water evaporation and less sweat accumulation properties (Ha et al., 1999), and on this basis, the effect of ventilation structures was significant during a lower intensity exercise trials at the core temperatures around 36 °C. Ho (2011) and Ueda et al. (2006) adopted mean skin temperature and humidity as well as the mean temperatures of different body regions to investigate the effect of fabric and construction. However, the results are difficult to present a significant difference during lower intensity exercise. In this paper, the variation of skin temperature and humidity was presented at specific locations instead of the mean values, reflecting the influence of the spacer and mesh structures on thermal comfort directly during exercise.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

It can be concluded that the novel T-shirt design, which has a combined spacer and mesh structure, significantly increase the air circulation next to skin and ventilation cooling under windy condition and/or active body movement. Under windy condition, the moisture permeability index (i
                     m) of T-shirt with ventilation structures decreased about 11.1% compared to that of conventional one. Under the real exercise situation, the sports T-shirt with the new ventilation design contributed to the reduction of heat accumulation, the increase of skin relative humidity, and the decrease of hot and chill discomfort. The variation of skin temperature and relative humidity reduced up to 37% and 32% respectively. The wearer felt more comfort with the novel ventilation designed garment during exercise, especially in the post-exercise phase. Moreover, the new ventilation design also contributed to the reduction of 3.3% energy expenditure during exercise, which is expected to be applied on the active sportswear like those for jogging, racket sports, and ball games, etc.
