                  A fundamental challenge in the design of Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) is the proper utilization of resources that are scarce. The critical challenge is to maximize the bandwidth utilization in data gathering and forwarding from sensor nodes to the sink. The main design objective is to utilize the available bandwidth efficiently. The proposed Bandwidth Efficient Cluster-based Data Aggregation (BECDA) algorithm presents the solution for the effective data gathering with in-network aggregation. It considers the network with heterogeneous nodes in terms of energy and mobile sink to aggregate the data packets. The optimal approach is achieved by intra and inter-cluster aggregation on the randomly distributed nodes with the variable data generation rate. The proposed algorithm uses the correlation of data within the packet for applying the aggregation function on the data generated by nodes. BECDA shows significant improvement in PDR (67.44% and 26.79%) and throughput (41.25% and 26.16%) as compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recent advances in technologies allowed the development of small devices with the capability of sensing, processing and transmission.

These devices act as sensors and can be integrated into Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs). Many applications have been emerged to use WSNs especially for the environmental, health monitoring, vehicle tracking system, military surveillance, and earthquake observation [1]. The most-distinguishing attributes of nodes used in WSNs are the limited power supply, storage capacity and communication bandwidth required. In WSN, bandwidth utilization and energy saving is a very important criterion for any existing and new applications. Normally, data collected from WSNs are large which makes it essential to eliminate redundant data, minimize the number of transmissions and improve the energy consumption. The effort to reduce the number of data packet transmission with the in-network processing is called data aggregation. The elimination of redundant data by use of aggregation at cluster head (CH) results in a reduction of communication cost. In this context, the energy consumption, network lifetime, communication bandwidth and transmission cost of the WSN affect significantly. The variation in lifetime and bandwidth also depends on the changes in network topology and the method of aggregating data packets.

BECDA considers the WSN model that refers to cluster-based aggregation, since clustering improves the scalability by stabilizing the network topology [2,3]. The additive and divisible aggregation function at CH results in a decrease of data packet count from the node to the sink. It saves energy, improves the network lifetime and bandwidth utilization [4]. Also, data aggregation with in-network processing makes it possible to enable energy savings with better bandwidth utilizations.

The paper proposes a novel BECDA to reduce the number of transmissions of data packets from nodes to the mobile sink. It focuses on the symmetric aggregation functions at cluster head, which are perfectly compressible. The aggregation function considers the correlation of random data generated by cluster member nodes in the cluster region. Each node in the network generates data by use of a random function with the standard deviation in the range of 0 and 1. The performance of BECDA is measured by aggregating the variable rate of data packets generated with consideration of throughput, energy consumption, PDR, and bandwidth utilization. BECDA shows significant improvement in throughput and PDR as compared with TTCDA and EECDA with aggregation of data packets.

The remaining part of the work is elaborated in different sections as follows; Section 2 presents a review of related works. Section 3 described the assumptions and proposed network model used for BECDA. Section 4 discusses the details of the BECDA. Section 5 gives the parameters used in the simulation and evaluates the results. Finally, paper is concluded in Section 6 with future works.

WSN applications commonly use hierarchical approaches to aggregate the data generated by sensor nodes. It helps to reduce the computational load and data redundancy for the energy consumption. In [4], TTCDA analytically proves that aggregation of data packet reduces the energy consumption and data redundancy by using the additive and divisible aggregation functions. In order to increase the depth of aggregation with efficient cluster head election a survey of many cluster-based algorithms are explored in [5,6]. Select cast [7], considers the optimal tradeoff between aggregation throughput and gathering efficiency using the spatial correlation between data collected from the sensor with lower bound as the threshold value for the gathering efficiency and throughput. Ref. [8] presents the hybrid approach for cluster-based aggregation, which adaptively selects the appropriate data aggregation function. This paper shows an improvement in energy consumption with the velocity of the target. Dynamic clustering shows better performance when velocity of the target is high. In [9], authors consider the grouping of cluster for reducing the energy consumption. In [10], Stable Election Protocol (SEP) considers that some percentages of nodes are equipped with higher energy and studied the impact of heterogeneity; authors show that the network stabilizes and prolongs the life before death of the first node. In [11], an Energy efficient Data Gathering Protocol (EDGA) is proposed to reduce the energy consumption by considering the residual energy of a node as computational metric. In [12], EECDA protocol uses the heterogeneous nodes in terms of energy for improving the network lifetime and stability. In [13], authors configure the heterogeneous nodes as advanced and super with variation in energy to improve the network lifetime and reduce energy consumption. Performance is tested for the static nodes. In [14], secure identity-based lossy aggregation integrity scheme based on the weight of the sensor node is proposed. The proposed algorithm considers the sensed data of equal length and the possibility of the losses is more if variable data is sent by the node. In [15], Management Architecture for Heterogeneous WSN (MARWIS) is presented for the heterogeneous WSNs; authors propose to subdivide the large network into small subgroups, which contains the sensor node of the same type for improving the resource utilization. Ref. [16] indicates the use of mobile data collector in large WSNs with a restriction of single hop. When the network size increases, data collectors increases, thus increasing the usage of energy. The paper [17] shows performance of WSN for the energy efficiency by considering static and mobile sink with duty cycle as computation metric.

To simplify the network model, following assumptions are considered based on [12,13].

                                 Nodes [normal, advanced, super] are heterogeneous in terms of energy and are equal in numbers.

The data generation rate of each node is different and not known to each other.

All the nodes in the cluster are at one hop for intra-cluster aggregation and are synchronized.

Each node generates the random data in the range of zero and 1.

                                 Network is divided into regions of 25×25m with each region having one CH and many cluster members (CM).

All heterogeneous nodes are randomly distributed with equal density and are stationary with mobile sink.

Clusters are considered as multi-hop and have mixed links, unidirectional for intra-cluster and bi-directional for the inter-cluster aggregation in the network.

The network model is considered as a connecting graph G (V, E) of different clusters {C
                        1, C

                        } of WSNs with heterogeneous nodes and mobile sink. Each region has a CH and numbers (nodes) that are represented by a set of vertices ‘V’ and wireless connecting edges ‘E’. The ‘V’ nodes in the network are randomly distributed and organized into ‘n’ clusters using a multi-hop clustering algorithm. Few nodes ‘h’ are deployed with higher energy (30J, 40J) than the normal nodes ‘u’ (20J). Now consider that, each cluster has ‘N’ nodes out of which ‘u’ and ‘h’ nodes ‘∀ u, h

                           The first part of the equation indicates energy consumed by CH in transmission of broadcast messages within the cluster. The second part indicates the energy consumed in reception of packets from {(N/n)−1} nodes in the cluster. Therefore Eq. (4) can be rewritten as,

Now consider, each participating node sends data packet to CH. This data is aggregated according to required aggregation function and then communicates to sink by forming a group as ‘m’. Under this condition, one CH with high residual energy and close to sink transfers the aggregated data packets from the group and other CH act as non-participating. Therefore, energy consumed by CH in data transmission per frame (EchF
                           ) to sink is,

The BECDA is presented for improving bandwidth utilization in terms of the PDR and throughput as metric of computation with a decrease in energy consumption. It works with three phases as shown in Fig. 2
                        . In the initial phase, randomly distributed heterogeneous nodes are organized into the number of clusters. It decides the CH for intra-cluster and inter-cluster aggregation from each square region. CH is elected according to the highest energy between the cluster member (normal, advanced or super node) and the highest number of average neighbor nodes with one hop connectivity. The threshold for the node to become CH according to [4] is:

                        where p is the percentage probability of selecting CH, r is the current round, (r mod 1/p) is a representation of elected CHs, Er
                         is residual energy after each round and Ei
                         is the initial energy, Di
                         is the degree of connectivity and Davg
                         is connectivity of network, dv
                         is the density of node within the selected range of cluster before the election of CH. Residual energy, density of node and connectivity decides the election of CH.

In the second phase, each CH is responsible for aggregation of data packets generated by cluster members with variable rate. The size of data packet generated is fixed.

According to the network consideration, each CH in the third phase works as individual node for performing inter-cluster aggregation. The end result is the aggregation of data packets at the sink with reduced packet count, Thus reducing communication cost. Let Ci
                         denotes the cost of communicating packets from nodes to CH and from CH to sink as depicted in Eq. (11)

This indicates the cost of aggregation in terms of energy consumption by the network, where cluster members sends random packets to CH [cost (j, i)] and CH to sink [cost (i, sin k)].

With the assumption that node in the network has equal density and heterogeneous in energy level are parts of the network graph G. The aggregated information for the inter-cluster phase with nodes ‘N’ into the cluster is obtained by the algorithm as given below:


                        Input: Graph G (V, E) with ‘n’ clusters G
                        ={C
                        1, C

                        3, … Cn
                        }.


                        Output: CH with aggregated data packets and sink with network wide aggregation.


                        Notations: hc=hop count, S – Sink, Pam – Parent announcement message, Pch – Parent cluster head, Rt – Routing table,
                           
                              1.
                              Sink node generate parent announcement message (Pam).

Set parent cluster head id=sink id.

Set first Pam=hc=1 and previous hop=sink id.

Initialize the timer for periodically broadcast Pam.

If Pam is received by CM then update the routing table Rt=Pam=previous sink id, since hc=1.

Increment hop count hc++ and update Pam=current node id.

Else, check the sequence number in ‘Rt’ and update ‘hc’.

If new – forward to Pch, else drop the packet.

Classify the nodes based on the rate.

At the end of time interval calculate rate of data received from CM.

Aggregate number of packets received and send it to CH.

Repeat steps 4–11 till packet reaches to the sink.

End.

In this section, performance of the BECDA algorithm is evaluated with two conditions of packet generation in heterogeneous WSN with mobile sink. Each node in the network generates the equal and different number of data packets. The results obtained for different performance measures of BECDA are compared with TTCDA [4] and EECDA [12]. To validate the performance, network simulator NS-2 is used. The transmission and receiver power of WSN nodes are taken according to trans-receiver model TR1000, simulation parameters used are listed in Table 1
                     .


                        Fig. 3
                        , shows the throughput of BECDA. This is measured with the number of bits received at the sink. It achieves around 37.01% and 17.16% less throughput in an equal rate and 45.48% and 34.39% in different rates of packet generation as compared with TTCDA and EECDA respectively.

This causes due to the elimination of repetitive readings of the data packets at intra and inter-cluster aggregation stage. This indicates that BECDA consumes less bandwidth as compared with TTCDA and EECDA.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows details of the average energy consumption. This is the measure of the ratio between the sum of energy consumption of all nodes to the total number of nodes. The average energy consumption of BECDA is less by 5.89% and 7.77% as compared with EECDA in both the conditions, but more by 36.29% and 6.38% as compared with TTCDA. This is because each node generates different number of data packets in each round of aggregation and packets reached at the sink are less and hence consumes less energy as compared with EECDA.

In Fig. 5
                        , it is seen that BECDA has less PDR of 67.66% and 22.73% in an equal rate of data generation and 67.29% and 30.85% in different rate as compared with TTCDA and EECDA. It is due to application of additive and divisible aggregation function at CH. Packets received at the sink are less with equal rate as compared with different rate of generation. It shows effective utilization of bandwidth. PDR is the ratio of the number of packets received by the sink to the total number of packets generated by all the nodes.


                        Fig. 6
                        , shows that, BECDA has more residual energy (15.77% and 24.26%) as compared with EECDA but less by approximately 36.69% and 12.19% as compared with TTCDA in equal and different rates. It is due to the fact that TTCDA considers the node with equal initial energy. Residual energy is calculated as the ratio of the sum of remaining energy of all nodes to the total number of nodes.


                        Fig. 7
                        , indicates the network lifetime, it is the time at which sink receives last data packet after some nodes are dead. Lifetime of BECDA is more by 32.72% and 36.17% as compared with EECDA with equal and different rate of packet generation. This is an indication of improvement in the lifetime of the network. The lifetime of the network is measured with first node die. The lifetime of TTCDA is more since it energy efficient as compared with BECDA and EECDA.

According to Fig. 8
                        , energy consumption in the number of rounds is less in the BECDA as compared with EECDA. In EECDA network sustain only up to 28 rounds as compared with 48 rounds of BECDA. This causes due to heterogeneity of nodes. Also, the CH head election is based on one of the factor of remaining energy of node. Also only one CH is elected once and no re-election in the given cluster area.

According to Fig. 9
                        , energy consumption of each node in the network differ with the initial energy, it shows that the energy consumption varies from the normal node to supernode approximately by factor of 2. It is also seen that energy consumption of node in EECDA is less in each round as compared with BECDA.

The comparative results of different performance measures of BECDA with TTCDA and EECDA for heterogeneous WSN are summarized in Table 2
                        .

BECDA proposed novel techniques to improve the network performance by aggregating the data packets generated by heterogeneous nodes in the network with mobile sink. It uses the compressible aggregation function to increase the bandwidth utilization and energy saving as compared with EECDA. Simulation results show that BECDA has lower throughputs and PDR compared to TTCDA and EECDA respectively. The proposed BECDA is bandwidth efficient. Also, BECDA has better energy saving compared to EECDA but lacks with TTCDA.

The extension of the proposed algorithm will be considered for mobility and heterogeneity of both nodes and sink in the future work.
