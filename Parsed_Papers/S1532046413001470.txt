                  Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) are extensively used in the biomedical domain to support information sharing between software applications. KOSs are proposed covering different, but overlapping subjects, and mappings indicate the semantic relation between concepts from two KOSs. Over time, KOSs change as do the mappings between them. This can result from a new discovery or a revision of existing knowledge which includes corrections of concepts or mappings. Indeed, changes affecting KOS entities may force the underline mappings to be updated in order to ensure their reliability over time. To tackle this open research problem, we study how mappings are affected by KOS evolution. This article presents a detailed descriptive analysis of the impact that changes in KOS have on mappings. As a case study, we use the official mappings established between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM from 2009 to 2011. Results highlight factors according to which KOS changes in varying degrees influence the evolution of mappings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) encompass all types of schemes for organising information [1] such as terminologies, taxonomies, classification and ontologies. They comprise properties to make the semantics of the data explicit, and biomedical KOSs like SNOMED CT

                      (International Classification of Disease) (ICD for short) are nowadays widely used. They have applications in epidemiology, health management, clinical administration and biomedical and medical decision support systems.

The ever-increasing size of the biomedical domain means that software applications must rely on multiple KOSs to ensure optimal coverage of their requirements. To cope with this issue, semantic correspondences, i.e., mappings, are established between various KOSs. The mappings are useful since they can support many applications, such as semantic search services, facilitating information indexing with multiple terminologies [2] or the integration of data from various sources [3]. Fung and Xu [4] highlight the possibility of applications to understand heterogeneous data by interpreting mappings that link two different KOSs. For instance, mappings between SCT and ICD support the classification of data using ICD from clinical records annotated with SCT, which has various benefits [4]. These examples underline the relevance of mappings and justify the need to keep them reliable over time.

The highly dynamic nature of medical knowledge makes frequent releases of new KOS versions inevitable [5]. Consequently, atomic and complex changes affecting KOS entities [6] can potentially have a direct impact on existing mappings between these entities and thus on the underlying software applications. In this case, there is a clear need to update mappings every time a KOS evolves [7–9]. A naïve approach would be to re-apply existing matching algorithms [10] considering all entities of both aligned KOSs each time a new version of a KOS is released, but tremendous time and efforts are required to complete and evaluate the resulting mappings. Hence the need for efficient approaches to keeping mappings valid, as mentioned by Saitwal et al. [7]. In our previous work [11] we proposed the DyKOSMap framework for maintaining mappings at KOS evolution time. This approach is predicated on the hypothesis that there is a correlation between changes affecting KOSs’ entities and the evolution of their associated mappings.

This article aims to demonstrate through experiments the relationships between changes in entities of a biomedical KOS and the evolution of their associated mappings. In other words, we try to identify which KOS changes are the cause or motivation for adapting the associated mappings. The results can help to provide empirically justified efficient approaches to keep mappings valid. The analyses conducted take the influence of changes in different KOS entities into account (e.g., concepts and their attributes, relationships and change in neighbour concepts). We propose a means of categorising mapping evolution to measure the impact of various types of changes in KOS entities on categorised mappings. The experiments explore various official releases of SCT and ICD and the official mappings established between them.

The remainder of this article is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the related work; Section 3 presents the experimental scenario including basic definitions, the method applied as well as the organisation of the experiments conducted; Section 4 describes the findings on the influence of KOS evolution on mapping evolution, while Section 5 presents the results of the analyses regarding the correlation between different mapping change operations; Section 6 raises relevant questions and discusses future work; finally, Section 7 offers the conclusions of the article.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#


                     Mapping maintenance is the task aiming to keep existing mappings in an updated and valid state, reflecting changes affecting KOS entities at evolution time.

Having the appropriate techniques for adapting mappings so that they evolve over time is vital due to the increasing use of combined KOSs in current biomedical systems. Recent research [7] has highlighted the importance of reducing significant manual efforts associated with the maintenance of mappings needing to be updated on a regular basis and has identified mapping maintenance as a challenge. Since our hypothesis is that KOS evolution may be the main reason for invalidating mappings, it is important to understand and classify the different aspects of this evolution and, therefore, search for potential impacts and correlations between KOS change types and possible changes in mappings. If such correlations exist, they could serve as the foundation of innovative methods and techniques for mapping maintenance.

Although significant research efforts in the past years have dealt with issues related to ontology evolution [12], the understanding of how this evolution impacts dependent artefacts, such as mappings, has received very little attention. Recent research on ontology change impact analysis [13] mainly concerns internal logical inconsistencies of ontology, whereas dependent artefacts are not taken into account. In contrast, Tang and Tang [14] have proposed a method for evaluating ontology evolution with a specific emphasis on the validity of the existing mappings between ontologies. In the method proposed they assume that only removal of axioms can impact mappings.

Few key proposals in literature tackle ontology mapping evolution in a more automatic approach [15,16]. Martins and Silva [15] propose evolving mappings by imitating strategies applied in ontology evolution, but only the case of concept removal is studied. The proposal of Khattak et al. [16] focuses on reducing the time for re-determining mappings. They suggest identifying only those concepts which have changed in the source ontology and applying matching algorithms, only considering this subset of concepts with respect to the entire target ontology. The precision of this approach is highly dependent on the matching techniques selected. Both proposals are preliminary and still insufficient to adequately tackle the mapping maintenance problem, as they do not identify possible foundations according to which KOS evolution impacts mappings. For instance, scenarios of complex change, such as concept splitting, raise difficult challenges in adapting mappings to make them valid [11].

The case study in this article explores changes in the evolution of SCT and mappings between SCT and ICD. Although there is research in literature with regard to the evolution of SCT [17,18], it does not concern this evolution’s impact on associated mappings. For instance, Gonçalves et al. [17] analyse the changes between two ontology versions and use SCT to show the applicability of their approach. Spackman [18] investigates rates of change in large clinical terminologies using SCT as the object of study, although mappings are not taken into consideration. Closely related to this article, the work of Gross et al. [19] explores how mappings in life sciences ontologies change. They empirically analyse which ontology changes lead to an addition or deletion of ontology mappings. The study also examines stability of matching techniques to identify which matchers are most influenced by ontology changes. Using a computed mappings dataset, the study demonstrates how ontology changes can impact mapping changes and presents the ratio of changes in mappings according to three general categories of ontology change types.

The findings of the aforementioned study highlight the relevance of this study’s quest to gain a more in-depth understanding of how a more fine-grained classification of KOS changes would affect mapping evolution, considering also real-world mapping sets in the experiments conducted. In contrast to previous work, this article focuses on the correlation between the way KOS elements involved in mappings evolve and how these mappings behave over time.

Section 3.1 sets out the article’s final objective and provides basic definitions. Section 3.2 presents the method used to investigate mapping evolution. Section 3.3 describes the conducted experiments as well as the used datasets.

The objective of this work is to underline correlations between KOS evolution and mapping evolution. To this end, a set of experiments with specific objectives highlighting different levels of detail analyse the evolution of mappings between SCT and ICD (cf. Section 3.3). We only considered KOSs having several versions of official mappings, and analysed the impact of the evolution of only one KOS (in this case SCT because the richness of its model allows a more detailed analysis). Three groups of changes in the KOS were considered during the analysis: Addition of concepts, Modification of attributes, and Removal of concepts. We consider a mapping m as a triple (s, t, r), where s is the “source concept” (domain) and denotes a concept belonging to the source KOS; t is the “target concept” (range) and denotes a concept from the target KOS; and r is a relation symbol representing the type of semantic relation between s and t. The types of semantic relations considered in this study are based on those proposed by IHTSDO: Unmappable (UN), which means that a source concept cannot be linked to a specific target concept; Equivalent (OO), signifying two concepts that are semantically identical; Narrow-to-broad (NB), when the source concept is semantically more specific than the target concept; Broad-to-Narrow (BN), which is the opposite proposition of NB; and Partial Overlap (PO), when there is a relation between the concepts but it is not one of the previous defined relations.

In the experiments, we consider the definition of KOS to be a set of Concepts, Attributes and Relationships. Concepts are defined by a set of Attributes, and Relationships link the concepts within the KOS. We intentionally use the words relation and relationship to differentiate the element of a mapping from an entity of a KOS, respectively. The type of Attributes and Relationships varies according to the KOS model (for example, ICD has only one type of relationship, while SCT has several). Relationships are well-defined types of semantic relationships (e.g., subsumption) linking different concepts of the same KOS. Relationships are important in this work because we also consider neighbour concepts (concepts linked to a concept c
                        1 through a direct relationship) in the analysis.

In order to conduct the experiments we establish a system of categorising mapping evolution. The categories correspond to “mapping change operations” (MCOs) which lead to mappings evolution from one released version to another. MCOs are different from KOS change operations because they only refer to the mappings. For instance, one element of the mapping can change (e.g., the target concept was modified from concept t
                        1 to t
                        2 such that these concepts have different identifiers) without implying that the content (e.g., attributes) of these concepts changed in the KOS. We aim to identify possible correlations between MCOs and the KOS change operations which affect the source concept of mappings. Analysing two subsequent versions of a set of mappings makes it possible to identify a subset of mappings which differ from one version to another.

                                 Isolation. The fourth step consists in selecting the changed mappings affected by only one KOS evolution. For the experiments, we selected only mappings whose target concept was unchanged over two successive releases of mappings. The modified concepts are identified by calculating a simple difference between all concepts of two successive versions of the target KOS. We evaluate one KOS at a time in order to provide a conclusive analysis from the set of values that we calculate. Cases where both KOSs evolve at the same time will require a qualitative analysis supervised by domain experts in order to explain the impact of each changed concept (in the source and in the target) on the mappings. In reality, new releases of KOSs are published in different periods of time, but mappings are generated only once a year (in the case of SCT and ICD) several months after the KOS evolution. Our long-term goal is to reduce this period by providing automatic mapping maintenance as soon as a new version of the KOS is released.

In the following we present the definition of the set of experiments conducted.

We assume that only concepts directly related to the categorised mappings (i.e., source or target concepts), or those in the neighbourhood (e.g., super-concepts, sub-concepts, siblings, etc.), can potentially impact the evolution of mappings. We organise the experiments according to two distinct objectives: (1) KOS–MCO change analyses on mapping evolution and (2) MCO–MCO change analyses on mapping evolution. It is important to note that the nature of the experiments conducted in the first category differs from that of the experiments conducted in the second one. In the first, the different types of MCOs are investigated independently (i.e., one by one). We assume that a mapping is only influenced by changes in the source concept and in its related KOS entities (attributes, relationships and hierarchical concepts). In the second category, we wish to identify correlations between different MCOs. This analysis can be used to identify more complex MCOs. Following are the main characteristics of each experiment group:

A general view of mapping behaviour can allow the identification of entities that need deeper investigations. This principle was applied to our experiments and presented in Tables 1 and 2
                           
                            (general analyses). The detailed analyses were performed to better understand the impact of each entity on the MCOs.
                              
                                 1.
                                 
                                    General analyses. They focus on mappings only (cf. Section 4.1). The experiments provide an overview of the change operations performed in the mappings without considering the potential impacts of the KOS. These experiments were grouped into two types:
                                       
                                          (a)
                                          Basic analysis on explored mappings presents the absolute values of the mappings (Table 1) and the relative values of changes in the mappings in the MCOs categories (Table 2). We can identify the most frequent operations and whether there are operations that never happen in order to exclude them from the rest of the study.

Analysis of mapping relations focuses on the modifications of types of semantic relations expressed by the mappings. We present the relative values of changes in the mappings according to the type of relation (Table 3
                                             ). The analyses of the results give an idea of how the mappings have evolved in recent years and show (Fig. 2
                                             ) whether the KOSs tend to be fully aligned.


                                    Detailed analyses. We present the influence of KOS evolution on mapping evolution (cf. Section 4.2). This differs from the previous analyses by taking into account the various potential types of changes in each entity of the source KOS (e.g., in the concepts, relationships, etc.). The goal is to observe whether changes in the KOS entities have a direct impact on the evolution of mappings and eliminate those that have low or no impact. We started with a general view of changes in the KOS entities with regard to MCOs. It highlights the KOS’ most relevant entities, which we will study in depth. Then, each relevant entity is analysed separately.

Taking into account the context of each KOS’ concept, we can identify whether other elements (e.g., super/sub concepts and sibling concepts) and KOS structural changes related to them influence mapping evolution. We conducted these experiments because many matching algorithms use structural properties to create mappings. It would be interesting to know the exact impact of the structural properties on the mapping evolution. The structural analysis may allow identifying more complex operations related to mappings (e.g., move or duplication of mappings) and look for correlations with more complex changes in the KOS (e.g., substitution, split and merge of concepts). For this purpose, we conduct two types of analyses: quantitative and qualitative:
                              
                                 1.
                                 
                                    Quantitative analysis. In this analysis we search for correlations between MCOs and concepts sharing structural properties (cf. Section 5.1). We investigate different combinations of MCOs considering mappings that share the same target concepts and whose source concepts have a structural relationship. A structural relationship means that source concepts are interrelated through an “is_a” relationship or that they have sibling concepts (i.e., they share the same super concept) (Table 10).


                                    Qualitative analysis. In this analysis, we select some cases based on the results from the previous analysis and we analyse them in detail (cf. Section 5.2). Our objective is to observe the role played by each KOS’ change and by the involved concepts in the MCO. In particular, we investigate the source concept information that mappings are related to and evaluate which of the changes in these concepts may have triggered the need for changes in the associated mappings, i.e., the specific features of the changes that could explain the need to adapt the mapping.

For this study we look for biomedical KOSs with the following characteristics:
                              
                                 1.
                                 Availability of several versions of the KOS.

Substantial number of concepts in each KOS.

Availability of several versions of mappings between them.

Finally, we opted to use SNOMED CT (SCT)

                            and ICD-9-CM (ICD).

                              4
                            The SCT model relies on three main entities: Concepts, Descriptions and Relationships. Concepts are identified by a unique identifier and have attributes such as name and status. Concepts are never removed, but their status can be set to active or inactive. Each concept may be associated with a set of descriptions and relationships. Descriptions are special attributes and are composed of sets of terms that textually describe the concepts. Their type denotes either a preferred term or a synonym, and their associated status follows the same categorisation as in the case of concepts. As for Concepts, Descriptions are never removed, but their status can change. It is important to emphasise that Descriptions are independent entities related to concepts.

The ICD model is composed of a pre-defined hierarchical structure including Chapters, Blocks and Codes. Chapters are the most general level of organisation. Blocks always belong to a Chapter, and Codes are identified by a unique numerical identifier belonging to a unique Block and Chapter. There are no explicit relationships between concepts from ICD, and mappings are always interrelated with the Codes level.

We use SCT as the source KOS and ICD as the target. According to the adopted definition of mapping, the source concept is a concept in the SCT while the target concept is a concept belonging to ICD. For instance, concept code ‘123714004’ with the name ‘Ventricular septal defect, spontaneous closure (disorder)’ in SCT is mapped to concept code ‘745.4’ with the name ‘Ventricular septal defect’ in ICD. This mapping has the relation type NB, i.e., the concept in SCT is considered semantically less general than the concept in ICD. For the experiments, we selected six different KOS versions (i.e., four different versions of SCT and two different versions of ICD). We also selected four official versions of mappings (provided by IHTSDO) between these KOS (as illustrated in Fig. 1).

In this Section we first present the general analysis conducted on mapping evolution (Section 4.1) followed by the detailed empirical results (Section 4.2).

The following experiments aim to provide an initial overview of mapping evolution. We started with a basic analysis of the categorised mappings and then conducted an analysis of the mapping relations.

We perform this analysis in order to gain an overview of the dataset and evaluate whether mappings authors really need automatic methods and tools to support mappings maintenance activities. The absolute and relative quantity of the categorised mappings are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The MCOs considered are: Unchanged (U), Addition (A), Removal (R), Modification in t (M
                           
                              t
                           ), Modification in r (M
                           
                              r
                           ) and Modification in t and r (M
                           
                              t_r
                           ). Four sets of mappings were analysed. From each couple of subsequent mapping versions, the sets of C
                           
                              i
                            were calculated according to the rules described in Section 3.2.


                           Table 1 presents total changed and unchanged mappings over C
                           
                              i
                           : C
                           1 with 100,875 mappings, C
                           2 with 101,254 mappings, and C
                           3 with 102,601 mappings. Changed mappings are all those affected by the MCOs: A, R, M
                           
                              t
                           , M
                           
                              r
                            and M
                           
                              t_r
                           . Although unchanged mappings represent 99.10% of the total quantity of mappings, the quantity of mappings that require changes is still substantial, and automatic tools that reduce this laborious human task are fully justified.

The results obtained show expressive growth in the quantity of mappings changed during the analysed period. This growth tends to continue with the increasing size of SCT and ICD.


                           Table 2 shows the proportions of changed mappings to each mapping change operation. This is the ratio between the quantities of mappings categorised with a determined mapping change operation divided by total changed mappings in C (cf. Table 1). Modifications were first observed in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       M
                                    
                                    
                                       3
                                    
                                 
                              
                            (and included in C
                           2), where the three types of modifications (M
                           
                              t
                           , M
                           
                              r
                            and M
                           
                              t_r
                           ) account for 51% of the mappings in C
                           2. One potential explanation can be that C
                           2 was calculated after the evolution of ICD and SCT. Even applying our algorithm to exclude mappings related to concepts that changed in the target KOS, it is possible to have an indirect impact of these KOS changes into the other mappings. For instance, if a sub-concept is added to ICD, the relation of the existing mapping can change. A qualitative analysis of both KOS is necessary to understand well the mapping evolution.

We study the evolution of the semantic relations of mappings, i.e., we analyse the MCOs according to the nature of the semantic relation between the source and target concepts. We expect to observe whether the evolution of the KOSs tend to increase their “harmony” (i.e., OO mappings are increasing) or their specialisation (i.e., relation of type NB is predominant). The harmony between two KOSs is obtained when they agree on the definition of a specific concept. From the mappings side, it implies they can be added, removed but not modified if the source and target concepts do not change. With the analysis of relations, we also seek to identify situations in which the relations were impacted by the KOS evolution.


                           Table 3 shows, for each MCO, the frequency of the relations used by the mappings in C
                           
                              i
                           . The numbers in Table 3 represent the quantity of mappings with a specific relation for one operation divided by the total of mappings from C
                           
                              i
                           . For instance, the number 17.55 means that 17.55% of the unchanged mappings from C
                           1 have the relation type UN. Fig. 2 presents the behaviour of the modification of semantic relations for the most representative modifications (M
                           
                              r
                            and M
                           
                              t_r
                           ). We analyse the absolute counts of the relation type before and after evolution considering all possible combinations of modification.

The outcomes show that the number of mappings of type UN decreased significantly for mappings added during the analysed period, and the number of mappings of this same relation type had increased for removed mappings. This can reveal a convergence between the KOSs. However, it does not indicate that both KOSs evolve in the same way. Observing that existing mappings tend not to change when SCT is less general than ICD (∼60% unchange), and that mappings with NB relation are most frequently added than removed, while those with relation type OO are more frequently removed than added, we can potentially conclude that SCT evolve faster and tend to be more specialised than ICD.

On the other hand, when observing how the relation of the mappings evolve (cf. Fig. 2), we note the inverse phenomenon (changes from NB to OO are more frequent). This preliminary analysis could not explain the modifications in the mapping relation, which can potentially come from the impact of KOS changes in the ICD. This hypothesis derives from the number of relation modifications after changing the version of ICD (from 2009 to 2010), indicated in the line C
                           2 of Table 2. Nevertheless, deeper analyses of the mapping relations, the KOS and the context are necessary in order to better understand this phenomenon.

The objective of the following experiments is to evaluate how changes affecting the source entities impact on associated mappings. For instance, we observe the behaviours of mappings when a concept is deleted from the KOS or when an attribute is added to a concept. We aim to identify a correlation between KOS changes and mappings evolution. To do so, we compare the MCOs with the changes in the source KOS. We consider only concepts belonging to the source KOS (i.e., the set of source concepts of mappings) and the set of concepts explored in the experiments is a subset of the SCT concepts. In the experiments we consider the influence of Concepts (only those that have a mappings associated), Descriptions, Relationships and Neighbourhood.

The entities are selected to evaluate potential impact on mappings change, not only due to a source concept change, but possibly to a change in different KOS entities, for instance, a connected relationship. Moreover, the different types of change related to the KOS entities are taken into consideration. We individually investigated each type of change in the KOS to better evaluate its potential impact on mappings.

In the following experiments we started by observing the influence of KOS entity changes on mappings. Note that we only determined if KOS entities changed, not how. Based on the results obtained (Table 4
                        ), further experiments were conducted to measure in greater detail the impact of different aspects of changes in KOS entities.

We further considered the influence of different types of changes affecting the source concept: a change in attributes or the addition of a concept (Table 5)
                        , a change of status (Table 6)
                        , a change in descriptions (Table 7)
                        , a change in relationships (Table 8
                        ), and finally a change in the neighbourhood (Table 9
                        ).

In this analysis we considered changes affecting one of the source KOS entities (see Table 4). Each column corresponds to an entity (Concept, Descriptions, Relationships and Neighbours). Note that the analysis of changes in source concepts and neighbour concepts does not include changes in their descriptions, which are considered distinct elements. In Table 4, the numbers represent a percentage of total mappings for each MCO. For instance, 0.06% represents the ratio of all unchanged mappings in which the source concept has changed (e.g., in the attributes). In other words, in 1.71% of the unchanged mappings some neighbour concept of the source concept had changed. Note that one concept can have several changes at the same time, for instance, a concept can be “deleted” and also have its relationships deleted. In this case, the same concept will be counted in two different columns (e.g., Concept and Relationship). For the purposes of representing the data visually we decided to not normalise the values. The sum of the relative values is therefore not necessarily 100%.

The results show that changes in KOS entities may have no effect on the mappings. However, these exceptional cases are rare and require a case-by-case analysis. This can be attributable, for instance, to minor corrections in the text (e.g., adding an “s” to the end of a name or a capital letter) in the cases of Concepts and Descriptions, or the addition of a new relationship (implying a new neighbour). The case-by-case analysis of these situations is beyond the scope of this article.

Modifications in the semantic relation of mappings between KOSs have been performed without observing changes in the KOS entities. For instance, according to Table 2, in C
                           3, 2% of mappings change had their relation modified, but in Table 4 (cf. row M
                           
                              r
                            in C
                           3) these modifications were not associated with changes in the KOS. The results obtained so far did not allow any precise explanation about these observations. We can imagine that improvements in mappings from one release to another, or changes in the ICD, are potentially the origin of mapping relation modifications. Table 4 shows clearly that adding or removing mappings is frequently associated with changes in the source concepts, as well as in concepts’ descriptions and relationships. For instance, in the row Addition and C
                           1, all concepts from the source of the mappings changed somehow. This fact drove us to deepen the analysis for each type of change in the source concept. Observation of the changes in neighbour concepts indicates that these have the lowest rate of change, but they can potentially be used to improve the precision of an approach for mapping maintenance.

The objective of these experiments is to highlight correlations between different types of changes affecting the source concept and the MCO. For this purpose, we provide two different analyses. First, we investigate the types of change in concepts according to the taxonomy of concept changes proposed in SCT (Table 5). Second, we focus on status change as a specific type of change in the concepts (Table 6).

The types of change analysed, as shown in Table 5 are: Addition, Status change, Minor change and Unchanged. Addition represents a new concept added to the KOS; Status change means that the attribute status of the concept has changed; Minor change means that the concept was affected by a small change in its name. Changes in the label occur when the text used to name the concept is modified. In this analysis we also include the type Unchanged to represent a source concept that has not been changed at all.

The results obtained are shown in Table 5. The numbers in this table represent the ratio of MCOs that are associated with one specific type of concept change. For instance, 98.82% of added mappings are associated with a new concept added to the KOS.

There is a strong correlation between mappings that are removed and changes in concepts’ status, which deserves more in-depth study. Moreover, a mapping is normally added after a source concept is added (in at least 99.54% of the cases). If, from one side, these results show a strong correlation between the addition of concepts and the additions of mappings, from another side, they did not explain why M
                           
                              t
                           , M
                           
                              r
                            and M
                           
                              t_r
                            MCOs are (in most cases) not correlated to changes in source concepts. A case-by-case study is necessary.

In order to show correlations between MCOs and the status of the source concepts, we compare the value of the status of each concept before and after the KOS evolution. We aim at identifying changes in the status of concepts that may indicate the correction of a mistake in the previous version of the KOS (e.g., ambiguous, etc.). We search for possible influences that a status change in the source concept can have on changes in the mappings. Following are the types of status that can be assigned to a concept in SCT: “non-existent” (−1), “current” (0), “inactive with no reason given” (1), “duplicated” (2), “outdated” (3), “ambiguous” (4), “erroneous” (5), “limited” (6). The non-existent status is to accommodate those concepts that are added in a later KOS version. The statuses from 1 to 6 compose the inactive group, and only the reason for the inactivation differentiates them. As the removal of a concept does not exist in SCT, in the analysis we considered that all inactive statuses correspond to a concept removal operation. For the purposes of displaying the data, the numbers corresponding to the statuses are used in Table 6. This table illustrates only statuses whose value is not always 0%. For instance, for all concepts analysed before evolution, status 4 (ambiguous) was not found and is therefore not shown in Table 6. The numbers in this table represent a percentage of total source concepts of each type of MCO that have a given status. For instance, 98.82% of added mappings are associated with concepts whose status before evolution was non-existent (−1), whereas 100% of added mappings are associated with active concepts (i.e., after KOS evolution, these mappings’ source concepts have the current status).

Considering unchanged mappings, the status of source concepts remains the same before and after evolution, confirming that there is a strong correlation between the changes in the concept status and changes in the mappings. As expected, an addition of mappings is always done between active concepts. However, they are not limited to new concepts. In the row Addition and C
                           3, it can be observed that 33.67% of the source concepts underwent no status change. Equivalent conclusions can be drawn from mappings removal. They are always removed from active concepts, but the concepts are not always assigned as inactive in the next KOS version.

The impact of changes on concept status is inexpressive (or null) for the three MCOs regarding modification of mappings: M
                           
                              t
                           , M
                           
                              r
                            and M
                           
                              t_r
                           . In the following, we analyse the changes in source concepts’ descriptions.

Since concepts’ descriptions are linked to a concept (i.e., they are not attributes of the concept entities), we analyse them separately to find correlations between MCOs and changes in the descriptions of the source concept. We assume that attributes of concepts are important for establishing semantic correspondences between concepts and we aim to measure this importance by verifying whether mappings are sensible to changes in the attributes. For this purpose, we analyse Addition of descriptions (when a new description is added, with an active or inactive state), Change of status (to active state or to inactive state) and Unchanged. The numbers in Table 7 represent the ratio of total mappings of each MCO for which the source concepts’ description underwent a specific change. For instance, 99.05% of added mappings have at least one newly added active description. In the mappings analysed we did not observe any addition of inactive descriptions; therefore, we decided to exclude the “inactive” table column for the added descriptions.

A concept can have a set of descriptions. Each description is considered independently from the others. Therefore, it is possible to find situations where there is more than one type of change in the same description set at the same time. This explains why the sum of the numbers in the rows of Table 7 is not necessarily 100%. For example, in the row Removal and C
                           1, 98.2% of the source concepts of the removed mappings have at least one description that changed. In the same row, but in the next column (Unchanged%), we see that 23.21% of removed mappings have at least one description that did not change. These two columns are not complementary because one concept can have several associated descriptions, and there are cases in which a subset of descriptions has changed while another subset has not.

Observing unchanged mappings, there were few cases in which there was no change in the descriptions. Added mappings are frequently related to the addition of descriptions. There is a correlation between additions of descriptions and addition of mappings. Since it is impossible to remove descriptions in SCT, when a description needs to be updated, one possibility is to set its status to inactive and create a new description. These two operations may explain why some descriptions changed to inactive (0.23%) when mappings were added. Furthermore, the results indicate a strong correlation between removal of mappings and changes in the status of the descriptions to inactive (94.94% on average).

We analyse whether information collected from a KOS’s structure can be used to determine how mappings evolve. The objective is to investigate how changes affecting the relationships connected to the source concept of the mappings analysed can have an influence on how these mappings change.

We consider three types of relationships between the source concept and another concept belonging to SCT (i.e., within the same KOS): (1) “Super” relationships, those of type is_a that link the source concept with its “super concept(s)” such that the source concept is the domain in the relationships; “Sub” relationships, the inverse of the previous one; and “Other” relationships representing all other types of relationships other than is_a in which the source concept of mappings is the domain or range of the relationship.

We take three types of changes in concepts’ relationships (Addition, Removal and Unchanged) into consideration, each represented by a column in the Table 8. Nevertheless, unlike for concepts and descriptions in SCT, there is no different status for relationships. As a consequence, relationships are added or removed, and we consider the removal of relationships to be a particular type of change. Moreover, in SCT there are various “concepts of control”, which have an impact on the analysis of changes in relationships. They are used to assess relationships according to changes in concepts. For instance, when a concept is set as inactive, the set of relationships associated with this concept is removed, and other relationships to the “control” concept are created to avoid anomalies in the structures of SCT. For this reason, when analysing the values in Table 8, it is necessary to consider that the removal of a mapping triggered by the inactivation of a concept will lead to both the removal and addition of relationships (at the same time). The values presented in Table 8 are the ratio of each MCO that has the specific change in the relationship of the source concepts in relation to the total of each MCO. One specific change in the relationship (e.g., Addition) has three subgroups of values (i.e., “Super”,”Sub” and “Other”). For instance, 66.33% of the mappings’ source concept added has at least one new relationship added with a super concept. Each type of relationship is analysed independently.

The conducted analysis considering how changes in the relationships affect the MCOs is described separately:
                              
                                 •
                                 “Super” relationships: When the majority of the “Super” relationships of source concepts remain unchanged, mappings also remain unchanged. As showed in Table 8, in most cases the addition of “Super” relationships is correlated to the addition of mappings. Only in few insignificant cases can the addition of mappings be correlated to the removal of “Super” relationships. The ratio of addition and removal of “Super” relationships is equal when mappings are removed. As explained before, the inactivation of a concept lead to a structural KOS change. These results reveal that addition of “Super” relationships influences the addition of mappings. However, as already noted in the analysis of descriptions, the addition of relationships can also be triggered by the addition of concepts.

“Sub” relationships: The addition of “Sub” relationships is not observed when mappings are removed, while the removal of “Sub” is not observed when mappings are added. The values are attributable to the inactivation of a concept (which causes the removal of “Sub” relationships) or by the addition of new concepts (which can lead to the addition of “Sub” relationships). However, there is no clear correlation between “Sub” relationships and MCO. The impact of changes on “Sub” relationships is inexpressive for the unchanged and modified mappings categories.

“Other” relationships: They behave similarly to “Super” relationships.

We observe possible impacts of changes in neighbour concepts on the MCOs. We refer to this as ‘indirect impact’. We search for correlations between changes in the mappings and other components of the KOS that are not directly related to the mappings. We analysed neighbour concepts in a way similar to the strategy used for analysing source concepts’ descriptions. Therefore, we analysed “Addition” and “Change of status” with regard to the nature of their status: “Active” or “Inactive”, and “Unchanged” neighbour concepts. Each type of change is analysed independently, since similarly to relationships, one source concept can have several neighbour concepts. Consequently, different changes may occur at the same time. Table 9 represents the ratio of each MCO that experienced the specific change in the source concept neighbours over the total of each MCO. For instance, 0.89% of source concepts of unchanged mappings have at least one neighbour concept added and active.

The results indicate that there is not a strong correlation between changes affecting neighbour concepts and MCOs. The Unchanged (%) column indicates that at least one neighbour did not change when the mappings changed and when the mappings remained unchanged.

Although unchanged neighbour concepts are the most frequent case, which seems to have no effect, further investigation is required to study the context in more detail. These results prompted us to investigate other possible influences of the context of the source concept on mapping evolution. We feel a more thorough analysis is necessary to better identify different situations in which context has an influence, e.g., sibling concepts; this is not covered in the present experiments.

In this Section we present the MCO–MCO experimental analyses conducted which includes a quantitative analysis (Section 5.1) followed by a qualitative discussion of particular cases (Section 5.2).

We investigate here the correlations between MCOs and concepts sharing structural properties. The performed experiments aim to identify possible influence of the context (concepts sharing structural properties) of the source concept on mapping evolution. It is possible to have situations where mappings may be changed due to a combination of KOS changes, regardless of whether there is some kind of influence (dependence) between them. For instance, one concept’s attribute modified plus one new concept led to a change in the source concept of the mapping. In this analysis we are interested only in observations about the behaviour of couples of mappings. In particular, we search for correlations between MCOs involving two mappings. These mappings might share equal and unchanged target concepts, and their source concepts must share structural properties. We observed concepts having an is_a relationship between them and sibling concepts in the sense that they share a “Super” concept. The proposition is to understand how KOS changes affecting concepts with these kinds of structural relationships may influence the evolution of associated mapping between the concepts involved. We consider different combinations of MCOs to assess which situations they occur in and observe whether there is a “pattern of change”.

The numbers in Table 10 represent the percentage of cases found in the different combinations with regard to total cases. For instance, in the combination of equal sets, 84.5% of the cases found were in the combination A′×
                           A′ with sibling relationships. The percentages are calculated independently for each distinct group of analysis.

Analysing the results for the first group, in most of the cases siblings concepts are found when mappings are added A′×
                           A′ compared to the other combinations of this group. This indicates that there are cases where, when two new mappings are added such that m
                           1
                           =(s
                           1, r
                           1, t) and m
                           2
                           =(s
                           2, r
                           2, t), s
                           1 and s
                           2 are sibling concepts. Few cases with respect to parent relationships are found (6.7%). Considering the previous m
                           1 and m
                           2 mappings, in these cases s
                           1 is the “Super” concept of s
                           2. This percentage is higher than those of the combination R′×
                           R′. In this combination, both types of structural properties have a slightly higher percentage for the type siblings. The results reveal few cases where only the super/sub (parent) concept property is found when analysing M

An analysis of the results of the second group reveals no cases for the parent structural property. All cases concern the sibling structural property, and most of them belong to R′×
                           A′, while no case was found when analysing

                            is of type OO, and in two-thirds of the cases r is of NB type. When analysing the b concept, we notice that this concept had minor changes (e.g., one description changed), and the mapping between b and d also changed. The value of r changed from NB to OO. We assume that the new mapping (c, r, d) is the consequence of adding the new concept c. However, further investigation is perhaps warranted to understand the reasons why the mapping (b, NB, d) changed its r value to OO. One possible explanation is that the mapping was strongly connected to the description that was modified. Thus, after evolution, NB is changed to OO in order to keep the semantic correspondence between b to d as valid.

We analyse cases of (R′×
                           A′), the most frequent in the second group. Fig. 4
                            presents two scenarios considering the concepts a, b, c and d (where only d belongs to a different KOS) before and after evolution of KOS
                           
                              A
                           . Fig. 4(a) shows the scenario before evolution where the concept b is mapped to d through relation r
                           1. After evolution, modifications affecting concepts and mappings are shown in Fig. 4(b). We notice that concept b is set to inactive and the mapping (b, r
                           1, d) is removed. The new concept c is mapped to d with the relation r
                           2. We found many cases where r
                           1 and r
                           2 were different. Among the 81.4% of (R′×
                           A′), in 13.3% of cases the relations r
                           1 and r
                           2 were of the type UN; in 13.3% of the cases r
                           1 and r
                           2 are OO; in 26.6% they are of the type NB; and in 26.6% of cases, r
                           1 is OO while r
                           2 is NB. The remaining cases, representing 20.2%, are exceptional cases where concepts b and c are unchanged while the mappings are removed and added as in Fig. 4(b). In these situations, there are also cases where r
                           1 and r
                           2 have distinct types. We can imagine that these are typical cases where mappings are curated by experts.

Considering the cases in Fig. 4, it is hard to identify direct correlations between changes in concepts and changes in mappings, as in the cases studied, concepts had the same change status, while mappings of different relation types were removed and created. It seems that further analysis of not only change in a concept’s status but also detailed KOS changes is necessary to better understand the evolution of mappings. This is what prompted the analysis presented in the following section. In the case where r
                           1
                           ≠
                           r
                           2 and b and c are sibling concepts, we must understand why they have different types of semantic relation, knowing that they are siblings.

After obtaining the previous results, we chose to devote this section to a qualitative analysis explaining some relevant cases. We select some cases of R′×
                        A′ and analyse the content of the concepts involved, along with the changes affecting them. This analysis aims to explore the existing relations between the changes affecting sibling concepts. For instance, we evaluate the content of a concept before and after the applied changes and searched for information that was transferred from one concept to another. These experiments attempt to identify with precision which context content could be used to establish the mappings. We highlight whether the mappings follow the related content after evolution. This analysis shows the role played by each concept involved and the details of the changes that occurred in the MCOs. Given their representativeness, four cases were selected and are described in the following:
                           Case 1
                           In this scenario, before SCT evolution, a concept is named ‘Primary malignant neoplasm of intrahepatic bile ducts (disorder)’, and there is a mapping of type OO that links this concept with the ICD concept named ‘Malignant neoplasm of Intrahepatic bile ducts’. Analysing the names, we found a partial match (one is a substring of the other). After evolution, the status of the SCT concept changed to ambiguous (i.e., it is no longer active), but a new active and sibling concept is added in SCT. We observed that this new sibling concept has the same name as the inactive concept in SCT. In this case, the type OO mapping that linked the inactive concept in SCT with the ICD concept is now linking the new sibling concept with the same target ICD concept and with the same relation type (i.e., OO). This case shows that a substitution of concepts occurred and that the associated mapping was transferred to the new sibling concept while maintaining the same type of semantic relation.

Before evolution, a concept from SCT has the name ‘High density lipoid deficiency (disorder)’ and is equivalent to the ICD concept named ‘Lipoprotein deficiencies’. Note that there is a certain degree of similarity between both names, although it is not an exact match. After evolution, the status of the SCT concept changed to ambiguous (i.e., it is no longer active), but a new active and sibling concept was added to SCT. The name of this new sibling concept is slightly different from the latter concept: ‘High density Lipoprotein deficiency (disorder)’. The descriptions also changed. We observe that the mapping evolves as in Case 1, i.e., it keeps the same relation type (OO) and links the new concept with the same target concept in ICD. This case also indicates a substitution of concepts in SCT, and the associated mapping was transferred to the new sibling concept while maintaining the same type of semantic relation.

Before evolution, the SCT concept named ‘Cutaneous histiocytoma (disorder)’ is defined as more specific than the ICD concept named ‘Benign neoplasm of skin, site unspecified’. Note that there is no exact match between the names, but semantically the concept in SCT can be considered to be more specific than the one of ICD. After evolution, the status of the SCT concept changed to duplicated (i.e., it is no longer active), but a new sibling concept named ‘Pleomorphic fibroma (disorder)’ was added. Analysing the content of the descriptions of the inactive concept, we observe that there is one description describing the concept as a ‘Pleomorphic fibroma’ (a synonymous term of the inactive concept). This description becomes the name of the new sibling concept. The mapping of NB type is now linking the new sibling concept with the same target concept of ICD. This case also reveals a substitution of concepts but with a different label (using a synonymous term). As occurred in the other cases, the associated mapping was transferred to the new sibling concept while retaining the same type of semantic relation.

Before evolution, the SCT concept named ‘Chest deformity (finding)’ was equivalent to the ICD concept named ‘Acquired deformity of chest and rib’. There is no exact match between both names, but there is some similarity. One description of the SCT concept describe it as ‘Deformity of thorax’, which is a synonym of the concept. After evolution, the status of the SCT concept changed to ambiguous, but a new sibling concept named ‘Deformity of thoracic structure (disorder)’ is added. The description of the inactive concept has a high degree of similarity with the name of the new sibling concept. Particularly in this case, the mapping is transferred to the new sibling concept, and its semantic relation is set to NB. Thus, ‘Chest deformity’ was considered to be equivalent to the ICD concept ‘Acquired deformity of chest and rib’, but now the new concept ‘Deformity of thoracic structure (disorder)’ is considered semantically more specific than the ICD concept. This case shows that substitution between sibling concepts did occur, but modifications in the name affect the evolution of mappings. As in the other cases, the associated mapping was transferred to the new sibling concept but with a different semantic relation.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this article we studied the impact of KOS evolution on mappings over time. We characterised this impact through correlations between how the KOS evolved and the consequent changes in mappings. The goal was to establish the basis for defining an automatic mechanism to keep mappings valid at KOS evolution time. The correlations were studied using quantitative analyses of different KOS entities focused on their atomic changes. Preliminary qualitative analyses were performed to search for explanations that could not be obtained in the former analyses. The experiments conducted underline correlations between KOS evolution and mapping evolution. Defining these correlations more finely can be essential to designing an adequate automatic mapping maintenance mechanism. The main research questions addressed in this study are summarised in the following:
                        
                           •
                           
                              Are automatic mapping maintenance tools really necessary?
                           

Considering the number of changed mappings (cf. Table 1), we observed that they were multiplied by three over a two-year period. Human efforts required to update the mappings justify having automatic tools. When analysing the frequency of each MCO (cf. Table 2), we realised that addition and removal of mappings are predominant. We were expecting to find more changes in the relation of mappings (like for C
                              2).


                              What type of semantic relation in mappings should we deeply study?
                           

The five different types of relations expressed in mappings between SCT and ICD were the focus of this study (cf. Table 3 and Fig. 2). Relations of type OO and NB showed interesting behaviour. The increasing number of added mappings of type NB shows that SCT is becoming more precise than ICD which could be concluded about the KOS evolution. In general, we can evaluate the evolution of KOS (and the trends) by observing the evolution of their mappings.


                              What KOS changes are important to consider for mapping maintenance?
                           

The analysis of independent KOS changes shows the high frequency of added concepts (cf. Table 2) which reflects the high number of added mappings as a correlation evidenced in this study. New concepts may mainly require a KOS alignment strategy to establish new mappings. An addition of concepts (independently analysed) is not in the principal focus of our interest because mapping maintenance refers to keeping existing mappings up-to-date. However, even though other KOS changes are less frequent, they can directly impact on existing mappings as in the case of concept removal. KOS changes concerning the attributes in general (e.g., concept’s status and descriptions) are also relevant.


                              Are there specific types of change in the source concept that can be the main reason for specific changes in mapping?
                           

The analysis of changes in the entities of the source concept (cf. Tables 5 and 6) allows to conclude that mapping removal mainly occurs when the status of concepts or their descriptions changes to inactive. However, we did not observe any clear correlation between changes in SCT entities and modifications in the semantic relation of mappings between KOSs (i.e., M
                              
                                 t
                              , M
                              
                                 r
                               and M
                              
                                 t_r
                              ). The complexity of the maintenance process may force a knowledge engineer to exclude this case.


                              Can KOS changes on the relationships and neighbour concepts of the concept source impact the mapping evolution?
                           

Results from Tables 8 and 9 mainly reveal that Super and Sub concepts have high and low impact on the mappings evolution respectively. But, this difference can be justified by the “control concepts”, in which concepts are linked after having been assigned an inactive status (i.e., the Super relationship is changed). The analysis of neighbour concepts shows a low impact on the mapping evolution. However, in specific cases, we show a correlation between KOS changes and mappings evolution.


                              Can we identify a correlation if we analyse the combination of two MCOs where the source concepts share a structural property?
                           

In order to verify if, for example, one mapping was deleted because another mapping was created (characterising a move of mapping), we combined different MCOs and analysed if the source concepts of each mapping share some structural property (Table 10). This analysis indicated a potential correlation between MCOs and KOS evolution.

In a more general way, the facts revealed by the results in the MCO–MCO change analyses show that only considering simple atomic KOS changes over source concepts does not yield enough information to determine the impacts that changes in KOS can have on mappings. It has been shown that adapting mappings only based solely on this information is insufficient because it can conceal potential interdependence between mappings change operations. Deeper analyses of this interdependence is necessary in cases where KOS changes can be also represented as a composition of atomic changes having a semantic meaning, e.g., a substitution, merge or split of concepts. It could provide richer information so mappings can be adapted adequately. Based on a preliminary qualitative analysis of the cases, we detected potential influence of complex KOS changes, and a deeper qualitative study would shed more light on this. Moreover, the four cases selected are real examples in which mapping removals and additions are combined into a more complex procedure for adapting mappings in case of a KOS complex change. The experiment mainly centred on concept substitution, but it is also possible to imagine other types of complex KOS changes, such as the split and merge of concepts in which a set of combined atomic MCOs might take place in a meaningful way influenced by the underlying KOS change.

Further refined correlations will require additional experiments from a qualitative point of view, and different individual cases of mapping evolution must be examined so conclusions can be drawn. These might highlight other elements that must be taken into consideration for understanding why mappings have changed. Contextual information regarding KOS complex changes may have varying influence on how changes occur in mappings. Consider, for instance, the structural organisation of the concepts resulting from a split change operation. Therefore, it is very important that further information be obtained on the changes affecting concepts associated with mappings, and this issue remains to be further investigated. Thus, a complementary study to the present investigation could be envisaged to examine the influence of KOS complex changes involving mappings’ source concept. This could further our understanding of mapping evolution and how to best perform it, and as automatically as possible. In addition to the results provided in this article, these contextual factors of KOS changes can be key elements in the design of a solution capable of adequately handling the adaptation of mappings over time.

Although this study was conducted considering only two KOSs, there are evidences concerning the generalizability of the experiments. Firstly, we explored the basic ontological and structural properties of the SCT which is similar to many other biomedical KOSs like NCI Thesaurus and Gene Ontology, for instance. Any further formal or specific particularity of KOS is necessary to perform the experiments. Secondly, SCT and ICD are underlined by different KOS models and present significant differences in terms of granularity of the KOS which is very common in the KOSs of the biomedical domain. In this sense, the designed experiments could be easily carried out with other biomedical KOSs and the achieved results of the this study contrasted against that.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Now more than ever, biomedical KOSs play a pivotal role in allowing better organisation and exploration of the overwhelmingly voluminous data available in this domain. Semantic mappings established between them are necessary and play a crucial role in supporting various tasks in software applications. However, due to the rapid evolution of the biomedical KOSs, existing mappings become obsolete and unreliable over time. Hence, there is a clear need to keep mappings up-to-date as automatically as possible as KOS’s evolve. Despite the practical benefits of tackling such problem, it continues to be a complex, ongoing research challenge, and very few studies attempt to understand the correlations between changes affecting KOS entities and changes in associated mappings. In this article we conducted a set of experimental analyses observing official mappings between SCT and ICD in view of understanding their evolution. Correlations were thus identified which pave the way towards defining an automatic mechanism for semantic mapping evolution.
