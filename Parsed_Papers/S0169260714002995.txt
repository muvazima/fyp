                  The cure fraction models have been widely used to analyze survival data in which a proportion of the individuals is not susceptible to the event of interest. In this article, we introduce a bivariate model for survival data with a cure fraction based on the three-parameter generalized Lindley distribution. The joint distribution of the survival times is obtained by using copula functions. We consider three types of copula function models, the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM), Clayton and Gumbel–Barnett copulas. The model is implemented under a Bayesian framework, where the parameter estimation is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To illustrate the utility of the model, we consider an application to a real data set related to an invasive cervical cancer study.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Scientific articles in the health field involving time-to-event data commonly utilize statistical hypothesis tests, such as the log-rank or Wilcoxon non-parametric tests to compare survival curves [1], or the Cox proportional hazard model [2] to analyse the effects of independent variables on the survival time. However, more complex situations may require more complex statistical modelling. As a special case, there are practical situations for which a fraction of individuals is not expected to experience the event of interest, while the traditional approaches for survival analysis assume that all individuals under study are susceptible to the event and will timely experience it if followed by a sufficiently long period. For such cases, the survival regression models in presence of a cure fraction are a good option to be fitted by the data [3]. Many papers have been introduced in the literature related to this type of model. In this way, Farewell [4] introduced a mixed-model analysis based on the maximum likelihood method considering data with long-term survivors. Kuk and Chen [5] proposed a generalization of Farewell's model [4] using a Cox proportional hazards model for the susceptible individuals, and Sy and Taylor [6] introduced a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the regression parameters in this model assuming a non-parametric form of the likelihood and an EM algorithm. Chen and Ibrahim [7] introduced maximum likelihood methods for parameter estimation of semiparametric survival models with a cure fraction, in which the covariates are allowed to be missing.

Parametric cure fraction models were introduced by authors such as Cantor and Shuster [8], based on the Gompertz distribution. Lambert et al. [9] extended the cure fraction model based on the Weibull distribution to incorporate background mortality rates so that the cure fraction can be modelled in population-based cancer studies. More recently, many authors have developed parametric models based on distributions with more than two parameters. As recent examples in this direction, we can mention the extended family of the generalized gamma distribution [10] and the generalized modified Weibull distribution [11,12]. Some common distributions used in lifetime data analysis are special cases of these generalized distributions which can provide a considerable flexibility to fit many different shapes for the hazard function.

The presence of multivariate lifetimes [13,14] subjected to censoring and cure fractions is other aspect of survival analysis that has drawn attention of many researchers. In medical applications, we can find several situations involving multiple time-to-event data, such as the classical example of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study reported by Huster et al. [15], a study aimed to analyse the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation in delaying the onset of blindness in patients with diabetic. One eye of each patient was randomly selected to receive a treatment and the other eye was observed without treatment. Thus, the event of interest is the time of loss of visual acuity in each of the eyes of the patients. In the statistical literature, this data set was used by many authors to illustrate the use of new approaches to modelling bivariate time-to-event data [16–18]. Recently, copula models have become widely used for modelling multivariate survival data [9,17,19–22]. In a simplified sense, copulas are functions that connect univariate distribution functions to form a multivariate distribution [23].

In the present article, we introduce a bivariate model for survival data based on the three-parameter generalized Lindley distribution [24] in presence of cure fraction and censored data. Under a Bayesian approach, this model is based on copula functions and the parameter estimation is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods. In Section 2, we describe the Lindley distribution, its three-parameter generalization and the bivariate mixture cure fraction model based on this distribution. In Section 3 we describe the Bayesian analysis for the proposed model. In Section 4 we introduce a real data set obtained from an invasive cervical cancer study and the obtained results of the Bayesian analysis for this data considering the proposed model. We also consider the application of the model to the data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study reported by Huster et al. [15]. In Section 5 we present a discussion of the obtained results.

The one parameter Lindley distribution was introduced in 1958 as a useful tool to analyse lifetime data in modelling stress-strength reliability applications [25]. This distribution is specified for the lifetime T by the probability density function

                         plots the survival and hazard functions of the Lindley distribution for some parameter values. The statistical properties of the Lindley distribution were studied by Ghitany et al. [26], including their moments, characteristic function and maximum likelihood estimation. These authors also showed that this distribution could be better fitted by some data sets when compared to the standard one parameter exponential distribution. In recent years, the Lindley distribution has been receiving the interest of many authors. Gupta and Singh [27] studied the problem of estimation of the parameters of the Lindley distribution in presence of hybrid censored lifetimes. Mazucheli and Achcar [28] introduced a competing risk model assuming that the causes of failures follow a Lindley distribution. Krishna and Kumar [29] discussed the estimation of the parameter of the Lindley distribution considering data subject to a progressive type-II censoring scheme. Shanker et al. [30] proposed a two-parameter Lindley distribution for modelling waiting and survival times data.

In a recent paper, Zakerzadeh and Dolati [24] introduced a three-parameter family of distributions which generalizes the Lindley distribution. The generalized Lindley distribution is a continuous random variable with probability density function given by

In Fig. 2
                        , we have the plots of the hazard function h
                        0(t) of the generalized Lindley distribution for different parameter values. We can note that h
                        0(t) is increasing for α
                        ≥1 and β
                        >0; h
                        0(t) is bathtub shaped for α
                        <1 and β
                        >0; h
                        0(t) is decreasing for α
                        <1 and β
                        =0, and h
                        0(t) is constant for α
                        =1 and β
                        =0. In this way, we have a great flexibility of fit.

Alternatively, non-mixture cure fraction models were proposed by Tsodikov et al. [31], but these models are beyond the scope of this paper. Many works on modelling survival data long-term survivors are introduced in the literature, and interested readers can refer, for example, to Achcar et al. [32], Cancho et al. [33], Maller and Zhou [34], Sposto [35], among many others.

                        2 associated to the same individual. From the expression (5), the marginal survival functions are given respectively by

Let us suppose that either T

                        2 can be censored and that censoring is independent of the time to the events considered by the study researchers. Considering a random sample of size n, each ith observation (i
                        =1, …, n) can be classified into one of four groups:

                                 ∈(0, 1] and ln is the natural logarithm. We note that when λ takes the zero value, we have independence between the lifetime times. The GB copula covers a region of negative dependence, and the relationship between the dependence copula parameter λ and the Kendall correlation coefficient is written in terms of an exponential integral function, which must be evaluated numerically [45].

Considering the proposed bivariate model, let

                     =(α

                        ν
                      given by Eq. (12). To simulate samples of the joint posterior distribution we could have a great computational simplification using some existing MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithms implemented in the OpenBUGS software, where we only need to specify the distribution for the data and the joint prior distribution for the parameters. For a Bayesian analysis of the model, we assume independent gamma prior distributions for the parameters α

                     2 and β
                     2. Thus, we have

                     . A generalized beta is a distribution with a density given by a standard beta density ranged in an interval not necessary equals to [0,1]. We also assume that the dependence parameter λ follows a uniform prior distribution (1−
                     λ)/2∼

                     ) when considering the FGM and GB copula functions. This choice assures that λ
                     ∈(−1, 1). When considering the Clayton copula function, we assume λ
                     ∼
                     Gamma(c

                        λ
                     ). Note that c
                     
                        λ
                      and d
                     
                        λ
                      are known hyperparameters. We also assume independence among the parameters included in the model. The joint prior distribution π(
                        ν
                     ) is hence given by the product of the densities of the prior distributions for the parameters included in the model.

Based on the Bayes theorem, the joint posterior distribution is obtained by combining the likelihood function (12) with the joint prior distribution π(ν). The joint posterior distribution is not analytically tractable, but posterior summaries of interest can be readily obtained using MCMC methods. In our applications we generated 1,010,000Gibbs samples for each parameter, where the first 10,000 simulated samples were discarded as a burn-in period, which is used to minimize the effect of the initial values. In addition, we store each 100th simulated sample to avoid autocorrelation between successive samples. The median of the simulated values for a given parameter was used as a point estimate for that parameter, since some simulated distributions were quite skewed. The 95% credible intervals were also determined for each parameter on the basis of the upper and lower 2.5% quantiles of the corresponding simulated values. Convergence was monitored by plotting trace and autocorrelation plots of the samples and also using some existing Bayesian convergence methods.

Comparison between models assuming different formulations was assessed by the deviance information criteria (DIC), a measure of model fit introduced by Spiegelhalter et al. [47]. Lower values of DIC indicate better model fit. The DIC value is computed as

In this subsection, we present an application of the proposed model to real medical data from a published study that included a total of 148 women diagnosed and treated for invasive cervical carcinoma between 1992 and 2002. The interested reader should consult Brenna et al. [49] for further details of this data set. In the present study, we consider a subsample of 118 women who received the standard treatment recommended by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the date of surgery to the first event of disease recurrence and the overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of surgery to the death. Thus, let T
                        1 and T
                        2 be two random variables denoting the DFS and the OS times, respectively.


                        Table 1
                         shows that we have 48.3% of censored data if we consider the DFS time and 53.4% of censored data if we consider the OS time. We also observe that 48.3% of the data are censored in regard to both DFS and OS times. There are no patients with both censored data at the DFS time and completed data at the OS time.

Firstly, we fitted univariate models separately for DFS and for OS times, considering the generalized Lindley, gamma and standard Lindley distributions, with and without the cure fraction p. These models are based on the likelihood function given by the expression (7), where the baseline probability density function f
                        0(t) is given by (1) and the baseline survival function S
                        0(t) is given by Eq. (2). Assuming prior independence among the parameters, consider the following prior densities for α, θ and β: α
                        ∼
                        Gamma(1, 1), θ
                        ∼
                        Gamma(1, 1) and β
                        ∼
                        Gamma(1, 1). When included, the cure fraction follows a beta distribution specified by p
                        ∼
                        Beta(1, 1). We must also remember that the model based on the gamma distribution considers β
                        =0 and the model based on the standard Lindley distribution considers α
                        =1 and θ
                        =1. Posterior summaries for these univariate models considering the DFS time (T
                        1) are shown in Table 2
                        , and considering the OS time (T
                        2) are shown in Table 3
                        . A brief sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of various choices for the hyperparameters of the priors on α, θ and β, such as gamma prior distributions specified by Gamma(1, 0.1), Gamma(0.1, 0.1) and Gamma(1, 0.001), but only small changes were observed in the results. In some cases, when we considered prior distributions with larger variances for α, θ and β, even increasing the number of samples and thinning interval used in the simulation procedure to get samples of the joint posterior distributions, we could not get convergence of the chains.

The results given in Tables 2 and 3 show that the models with a cure fraction have lower DIC values, suggesting that the addition of a cure fraction parameter improve the fit for the considered data. The graphs in Fig. 3
                         show the Kaplan–Meier estimates for the survival functions considering the DFS and OS times and the survival functions obtained from the fit of the univariate models (results in Tables 2 and 3), according to the generalized Lindley distribution and its special cases. We note that the survival curves associated to the models that include the cure fraction are the closest to the empirical values obtained from Kaplan–Meier estimates.


                        Table 4
                         shows results for the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution and the copula functions, also including the independence copula. The independence copula is the simplest copula function and it corresponds to S
                        012(t
                        1, t
                        2)=
                        C
                        
                           λ
                        (S
                        01(t
                        1), S
                        02(t
                        2))=
                        S
                        01(t
                        1)S
                        02(t
                        2), similar to the FGM copula when λ
                        =0. Table 4 also exhibits Bayesian estimates for the dependence parameter λ considering the FGM, Clayton and GB copulas, but it is important to observe that λ has different interpretations depending on the copula function and thus it is not comparable between the models based on different copulas. When comparing the models, Table 4 shows that the models that assume dependence between the indicator random variables V
                        1 and V
                        2 of susceptible individuals have lower DIC values, suggesting that the addition of the parameter ω improves the fit for the data. We also observe that the estimates for the parameters ϕ
                        00, ϕ
                        01, ϕ
                        10 and ϕ
                        11 are quite different if we compare the models that include and do not include the dependence between the indicator random variables V
                        1 and V
                        2. Considering independence between the cure fractions, the Bayesian estimates for ϕ
                        00, ϕ
                        01, ϕ
                        10 and ϕ
                        11 are close to 13%, 24%, 22% and 41%, respectively. However, when including the parameter ω in the models, the estimates for ϕ
                        00, ϕ
                        01, ϕ
                        10 and ϕ
                        11 are close to 39%, 3%, 0.7% and 56%, respectively. These results may appear more clinically plausible considering the frequencies in Table 1, although censored data do not necessarily correspond to cure fractions. However, this argument reinforces that the models that include the covariance parameter ω are more suitable to the data compared to other specifications.

In addition to these points, we also note in Table 4 that the models based on the Clayton copula are the models with the lowest DIC values. It is important to point out that FGM copulas can only model relatively weak positive dependence [23], while Clayton copulas exhibits strong left tail dependence and relatively weak right tail dependence [50]. Gumbel–Barnett copulas are suitable to represent situations with weak and negative dependence. However, negative dependence is not a usual characteristic of survival times. Perhaps for these reasons, in the present study the model based on the Clayton copula is the most suitable to the data set.

In the plots in Fig. 4
                         we compared the survival functions for the DFS and OS times estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival curves obtained from the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution (results in Table 4). We can note in Table 4 that the Bayesian estimates for α
                        1, θ
                        1 and β
                        1 are quite similar when compared between the models based on the different copula functions. Consequently, in the graphs (a) and (c) in Fig. 4, the survival curves based on the different copula functions are relatively close. We observe in Table 4 that the Bayesian estimates for α
                        2, θ
                        2 and β
                        2 showed a greater variability among the considered copula functions.

In this subsection we consider the copula-based Bayesian approach presented in the previous sections in the estimation of parameters of interest for the data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study [15], where the objective was to assess the efficacy of photocoagulation treatment for proliferative retinopathy. The main endpoint of this study is severe visual loss in each eye. Thus, let T
                        1 and T
                        2 be two random variables denoting the time up to visual loss for the control eye and the time up to visual loss for the treatment eye, respectively.

In the Bayesian analysis, the choice of the prior distributions was similar to that of the previous application. Table 5
                         shows results for the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution and the different copula functions. As in the previous application example, Table 5 shows that the models that assume dependence between the indicator random variables V
                        1 and V
                        2 of susceptible individuals have lower DIC values, except for the Clayton copula, where the DIC value does not change. This suggests that the addition of the parameter ω improves the fit for the data. In the plots in Fig. 5
                         we compared the survival functions for the T
                        1 and T
                        2 times estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival curves obtained from the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution (results in Table 5). We can note that the estimated survival curves considering the independence and GB copula are very close to each other, almost overlapping in the graphs.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Bivariate lifetime data is very common in many application areas as in medicine or in engineering studies. Usually, researchers in these areas assume some existing parametric bivariate lifetime distributions obtained as generalizations of the popular exponential distribution (see for example, Block and Basu [51], Marshall and Olkin [52], Sarkar [53] or Gupta and Kundu [54]). In this paper, we introduced a flexible modelling approach based on the generalized Lindley distribution and standard existing copula functions to analyse bivariate lifetime data in presence of censoring and cure fraction a common situation in medical studies.

Usually, classical inferences approaches for the parameters of this family of parametric models could be difficult and not very accurate using standard maximum likelihood estimation approach since the likelihood function could become very complex, especially in the presence of censored data and cure fraction. Other problem in this approach: hypothesis tests and confidence intervals usually are obtained using asymptotical results as the asymptotical normality of the maximum likelihood estimates which are very dependent on large sample sizes and proportion of censored data. In this way, the use of a Bayesian approach, especially using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) simulation methods is a suitable way to get the inferences of interest for the parameters of the new proposed models. It is also important to point out that the use of free available software like the popular OpenBUGS software gives a great simplification to obtain the posterior summaries of interest.

In the application of the proposed methodology introduced in Section 4, we observe that assuming some special copula functions and the generalized Lindley distribution, we obtained good fit of the proposed bivariate lifetime distribution for the bivariate lifetime data in presence of censoring and cure fraction. This fact was observed using standard Bayesian discrimination methods as the DIC criterion or by comparisons of the plots of the estimated marginal survival functions based on the bivariate lifetime distribution with the nonparametric Kaplan–Meier estimates of the survival functions for each lifetime.

It should be noted from the results of our study that the model based on the Clayton copula gave better fit for bivariate lifetime data, given that the FGM copula function is only appropriate to model weak dependences and the GB copula is appropriate to model negative dependences. Another very important result obtained in our study: the usual assumption of independence between the binary random variables V
                     1 and V
                     2 denoting the indicators of susceptible individuals for each lifetime assumed in medical studies could not be appropriate as it was observed in the application introduced in Section 4. In this way, we observed that assuming dependence between the random variables V
                     1 and V
                     2 by the introduction of the parameter ω denoting the covariance between V
                     1 and V
                     2 resulted in much better fit of the proposed model for the data set. These results could be of great interest in applications.
