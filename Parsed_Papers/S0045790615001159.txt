                  This article presents a new method for detecting objects on waters’ surfaces using colour elimination based on image erosion with a morphological variable. The proposed object detection method includes definitions of the target’s colour space and colour deviation using Euclidean distance. It also introduces a procedure for image erosion using a morphological variable. In order to evaluate the proposed object detection method, the experiments were performed on two different image databases: the MSRA (Microsoft Research Asia) salient object database and a proprietary image database containing pictures of water activities typically encountered near hydro power plants. The experimental results show that the proposed object detection method enables efficient and robust detection of objects on of waters’ surfaces, compared to other methods primarily based on the optimisation of image contrast and edge detection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Detecting objects on waters’ surfaces, especially vessels and driftwood, is an increasingly important problem, particularly in the area of automatic surveillance systems [1] such as those in the vicinity of hydro power plants. As with many other automatic surveillance systems [2], hydro power plants and their vicinities are covered with video cameras and equipped with video surveillance systems. Nowadays, many hydro power plants are remotely controlled from control centres, and any system capable of detecting objects on waters’ surfaces, especially vessels and driftwood, using an existing video surveillance system onsite would therefore be of great interest. Navigation on rivers within the vicinity of hydro power plants is problematic, not only because of direct threats from outside persons but also due to the potential for various work-related consequences that can pose a serious risk to the power plants themselves. These consequences range from negligible events to those that can seriously endanger the functioning of the power plant for a certain period of time and threaten the safety of the persons involved. In the surroundings of a hydro power plant, there are defined areas in which any kind of river navigation is prohibited. In the accumulation pool areas, however, some sports activities such as boating, rafting, swimming, driving motorboats and so on take place. These can cause grave problems in cases when a person or object is swept away towards the hydro power plant. If we could detect and recognise these kinds of objects by automatic means, we would be able to adequately warn the crew at the guidance centre, who could take appropriate action. The second issue is the detection of driftwood, which, like navigation, can present serious problems for those working at hydro power plants. Driftwood is a relatively serious problem in hydro power plant areas, especially during times of increased river flow, because it demands regular cleaning of the entrance grids of turbine flows and the removal of driftwood from barriers.

Several methods of object detection on waters’ surfaces or on other complex backgrounds have been introduced in the past based on the optimisation of image contrast and other procedures. Some of these methods [3,4] use contrast or multiple difference images as one of the key features for distinguishing objects from their backgrounds. Robust detection of objects within a complex background is an appealing task, especially in real-life situations such as surveillance systems in all-weather situations. Detecting objects on waters’ surfaces can be regarded as a complex background problem, especially considering the variability of water surfaces due to various weather conditions, lighting, water colour changes, etc.

A number of object detection methods dealing with complex backgrounds have been introduced in the past. In order to achieve better results, many of these methods use edge detection [5–7] as part of their method for detecting objects, while some methods [8,9] use contrast optimisation for improved edge detection. Several methods for object detection or for the detection of moving objects are based on extracting objects from their backgrounds [10–13]. Nowadays, many state-of-the-art methods deal with salient object detection [14–19], which is generally defined as the detection of that which captures human perceptual attention. The Colour Elimination method based on Image Eroding using a Morphological Variable (CEIEMV), as proposed in this article, combines all of the aforementioned approaches.

The present paper is organised as follows. A definition of the base colour value, which is specific for each application domain within which the proposed method could be used, is given next in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 defines colour deviation, in which pixel-based image processing is performed. The result of colour deviation calculation is a table of values of individual pixels. Section 2.3 describes the definition of the threshold value. All of the values of the individual pixels that do not satisfy border criteria and do not fall into a specific colour space are eliminated from further processing and are considered to be useless. Section 2.4 provides the definition of a morphological variable with which we can later, during the procedure of eroding specific colour segments, easily detect those elements within the image that actually present the objects for detection. After the erosion procedure, we obtain a created mask that contains the elements of the defined colour space. By eliminating these areas, we extract the object that we want to detect from its original image (Section 2.5). Definitions of boundary conditions, parameters and edge conditions are given in Section 3. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform a comparison with selected methods (Section 3.2) using the MSRA (Microsoft Research Asia) salient object database [14] and a proprietary image database containing pictures of various water activities. The experimental results for the proposed method and the comparison of the results with the results of other methods are given in Section 4.

The proposed object detection method (Fig. 1
                     ) encompasses the phases of defining the colour space, colour deviation using Euclidean distance, transformation of the image into a grey image, borders, thresholding, and image erosion using morphological variables.

The term colour space represents a complex description of colour spectra that is distinctive for a specifically observed image area. This method enables adjustment of the base colour space [21] by defining different base colours, thus allowing the use of a wide colour spectrum.

                         are the values for each of the three coloured channels. Definition of the base colour values is obtained by experimental tests and is based on images from the image database used in these experiments.

The Euclidean distance [21] measurement is used to define a table of colour deviations for individual pixels (used later for the definition of thresholds for the elimination of specific pixels). The colour values for individual colour elements are defined as:
                           
                              
                                 RM,N

                                 (x, y)=value of the blue of the analysed pixel.

Using a previously defined base colour space, we mark the colour values of the pixel named Base with:

                                 =value of the green on the predefined pixel,

The Euclidean distance between points a and b within image I is the length of theline segmentconnecting them. The distance from a to b or from b to a is stated as:

                        (i) that individual pixels take in table T. The darker shades within the image represent those colour spaces that should be eliminated from the original image during the next step. After defining a colour deviation and RGB to luminosity, greyscale is performed (Fig. 4c) based on [26].

The definition of the threshold method anticipates the data-driven definition of threshold [22,24]. Let us assume that image I is a group of discrete values for brightness. The proposed threshold definition method, based on histogram analysis, uses an interpretation of the histogram image (Fig. 2). From this image, the method can estimate a threshold above which the values are 1 and below which the values are 0. This kind of thresholding translates a greyscale multilayer image into a double layer or binary image. The threshold method is defined as:

                        I(x, y) that do not reach the threshold value t and do not fall into a certain colour space are eliminated from further processing and denoted with the value 0. All of the values that reach the threshold value t are denoted with value 1. The binary image can be defined (Fig. 4d) based on these values. White colour – represented by the value 1 in Fig. 4e – represents the individual pixels P
                        =
                        I(x, y) that denote the appropriate result. Black colour – represented by the value 0 in Fig. 4d – represents the areas of individual pixels that are to be eliminated. From Fig. 4d, we can clearly see that during this phase we achieved the initial requirements of colour elimination. We can also see from Fig. 4d that, besides the eliminated object (seen as white colour), some additional elements exist that have reached the threshold value and are shown in the image as additional objects distributed across the image. These objects should be further eliminated from the final image.

By eroding the colour spaces using a morphological variable (24), we seek to additionally eliminate those areas from the image that do not represent the detected target object. In general, the erosion procedure [23,24,26] reduces the size of the object within the image on which the procedure is performed, as well as eliminating smaller anomalies.

Firstly, the structuring element, the morphological variable, is defined (Fig. 3
                        a).

The structuring element consists of a pattern, specified as a number of discrete points relative to a certain shape. The origin (the main pixel in the structuring element, marked as darker in Fig. 3a) is often at the centre of the structuring element. The structuring element, which is much smaller than the image, is itself a binary image and can be of different shapes.

In general, the erosion procedure of the image I(j, k) is expressed as:

                        meaning that the eroding of the image I(j, k) by the structuring element S(j, k) is the intersection of all of the translates of I(j, k) within which the row and column indexes of the pixels of the structuring element S(j, k) have the value 1 [23,25,32].

The erosion phase completely removes those objects smaller than the structural element from the binary image (Fig. 4
                        e), or removes the areas of single-detected points from the larger image objects. In the method of detecting objects on waters’ surfaces using colour elimination based on image erosion with a morphological variable, the erosion phase is defined as a procedure that, during the first step, erodes the image with a structuring element S(j, k) at an angle of 90°. During the second step, we again erode the image with the same element, but the angle is now 0° (Fig. 3b). The structuring element S(j, k) slides over the image I and transforms it in such a way that the origin is left as it is if a shape is the same as the structuring element, otherwise the pixel is set to black. If we compare the image after the erosion procedure (Fig. 4e) with the image after the thresholding phase (Fig. 4d), we can see that with the eroding procedure most of the image regions in the picture that were perceived as suitable have been removed after determining the threshold border phase.

By overlaying the defined mask on the original image, we extract the target objects from the basic image (Fig. 4f). All of the pixels Value
                           M

                           N
                         that have values 0 in the table were eliminated from the image – denoted as black in Fig. 4f – whereas the pixels with values 1 are shown in Fig. 4f in the form of a mask over the original image. We can see from Fig. 4f that we have eliminated the basic colour space from the image determined at the beginning. With the proper definition of colour deviation, we have successfully eliminated all shades of the base colour space representing the water’s surface in the basic image. Those pixel areas foreign to the target object were successfully removed after the image erosion process.

We will later compare the results of the proposed method with those of methods that use Sobel edge detection as part of the overall method [6,7], The Sobel edge detection method is applied over the masked part of image I (Fig. 4g). This procedure takes a binary image G, obtained after eroding image I, by using the morphological variable S as its input,

                        and returns a binary image of the same size as I, with values of 1 where the method finds edges and values of 0 elsewhere. If we compare the results of edge detection over the original image (Fig. 8 1b) with the final results from Fig. 4g, it is evident that the proposed method improves edge detection in a such way that the object’s shape clearly stands out from the original image. From Fig. 4, we can also clearly see that the proposed CEIEMV method (Fig. 4f) successfully eliminates all unsuitable pixels from the original image (Fig. 4a), and that the target object is successfully detected.

In the experimental setup, the image size was limited to 800×600 pixels, as this is the output image size of the images from which the image database containing pictures of water activities near hydro power plants was created. In addition, all of the other images in the MSRA image database used in the evaluation of the proposed method have the same size. The limitation of the image size did not affect the results of the method; therefore, any other image size could also be used.

                     (max) (14) are considered to be results that are over the threshold, which means that such pixels are suitable for further processing. In the case that a certain random pixel or a small number of pixels take values above 255 and are not considered as being appropriate for further processing, this colour space or individual pixel will be eliminated during the erosion phase.

The proposed CEIEMV method is designed in a Matlab development environment. The shape and size of the morphological structuring element (Fig. 3a) is selected based on extensive testing within the Matlab development environment, thus ensuring that the erosion procedure (25) provides the best results for further processing. Due to the proposed method’s modular design, the algorithm could easily be implemented in any other system. Furthermore, its simple design enables further improvement of results by incorporating additional modules where appropriate.

The proposed object detection method has been extensively tested and evaluated on two databases: the publicly available MSRA (Microsoft Research Asia) salient object database [14] and a proprietary image database containing pictures of water activities that typically take place near hydro power plants. The MSRA database contains 25,000 images in two separate image sets. Image set A contains 20,000 images with the ground truth manually labelled by three users, while image set B contains 5000 images with the ground truth manually labelled by nine users. The proprietary image database used for evaluation of the proposed method was collected from images that represent one of four groups of objects. It contains over 500 different images that represent scenes, vessels, driftwood and sports activities on waters’ surfaces, all of which are typically present in the vicinity of hydro power plants. The images were divided into four groups of objects (scenes of people in the water, vessels on the water’s surface, sport activities on the water’s surface, driftwood and other floating objects on the water’s surface). Besides the images showing different objects on the water’s surface, both databases also contain other images that do not contain water surfaces and that are used for evaluating the robustness of the proposed method.

Four different methods were compared with the proposed CEIEMV method. The first was the SED method (Sobel Edge Detection), which performed Sobel edge detection [7] on the original image. The second was the ALHV method (Auto Levelling Histogram Values), which enhanced the contrast [30] of the image by transforming the values within an intensity image, so that the histogram of the output image approximately matched a specified histogram. In the third method, the MLHV (Manually Levelling Histogram Values) method, the histogram [31] was manually levelled based on establishing upper and lower values. Liu [14] proposed an approach that learns to detect the salient object, and also constructed the MSRA image database. The salient objects are detected by combining their local, regional and global saliences with conditional random field learning. The fourth method used in the analysis was therefore the SOD (Salient Object Detector) method [14], based on Ordonez implementation [20].

As we will later also compare the results of the proposed method with methods that use Sobel edge detection as part of the overall method [6,7], Sobel edge detection is applied over the original image I (Fig. 4a).

A high-pass filter is applied on the image to detect whether there are changes presented at every pixel. The Sobel operator is the linear filter used for high-pass filtering over the image. It uses the following 3×3 masks:

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

This section discusses the efficiency of object detection using the proposed method, and provides a comparison with four methods, as described in the experimental setup section. The evaluation also encompasses analysis of the proposed method’s robustness to noise as well as its real-time performance.

This section presents the results regarding the proposed method based on the MSRA (Microsoft Research Asia) image database. The experiments were performed on the Intel (R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU with 8G RAM. The MSRA data set is mainly used for saliency detection and salient object extraction [15–19]. Fig. 5
                         shows the results of the proposed CEIEMV method on the MSRA data set.

As can be clearly seen in Figs. 1 and 5, the proposed method enables efficient and robust detection of objects on the waters’ surfaces as well as objects on some other backgrounds. These results were then compared with the methods described in the experimental setup: SED, ALHV, MLHV and SOD. The experimental results were divided into two groups, based on the comparable methods.

Firstly, the final object detection results (Fig. 6
                        ) with the proposed CEIEMV method are presented together with the ALHV, MLHV and SOD methods.

As can be seen in Fig. 6, in most cases the proposed method can achieve comparable or better results compared to the other methods. The SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results in all of the test examples. More detailed analysis clearly shows that, in the majority of cases, when dealing with complex backgrounds the proposed CEIEMV method provides better results than the other methods, based above all on the optimisation of image contrast and edge detection (ALHV, MLHV). Further analysis of the results for the two most successful methods, SOD and CEIEMV, shows that both methods achieved good object detection accuracy. However, it can be seen that they are designed for different purposes, and that the proposed CEIEMV method provides better results in the majority of cases.

The SOD method is designed to detect salient objects within images. It therefore has problems defining what a salient object is when dealing with multiple objects (4d in Fig. 6) within one image and when the object is set further back in the background. Furthermore, the proposed CEIEMV method is designed to detect objects on the surface of water and is optimised for dealing with these kinds of scenes. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the proposed method achieves the highest object detection rate and is also less sensitive than the SOD method to other disturbing elements such as shadows, reflections (3e and 7e in Fig. 6) and noise. If we further compare SOD (1d–7d in Fig. 6) and CEIEMV (1e–7e in Fig. 6), it can be seen that the proposed CEIEMV method distinctively enhances the edges of extracted objects, so that the detected object is eliminated from the image with as little surroundings as possible.

Next, the analysis focused on the edge detection capabilities of the methods, with the SED method being added to the group of methods being compared (Fig. 7
                        ). From the presented results, it is possible to see which of the methods is most successful in improving edge detection in such a way that the detected object stands out from the original image. Experimental results with the proposed CEIEMV method and the SED, ALHV, MLHV and SOD methods are presented below (Fig. 7).

As can be seen from Fig. 7, in most cases the proposed method achieved comparable or better results compared to the other methods. In Fig. 6, we can see that the SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results for almost all of the test examples. More detailed analysis clearly shows that the proposed CEIEMV method provides a greater level of detail of the detected object, so that it stands out more clearly from the original image. It can also be clearly seen that the proposed method is less sensitive to other disturbing elements, such as shadows or water reflections (3f, 3f, 7f in Fig. 7). As in Fig. 6, it can be seen that if we further compare SOD (1e–7e in Fig. 7) and CEIEMV (1f–7f in Fig. 7), the proposed CEIEMV method distinctively enhances the edges of the extracted object, resulting in the detected object being eliminated from the image with as little surroundings as possible.

This section presents the results regarding the proposed method based on the proprietary image database. Fig. 8
                         shows the results of image processing using the proposed CEIEMV method for different intermediate processing phases.

As can be clearly seen from Fig. 8, the proposed method enables efficient and robust detection of objects on the waters’ surfaces. Next, these results were compared with the four other methods: SED, ALHV, MLHV and SOD. As before, we divided the experimental results into two groups based on the comparable methods.

Firstly, the object detection results for all of the methods are presented in Fig. 9
                        .

As can be seen from Fig. 9, in most cases the SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results compared to the other methods. Further analysis showed that when dealing with complex backgrounds (images 4, 5, 7 in Fig. 9), the proposed CEIEMV method provided better results than the other methods. Here it can also be seen that the proposed CEIEMV method was less sensitive to other disturbing elements such as shadows or reflections when compared with the SOD method. It can be seen from images 4, 5, 7, 8 in Fig. 9 that the proposed CEIEMV method provided much better results than the SOD method when dealing with complex backgrounds, and also that the proposed CEIEMV method achieved higher object detection rates. It is also clearly evident that the CEIEMV method eliminated the objects from the image more effectively (4, 5, 7, 8 in Fig. 9), with as little surroundings as possible.

Secondly, we added the SED method and compared the experimental results for all of the methods based on edge detection. These results allowed us to determine which of the methods improved edge detection the most, thus enabling the detected object to stand out from the original image. The experimental results with the proposed CEIEMV method and the SED, ALHV, MLHV and SOD methods are presented in Fig. 10
                        .

As can be seen from Fig. 10, the SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results for almost all of the test examples. When considering only the first two methods (SED and ALHV), it can be seen that both methods performed similarly. One of the main reasons for the SED and ALHV methods being less successful than the other two methods was that the images in the image database showed activities on the surface of water, where the water’s surface was in most cases a rough area. When further comparing the MLHV and SOD methods with the proposed CEIEMV method, it can be clearly seen that SOD and the proposed CEIEMV method provided comparable or better results than the other methods, based above all on the optimisation of image contrast and edge detection. Further analysis showed that, when dealing with a complex background (images 4, 5, 7 in Fig. 10), the proposed CEIEMV method provided better results than the other methods. It can also be clearly seen that the CEIEMV method (column f in Fig. 10) eliminated the objects from the images (4, 5, 7, and 8 in Fig. 10) better than the SOD method (column e in Fig. 10) with as little surroundings as possible.

In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method to noise-corrupted images, Gaussian white noise was used to produce noise-corrupted images. The elimination of Gaussian white noise from digital images [27–29] is a very common problem nowadays. All of the images in the evaluation database were corrupted by the same noise (Figs. 11 and 12
                        
                        ). The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was used as the metric for noise-corruption strength. The PSNR was defined as:

                        N are the original image and the image corrupted by noise. The peak signal-to-noise ratio in our case was 29.48dB.

As can be seen from Figs. 11 and 12, the MLHV method (column c in Fig. 11 and column d in Fig. 12), which gave good results in the case of clear images, gave the worst results of all of the compared methods in the case of noise-corrupted images. This is due to the fact that the MLHV method lacks two of the very effective phases used in the proposed CEIEMV method: definition of colour deviation and erosion of colour spaces with a morphological variable. Considering only the first two methods (SED and ALHV), it can be seen in Fig. 12 that both methods performed similarly and that both lacked an erosion process that would eventually erase those pixels that are unsuitable as results.

As in Figs. 6, 7, 9 and 10, we can conclude that the SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results for almost all of the test examples. When further comparing the SOD and CEIEMV methods, the experimental results for noise corrupted images showed that the CEIEMV method provided good results when considering responses to noise in images compared to the SOD method. The results showed that the proposed CEIEMV object detection method enables efficient and robust detection of objects when considering noise-corrupted images.

In order to evaluate the real-time performance of the proposed method, in this section we measured the average time consumption.

From Figs. 6, 7 and 9–12, we can conclude that the SOD and CEIEMV methods gave better results for almost all of the test examples; only these two methods will therefore be compared in this evaluation. The experiments were performed on the Intel (R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU with 8G RAM. A total of 280 images (800×600 pixels) were used to evaluate the performance, each showing salient objects.

When comparing the SOD and CEIEMV methods, the minimum execution time with SOD was 573ms and the maximum execution time was 849ms. On average, the execution time with the SOD method was 692ms. The minimum execution time with the proposed CEIEMV method was 422ms and the maximum execution time was 836ms. On average, the execution time with the proposed CEIEMV method was 588ms. Total execution times varied, as the images had different backgrounds, objects and lighting. The above experimental results for real-time performance show that the CEIEMV method yielded results that were 15% better then those of the SOD method when considering real-time performance, this demonstrating that the proposed CEIEMV object detection method enables less time-consuming detection of objects.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new object detection method was proposed for detecting objects on waters’ surfaces. The proposed CEIEMV method uses colour elimination based on image erosion with a morphological variable for detecting objects on waters’ surfaces. It was demonstrated on two image databases (MSRA and a proprietary image database containing pictures of water activities) that the proposed CEIEMV method enabled efficient and robust detection of objects on waters’ surfaces, and that it could compensate for the high variability of water surface colours within different images. In the experimental results section, it was shown that the proposed CEIEMV method provides comparable and in most cases better results in comparison with the other methods referred to in this article. It was also shown that, when comparing two of the more successful methods (SOD and CEIEMV), the proposed CEIEMV method distinctively enhanced the edges of the extracted objects, so that detected objects could be eliminated from images with as little surroundings as possible, thus providing better results when detecting objects on waters’ surfaces. In further comparison of these two methods, it was also shown that the proposed CEIEMV method yielded 15% better results when considering real-time performance.
