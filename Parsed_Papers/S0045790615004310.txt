                  In this paper, a distributed base station cooperation-based handover management method is proposed for WiMAX Point-to-Multi-Point networks to provide quality of service to handover nodes. Moreover, a delay reduction method is proposed to reduce the packet delivery delays during handover. A Call Admission Control (CAC) algorithm is proposed to handle handover calls of various service classes fairly, according to their priorities. A bandwidth borrowing scheme is proposed to reduce the handover call dropping probabilities of various service classes while not starving the ongoing calls of lower priority service classes. A Markov model is developed to analyze the proposed CAC method and to obtain the approximate handover call dropping probabilities of various service classes. Simulation experiments are conducted to establish the performance advantages of the proposed handover management and CAC methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) technology and it is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. It provides high data rate services to last mile users. It supports two modes of deployment: Point-to-Multi-Point (PMP) and mesh mode [1]. In the PMP mode all Mobile Nodes/Subscriber Stations (MNs/SSs) are under the direct coverage of the Base Station (BS), whereas in the mesh mode, SSs/MNs, using their mesh connectivity property establish a wireless mesh among themselves to help each other in the data transmission and to extend the coverage area of the network.

In order to capture the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of various user applications and to provide prioritized data transmission, WiMAX defines five service classes namely Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), extended real-time Polling Service (ertPS), real-time Polling Service (rtPS), non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS) and Best Effort (BE). These service classes differ in their QoS parameters. UGS calls require fixed bandwidth allocations at regular intervals. BE service calls can access the radio resource if and only if some bandwidth remains after the completion of the bandwidth allocation of the other four service classes. The service class priorities of UGS, ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS and BE are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.

Handover management is an important research problem related to WiMAX networks. Consider the network diagram shown in Fig. 1
                     . Assume that a mobile node MN
                     1 is currently under the coverage area of BS
                     1 and moving towards the coverage area of BS
                     2. As MN
                     1 moves away from BS
                     1 and towards BS
                     2, it might happen that some time before the handover, during the handover and some time after the handover, none of the base stations (neither BS
                     1 nor BS
                     2) could be able to provide the full required data rate to MN
                     1. As MN
                     1 moves away from BS
                     1, the signal strength (SigS) it receives from BS
                     1 decreases. As a result BS
                     1 adopts a more robust level of Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) with a lower data rate to ensure error free data reception at MN
                     1. After its handover, MN
                     1 is at the border of the coverage area of BS
                     2. Similar to BS
                     1, BS
                     2 also adopts a more robust MCS level with a lesser data rate. As a result the QoS requirements of MN
                     1 are not fulfilled during the handover and for some time before and after the handover. In the remaining discussion, the two BSs involved in the handover of an MN are called as the old_BS and the new_BS. Old_BS is the currently serving BS of the MN and the new_BS is its serving BS after the handover. Also, the words “calls” and “flows” are used interchangeably.

The IEEE 802.16e amendment [2] of the IEEE 802.16 standard [1] gives a break-before-make hard handover protocol and this protocol does not provide QoS to MNs during their handover. In the literature some research contributions try to improve the performance of the handover method given in the IEEE 802.16 standard. Some methods [3] try to reduce the scanning delay of MNs by ensuring that the QoS requirements of the MNs can be fulfilled with the bandwidth available at the target BSs. According to these methods, data transmission to an MN takes place either through the old_BS or new_BS. But none of them [3,4] addresses the issue mentioned above. Consider a situation where neither the old_BS nor the new_BS can support the QoS requirements of the MN but both of them together can support. In such situations, if both the BSs participate in the data transmission, then they can support the QoS-constrained service flows of the MN. For that, the two BSs involved in the MN’s handover should coordinate in terms of the bandwidth allocations they make to the QoS-constrained flows of the MN.

Assume that the data rate requirement of a flow of an MN is b kbps. Further assume that the old_BS as well as the new_BS can provide only the data rate of b/2 kbps to the MN. In such a situation, both the old_BS and new_BS together transmit data to the MN. The old_BS provides the data rate of b/2 kbps and the new_BS provides the remaining data rate, that is, b/2 kbps to the MN to support its QoS requirements.

Cooperation between the old_BS and the new_BS of an MN can be achieved in two ways: centralized and distributed. Centralized Base Station Cooperation (BSC) is used in the literature for load balancing [5], throughput enhancement [6,7], capacity gain [8] and handover [9]. In a centralized cooperation method, a central controller handles all issues related to the handover and instructs actions to the BSs to provide QoS to the MN’s flows. It has SigS information of the BSs involved in the handover. Based on that information, it performs scheduling and generates universal uplink map (UL-MAP) and downlink map (DL-MAP) for all BSs involved in the handover [5]. Different from this method, the present paper proposes a distributed BSC method for WiMAX PMP networks, since a distributed approach is more practical and scalable than a centralized solution.

The most difficult part of the distributed solution is: the two BSs have to place their bandwidth allocations in the subframes (uplink and downlink) in such a way that the handover MNs should be able to switch to the respective channels of the BSs to avail their bandwidth allocations.

A novel delay reduction algorithm is another important contribution of this paper. It uses the fragmentation facility that is available in WiMAX to reduce the packet delivery delays during handover.

Another issue that contributes towards the QoS provisioning during handover is admission control of handover calls. Call Admission Control (CAC) module of a BS admits the calls of MNs that handover from the neighboring BSs. Some methods [10,11] are proposed in the literature for CAC in WiMAX PMP networks. These methods treat handover calls of various service classes equally. However, it is very important to provide certain priority to the handover calls of higher priority service classes. The CAC method proposed in this paper, admits handover calls of various service classes according to their priorities.

Some bandwidth borrowing schemes [10,12] are proposed to borrow bandwidth from the lower priority calls such as nrtPS and BE calls when sufficient free bandwidth is not available for admission of handover calls of higher priority service classes. These methods may lead to the starvation of nrtPS and BE calls when the handover call arrival rates of higher priority classes are high. The present paper proposes a bandwidth borrowing scheme which does not starve the ongoing calls of nrtPS and BE service classes.

In addition, in this paper, we develop a continuous-time Markov model to analyze the proposed CAC method. With this model, the approximate call dropping probabilities of various service classes are obtained.

To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are:

                        
                           (1)

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

This section discusses the related research work of the two issues (handover management and CAC in WiMAX networks) addressed in this paper. Some of the recent methods for handover in WiMAX are discussed below. Following that, the call admission control and scheduling algorithms proposed for WiMAX PMP networks are discussed.

There are some methods [3] in the literature that try to reduce the scanning delay involved in the handover process of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Unlike these methods, the proposed handover method tries to support the QoS-constrained flows of the MNs during their handover. That is achieved through the distributed coordination between the old_BS and the new_BS over the backbone.

The method proposed in [13], based on the reception times of DL-MAP messages from the serving BS and the neighboring BSs, identifies an MN’s location and the target BS for the handover of the MN. A velocity adaptive Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) selection method for handover is given in [4] to reduce the handover delay and wireless resources wastage. None of these methods try to provide QoS-constrained flows to the MNs during handover.

Central controller-based BSC technique is used in [5,6,8,9]. In [6], BSs perform cooperative transmission if and only if it enhances the downlink throughput of a user. In [8], BSC is used if the capacity gain of a user with BSC is more than the capacity loss of the other cell edge users. In spatial-multiplexed handoff scheme [9], each BS that participates in the handover of an MN transmits a sub-stream of the main stream. This handoff method was proposed for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular systems. In [5], BSC scheme is used for load balancing among the BSs participating in the handover of an MN. Cooperation between the macro BS and small-cell BS is exploited in [14] to provide multimedia data transmission to the users in an energy-efficient way. In [15], BSC has been suggested as a way to offload traffic from the on-grid BSs to the off-grid BSs so as to reduce the on-grid power consumption.

The BSC method proposed in the present paper differs from [5–9,14,15] in several ways. First, in this paper a delay reduction method is proposed to reduce the packet delivery delays of the flows of an MN during its handover. Second, in the BSC-based methods proposed in [5,6,8,9], a central controller is used to suggest actions for the BSs that participate in the cooperative data transmission of an MN. Different from these methods, the present paper proposes a distributed base station cooperation-based handover management method.

The CAC method proposed in [10], reserves a fixed number of channels exclusively for the admission of handover calls. This results in the wastage of bandwidth when the handover call arrival rate is low or nil. A bandwidth borrowing scheme is also proposed in [10]. This method does not provide delay guarantees to real-time calls, since CAC can borrow bandwidth from the ongoing real-time calls and it does not compensate the borrowed bandwidth. The CAC method proposed in [16] also uses the bandwidth borrowing scheme when enough bandwidth is not available to admit handover calls, but fails to address the fairness issue (see Section 3.2) while admitting the handover calls of various service classes.

Similar to the above discussed methods, the CAC methods proposed in [12,17–20] did not address prioritized handling of the handover calls of various service classes and also their bandwidth borrowing schemes may lead to the starvation of the lower priority calls sometimes. In contrast, the CAC method proposed in this paper gives handover calls of all service classes a fair chance to enter the network according to their service class priorities. Also, the proposed bandwidth borrowing scheme does not starve the lower priority calls. Different from the schemes proposed in [10,12,16], our proposed scheme never borrows bandwidth from the real-time calls and helps to reduce the handover call dropping probabilities of various service classes.

Different from the existing methods [21], our proposed scheduling method handles flows involved in the cooperative data transmission.

This section first discusses the data structures used by the BSs. Next, it explains the scheduling algorithm followed by that the proposed handover management and CAC methods.

                     . For the following discussion it is assumed that the two BSs involved in the handover of an MN are operating on the different channels. However, the proposed method is applicable when the BSs operate on the same channel as well.


                     Scheduling algorithm: The scheduling algorithm serves calls according to their service class priorities so that the QoS requirements of the higher priority service calls are fulfilled. It first schedules the UGS flows followed by the ertPS flows. Next, it tries to satisfy the requests of the rtPS flows. Then, it fulfills the minimum bandwidth requirements of the nrtPS calls, and after that if some bandwidth remains, then it allocates bandwidth to the requests of the nrtPS calls in a round robin fashion. If still some bandwidth remains, then it serves the requests of the BE calls in a round robin fashion.

Now, let us look at the scheduling process of the handover calls that are admitted at the new_BS. The scheduling algorithm allocates (maximum sustained rate – rate currently provided by old_BS) for the UGS and the ertPS calls and allocates (requested rate – rate currently provided by old_BS) for the rtPS calls. It allocates (minimum sustained rate – rate currently provided by old_BS) to the nrtPS calls and the fulfillment of the bandwidth requests of the nrtPS calls depends on the bandwidth availability at the new_BS.

This section explains the proposed modifications to the handover management method given in the IEEE 802.16 standard.

When MN
                        1 shown in Fig. 1 wants to perform handover, it follows the handover procedure given in the IEEE 802.16e [2]. It sends a MOB_MSHO-REQ (MN Handover Request) message to its currently serving BS, BS
                        1. After receiving the handover request, BS
                        1 selects the best new BS (BS
                        2 in Fig. 1) for MN
                        1 and sends MOB_BSHO-RSP (BS Handover Response). After receiving the response from BS
                        1, MN
                        1 starts the handover process by sending MOB_HO-IND (Handover Indication) message to BS
                        1. After receiving the MOB_HO-IND, BS
                        1 sends the call information of MN
                        1 to BS
                        2 through

                        1, then BS

Meanwhile, MN
                        1 performs handover from BS
                        1 to BS
                        2. From that point onwards both BS
                        1 and BS
                        2 coordinate among themselves over the backbone to continue QoS-constrained flows to MN
                        1, as explained in the next sections (Sections 3.3 and 3.4). MN
                        1 exchanges the management messages with BS
                        2 but sends/receives data to/from both the BSs.

This section explains the proposed CAC method and the proposed bandwidth borrowing scheme. While admitting the handover calls of UGS, ertPS and rtPS classes, the CAC module of the new_BS considers (maximum sustained rate – rate currently provided by old_BS) as their bandwidth requirement and (minimum sustained rate – rate currently provided by old_BS) as the bandwidth requirement of the nrtPS handover calls. BE calls are always admitted into the network. Handover call admission takes place after the completion of the scheduling of ongoing calls. Following the handover call admission, the new call admission takes place.

Step 1 (Fair bandwidth division strategy): Assume that, at a BS, after the completion of the scheduling, the remaining bandwidth is 
                           
                              r
                              _
                              b
                              w
                           
                        . The fair bandwidth division strategy of the proposed CAC method (CACm
                        ), divides this 
                           
                              r

The weights are assigned to various service classes to reflect their priorities as defined in the IEEE 802.16 standard. The amounts of bandwidth assigned to the four service classes are given by

Data transmission during the handover of an MN is a complex task, since the MN receives data from two BSs in the downlink and sends data to two BSs in the uplink which are operating on different channels. To schedule the calls of MN, at the old_BS, the scheduling algorithm uses the SigS and MCS level information stored in the

The old_BS sends this bandwidth allocation information to the new_BS over the backbone. Now it is the new_BS’s responsibility to transmit this bandwidth allocation information to the MN. Also, based on the received allocation information, the new_BS places its allocation for the same flow in a conflict-free manner. In order for the MN to switch between the channels of old_BS and new_BS, the old_BS places its bandwidth allocation at the beginning of an uplink/downlink subframe and the new_BS places its bandwidth allocation in the respective subframe in a conflict-free manner. Bandwidth allocation in the uplink during cooperative data transmission of MN
                        1 is shown in Fig. 2
                        .

In WiMAX networks, BSs periodically broadcast the Uplink Channel Description (UCD) and the Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) messages to announce the MCS levels to be used for the uplink and the downlink data transmission respectively. BSs select the downlink profiles for the MNs based on the channel feedback information received from the MNs. Once a profile is selected for an MN, it will be used in all upcoming frames until the next burst profile change.

                        1 shown in Fig. 2 and which is involved in the cooperative data transmission uses the Channel Quality Indicator CHannel to report the signal strengths of both BS

                        2 forwards the SigS information of BS
                        1 over the backbone to BS

                        . Based on the SigS information, both BS
                        1 and BS
                        2 change the MCS levels they use for MN
                        1. Whenever BS
                        1 changes the MCS levels of MN
                        1, it sends this information to BS
                        2 over the backbone which in turn sends that information to MN
                        1.


                        Downlink flows: Consider an MN which is involved in the cooperative data transmission for one of its downlink flows. After the handover and till the end of the cooperative transmission, the packets of the downlink flow reach the old_BS. The old_BS transmits some of these packets to the new_BS over the backbone. This division of packets between the two BSs is done in accordance with the data rates they provide to the MN. If the data rates that the old_BS and the new_BS can provide to the MN are the same, then the old_BS transmits alternate packets to the new_BS.

The old_BS and the new_BS transmit packets to the MN using the bandwidth they allocate to the MN’s flow. As mentioned before, MN receives the bandwidth allocation information of both the BSs from its current serving BS, that is, new_BS. It switches to the old channel by the start of the allocation period by the old_BS. It stays there on the old channel for the allocated duration and then switches back to the new channel. Since the new_BS allocates bandwidth in a conflict-free manner, MN receives data from both the old_BS and the new_BS during a downlink subframe.


                        Uplink flows: Now, consider an MN which is involved in the cooperation transmission of one of its uplink flows. MN transmits a packet to either the old_BS or the new_BS. It transmits packets to the two BSs in proportion of the data rates they provide to it. If both the BSs provide the same data rate, then it transmits one packet to the old_BS, next packet to the new_BS and so. MN switches to the old channel by the start of its uplink allocation period from the old_BS, stays there for the duration of the allocation period, performs data transmission and switches back to the new channel at the end of the allocation period. Due to the conflict-free bandwidth allocation from the new_BS in the uplink direction as well, MN transmits data to both the BSs during an uplink subframe. The old_BS, after receiving a complete packet from the MN, transmits the same to the new_BS over the backbone.

This cooperative data transmission continues until the new_BS alone can provide the required data rate to the MN or MN moves completely outside the coverage area of the old_BS. When that situation comes, the new_BS asks the old_BS to stop bandwidth allocation for the flows of MN and finishes the cooperative data transmission.

When the downlink cooperative data transmission method (Section 3.3) is implemented and simulated, it is observed that the packets are experiencing more delay (50 ms) when compared with the delay they experienced when there is no handover. The reason for this increase in the delay is that both the old_BS and the new_BS transmit whole packets to the MN. Similarly, the MN transmits a whole packet to either the old_BS or the new_BS. But the data rate either the old_BS or the new_BS can provide is only a fraction of the data rate required by the respective flows of the MN, as a result the packets experience more delay.

Consider a packet which has to be transmitted to the MN (see Fig. 3
                        ). Assume that the old_BS and the new_BS can provide only half of the data rate required by the MN. Hence, the old_BS can transmit only a fragment F (its size is half of the packet size) of that packet to the MN in a frame. It will take two frames for that packet to reach the MN. Similarly, for the new_BS also it will take two frames to transmit that packet to the MN. If they together transmit that packet (the old_BS transmits the first fragment and the new_BS transmits the second fragment), then it can reach the MN in one frame duration (see Fig. 4
                        ).

Packet fragmentation facility which is available in WiMAX is used to reduce the packet delivery delays. For the downlink flows of MN, the old_BS fragments every packet into two parts. The sizes of these parts are in the proportion of the data rates old_BS and new_BS can provide to the MN. The old_BS retains its fragment and forwards the other fragment to the new_BS. Now, the BSs transmit fragments to the MN, the MN assembles them to build the respective packet and these fragments reach the MN with less delays when compared with the whole packet. To prove this point simulation experiments are conducted and the results are discussed in Section 5.

MN uses the same method for the delay reduction in the uplink direction. The old_BS, after receiving an uplink fragment from the MN, transmits the same to the new_BS for the reassembly of the respective whole packet. The new_BS, after receiving its fragment of the same packet performs the reassembly.

A continuous-time multi-dimensional Markov model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed CAC algorithm. Using this Markov model the states of a BS are represented as 5-tuples (i, j, k, l, m), where i, j, k, l, m are the number of currently existing UGS, ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS and BE calls at the BS, respectively. Handover call arrival rates of these five service classes are Poisson distributed with rates λu, λe, λr, λn
                      and λb
                     . Service times of these service classes are exponentially distributed with the respective rates of μu, μe, μr, μn
                      and μb
                     . It is assumed that in every frame at most one handover call of each service class arrives at the BS. The valid states of the Markov model are defined as: If S is the state space of the proposed Markov model, then s(i, j, k, l, m) ∈ S is a valid state if

The possible state transitions on a call arrival/departure from a state s(i, j, k, l, m) are shown in Table 1
                        . Based on these state transitions, the steady state equations of the proposed Markov chain can be obtained. By solving these equations along with the normalization condition (that is, the sum of all steady state probabilities equals to one), the steady state probabilities of all valid states can be obtained. These steady state probabilities are used to obtain the approximate handoff call dropping probabilities and their upper and lower bounds.

To calculate the dropping probability of a handover call c that belongs to service class C with the bandwidth requirement of

                              ,
                           
                         first we need to identify the states of the Markov model that prevent the admission of call c. A state s(i, j, k, l, m) is a preventing/dropping state of call c if the cumulative bandwidth available for call c in state s is less than 
                           
                              C

                        . The dropping states are different for the handover calls of different service classes because of their varying QoS requirements. Procedures are given below to find out whether a state s is a dropping state or not of the handover calls of various service classes.

To find out whether a state s is a dropping state of a handover UGS call or not, we have to compute the total bandwidth available for the handover UGS call admission when the BS is in state s. From the above discussion, bw
                           1(s) is the fraction of

                                 b
                                 w
                                 (
                                 s
                                 )
                              
                            allocated for the UGS handover call admission. Handover UGS calls can take bandwidth from the nrtPS class, if required. Moreover, the handover calls of top four priority service classes can take bandwidth from the ongoing calls of BE and nrtPS service classes provided their counters are less than their thresholds. For the analysis, we assume that each arrived higher priority handover call takes bandwidth from the ongoing BE and nrtPS calls. As explained in Section 3.2, if the

                           where t is the frame duration and λ is the handover call arrival rate of a higher priority service class. In a similar fashion a handover UGS call is allowed to steal extra bandwidth from the ongoing nrtPS calls after retaining their minimum required bandwidth. The expected cumulative bandwidth available for the UGS handover call can be obtained by

                            is computed based on the assumption that all higher priority handover calls take bandwidth from the ongoing calls of BE and nrtPS service classes. In reality this is not the case. The higher priority handover calls borrow bandwidth from the ongoing nrtPS and BE calls if sufficient free bandwidth is not available. Due to this assumption, T
                           1(s) is an approximation of the actual bandwidth available for the UGS handover calls.

If T
                           1(s) is less than the MSR of the UGS class, then the UGS handover call under consideration is dropped. For every valid state, that is, sv
                            of the Markov model, T
                           1(sv
                           ) can be obtained as explained above and the dropping states for the UGS class can be identified. The cumulative steady state probability of the dropping states of the UGS class normalized by the cumulative steady state probability of all valid states is the dropping probability (CBP
                           1) of the UGS class.

The bandwidth available for the handover calls of type K (K = 2, 3, 4) is obtained by

                            is the bandwidth forwarded from such a situation to type K handover call admission. For example, the bandwidth available for ertPS class can be computed as explained below.

According to the proposed CAC algorithm, admission of the ertPS handover calls starts after the admission of the UGS handover calls. In Table 2
                           , e
                           1, e
                           2 and e
                           3 respectively represent the expected bandwidth forwarded from the UGS class to the ertPS class in the events (1) no UGS call arrives in the current frame, (2) the CAC algorithm drops the arrived UGS call(s) and (3) the CAC admits the arrived UGS call(s) with T
                           1(s).

The expected cumulative bandwidth available for the ertPS handover call admission is given by

To obtain the upper bound on the handover call dropping probability of a service class C, it is assumed that no bandwidth borrowing is possible (neither from the nrtPS class nor from the ongoing calls). Due to this assumption, only bandwidth available for class C handover call admission is the amount of bandwidth given to class C according to its priority after the completion of scheduling. That is the least amount of bandwidth available for the handover calls of class C. Hence, the handover call dropping probability of a service class computed under the above mentioned assumptions is the upper bound on the dropping probability. These bounds (upper and lower bounds) give us the dropping probabilities of various service classes under extreme conditions. Relatively, they are much easier to compute than the actual approximate handover call dropping probabilities.

To obtain the lower bound on the handover call dropping probability of a service class C, it is assumed that the bandwidth borrowing is always possible and the bandwidth assigned to the handover calls of higher priority service classes is always passed onto class C. Under these assumptions, the bandwidth available for a service class is the highest bandwidth available for that class. Hence, the handover call dropping probability computed under these assumptions is the lower bound on the dropping probability of class C.

The proposed handover management (including cooperative data transmission and delay reduction) and CAC (including bandwidth borrowing) methods are implemented in NS-2 (version 2.28) [22]. The NIST WiMAX module [23] is used for the implementation. A network with 50 nodes among which 3 are BSs and the remaining nodes are MNs is considered for the evaluation. The transmission ranges of BSs are taken as 500 m and BSs are connected to the neighboring BSs through wired links with the delay of 1ms and bandwidth of 100 Mbps. Channel bandwidth is 10 MHz and frame duration is 10 ms.

Three sets of simulation experiments are conducted. In the first set, the performance of the proposed handover management method is compared with the performance of the hard handover method proposed in the IEEE 802.16e [2] in terms of Packet Drop Rates (PDRs) and Packet Delivery Delays (PDDs). PDRs and PDDs of flows are evaluated when an MN is moving with the speed of 25 m/s from the coverage area of one BS (old_BS) to the other (new_BS) (see Fig. 1). The two BSs are located at 500 m and 1400 m, respectively. In order to test the cooperative data transmission method given in Section 3.3, the two BSs are almost fully loaded and have free bandwidth to support half of the data rate of one additional flow. For the simulations in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, the third BS is located at 2300 m and mobile nodes move according to the random mobility.

For the second and third sets, the new call arrival rate is Poisson distributed with λ. The call durations are exponentially distributed with 1/μ, where μ is the call termination rate (

                     ) and the channel holding time of a call in the coverage area of a BS is exponentially distributed with 1/α, where α (

                     ) is the handover rate [24–26]. Under these conditions, the handover call arrival rate is the product of the new call arrival rate and the handover rate [25]. For these sets of simulations, uniform mobility is considered. Under these assumptions the cumulative call arrival rate (new calls + handover calls) is Poisson distributed [25]. The new calls are also treated as handover calls while performing call admission. Performance of the proposed CAC method is studied in the second set and it is compared with the analytical results in the third set. Traffic parameters of the five service classes used for the simulations and analysis are shown in Table 3
                     .

In this set of simulation experiments, the PDRs of the downlink rtPS flows with the hard handover and the proposed handover methods are compared. The packets exceeding the delay limit (20 ms) are dropped at the BSs. With the proposed method, no major change is observed in the PDR (see Fig. 5
                           ) during handover, whereas the hard handover method caused a higher PDR. Cooperative data transmission of the old_BS and the new_BS helped to maintain the PDR at a lower level. Sometimes, it is observed that, with the proposed method, the PDR during the handover is little higher than the PDR when there is no handover. This is due to the switching of the channels by the respective MNs during handover. In the case of hard handover method, during the handover and for some time after the handover, MNs do not receive the required data rate, since they are at the border of the coverage areas of the respective new_BSs. As a result, they face higher PDRs.

In the case of PDDs also, the proposed method outperforms the hard handover method. PDDs are the delays for the packets to reach from the old_BS to the respective MN. PDDs of nrtPS flows are shown in Fig. 6
                           . When the proposed method without Delay Reduction (DR) strategy is used, the PDDs are lesser than the PDDs with the hard handover method, but higher than the PDDs when there is no handover. When the proposed method with the DR strategy is used, the average PDDs during the handover are almost equal to the average PDDs when there is no handover. With the hard handover method, the delays faced by the packets are very high due to the data rates provided by the old_BSs before handover and the data rates provided by the new_BSs after the handover are less than the required rates of the flows of the respective MNs. The BSC scheme proposed in [5] which is developed without DR, will give PDDs similar to our scheme without DR.

In this set of simulations, the speed of an MN is increased from 5 m/s to 30 m/s. The average PDRs of downlink rtPS flows are evaluated during MN’s handover. As can be observed from Fig. 7
                        , for a given speed the PDR with the proposed method is much less than the respective PDR with the hard handover method. As the speed of MN increases, the PDRs with both the methods increase. With the proposed method, due to its cooperative data transmission, increase in the PDR is very less.

This set of simulation experiments studies the PDDs of the nrtPS flows with the proposed and the hard handover methods as the speed of an MN increases. Due to cooperative data transmission, the proposed method causes less increase in the PDDs when compared with the hard handover method. For a given speed, PDDs with the proposed method are less than the respective PDDs with the hard handover method (see Fig. 8
                        ).

This set of experiments studies the handover Call Dropping Probabilities (CDPs) of various service classes as the handover call arrival rates increase from 1/5 calls/s to 1 call/s. Four versions of the proposed CAC method are implemented and compared:

                           
                              (1)
                              Fair bandwidth division + bandwidth borrowing from the nrtPS class + bandwidth borrowing from the ongoing nrtPS and BE calls (Proposed Method).

Fair bandwidth division + bandwidth borrowing from the nrtPS class (Partial BB).

Fair bandwidth division (Without BB).

CAC without fair bandwidth division and bandwidth borrowing (Without FH and BB).

In the case of the “Proposed Method”, due to the bandwidth borrowing from the nrtPS class and from the ongoing nrtPS and BE calls, more UGS handover calls are admitted into the network. Since bandwidth is taken away from the nrtPS class, among all classes, a less number of handover calls of this class are admitted into the network. With the “Proposed Method”, the CDPs of all service classes are low when compared with the CDPs with “Partial BB”, “Without BB” and “Without FH and BB”.

In the case of “Partial BB” the CDPs of all service classes are very high, even though the bandwidth borrowing from the nrtPS class is open. The CDPs of UGS, ertPS and rtPS classes with the “Without BB” scheme should be higher than the respective CDPs with the “Partial BB” scheme, since in the “Without BB” scheme no bandwidth borrowing is possible. This hypothesis is proved in the case of rtPS service class as shown in the Fig. 11. Surprisingly, at certain call arrival rates, the CDPs of UGS and ertPS classes (see Figs. 9
                         and 10
                        
                        ) with the “Without BB” scheme are less than the respective CDPs with the “Partial BB” scheme. The reason for this is: with the scheme “Without BB”, no bandwidth borrowing is possible, as a result a less number of rtPS handover calls are admitted into the network and in every frame, bandwidth is allocated to comparatively less number of rtPS handover calls when compared with the scheme “Partial BB”. Due to this, more bandwidth is available for handover call admission after scheduling. Moreover,

                         are relatively low when compared with 
                           
                              b

                              s
                           
                        . Due to all these reasons, with the “Without BB” scheme, more handover calls of UGS and ertPS classes are admitted into the network when compared with the scheme “Partial BB”. The CDPs of the nrtPS class (see Fig. 12
                        ) with the scheme “Without BB” are less than the respective CDPs with the scheme “Partial BB”. Since bandwidth cannot be taken from the nrtPS class in the scheme “Without BB”, more number of nrtPS handover calls are admitted into the network.

The results with the “Without FH and BB” scheme are shown in Figs. 9–12. As can be observed from the figures, with this scheme, the CDPs of the UGS class are less when compared with the scheme “Without BB”. Since they are the top priority service calls, UGS handover calls get access to the free bandwidth earlier than the handover calls of the other service classes and less affected by the absence of the fair bandwidth division strategy when compared with the other service classes. The same observation is made in the case of ertPS calls. Most of the time, the CDPs of the rtPS and nrtPS classes with the scheme “Without FH and BB” are more when compared with the scheme “Without BB” which is due to the high bandwidth usage by the handover calls of UGS and ertPS classes and the disabled bandwidth borrowing.

In this set of simulation experiments the number of times bandwidth borrowed from a nrtPS flow in its life time is studied “with starvation prevention strategy” (Scheme-I) and “without starvation prevention strategy” (Scheme-II) as the call arrival rate increases from 1/5 calls/s to 1 calls/s. In “Scheme-II”, the higher priority handover calls can always take bandwidth from the nrtPS and BE calls. As a result, with “Scheme-II” more number of times bandwidth is taken from the nrtPS flow when compared with “Scheme-I” (Fig. 13
                           
                           
                           
                           
                           ). This observation is made at all call arrival rates. As the call arrival rate increases the number times bandwidth borrowed from the nrtPS flow also increases with both the schemes but with “Scheme-I” this increase is low when compared with “Scheme-II”.

In this section the simulation results of the proposed CAC method are compared with the analytical results. While obtaining the simulation results (SIM), bandwidth borrowing from the nrtPS class is always enabled, since the Markov model is developed in that way. MATLAB is used to obtain the analytical results. The actual analytical CDPs (ANA), the maximum bounds (MAX Bound), the minimum bounds (MIN Bound), are obtained using the procedures explained in Section 4 and shown in Figs. 14–17. The simulation results and analytical results are always within the respective upper and lower bounds. At some places the analytical CDP is more and at some other places it is low when compared with the simulation CDP for the same call arrival rate. The reason for this could be the assumptions made while obtaining the analytical results.

As the call arrival rates of various service classes increase, then their handover call dropping probabilities should also increase. The increase in the handover call dropping probabilities of lower priority service classes (such as nrtPS) should be higher than the increase in the handover call dropping probabilities of higher priority service classes (such as UGS, ertPS and rtPS). The reason for this is: the handover calls of UGS, ertPS and rtPS service classes can borrow bandwidth from the nrtPS class and the ongoing calls of lower priority service classes. This hypothesis is validated from both the simulation and analytical results as shown in Figs. 14–17.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Handover management in WiMAX PMP networks becomes more challenging if we have to support the QoS requirements of the flows of MNs during their handover. To address this issue, we proposed to involve more than one BS in the data transmission of handover MNs, in a distributed manner. Packet fragmentation and reassembly-based cooperative data transmission method is developed to reduce the packet delivery delays. The proposed CAC method admits handover calls fairly and prevents starvation of the lower priority calls. In addition, analytical dropping probabilities of various service classes with the proposed CAC method are obtained by developing a continuous-time multi-dimensional Markov model. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed handover method, with the help of cooperative data transmission, outperforms the hard handover method proposed in the IEEE 802.16 standard in terms of packet drop rates and packet delivery delays. Capability to reduce the call dropping probabilities and the starvation prevention property of the proposed CAC method are also evaluated through simulation experiments. In addition, it is observed that the simulations and analysis-based dropping probabilities are always within their analytical bounds and follow each other.
