                  A rational curve on a rational surface such that the unit normal vector field of the surface along this curve is rational will be called a curve providing Pythagorean surface normals (or shortly a PSN curve). These curves represent rational paths on the surface along which the surface possesses rational offset curves. Our aim is to study rational surfaces containing enough PSN curves. The relation with PN surfaces will be also investigated and thoroughly discussed. The algebraic and geometric properties of PSN curves will be described using the theory of double planes. The main motivation for this contribution is to bring the theory of rational offsets of rational surfaces closer to the practical problems appearing in numerical-control machining where the milling cutter does not follow continuously the whole offset surface but only certain chosen trajectories on it. A special attention will be devoted to rational surfaces with pencils of PSN curves.
               
            

One of the basic operations in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and related technical applications (such as numerical-control machining, robot path-planning, tolerance analysis, etc.) is offsetting. The two-sided δ-offset 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        )
                      to an irreducible surface 
                        X
                      is the envelope of the system of spheres centered at the points of 
                        X
                      with the radius δ. Because of their high applicability, investigating surface offsets has become a popular research field in recent years and many interesting and challenging problems have been thoroughly studied – e.g. analysis of their geometric and algebraic properties, determining the number and type of components and constructing rational parameterizations (if they exist); see e.g. Arrondo et al. (1997, 1999), Lü and Pottmann (1996), Sendra and Sendra (2000). Computational techniques for offsets have been surveyed firstly by Pham (1992) and later by Maekawa (1999).

A serious problem with offsets is that they are often far more complicated than the input generating surfaces (they can be of very high degree, reducible, with self-intersections, non-rational, etc.). Hence approximation methods are in several real situations not only possible but unavoidable. However, offsets to special classes of rational surfaces admit exact rational representations. The notion of rational surfaces with rational offsets, the so-called Pythagorean Normal vector (PN) surfaces, was introduced by Pottmann (1995) as the surface counterpart to the theory of Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves, which are planar curves possessing rational offset curves introduced by Farouki and Sakkalis (1990). More details about PN surfaces can be found e.g. in papers by Krasauskas (2008), Lávička and Bastl (2008), Lávička and Vršek (2012), Vršek and Lávička (2013). For a survey of shapes with Pythagorean normals property (i.e., possessing rational offsets) see Farouki (2008) and for a recent discussion about rational offset surfaces and their modelling application see Krasauskas and Peternell (2010).

The aim of this paper is to start an investigation of rational offsets to surfaces from a new point of view and return this research back to one of the practical applications which originally motivated the introduction of PN surfaces in CAGD, namely closer to numerical-control machining. We recall that PN surfaces were introduced due to their straightforward applicability in CAD/CAM as they guarantee that the surface representing the centers of the sphere milling cutter (i.e., an offset of the shape being milled) is rational and thus it can be described via NURBS formalism and then entered to some CAD system. Nevertheless, this requirement is too strong as the milling cutter does not follow continuously the whole offset surface but only a chosen (suitable) trajectories on it, see Fig. 1
                     . So we do not have to assume that the PN property is satisfied globally but only along some special curves. Of course, it is necessary that the surface possess “enough” and “suitably” distributed curves (trajectories of the milling cutter) along which the unit normals of the surface are rational (we will call this trajectories PSN curves). The close relation of surfaces with pencils of PSN curves to PN surfaces will be investigated and presented.

The main results concerning the PSN curves (and related topics) can be summarized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           A complete algebraic analysis of degeneration and existence of simple and special components of offsets to irreducible surfaces along rational curves is provided.

A simple criterion, based on the discussion of the roots of a certain polynomial, for deciding if the curve on the surface is PSN or not is formulated. In addition, we also suggest how to decide whether the curve is proper or non-proper PSN curve.

Surfaces with PSN pencils such that a generic fiber is a proper/non-proper PSN curve are investigated and related to PN surfaces. Moreover, the results dealing with the reducibility and the rationality of the offsets depending on the properties of the associated double covers are presented and discussed.

It is shown that all developable surfaces are PSN pencils. Furthermore, for non-developable surfaces a method for generating all real parameterizations respecting PSN pencils is designed as a direct counterpart to a similar approach formulated for PN surfaces.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section shortly summarizes some fundamental facts about surfaces with Pythagorean normals (PN surfaces) and PN parameterizations. Furthermore, the so-called PSN curves and PSN parameterizations will be introduced (where PSN stands for Pythagorean surface normals). In Section 3 we will deal with algebraic properties of offsets and associated double covers (or double planes). In this section, the reducibility and rationality of the double plane associated to the given surface will be related to the PN/PSN property. Theorem enabling to distinguish whether a curve is PSN or not will be formulated. In addition, components of PSN curves will be investigated. Special and degenerated components of surface offsets along curves will be thoroughly studied in Section 4. Finally, after studying remarkable surfaces with pencils of PSN curves in Section 5 we conclude the paper.

Throughout this paper we will work over the field of complex numbers 
                        C
                     . Although for modelling applications the results over the field of real numbers 
                        R
                      are necessary the global analysis over an algebraically closed field is usually very helpful for right understanding of the essence of the studied problems, especially when the tools of algebraic geometry are involved.

Then we say that the parameterization 
                        x
                        (
                        u

                        )

                        v
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      fulfilling (6) 
                     admits Pythagorean surface normals with respect to 
                     
                        X
                     , or it is shortly called a PSN parameterization. A curve 
                        C
                        ⊂
                        X
                      admitting a PSN parameterization will be then called a PSN curve. Moreover, it is easy to verify that the PSN property 
                     (6) does not depend on the reparameterization of 
                        x
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      and thus it is well defined.


                     
                        Remark 2.1
                        Since a normal vector of a surface is not well defined at a singular point we will, for the sake of simplicity, implicitly assume in what follows that a generic point of 
                              C
                            is non-singular on 
                              X

                        t
                        )

                      of the curve 
                        C
                        ⊂
                        X
                      is PSN. Thus there exist a lot of PSN curves on PN surfaces. Nevertheless it must be stressed out that not every rational curve on a PN surface has to be PSN, see Fig. 2 (right) showing an ellipsoid of revolution (i.e., a PN surface as proved by Peternell and Pottmann, 1998) with two curves on it – a PH circle and a non-PH ellipse. This occurs when the PN surface has only a non-proper PN parameterization 
                        x
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      (see Section 3); in this case not all rational parameterizations of curves on the surface can be written in the form 
                        x
                        (
                        u
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        ,
                        v
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                     .

Despite working only with irreducible surfaces their offsets need not to be generally irreducible. Hence, we have to distinguish the following components, whose names were introduced in Arrondo et al. (1997) and used e.g. in Sendra and Sendra (2000), Vršek and Lávička (2010). An irreducible component 
                        U
                        ⊂
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        )
                      is called simple, special, or degenerated if for a generic point 
                        r
                        ∈
                        U
                      there exist(s) just one, more than one but finitely many, or infinitely many pair(s) 
                        (
                        p
                        ,
                        q
                        )
                     , where 
                        p
                        ∈
                        
                           
                              X
                           
                           
                              Reg
                           
                        
                      and 
                        q
                        ∈
                        
                           
                              S
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , generating the point 
                        r
                        ∈
                        U
                     , respectively. Special components are precisely those generated when computing offsets to offsets and it follows directly from the definition of degenerated components that they are not surfaces but curves or points.

For later use, we recall some results from Sendra and Sendra (2000). In particular, it can be proved that offsets have at most two components and at least one of them is simple. For almost every distance δ (i.e., up to finitely many exceptions) the offset 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        )
                      has simple components only. Next, we summarize some results from Arrondo et al. (1997) in the following theorem and introduce two classes of PN surfaces, which will be later discussed in more detail.

                                    a proper PN surface.

                                    is PN then we call it a non-proper PN surface.
                                 

The aforementioned properties can be efficiently studied with help of incidence varieties relating the surface and its offset. For an arbitrary algebraic surface

Considering the incidence variety and all related mappings we can view offsets as double covers of the original surface via the following incidence diagram
                        
                           (10)
                           
                        
                      This point of view turns out to be very useful when trying to understand for instance the correspondence between the curves on 
                        X
                      and 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        )
                      and the rationality of offsets.

The double cover is branched along a certain curve consisting of the points with only one preimage. The double covers (or sometimes also called double planes, see e.g. Jung, 1942; Calabri, 2002 for more details) are usually studied in normal form, i.e., as

                        =
                        0

                        To be more precise we need the algebraic degree of

                            to be even otherwise the line at infinity has to be added to the branching curve in the projective extension. However, we will not need this fact in what follows.
                      and π is a projection to the uv-plane. We recall that the polynomial is called reduced if it does not have multiple factors. In what follows we will find a normal double cover equivalent to the offset of the algebraic surface. Let

It is not seen at the first sight from the parameterization of the paraboloid from Example 3.2 that this surface is a PN surface (although this is a well-known fact as all elliptic/hyperbolic paraboloids belong to surfaces with Linear Normals (LN surfaces), see Jüttler, 1998, and thus they are PN). Hence, we have to consider suitable reparameterizations which relate the PN property of the surface

                        Remark 3.8
                        Suppose that a proper parameterization 
                              x
                              (

                              )
                            of the surface 
                              X
                            is given. It is a simple task to test whether it is a PN parameterization or not. Nevertheless, if we prove that the PN property is not satisfied we still cannot say with certainty whether the surface has rational offsets or not – one should try all the reparameterizations and test them on the PN property, which is of course impossible. Another variant is to calculate the offset surface directly (in implicit form) and then decide if it is rational or not. However, this computation is usually very complicated. Corollary 3.6 provides a new alternative tool because the equation of

Now we are ready to return back to PSN curves and we are able to use the introduced approach to obtain the first results dealing with their properties. It is not surprising that a statement analogous to Theorem 3.1 will hold for the offsets of curves on surfaces, too.

As the conclusion of the previous theorem we can see that the PSN property of curves is reflected in the rationality and/or reducibility of the corresponding curves on the offset surface. These properties of

                        C
                      with the branching curve of the associated double cover. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine these numbers and thus we use Theorem 3.3 instead.

There exists a close relation of offsets along curves possessing degenerated components to standard surface offsets with degenerated components. In particular, the surface yielding an offset with a degenerated component has a lot of curves along which the offsets have also degenerated components. Nevertheless, not every curve on such a surface has to have such a component. To see this let us recall that the component of 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        )
                      degenerates to point if and only if 
                        X
                      is a sphere of radius δ and it degenerates to a curve if and only if 
                        X
                      is the envelope of a one-parameter set of spheres of radii δ, i.e., it is a pipe surface. In the first case, the δ-offset of any curve degenerates to a point (the center of the sphere). In the second case the δ-offset of a characteristic circle degenerates to the point but for other curves 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ

                        C
                        )
                      consists of the spine curve (as the inner component) and other simple component. However, it must be stressed out that the curves with degenerated offsets may exist even when the underlying surface has simple components only, for illustration see e.g. Fig. 3
                      (left) in which one of the curve offset components is a singular point of the surface offset.

The steps of this proof are a straightforward analogy to the steps of the proof of Theorem 7 in Sendra and Sendra (2000).  □

It remains to be shown how curves with special offset components arise on surfaces with degenerated components. Let 
                        X
                      be a pipe surface given by its spine curve and the radius δ. Now consider an arbitrary curve 
                        C
                      on 
                        X
                      intersecting any generic characteristic circle of this pipe surface in exactly k points. Then for each characteristic circle, the δ-offset will consist of k “outer” points and one k-tuple “inner” point (the centre of the characteristic circle). Thus, we can immediately conclude that the spine curve is a component of 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        ,
                        C
                        )
                      which is k-special, see Fig. 3 (right). Therefore compared to the offsets of surfaces where only 2-special components can occur, in the curve case one can obtain a k-special component for any arbitrary k.

To sum up this section, the main message of the above given considerations is that the degenerated and special components are rare as they can arise solely on non-simple components of surface offsets (which are rare by Sendra and Sendra, 2000) or in the singular locus of the surface offsets (which is also a rare case because a generic point on the surface is regular).

As already mentioned before, the PN property of a given surface can be sometimes too strong for CNC machining as the milling cutter does not follow the whole offset surface continuously but only along some (discrete) trajectories on it. This is a main motivation to introduce and investigate PSN curves on surfaces and thus to extend the class of surfaces interesting and suitable for technical practise. Of course, it is also a challenging task to study a relation between the PN surfaces and surfaces possessing “enough” PSN curves. We recall that these curves can occur also on non-PN surfaces and vice-versa on PN surfaces we can find curves which are non-PSN. In addition, the natural question reads if e.g. a one-parametric system of PSN curves guarantees the PN property. We will discuss it in this section.

                        It must be stressed out again that in this paper we work over 
                              C
                           . However, problems originated in various fields dealing with computing for industrial applications need to work over the reals. Hence, some mathematical difficulties may appear and some results must be reconsidered. For instance, if one wants to parameterize a surface with a rational pencil properly, without passing to the complex numbers, then it is unfortunately sometimes necessary to produce parameterizations for which the curves in the pencil

                            are not parameter lines. Even worse there exist rational surfaces not possessing any real proper parameterization, for more details see Schicho (2000). Hence, it is not guaranteed in general that the PSN parameterization

In the rest of this section we want to study PSN pencils on general developable and non-developable surfaces in more detail. We start with a typical example of surfaces carrying pencils of PSN curves, in particular with the ruled surfaces. By definition ruled surfaces contain a continuous family of straight lines (generators or rulings). It was proved by Pottmann et al. (1996) (Proposition 1, p. 550) that the offset curve 
                        
                           
                              O
                           
                           
                              δ
                           
                        
                        (
                        X
                        ,
                        C
                        )
                      of a non-torsal generator 
                        C
                      is a rational quartic, i.e., 
                        C
                      is a non-proper PSN curve. Since a generic ruling on a non-developable ruled surface is non-torsal we see that any non-developable ruled surface carries a pencil of non-proper PSN curves. On contrary, it is easy to show that the offset of a torsal ruling consists of two parallel lines and thus such a generator is a proper PSN curve. See also Fig. 4
                     . Let us summarize this discussion to the next proposition.


                     
                        Proposition 5.6
                        
                           Each ruled surface is a PSN pencil with the rulings as the PSN curves. Moreover, the generic line is a proper PSN curve if and only if the surface is developable.
                        

The previous proposition with Theorem 5.2 give us also an alternative proof to the result from Pottmann et al. (1996), namely that the ruled non-developable surfaces have rational offsets (i.e., they are PN surfaces).


                     
                        Corollary 5.7
                        
                           Non-developable rational ruled surfaces are non-proper PN surfaces.
                        

To finish the analysis we will consider the developable surfaces as a special case. There exist three different types of the developable surfaces in

Thus developable surfaces are not necessarily PN, moreover most of them are not PN surfaces. Nevertheless the method presented above allows us to decide this very quickly and efficiently. In addition, we immediately obtain the PN parameterization if it exists.

                        Another class of surfaces carrying PSN pencil is the class of canal surfaces, which are shapes especially important in CAGD (similarly as ruled surfaces studied above). These surfaces are generated by the family of characteristic circles. The offset curve of these characteristic circles consists of two circles and thus they are proper PSN curves. Indeed each canal surface

                            which consists generically of two circles. It is a well-known fact that a typical property of rational canal surfaces is being non-PN (in particular, they are proper PN only for rational medial axis transforms). Thus, considering the PSN pencils extends understanding of rational offsets also for canal surfaces.

We have shown above that all developable surfaces are PSN pencils. In what follows, we will focus on non-developable surfaces and present a method for generating any real parameterizations respecting PSN pencils on non-developable surfaces. Using the dual representation, Pottmann (1995) derived the formula for generating all PN parameterizations. This approach can be modified also for PSN pencils.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we introduced the PSN curves as rational curves on rational surfaces along which the surface possesses rational offset curves. The main motivation for starting this study (generalizing the approach to well-known PN surfaces) was to bring the theory of rational offsets of rational surfaces closer to the practical problems originated in CNC machining where the milling cutter does not follow continuously the whole offset surface but only certain chosen paths on it. The properties of PSN curves were studied with help of normal double planes associated to the given surface and equivalent to offsets of algebraic surfaces. It was shown that PSN curves can occur also on non-PN surfaces, and conversely on PN surfaces we can find curves which are non-PSN. In addition, the analysis of simple, special and degenerated components of offsets along PSN curves was provided. The close relation of rational surfaces possessing pencils of PSN curves to PN surfaces was revealed and as a special case the ruled surfaces were thoroughly investigated from this point of view. It was proved that all developable surfaces are PSN pencils and for non-developable surfaces a method for generating all real parameterizations respecting PSN pencils was designed as a direct counterpart to a similar approach formulated in the past for PN surfaces.
