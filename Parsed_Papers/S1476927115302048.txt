                  Introduction
                  
                     PLA2G7 encodes Lp-PLA2 having role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques by catalyzing its substrate, phosphatydilcholine (PC), to be pro-inflammatory substances. The increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Asian population has been related with this enzyme. 279Val→Phe variant was reported to have a protective role against CAD due to, in part, secretion defect or loss of enzymatic function. Therefore, We study folding kinetics and enzyme-substrate interaction in 279Val→Phe by using clinical and computational biology approach.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Polymorphisms were detected by genotyping among 103 acute myocardial infarction patients and 37 controls. Folding Lp-PLA2 was simulated using GROMACS software by assessing helicity, hydrogen bond formation and stability. The interactions of Lp-PLA2 and its substrate were simulated using Pyrx software followed by molecular dynamics simulation using YASARA software.
               
               
                  Result
                  Polymorphism of 279Val→Phe was represented by the change of nucleotide from G to T of 994th PLA2G7 gene. The folding simulation suggested a decreased percentage of α-helix, hydrogen bond formation, hydrogen bond stability and hydrophobicity in 279Val→Phe. The PC did not interact with active site of 279Val→Phe as paradoxically observed in 279 valine. 279Val→Phe polymorphism is likely to cause unstable binding to the substrate and decrease the enzymatic activity as observed in molecular dynamics simulations. The results of our computational biology study supported a protected effect of 279Val→Phe Polymorphism showed by the odd ratio for MI of 0.22 (CI 95% 0.035–1.37) in this study.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  279Val→Phe Polymorphism of Lp-PLA2 may lead to decrease the enzymatic activity via changes of folding kinetics and recognition to its substrate.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), known as platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), is an enzyme associated with cardiovascular disease. Formerly, this enzyme was thought to be a protective enzyme as this enzyme hydrolyzes PAF. However, recent studies weighted its role as pro-atherogenic role (Steen and O’Donoghue, 2013) as hydrolysis of oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) by this enzyme yields potent inflammatory mediator, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) and Nonesterified Fatty Acid (NEFA) (Ferguson et al., 2012). PLA2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phospholipid contained in ox-LDL, yielding Lyso-PC (Gibellini and Smith, 2010; Gonçalves et al., 2012) . In association with disease, previous studies have shown that angina and atherosclerotic event were associated with Lp-PLA2 level (Liu et al., 2011; Gonçalves et al., 2012; Patil et al., 2007). Our previous study also showed that Lp-PLA2 activity was increased in subjects with acute myocard infarct (Wahjono et al., 2014).

Lp-PLA2 is encoded by PLA2G7 gene having many variants; one of those is 279Val→Phe. This variant has been reported, in Japan and Korea, China, Taiwan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan (Liu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006). Four percent of Japanese population having 279Val→Phe resulted in lost of Lp-PLA2 function (Samanta and Bahnson, 2008), whereas study conducted in Korea reported that odds ratio of coronary artery disease of subjects having 279Val→Phe was 0.8, suggesting its protective role (Jang et al., 2011). In addition to loss of its function, 279Val→Phe variant has a low level of serum Lp-PLA2, at least in part, possibly due to defect of Lp-PLA2 secretion (Ishihara et al., 2004). The low concentration of serum Lp-PLA2 in 279Val→Phe population is probably due to folding defect (Jang et al., 2006).

Therefore, the aims of this study are to explore the effect of 279Val→Phe mutation on its folding kinetics and its enzymatic activity at molecular level.

@&#METHODS@&#

A case control study was conducted in Saiful Anwar Hospital in November 2011 to February 2015. One hundred three male patients were included if they had diagnosed MI (Myocard Infarct) and dyslipidemia. Diagnosis of MI was based on the Third Universal Definition of Myocard Infarction (Thygesen et al., 2012). The diagnosis of dyslipidemia met the NCEP ATP III criteria (Sidhu and Naugler, 2002). Patients having orthopaedic problems, weight gain or loss within last six month, and diabetes mellitus were excluded.

Control subjects were 40 outpatients who met the inclusion criteria: age-matched, asymptomatic CAD patients with negative result of treadmill test. On the basis of a medical questionnaire, subjects with a history of atherosclerotic, arterial disease (stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, or peripheral vascular disease), or known malignancy were excluded. All the subjects gave their informed consent, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit Qiagen. Genotyping for the variant 279Val→Phe (rs16874954) was performed using PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based technique as previously described (Stafforini et al., 1996). Briefly, Exon 9 of the PLA2G7 gene was amplified by using the primers 5′-CCCCATGAAATGAACAATTATAT-3′ and 5′-GGGGGCAAAAGAATAGCCTTATAA-3′. The 317-bp PCR products were digested with BST4Ci at 65°C in 3h. The 148- and 169-bp DNA fragments indicated the presence of the mutation.

A fully extended Lp-PLA2 was used as starting structure for all folding simulation both of wild type and 279Val→Phe. Amino acid sequence was retrieved from NCBI FASTA (accession code: Q13093.1). A wildtype Lp-PLA2 was constructed using Chimera. The Φ and Ψ angle was set to −135° and 135° respectively according to (Lei et al., 2008). The 279Val→Phe starting structure was constructed by replacing valine with phenylalanine.

A total of 160 ns simulation was performed in 16 simulation using GROMACS 5.0.2 software. Each variant was simulated 8 times in 292.39K, 299.93K, 307.61K, 315.43K, 323.39K, 331.49K, 339.75K, and 348.14K respectively.

CHARM22-all-atom force field with CMAP correction was used to enhance accuracy of dynamic properties of protein being studied (Lindahl et al., 2010). A 5000-step minimization was done followed by 2 ns equilibration in canonical ensemble. Production run was performed for 10ns each temperature in canonical ensemble. LINCS algorithm for constrain allowed us to use time step of 2 femtoseconds. Simulation were performed in GBSA as a solvent using dielectric constant of 2 (Wolf and de Leeuw, 2008) and salt concentration of 0.2M. Both of neighbor searching and GB pairwise summation was performed every 40 steps using cutoff of 6 A.

Data was analyzed using GROMACS analysis tool. Secondary structure prediction used STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995). As the hydrogen bond in protein is categorized as medium hydrogen bond (Minch, 1999), only medium to strong hydrogen bonds were analyzed. Hydrogen bond was defined as the distance of O atom from backbone carbonyl group and H atom from NH less than 3.0Å. The hydrogen bond formation was assessed by measuring distance of O atom and H atom of backbone of particular residue using i+4 pattern (Seung-Yeon and In-Ho, 2011). Hydrophobicity was plotted using Kyte and Doolittle plot (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982).

3D model of Lp-PLA2 WT was retrieved from RSCB PDB and mutant model was constructed using swissmodel webserver. All model were validated by PROCHECK and ResPROX webserver. Pocket site (catalytic triad) checking was performed using the CASTp web server (Dundas et al., 2006). The structure of PC as a ligand was downloaded from PubChem in the sdf file format.

To prepare all of the molecules for docking, the first step was to remove water molecules from the Lp-PLA2 molecules using PyMol. Two hundred times energy minimization was applied to the PC molecule using Open Babel Pyrx. Docking between the three types of Lp-PLA2 and the PC molecule was performed using Autodock Vina software; the default grid parameters were (X:25.000, Y:25.000, Z:25000), and the degree of exhaustiveness was eight. PyMol and LigandScout were used to analyze and overview the docking results.

Docking results were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation, which was performed using YASARA software, version 13.2.21, with the AMBER03 force field. Each complex protein was placed in a box that was 10 Ǻ larger than the corresponding side of the protein (Cornell et al., 1995). Hydrogen atoms were added to balance the pH and pKa values, when the applied pKa simulation value was higher than the pH value. The Ewald method was used in YASARA simulation to compute the pKa for all of the molecules that were used (Krieger et al., 2006). The complex structures were minimized using the steepest-descent method followed by simulated annealing. To match real cell conditions, water solvent was used with pH 7.0 in 0.9% NaCl and at a temperature of 300K for 4000ps. Intramolecular and intermolecular forces were used for multiple time-steps of 1.25 and 2.5fs.

Statistical analysis was carried out with IBM SPSS statistics version 20.0. Variables were presented as means±SD. P value of 0.05 or less was considered as significant. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI were calculated as a measure of association between genotype and MI. A value of p
                        <0.05 was considered as indicative of a statistically significant effect.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The baseline characteristics data are presented in Table 1
                     . The mean level of LDL-C was significantly higher in MI patients than in the controls.

The distribution frequency of the two genetic variants of PLA2G7 among MI patients and controls is presented in Table 2
                        . The GT and TT genotypes of rs16874954 were combined together for analysis since the frequency of TT homozygotes was extremely low.

For the rs16874954 mutation, a significantly higher prevalence of GT and TT genotypes was noted in the controls than in the MI patients (8.11% vs. 1.94%, P
                        =0.000). The PLA2G7 279F allele was associated with a reduced MI risk of 78% [OR 0.22 (0.035–1.37)].

To further explore molecular mechanism of protected effect 279F allele, the folding simulation was performed and the potential energy (Fig. 1
                        ) and radius of gyration (Rg) was assessed. The potential energy indicated that the simulation was stable. As showed in Fig. 2
                        , Rg is slowly decreased from 43.7nm to 14.3nm in WT and 43.7nm to 14.1nm in 279Val→Phe. At this level, however, there was no significant difference between two variants. Therefore the analysis was focused to residue level, residue 273–286.

Helicity of both variants were assessed using program STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) as shown in Fig. 3
                           . All secondary structures were formed during folding. The figure showed that residue 273–286 formed α-helix structure more frequently formed in WT compared to 279Val→Phe suggesting that mutation valine→phenylalanine at 279th residue decreased helicity.

To further study the influence of 279Val→Phe on α-helix formation, hydrogen bonds in residue 273-287 were assessed. As depicted in Fig. 4
                           , contacts of O atom of residue 273rd residue and H atom of 277th residue are more frequently found in WT compared to 279Val→Phe. So as O atom of 278th and H atom of 282nd residue; and O atom of 283rd residue and H atom of 287th residue, O-H contacts are more frequently found in WT.

The hydrogen bond stability, hydrogen bond autocorrelation expressed as (C (t)), was assessed. Lower C (t) indicates lower hydrogen bond stability. The lower C(t) of 279Val→Phe observed in this study suggest that mutation on 279th residue from valin→phenylalanine had effect on hydrogen bond stability (Fig. 5
                           ). These data indicate that 279Val→Phe mutation affects folding of Lp-PLA2 by disrupting α-helix formation through hydrogen bond breaking.

In this study, the hydrophobicity of individual amino was plotted (unpublished data). The residue having high peak of hydrophobicity contribute in the α-helix formation, particularly helix 2, 3, 7, and 9 wich are constantly formed during early to the end of simulation (Fig. 6
                           b). The lower helices in 279Val→Phe may interfere tertiary structure formation.

The three-dimensional structure of wild-type Lp-PLA2 was determined from homology modeling based on the PDB file X-ray crystal structure. Quality checking of each protein structure yielded varying protein resolutions: 1.53Å for the wild type and 1.3Å for F279. Lp-PLA2 has pocket sites, the catalytic triad, formed by three amino acid residues: Ser273, Asp296, and His351. The PC molecule was retrieved from PubChem. PC is a phospholipid containing short-chain fatty acyl group located in the acetyl group at the sn-2 position and acts as the hydrolysis target of Lp-PLA2 (D’Arrigo and Servi, 2010; Levitan et al., 2010; Burke et al., 2010).

The Lp-PLA2 structure taken from homology modeling has 427 amino acid residues consisting of 35% α helices, 27% β-strands, 25% turns, and 38% coils, which form 2D structures (Unpublished data). This 2D configuration has not changed due to amino acid alteration at 279. Thus, the alteration of the amino acid at 279 has no effect on the overall three-dimensional structure (Fig. 7
                        ). However, the alteration of amino acids does affect the stability of the structures, resulting in stability values of 85.72kcal/mol for the wild-type and 13.26kcal/mol for the mutant 279Val→Phe. Increasing the structure-stability value above +0.5kcal/mol has been assumed to indicate destabilization of the structure (Van et al., 2011). Mutation 279Val→Phe also causes an increase in steric clashes for the atomic structure (unpublished data) of the protein.

To analyze the Lp-PLA2 and substrate interaction, we performed docking analysis using the Vina Wizard of the Pyrx software. Pyrx has been used to investigate the inhibiting activity of a molecule toward enzyme-substrate interaction (Suvannang et al., 2011) and also to perform virtual screening for drug design. PC energy minimization was performed 200 times using OpenBabel in Pyrx. This was done to avoid steric clashes because such clashes can drastically reduce the complex binding affinity (Mirzaei et al., 2012).

Docking results revealed difference in the Lp-PLA2 residues that interact with the substrate. This interaction is formed by hydrogen bonding (purple dash) as depicted in Fig. 8
                        . Residues that bind through hydrogen bonding are show in Table 3
                        . Lp-PLA2 wild-type formed interactions between amino acid residues in the active sites of the enzymes: Ser273 and His351 residues with the PC. This interaction is thought to catalyze the yielded products, lyso-PC and NEFA, the potent inflammatory mediator. The free energy for a complex interaction of substrate and wild type-Lp-PLA2 is −6.1kcal/mol.

In the 279Val→Phe, there were no interactions at the catalytic site. This action is thought to prevent dissociation acyl group from sn-2 position of phosphatydilcholine by Lp-PLA2; thus, hydrolysis process is stopped hence the pro-inflamatory mediator is not produced. 279Val→Phe destabilization is caused by the loss of hydrogen bonds due to the alteration valine→phenylalanine. The binding energy for 279Val→Phe docking was −4.0kcal/mol, a higher value compared to wild type. A more positive binding energy indicated a lower stability.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed in this study to determine the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex for both wild-type and 279Val→Phe. Protein complex stabilization during molecular dynamics simulation was calculated using the root mean square deviation (RMSD) (Fig. 9
                        ).

During MD simulations, RMS Cα atom values were used to calculate similarity in 3D structures of the globular proteins. The RMSD plot shows that the complex began to reach stability at 2500ps. Below 2500ps, all of the molecules were unstable due to the shock kinetic energy that was input to the molecules at rest (zero condition).

All of the complex RMSD values appear to be steady above 2500 ps. RMSD plots (Fig 9A) showed that the 279Val→Phe has a higher RMSD value. The higher standard deviation of the RMSD indicates a decrease in the stability of the structure. Non-active site residues appeared in peaks at in Fig. 9B. This finding indicates that the enzymatic machinery was not disturbed during the simulation. However, between the two complexes, Phe354 of mutant 279Val→Phe (Fig 9C) showed the highest atomic movement during the simulation, indicating that the enzymatic machinery was less stable compared with the wild type.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This study has shown the protective effect of 279Val→Phe among CAD patients. The protective effect might correlate with the change of its active site structure which in turn failed Lp-PLA2 to recognize its substrate, PC. This may prevent hydrolisis of PC by Lp-PLA2, hence the pro-inflammatory products are not yielded. The more positive binding energy of 279Val→Phe indicated the decrease stability of LpPLA2-phosphatydilcholine complex.

In addition, 279Val→Phe may impair folding of Lp-PLA2 resulted in reduced serum LpPLA2 level. In our study, 279Val→Phe reduced the hydrogen formation which in turn reduce the formation of α-helix. The reduction of α-helix formation may interfere tertiary structure formation.

Reduced hydrogen bond formation in our study suggests that hydrogen bond is less frequently formed during folding of 279Val→Phe variant, which means mutation affect hydrogen bond formation, e.g. hydrogen bond strength. A Similar study was conducted by Kim and Lee on vilin headpiece domain (Seung-Yeon and In-Ho, 2011). Replacement to phenylalanine might weaken the hydrogen bond strength. This is in agreement with the study of (Scheiner and Kar, 2002) The formed hydrogen bonds tend to break as showed by the lower hydrogen bond stability expressed as C(t) (Fig. 5). Several studies had used C (t) to asses hydrogen bond stability (Lee et al., 2005; Rawat and Biswas, 2014). Reduced helicity in 279Val→Phe may be caused by valine replacement to phe. Previous study showed that valine has higher propensity and stability to form helix compared to valine (Doruker and Bahar, 1997; Yang et al., 1997; Kinnear et al., 2000; Gregoret and Sauer, 1998; García and Sanbonmatsu, 2002). Our study found the crtitical role of helix formation in tertiary structure formation of Lp-PLA2. Helix 2, 3, 7, and 9 of Lp-PLA2 are constantly formed during early to the end of simulation. These findings were similar and consistent with the work of Uzawa et al. (Uzawa et al., 2004) In their experimental study concerning apomyoglobin folding, they found that the α-helix consistently formed during folding had critical role in the tertiary structure formation, as C-and N-terminus of formed helices form tertiary contact (Baldwin and Rose, 1999).

This folding study can be associated to the work of (Ishihara et al., 2004; Jang et al., 2006; Karasawa et al., 2003). Taken together, their work was: mutation of 279Val→Phe causes misfolding of Lp-PLA2 hence it is not secreted to circulation. The cell quality control ensures that misfolded protein will be degraded (AL, 2003; Alberts and Johnson, 2008; Eisele and Wolf, 2008). This study could explain the mechanism underlying folding defect of Lp-PLA2 assumed by Karasawa et al. (Karasawa et al., 2003), at least in the early folding event. The proposed mechanism gained by this study is that Val→Phe mutation on residue 279 of Lp-PLA2 causes disruption on hydrogen bond formation, whether hydrogen bond strength or stability, leading to reduction of α-helix formation. Reduction of α-helixes in turn, interfere tertiary structure formation. This mechanism is proposed as mechanism underlying Lp-PLA2 folding defect in 279Val→Phe.

The results of our study agreed with those of a study conducted in the Korean population (Jang et al., 2011). The present study indicates that natural, genetic deficiency in Lp-PLA2 activity due to carriage of PLA2G7 279F allele offers a certain protection against MI.

There are several limitations in this study. The first limitation concerns the sample size of the study. We examined the distribution of the PLA2G7 rs16874954 mutation of Lp-PLA2 in 37 control subjects and 103 patients, which is not a large sample. Secondly, there was a relatively small number of patients with the 279Val→Phe T allele. The small sample limited the statistic power of our study, determining a wide confidence interval. Therefore, a larger sample should be examined to confirm the relation between this polymorphism and MI, or existence of this mutation in Malang population.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

279Val→Phe Polymorphism of Lp-PLA2 may lead to decrease the enzymatic activity via changes of folding kinetics and recognition to its substrate.
