                  This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the assessment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from chest radiographs. Our method consists in automatically extracting intercostal patches from chest radiographs belonging to the test database using a semiautomatic segmentation method of the ribs. Statistical and spectral features are computed from each patch then a method of feature transformation is applied using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). A training database of 321 patches was classified by an expert in two classes, a class of normal patches and a class of abnormal patches. Patches belonging to the test database are then classified using the SVM classifier. Finally, the rate of abnormal patches is calculated for each quadrant to decide if the chest radiograph presents an ARDS. The method has been evaluated on 90 radiographs where 53 images present ARDS. The results show a sensitivity of 90.6% at a specificity of 86.5%.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory disease of the lungs associated with severe hypoxemia mostly due to pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents and major trauma [1,2]. Despite a mortality rate between 18% and 35% [3,4], ARDS is still underdiagnosed in intensive care [5]. Early diagnosis of ARDS counts among the measures that should improve the management of this disease including an early initiation of a lung protective ventilator support.

The diagnosis of ARDS is based on four criteria [6]:

Fluid overload and bilateral infiltrates (alveolar damage) on chest radiograph (white spots as shown in Fig. 1
                              ) [7].

The alveolar damage appears in chest radiograph in the form of opacities. This is due to the fact that the alveoli, which are responsible for air transfer between the outside and the blood, are filled with inflammatory fluid and/or are collapsed. These criteria are difficult to highlight simultaneously, which usually leads to a false diagnosis, and among them, Angoulvant et al. [8] demonstrated that the inter-observer variability on the chest radiograph, which corresponds to the fourth criteria, was very high (kappa=0.3) and was a limiting factor in the early diagnosis of ARDS. In fact, the difficulty of diagnosing this disease is probably due to both the quality of the chest radiograph and the intensivist׳s interpretation which usually depends on his own experience. In order to assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of ARDS, the development of an automatic system has proven to be essential.

The chest radiograph is an essential tool for diagnosing ARDS. Its low cost, portability, speed, and its use of a moderate dose of radiation make it the most adequate imaging tool. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to detect ARDS (diffuse abnormalities) in chest radiographs is a new area that has not been previously studied, even though CAD is one of the major research areas in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology [9] where several CAD systems have already been developed in order to help radiologists in chest radiographs diagnosis [10]. The computerized analysis of chest radiograph in these CAD systems is based on size measurements, detection of nodules (low-contrast white circular objects) or texture analysis [10]. Texture analysis is the best approach that assesses diffuse patterns in chest radiographs and can be used for ARDS diagnosis.

The texture analysis plays a very important role in CAD systems [11]. There are several approaches to represent the texture. The main ones are divided into three categories namely statistical, structural, and spectral [12]. In the 1970s, the texture analysis has been applied in chest radiographs in order to detect the pneumoconiosis using the Fourier spectrum [13]. More recent work has realized a fully automatic CAD scheme for pneumoconiosis using the histogram and co-occurrence matrices features [14]. Ginneken et al. [15] used as features the moments of responses to a multi-scale filter bank in order to detect tuberculosis (TB) and interstitial disease. Chest radiographs also include normal structures that may distort the analysis of the lungs. To address this, several studies have performed their analysis exclusively on the Regions Of Interest (ROI) that may contain the lesions. Kruger et al. [16] used the characteristics of the co-occurrence matrix and the Fourier spectrum extracted from the manually selected intercostal regions (ROI). Katsuragawa et al. [17] used the variation of Root Mean Square (RMS) and the first moment of the Fourier spectrum as features extracted from small automatically selected intercostal regions. They developed an algorithm to eliminate the posterior ribs by first selecting a large number of squares (ROI) in the chest radiograph and then eliminate those that contain sharp rib edges, using edge gradient analysis. However, in [16,17], the areas containing anterior ribs were not eliminated, when selecting intercostal regions for analysis. This can distort the ensuing analysis because these areas are visually similar to the lesions.

In the present work, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system for the detection of ARDS based on statistical and spectral texture features and using an SVM classifier. We applied a method of semiautomatic segmentation of the ribs in order to exclude them because of their similarity with opacities. This allowed an automatic selection of intercostal regions for analysis.

Chest radiographs have been selected from a previous clinical database (TARD study: Transfusion Associated Respiratory Distress), which included children in Pediatric Intensive Care [18]. Patients who participated in the TARD study were aged between 7days (newborns) and 18years. Given the inter-observer variability in the diagnosis of ARDS shown in the literature, a study of the variability in reading chest radiographs for the diagnosis of ARDS in children was necessary in order to optimize the reading method and to create in the end, a test set of chest radiographs diagnosed with consensus to validate precisely our automatic decision system.

To optimize the diagnosis of our database, in the first evaluation, two intensivists have initially agreed on the criteria for chest radiographs reading based on the 1994 definition of the Consensus Conference on ARDS [6] and from a panel of X-rays from the literature [19]. Then, they classified a set of 120 chest radiographs as ARDS positive or negative. In the same process, they determined the positions of the affected quadrants for each chest radiograph [20]. To establish the basis of a diagnosis consensus, chest radiographs showing disagreement between the two intensivists were reviewed by a third one. In case of disagreement among the three intensivists on the location of the damage, the three observers performed an evaluation together to determine the final diagnosis.

@&#METHODS@&#

The methods for the development of a CAD to detect ARDS are described in this section and shown in Fig. 2
                     .

Opacities in ARDS are bilateral and diffuse. To analyze the normal and abnormal regions, we manually selected normal and abnormal patches of size 32×32 pixels in the intercostal regions with the help of an intensivist (PJ) in order to create the training set. 321 patches were thus selected and diagnosed (avoiding the anterior and posterior ribs) from 9 radiographs. 4 radiographs presented ARDS and 5 others did not (4 normal cases and 1 case with left lung affected). A patch is considered abnormal if about 90% of its surface contains opacity.

In order to extract the intercostal patches, we first removed the anterior and posterior ribs׳ regions from the images.

Ribs in chest radiographs are considered as normal structures in the context of ARDS diagnosis. Locating the anterior and posterior ribs allows us to subsequently analyze exclusively the intercostal regions that may contain opacities. These are generally diffuse in the case of ARDS.

To achieve this objective, we have used in this work an algorithm for semiautomatic segmentation of ribs developed by Plourde et al. [21] which allows us to segment anterior and posterior ribs in chest radiographs by only identifying four points for every rib (two points at the beginning of each rib and two points at the end), as shown in Fig. 3
                           . The final rib border is obtained by finding the most parallel pair among the detected edges. This algorithm is based on an oriented filtering and edge following approach with multiple-path branching [21]. This method has already shown a good accuracy in a previous work and is capable of segmenting the entire rib [21] which corresponds to what is needed in our study.

We segmented only the ribs over pulmonary tissue (between 6 and 11 ribs for each lung; thus, between 12 and 22 ribs were segmented per chest radiograph depending on the latter). We also eliminated parts of the lungs near the heart which contain vessels that are in fact, normal structures, but resemble opacities. This is achieved through an appropriate choice of the two starting points on each rib. We also removed the parts of the lungs that are at the extremity since they show some similarities to the opacities (either because of the scapula or the pleural effusions).

Once the segmentation of the ribs was done, we removed them from the chest radiographs so as to only keep the intercostal regions (ROI) (Fig. 4
                           ). We then extracted the intercostal regions and we binarized them. We automatically browsed each intercostal region from left to right and from top to bottom until finding a block of size 32×32 pixels which all have a value of 1 (white). This means that the patch contains only the pixels belonging to the lung tissue between both ribs. Once we find the position of the white patch in the binary picture, we extract it from the original intercostal area for analysis as shown in Fig. 5
                           .

The 32×32 pixel patch׳s size was chosen because it is generally the optimal size that can be extracted from the intercostal area (smaller than or equal to the width of the intercostal regions). However, for smaller intercostal areas, 16×16 pixel patches were extracted as shown in Fig. 6
                           .

During the diagnosis, doctors take into account the variation of contrast between the skin tissue and the background. If it is large, then the patient is considered to be underexposed (white chest radiograph) and poorly penetrated. In this case, the chest radiograph is too bright and does not have enough contrast.

To solve this problem, we first calculated automatically the contrast between the skin tissue and the background for each chest radiograph by averaging neighboring pixels of the most lateral point of the fourth left rib, which is close enough to the skin tissue of the left lung. The background in a chest radiograph is normally black. If the difference in intensity is high, we apply the CLAHE (Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) preprocessing technique to improve the local contrast.

In this work, we used both statistical features (the histogram and the co-occurrence matrix) and spectral features (the Fourier transform).

Using the central moments can be a good method to represent quantitatively a histogram. This can be represented by the following formulas:

                           Six texture descriptors based on the intensity histogram were used as shown in Table 1
                           .

However, the histogram-based features do not capture the spatial relationships between the pixels׳ intensities. These relationships can be represented numerically using grayscale spatial dependence matrices, also called co-occurrence matrices. These determine the frequency of occurrence of a “pattern” formed of two pixels separated by a certain distance dis in a particular direction θ relative to the horizontal axis [22]. Co-occurrence matrices can show the degree of similarity or dissimilarity of adjacent pixels. A region of interest with opacity will contain adjacent pixels that have similar high intensities. Four features are extracted from the co-occurrence matrix: energy, contrast, homogeneity and correlation.

Spectral texture measurements for our study are based on the Fourier spectrum. In the frequency spectrum, the high frequencies show the strong variations between dark areas and opacities, which make them useful for our work. To facilitate interpretation of spectrum features, the spectrum is expressed in polar coordinates by the function 
                              S
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              θ
                              )
                           , where S is the function of spectrum and r and θ are the independent variables in the polar system [23]. The global description of the spectral energy is obtained by summing the following two functions:

The descriptors of these functions can be computed to characterize their quantitative behavior. Typical descriptors used for this purpose are the mean and variance of the function as well as the distance between the mean and the maximum value of the function [23].

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a method with the objective of finding an optimal linear transformation of features that separates 2 or more classes. The best transformation is the one that shows a maximum distance between the different classes and a minimum distance between elements of each class [24].

We used as a classifier, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) with a Gaussian kernel, to classify patches as normal or abnormal. The SVM is a technique developed by Vapnik [26] and has shown its effectiveness in the field of medical imaging and other fields. An SVM classifier looks for an optimal hyperplane as a decision function in a high-dimensional space, i.e., the one with the maximum distance from the nearest training patterns [27].

To effectively implement the SVM, it is necessary to optimize the values of the hyper-parameters C and γ of the Gaussian kernel. C is the constant of soft margin. This parameter is used to fix the tradeoff between minimizing the training error and maximizing the margin, while γ is the parameter of the Gaussian kernel. To choose the best hyper-parameters, we applied the SVM classifier on the training database using the leave-one-out validation strategy. The classification results were evaluated using measures of sensitivity and specificity. Then we plot the Received Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which shows the true positive fraction (sensitivity) as a function of the false positive fraction (1-specificity). The ROC curve is used to select the optimal hyper-parameters that give the best classification performance.

ARDS is defined as the presence of bilateral opacities. Before making a diagnosis of ARDS, doctors generally divide each lung into two parts called quadrants (Fig. 7
                           ). If at least two quadrants (one on the left lung and one on the right lung) are affected, then they consider the radiograph as an ARDS case. After having classified the patches, the ratio of affected patches in each quadrant is calculated by the following formula:

The ratio of affected patches is equal to the number of affected patches divided by the total number of patches.

Since the 16×16 patch׳s size is equivalent to one-quarter of a 32×32 patch, we multiplied the number of 16×16 patches by 0.25 (one-fourth):

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

Experiments were applied on 90 chest radiographs (test set), including 53 ARDS chest radiographs. We calculated the six characteristics of the histogram, the four characteristics of the co-occurrence matrix and the six spectral characteristics for each patch. We calculated the co-occurrence matrix with given orientations θ ∈ {0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°} and given distance dis=1. So at the end, we got 32 features for each patch as shown in Table 2
                        . For the training database X, we created two classes: a class of abnormal patches X1 containing 
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           165
                         patches diagnosed as abnormal and a class of normal patches X2 containing n
                        2=156 patches diagnosed as normal and each patch is described by 32 features.

Then we applied the feature transformation using the LDA method on the training dataset to find the optimum projection direction. We then projected each vector from the test dataset onto this optimum projection.

We applied the SVM classifier on the training database using the leave-one-out validation. This strategy consists of browsing the database and deleting temporarily the Kth data, where K is the number of data used (321 patches), and form the training set from the K−1 data (320 patches). The deleted K data is used as the test data. The same process is repeated K times (321times).

We calculated the sensitivity and the specificity for the training database of patches (validation set) while varying the hyper-parameters C and γ. We obtained the ROC curve as shown in Fig. 8
                           . The best performance is obtained when using C equal to 1000 and γ equal to 1000. It has sensitivity of 90.9% at specificity of 94.9%.

To classify the patches of the test database, 90 chest radiographs have been segmented semi-automatically to eliminate the entire ribs belonging to the two lungs. A total of 4536 patches were automatically extracted from the intercostal regions for analysis. It was not clinically relevant to analyze the 4536 patches of all radiographs as it was not the way clinicians work (analysis of the chest radiograph is not done by patch in clinical practice but by visual analysis of the global lung parenchymal texture). So we did not construct a test database with patch classification. The choice of the threshold value from which we consider the quadrant as affected was determined quantitatively while the intensivists determined that threshold qualitatively or intuitively. So we decided to choose the threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity for the 30 radiographs of the training dataset (11 radiographs with ARDS, 11 normal radiographs and 8 radiographs with unilateral opacity), which led us to a judicious choice of the threshold value.

We varied the threshold from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.1 and we plotted the ROC curve in order to choose the threshold that maximizes the two measures: sensitivity and specificity. According to the ROC curve in Fig. 9
                           , the threshold which gives a good performance (sensitivity=90.9% at specificity=94.7%) is equal to 34%.

The final diagnosis or the result of chest classification is obtained after having calculated the opacity rate for each quadrant. If this rate is greater than 34%, then the quadrant is considered as affected. And if the opacities are bilateral (located in the left and the right lungs), then the chest radiograph presents an ARDS case.

We evaluated the ROC curves for four different scenarios to show the relevance of each class of features. In Fig. 10
                           , we can see that texture analysis based on the combination of the three types of texture features outperforms the use of one kind of feature only (histogram or co-occurrence matrix or spectral features). For the automatic analysis of the 90 chest radiographs based on statistical and spectral texture features, the results of classification gave a sensitivity of 90.6% at a specificity of 86.5% (Table 3
                           ).

These results show that our system has a good performance. We also note that our automatic system is more sensitive than specific and therefore there are less false negative cases. The intensivists prefer to be more sensitive, since early diagnosis of ARDS has the advantage of using a reduced tidal volume and thereby avoiding the complications that can be caused by the treatment (mechanical ventilation).

According to our knowledge, this computer-aided diagnosis system for the detection of ARDS is considered as the first such system that evaluates this disease. ARDS introduces high inter-observer variability in chest radiograph interpretation which makes the development of an automatic system challenging. However our study of the variability of diagnosis between intensivists and the reconstruction of chest radiographs database diagnosed with consensus allowed to realize such a system. This system aims to interpret the chest radiograph, which is the most limiting factor among the four diagnostic criteria of ARDS defined by the AECC. The other three criteria (Acute situation, PaO2/FiO2 
                              <
                              200
                              
                              mmHg
                            and no clinical evidence of left heart failure) should be taken into consideration to establish a global diagnosis which is not studied in this work. The semiautomatic segmentation was used to analyze the intercostal regions (ROI) and eliminate other unnecessary areas for the diagnosis (ribs, heart, skin tissue, diaphragm, etc.). In addition the analysis of intercostal patches allows the intensivists to locate abnormalities on the chest radiograph by framing affected patches in black and the other patches in white (Fig. 11
                           ). Locating parts of the lungs that need to be ventilated to help the patient breathing can be very useful during treatment.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented a computer-aided diagnosis system for the detection of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in chest radiographs. Our method is based on texture analysis applied on intercostal patches which are selected automatically after having segmented the entire ribs. Statistical and spectral features are extracted from each patch and classified with an SVM. Finally, the classification of the chest radiographs is realized after calculating the opacity rate for each quadrant. Experiments were performed on a test dataset containing 90 chest radiographs, and therefore this tool can be used by intensivists to get a second opinion of diagnosis and elaborate an early diagnosis of the disease for improving its treatment. To show the utility of such a system, a comparison between the intensivist׳s assessment of chest radiographs and the CAD system for the detection of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is undertaken.
