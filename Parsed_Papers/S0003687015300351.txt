                  In traditional approaches of human reliability assessment (HRA), the definition of the error producing conditions (EPCs) and the supporting guidance are such that some of the conditions (especially organizational or managerial conditions) can hardly be included, and thus the analysis is burdened with incomprehensiveness without reflecting the temporal trend of human reliability. A method based on system dynamics (SD), which highlights interrelationships among technical and organizational aspects that may contribute to human errors, is presented to facilitate quantitatively estimating the human error probability (HEP) and its related variables changing over time in a long period. Taking the Minuteman III missile accident in 2008 as a case, the proposed HRA method is applied to assess HEP during missile operations over 50 years by analyzing the interactions among the variables involved in human-related risks; also the critical factors are determined in terms of impact that the variables have on risks in different time periods. It is indicated that both technical and organizational aspects should be focused on to minimize human errors in a long run.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

More and more industrial accidents involve human and organizational factors, in addition to failures or malfunctions that are taken as technical factors. The accidents occurring in recent years, such as Minuteman III missile accident in 2008 and Fukushima disaster in 2011, indicate that human activities and organizational aspects are playing increasingly critical roles in modern industrial operations, and unexpected human errors or ineffective organization can probably lead to severe output. It is fundamentally significant to take human errors into account more than in the past, when conducting safety assessment or accident investigation, but it has been increasingly challenging to assess human reliability due to the complexity and dynamics within socio-technical systems.

Human reliability assessment (HRA) is often used to deal with the risks related to human errors (Boring and Bye, 2008; Boring et al., 2009; Ung and Shen, 2011), and one of the fundamental functions of HRA is to predict human error probability (HEP) (Gertman et al., 2005; van de Merwe et al., 2012). There are typical HRA methods, such as Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) (Williams, 1988) and Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) (Swain and Guttmann, 1983), which predict the HEP via analyzing and evaluating various factors influencing the human performance (termed here as Error Producing Conditions, EPCs). Thus the aspects that may contribute to human errors and the determination of various EPCs corresponding to the contributing aspects are the most important inputs for human reliability analysis process, which will hopefully be beneficial to the investigation of accidents especially involving human operations.


                     Lee et al. (2013) describe the issues that should be considered in HEP estimation, and presented a method for quantifying human errors that can occur during operation executions and applied it to nuclear industry. Park (2008) suggests a method of HEP estimation referred as AHP-SLIM to overcome the lack of empirical data and thus to obtain a more accurate estimation. Sun et al. (2012) present a modified method of Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) to provide the point estimation of HEP for probabilistic safety assessment. Podofillini and Dang (2013) propose a method to empirically study the effect of an EPC on HEP to make sure that the definitions of the EPCs cover the influences important for HRA, and that the quantitative relationships among EPCs and error probability are adequately represented. However, one of the major limitations of the existing HRA methods in general is that few of them attempt to provide a causal picture of human errors (Groth and Mosleh, 2012), given the fact that the risk-contributing aspects interact with each other during the process rather than act independently. Another limitation is that most HRA methods are static analysis, and the calculated HEP is constant under given conditions. However, when considering the dynamic behaviors within a socio-technical system, the probability of a certain action is not necessarily stable but may vary enormously with organizational factors (e.g., management system, cost budget, and schedule target) or personal factors (e.g., safety awareness, time pressure, and physical rhythm) in addition to technical factors such as failures or degradations of equipment. The points above affect the comprehensive insight of human reliability as well as the model construction and verification for the calculation of HEP.

Therefore, the conventional approaches are challenged and some methods are developed to efficiently derive the relationships among EPCs and the error probability. In order to gain a full understanding and comprehensive awareness of human error in socio-technical systems, it is necessary to use a systemic approach to consider all the aspects that may lead to accidents or hazardous events. “System Dynamics (SD) deals with the time-dependent behavior of managed systems, with the aim of describing the system and understanding, through qualitative and quantitative models, how information feedback governs its behavior, and designing robust information feedback structures and control policies through simulation and optimization.”(Dangelico et al., 2010) When analyzing human factors in accidents, SD can be taken as a means to depict the system behaviors, including the interactions among human errors and other human-related contributing factors, given the causes identified and causality of accident that are analyzed in our preliminary research elaborated in (Rong and Tian, 2015).

As the follow-up work of (Rong and Tian, 2015), this article aims to contribute to HRA by proposing a temporal uncertainty analysis method of human errors that considers causality within a socio-technical system and produces quantitative assessment decisions. Such a method will be capable of accommodating modeling of all critical EPCs involved in a socio-technical system. The generic human error causal analysis method based on Systems Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes (STAMP) is proposed in (Rong and Tian, 2015), which is briefly reviewed here to clarify the context of the research in this article, also the motivation for connection between the qualitative analysis of accident and the quantitative assessment are expounded. To model and assess HEP, an SD flow chart with quantitative correlations between variables is developed in accordance with accident causality, and then based on simulation results, strategies of risk mitigation are suggested as well as verifications implemented.

@&#METHOD@&#

To identify human errors and all of the critical human-related contributing factors, systemic analysis is needed because accidents are complex processes involving working of the entire socio-technical system, and factors contributing to human errors exist in almost all aspects of the system as well. Human errors can be caused by failures of hardware or software, environmental interference, or safety culture and management, in addition to the inherent causes of human (i.e., physical or psychological factors). In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the causality of an accident that seems to result directly from some human errors, human operations have to be viewed as complex processes involving most of the aspects of the socio-technical system. Based on this consideration, first the human-related accident is systemically analyzed, as well as all of the human errors and human-related contributing factors are identified. Next, the effects of contributing factors on human errors are analyzed, and then the causality among these contributing factors and human errors are summarized. Finally, based on the two qualitative steps above, quantitative assessment is conducted which includes three steps: identify EPCs and determine the functions of HEP calculation, model and assess HEP, and discuss the results.


                        Rong and Tian (2015) present the method to identify human errors and human-related contributing factors within a socio-technical system based on STAMP (Leveson, 2011) which was proposed by borrowing the ideas in the cybernetics of systems theory. In STAMP, the most basic concept is not “event”, but “constraint”, which means that safety is taken as a control problem where the goal of the control is to effectively enforce the safety constraints. The cause of an accident, instead of being understood as a series of events in the sequential accident models, is viewed as a result of inadequate control or enforcement of the safety constraints during system development and operation (Leveson, 2011). The socio-technical system is accordingly modeled with a hierarchical control structure, where the controllers at each level impose constraints on the activities at the lower level(s). Based on this underpinning, the safety constraints and system requirements associated with the accident are identified, and the hierarchical structure of safety control in place to mitigate the hazards and enforce the safety constraints is constructed. Then the factors of human-related hazards in the operating process (inadequate control in technical aspects) and each successively higher level allows or contributes to the inadequate control at the lower level (inadequate control in social aspects). With all the identified inadequate controls, the human errors and subsequently all the human-related contributing factors are summarized.

Next, the causality among these contributing factors and human errors are explored. The effects of contributing factors on human errors are analyzed first, and then the effects among only the contributing factors are considered. To facilitate the quantitative analysis of the causal relationships, all the identified contributing factors are categorized according to their different types of relationship with human errors. In order to identify the EPCs to give priority when preventing human errors, the identified contributing factors are classified into two categories: direct and indirect influencing factors. It is noted that the feedbacks need to be identified to assist refining the model, as pointed out in both STAMP and SD. There are feedback effects of human errors on other organizational and technical factors, e.g., managers tend to pay more attention to human operations once human errors occurred.

The qualitative identification of the human errors and contributing factors can be succeeded by quantitative analysis of HEP and risk mitigation suggestions accordingly. SD modeling and simulation is adopted to indicate system conditions changing over time, which can be reflected by the level of parameters such as HEP. The temporal analysis is conducted by the steps below.
                           
                              1)
                              Identify EPCs and determine the function of HEP calculation

EPCs are the factors of a system that can affect operators’ performance, reliability, and their recovery from encountered errors (Sandom and Harvey, 2004). When determining EPCs, the direct human-related contributing factors should be attached more weight to. At present, most of the mature HRA methods (e.g., HEART, THERP and so on) have special viewpoints on HEP calculation, and they may have the database for the EPCs, probabilities, or the calculation functions. Even though the methods may differ with each other in naming for the factors, the categorization is nearly in the same way. HEART quantification method, which is typically based on the principle that HEP can be calculated through one or more given EPCs and the EPCs are applied to estimate of the failure probability under specific conditions to then obtain a final error chance (Williams, 1988), is adopted in this article. According to HEART, the proper generic HEP (p
                        
                           BHE
                        ) first needs to be selected among various pre-established task categories, and the probability then has to be multiplied by some coefficients to take into account the EPCs in terms of the case analyzed. Williams (1988) provides the database with the probability data for all the task categories, which enables analysts to select the associated one according to the task feature analyzed. Besides, efforts are needed to justify the correspondence between EPCs and the identified human-related contributing factors, so as to determine the EPCs and the function of HEP calculation.

                        Ericson (2005) indicates that to calculate the APOA of EPCs, “all assessors need to do is estimate using his own judgment”. However, the HEP may ﬂuctuate continuously with time due to the EPCs changing over a long period, and the APOA determined by analysts tends to be dynamic rather than a static point (Gertman et al., 2005). Gertman et al. (2005) provide the references that the ideal mean likelihood of human error (LHE) can be taken as a function of EPC influence, showing that the relationships between LHE and EPCs are positively correlated, i.e., LHE increases as the negative influence of the EPC grows.

                              Establish SD model and assess HEP

Socio-technical systems usually have typical features like: extremely complex, consisting of multiple interdependent components; highly dynamic; involving multiple feedback processes; and involving nonlinear relationships (Dulac, 2007). When human errors in a socio-technical system are focused on, the relationships between EPCs and human errors, as well as the relationships among EPCs, are supposed to be analyzed. These relationships may be nonlinear as feedback effects exist among dynamic system factors. Hence SD, which is an effective means able to help analyze the characteristics in complex dynamic systems by modeling the relationships among contributing factors, is adopted to assess HEP over time.

Basically the ways used in SD modeling to illustrate the structure of the investigated system are causal loop diagram (CLD) and stock/flow diagrams (Dangelico et al., 2010). CLD is a graphical description visualizing how the multiple variables in a system are interrelated, and was developed long before SD but used as an indispensable part of SD modeling. Through SD explanation, CLD is composed of model components linked with arrows and thus feedback loop(s) can be illustrated if there is any. When determining a CLD, a human error module and a system module are included. Based on an assessment function of HEP (e.g., the Equation (1)) the human error module is constructed, where the relationships between EPCs and human errors are reflected. The system module is built according to the causality analysis in which hazards and factors contributing to the accident are identified. The relationships among EPCs, as well as control and feedback effects between system module and human error module are reflected in the CLD. According to the CLD, stock and flow diagrams are then constructed, in which the type of all variables and initial values are determined based on the result of causality analysis conducted previously.

                              Develop and verify strategies of risk mitigation

Through SD simulation, the tendency of HEP and its related variables changing over time can be observed. The human-related contributing factors which have higher influence on occurrence of human errors and hence on accident risks are analyzed and identified as weak points according to the simulation results. Based on the influence of the contributing factors, risk mitigation strategies are developed with priority given to the top-ranking factors. Additionally, effectiveness of the strategies needs to be verified before implementation.

Taking the accident of MM III missile (which has been indicated to be a typical human-related fire accident) as a case, the temporal analysis of HEP was conducted based on the method proposed in Section 2.

On 23 May 2008, a fire broke out in MM III Launch Facility (LF) A06 that located near F.E. Warren Air Force Base (AFB), WY. By briefly summarizing the official accident report (Walker, 2008), Table 1
                      shows a timeline of the human activities involved as well as the related environmental situations and technical factors.

In the MM III operating process, the features of most tasks are consistent with “Restore or shift a system to original or new state following procedures, with some checking” (Williams, 1988), and the related value 0.003 is chosen accordingly as the basic HEP.


                        Rong and Tian (2015) identifies four human errors in this accident: 1) no periodical inspection of the LF, 2) flammable substances allowed to be there in the LER, 3) the maintenance team delayed to assign to the LF, and 4) errors in modification of the battery charger, causing the loose connection. The former two allowed the hazards to propagate and induce the accident, and the third contributed to the damage caused by the accident. Based on the hierarchical structure of safety control, six categories of human-related contributing factors in the operating process were identified according to their relationships with human errors: 1) Equipment Technology Level, 2) Experience, 3) Task Pressure, 4) Personal Commitment to Safety (a measure of safety awareness for personnel), 5) Management Commitment to Safety (a measure of safety assurance for managers, including training, task planning and safety culture), and 6) Management Commitment to Fighting Capability (a measure of fighting capability assurance for managers) (Rong and Tian, 2015).

When choosing EPCs, the human-related contributing factors which have direct influence on human errors were given priority to. By analyzing effects of the factors in (Rong and Tian, 2015), it was indicated that Equipment Technology Levels, Experience, Task Pressure and Personal Commitment to Safety have direct effects on human errors, so that they were regarded as EPCs. The EPCs and the maximum effect N
                        
                           i
                         that correspond to the four factors above were selected from the HEART database, with the details shown in Table 2
                        . Based on the Equation (1), the HEP calculation is refined and expressed as (2), which will be input to the SD model as a basic quantitative definition of relationships among variables in the model.

In (Rong and Tian, 2015) the accident causal relationships are identified, which indicates that to some degree Management Commitment to Safety contradicted Management Commitment to Fighting Capability. Also, Management Commitment to Safety influenced personnel by training and task planning, which caused changing experience and task pressure, and it influenced Personal Commitment to Safety through safety culture. Additionally, Equipment Technology Level, as well as Experience, Task Pressure and Personal Commitment to Safety, contributed to the inadequate control of operating process, which might ultimately lead to human errors.

However, based on the requirement for risk control, managers would be likely to create control according to the information about the state of safety in operation. When human errors are focused on, the HEP can be viewed as a type of indicator measuring system risk. Normally managers would give response once human errors are confirmed, hence there are feedbacks flowing to Management Commitment to Safety, and to Fighting Capability, respectively. When personnel in operating process get aware of their errors, Personal Commitment to Safety will usually be increased to better their behaviors, thus there is a third feedback flowing to Personal Commitment to Safety.

As described above, through adding required auxiliary variables (i.e., numbers, total experience and effect), the CLD (overview) of the MM III operation system was obtained and shown in Fig. 1
                           .

In Fig. 1, the overview of interactions among the six categories of human-related contributing factors and human errors is primarily depicted, with major variables linked by arrows presented to show the causal influence between them. A polarity (positive or negative) is associated to each causal link, expressing the influence of a variable on the other one which is dependent on it. The direct effects on human errors are shown as four thick solid arrows. All the feedback effects of human error are shown as three dotted arrows.

The CLD in Fig. 1 is not only a description of the causal relationships among human errors and their contributing factors, but also a modeling basis of the SD stock/flow diagram. Some thinking about mathematical modeling for the relationships between variables was also represented initially. In this case, a general thinking of using a relative value (which is a current value divided by its ideal one) to represent the effect of a factor on another, and the relative value were taken as a multiplier of some other variables in an SD function. The calculation of HEP was based on the Equation (2), and the positive correlation discussed in Section 2 was applied to describing the relationships between APOAs and the related EPCs. Meanwhile, in order to model the average Experience and Task Pressure, some required auxiliary variables such as Total Experience, Current Number of Soldiers were added.

The main causal loops were observed after establishing the relationships between variables. In Fig. 1, there are three feedback channels which are represented with two balancing loops (B1 and B2) and one reinforcing loop (R1). Loop B1 causes a positive change of safety management (training and task planning) in response to the increase in the HEP, and Loop B2 provides a positive change to Personal Commitment to Safety (personal safety awareness) when operators are aware of their errors. Loop R1 represents improvement of fighting capability when HEP is at a high level, which weakens the Management Commitment to Safety and leads to a higher HEP.

The obtained causal loop diagram was then converted to a stock/flow diagram which enables quantitative assessment of the variables in SD model. The model requires explicating all the time-dependent relationships represented by connecting arrows. As shown in Fig. 2
                           , the stock/flow diagram was developed by using the VENSIM PLE software package, and consists of two modules: the system module (which contains all the human-related contributing factors and their relationships) and the human error module (which explains the calculation of HEP over time).

The model includes five state array variables (i.e., Management Commitment to Safety, Management Commitment to Fighting Capability, Personal Commitment to Safety, Current Number of Soldiers, and Total Experience), eight array flows (i.e., Change in Management Commitment to Safety, Change in Management Commitment to Fighting Capability, Change in Personal Commitment to Safety, Hiring, Quit, Increase in Experience from Hiring, Increase in Experience from Training and Task, and Loss of Experience from Attrition), time lags (i.e., Time to Provide Training) and a considerable number of auxiliary variables and array constants, employed mainly for the determination of the relationships among the human-related contributing factors and human errors. In order to simulate the SD model, the relationships between variables need to be represented in mathematical terms. Based on the established SD model, the mathematical quantitative correlations behind between variables were determined (listed in Table 3
                           ) and elaborated in respect of three types below:
                              
                                 1)
                                 Management Commitment to Safety, Management Commitment to Fighting Capability, and Personal Commitment to Safety

The three state array variables are quantified in [0, 1.2]. The larger the value, the more commitment there is, hence the equations are similar in character. These variables are integrals of which the values vary from time to time, whereas the maximum (i.e., target value) is frequently restricted to achieve by the human-related contributing factors. Taking the variable Management Commitment to Fighting Capability as an example, it is expounded how the mathematical relationships were determined. The major equations involving this variable are shown as the Equations (3)–(8).

In the Equation (5) the variable Target Management Commitment to Fighting Capability is designed according to practical experience as well as Time to Change Management Commitment to Fighting Capability (set at 0.6). These equations typically describe negative feedback effects, in which the direction and amount of system adjustment is dependent on the gap between the actual and target state of the system. Relationships between Management Commitment to Fighting Capability and other contributing factors are reflected by Pressure to Change Management Commitment to Fighting Capability (see the Equation (6)).

In the Equation (7), the Exponent approach (Cooke, 2004) is applied to design Effect of Human Error on Management Commitment to Fighting Capability. Herein, the variable Human Error Effect Exponent on Management Commitment to Fighting Capability indicates how much human errors influence Management Commitment to Fighting Capability. For the other two state array variables, similar exponents include Human Error Effect Exponent on Management Commitment to Safety and Human Error Effect Exponent on Personal Commitment to Safety, indicating the degree of feedback effects (long dotted line in Fig. 2) that human errors have on the system module. Human Error Effect Exponent on Management Commitment to Safety, Human Error Effect Exponent on Personal Commitment to Fighting Capability, and Human Error Effect Exponent on Personal Commitment to Safety were set at 0.8, 0.9, 0.4 respectively in terms of (Cooke, 2004; Mohaghegh-Ahmadabadi, 2007). Due to the more direct effects of human errors on fighting capability than on safety, Human Error Effect Exponent on Personal Commitment to Fighting Capability has a slightly higher level. However, human errors tend to have a weaker influence on personnel than on management, since there frequently is time delay in the feedback from human errors to personnel even if a human-related accident happens, and sometimes it is hard for the personnel to be aware that the accident is caused by their errors.

Besides, in the related equations of Management Commitment to Safety there is a key constant variable Fighting Capability Priority Exponent, which represents the conflict between Management Commitment to Fighting Capability and Management Commitment to Safety. This variable was designed by borrowing the idea from Production Priority Over Safety Exponent (set at 0.4) in coal mine systems (Cooke, 2004), and Financial Priority Exponent(set at 0.1) in aviation maintenance systems (Mohaghegh-Ahmadabadi, 2007). Considering that the ICBM system of MM III has similar safety requirements to those in aviation, and that there is a close analogy between the missile operation and aviation maintenance, Fighting Capability Priority Exponent was set at 0.1.

When determining Effect of Equipment Technology on Management Commitment to Fighting Capability, the relative value of Equipment Technology Level was adopted in the Equation (8). Current Equipment Technology Level (CETL) was designed as a variable changing over time in SD model, where the equation in (Bohm et al., 2008) was referred to but adapted feasibly as shown in the Equation (20).

                                    where A(t) = exp(K
                                    
                                       a

                                     is the aging coefficient estimated in terms of practical experience.

CETL was calculated as the sum of the aging A(t) and the improvement through regular maintenance i(t), taking into account that the equipment is yearly improved through maintenance in order to retain the required performance, and i in the accident was set at 0.03 based on experts’ knowledge. The level of CETL changing over time is shown in Fig. 3
                                    . It was observed that the yearly improvement does not make sufficient sense for retaining the performance of equipment, since Equipment Technology Level is not prevented effectively from decreasing.

Current Number of Soldiers, and Total Experience

The equations regarding Current Number of Soldiers and Total Experience were designed by referring to (Ouyang et al., 2010) and (Mohaghegh et al., 2009), with some array flows simplified to satisfy the context in this case. Current Number of Soldiers is influenced by recruitment (hiring) and retirement (quitting), and major equations involved are shown as the Equations (9)–(12).

In the Equation (10), Relative Management Commitment to Safety indicates the degree of influence that Management Commitment to Safety has on Hiring, and Effect of Relative Personal Commitment on quitting was designed as a Lookup function of Relative Personal Commitment to Safety. Total Experience is influenced by Training, Task and Hiring, as shown in the Equations (13)–(18).

As mentioned earlier, Personal Commitment to Safety has a direct effect on efficiency of gaining task experience, thus Relative Personal Commitment to Safety indicates that the degree of attention that personnel pay to safety is capable of reflecting the level of Increase in Experience from Task.

Human Error

According to the method described in Section 2 and HEART, the relationships for HEP calculation are depicted with the thick solid lines in Fig. 3 which demonstrates the SD model (flow chart), and HEP was calculated with the Equation (19). When determining the APOA for each EPC, the Lookup function in VENSIM PLE, which can describe the relationships between EPCs and HEP, was applied in terms of (Gertman et al., 2005).

Assuming 10 years longer than the common service life of the missile, the model was run for a period of 50 years, which supports both verifying and predicting the MM III operation system state. Considering the quarter-year plan in practice, the time step in simulation was set at 0.25 year.

In the original run, the curve of the HEP (see Fig. 4
                        ) over time can be divided into two phases which differ from each other in feature, and the cut-off point is around the year 25. The curve fluctuates with decrease in amplitude before the point; but after that the HEP continues to increase. Accordingly, two phases showing different tendency was observed in both the curves of variables Management Commitment to Safety (see Fig. 5
                        ) and Personal Commitment to Safety (see Fig. 6
                        ) over time.

The “Causes Strip” function in VENSIM PLE was used to analyze the causal variables of HEP, and the analysis results are shown in Fig. 4. Obviously it is Personal Commitment to Safety that has the dominant effect on HEP before the cut-off point, that is, HEP is fundamentally dependent on the effect of safety culture involved in Management Commitment to Safety, as discussed in Section 3.2. In correspondence with the fluctuation of HEP in the phase before the cut-off point, Management Commitment to Safety fluctuates over time in the same phase due to the influence of human errors. The HEP is maintained at an acceptable level in the earlier phase, which tends to lead to possible negligence of management, or rather, to less attention paid to potential accidents, and thus results in decrease in Management Commitment to Safety. Besides, the degradation over time in equipment technology level is likely to bring about increase in HEP. More concern is brought to safety so that even Management Commitment to Safety can get up to the maximum of level and hold on for some time, once HEP keeps increasing and ultimately goes beyond the threshold of tolerance. As the result of enhanced management, the HEP turns to be going down. Due to the delay in the influence that Management Commitment to Safety has on Personal Commitment to Safety through safety culture, Personal Commitment to Safety displays the similar trend to Management Commitment to Safety, yet with a slightly later change and larger amplitude of fluctuation (see Fig. 6). The similar facts were found commonly in the SD model due to the expanded influence of the variable Management Commitment Effect Time on Personnel.

After the cut-off point, it is Equipment Technology Level instead that dominantly affects HEP. The continuous increase of HEP leads to the maximum of Management Commitment to Safety (see Fig. 5) and Personal Commitment to Safety (see Fig. 6), which lasts in the rest of the time period after the cut-off point, and means the most attention to safety paid by management department. However, even the most enhanced safety management is less likely to turn around the trend of increase in HEP caused by deteriorated level of equipment, which means the total risk is increasingly getting higher and may lead to accident ultimately.

Based on the simulation results, it is suggested that the two points below should be highlighted or given priority of consideration when developing mitigation strategies:
                           
                              1)
                              The equipment technology level should be better maintained at a satisfactory level through improving the maintenance and repair plan of missile supporting equipment.

The safety atmosphere or safety culture is significant, in a long run, for reduction of the HEP fluctuation as well as for mitigation of human errors probably occurring during operations. The development of safety culture should start as early as possible and last throughout the service period of the missile.

In order to verify effectiveness of the proposed measures, some variables in SD model were re-valued experimentally to test how HEP responds. Simulations were conducted by taking three different strategies that are related respectively to control of Equipment Technology Level (the technology run), to control of Personal Commitment to Safety (the management run), and to both of the control above (the technology-management run).

In the technology run, it is assumed that missile supporting equipment are maintained at an ideal level by setting i at a larger value in the Equation (3) from the initial time, and thus the Equipment Technology Level over time changes from Curve A to Curve B shown in Fig. 7
                        . Practically it means upgrading of the critical equipment used in system operations, and that the failure rates of equipment decrease. In Table 4
                        , the fluctuation of HEP curve illustrates that it is managerial factors that fundamentally cause human errors when equipment technology level is not the factor contributing dominantly to human errors. The trend of HEP's fluctuation reflects that slackness alternates with wariness in management to human errors, whereas the amplitude of HEP fluctuation is almost as large as that in the original run, which means that there is limitation in the strategy suggested to decrease human errors effectively.

In the management run, the value of Human Error Effect Exponent on Management Commitment to Safety was set at 0.4 instead of the original 0.9, which means the more attention of managers in response to human errors.


                        Table 4 shows the effectiveness of this strategy in the earlier time period due to HEP fluctuation restrained; yet in the later period it is the degradation of Equipment Technology Level that contributes dominantly to human errors, and thus the suggested strategy is not able to reverse the trend of continuous increase in HEP.

In the technology-management run, the re-valued variables in the both runs above were adopted to facilitate a third strategy, aiming to reduce human errors by integrating the organizational and technical means which were applied respectively in the two previous strategies. In Table 4 HEP is shown as an instable and increasing trend respectively in the technology run and the management run; whereas in the technology-management run it is maintained at a lower level with smaller amplitude of fluctuation, which means the control to instability and to increasing trend of risk is reconciled.

All in all, the state of both Equipment Technology Level and Personal Commitment to Safety should be focused on, that is, the technical and organizational aspects should be highlighted simultaneously so as to control human errors effectively.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on improvement to the conventional methods of HRA, a framework of HRA was built with focus on human-related contributing factors from the systemic and dynamic viewpoint, rather than the calculation of static HEP per se. According to the framework, SD approach was employed to model the interrelationships among the factors in missile operations that may contribute to accidents, in order to quantitatively analyze the migration of HEP over time, as well as to identify the factor(s) that might contribute dominantly to HEP in a long term (e.g., 50 years). This temporal uncertainty analysis explicitly reflects the long-term behavior of a socio-technical system with various human operations under the given conditions, and enables people to look at potential trade-offs between short-term profits and sustainable long-term improvement. Also, due to the prediction of the level of variables related to the contributing factors, the timing when the factors have significant impact on the system behaviors can be estimated, and taken as reference for decision-makers to determine what aspect should be given priority to when developing strategies for different time periods.

Taking an accident of missile operations as a case, the long-term HEP and its contributing variables were analyzed. The tendency of the curves characterizes the long-term change of the variables' level, and assists in improving technical conditions and organizational aspects during missile operations. Through the simulations, the factors of Equipment Technology Level (technical aspect) and Personal Commitment to Safety (organizational aspect) are suggested being focused on to derive or improve requirements for missile operations. Besides, through the strategy tests, it is suggested that human errors decrease most effectively if advisable control in both technical and organizational aspects can be adopted simultaneously. It is concluded in the officially-issued accident report that the direct cause of the accident was related to a loose connection at the capacitor C101A of the battery charger inside A06's launcher equipment room (Walker, 2008), but there is a lack of further exploration for the causes of the equipment failure. By comparing the results in this study with the accident report, we are inspired that human errors in the operating process can be characterized in a global perspective and be quantitatively depicted during a long term, which is not discussed even in the official accident report but definitely makes much sense.

More significantly, the idea that suggests examining dynamic characteristics of human activities (or human errors) by using SD can also apply to other types of socio-technical systems where human activities are involved and human errors are attached weight to, and the proposed method can be adopted given the corresponding causal relationship and data as inputs of modeling.

Although the insight regarding temporal uncertainty analysis of human errors has contributed to HRA in the aspect of quantification of the qualitative causality model, there are limitations below in this work:
                        
                           1)
                           The SD model is demonstrated with its two main parts, i.e., “human error” construct and “system” construct, but specific details about how to establish the constructs, particularly those for quantifying human-related accident causalities, are provided in a relatively simplified way. Consequently, the description of the interactions between human, organizational, social and physical elements of a real-world system has to depend largely on the way that the analysts look at the system, due to the simplified guidelines for modeling.

In order to ensure a high credibility of the SD model representing a real-world system, a comprehensive method including qualitative and quantitative tests is needed to validate the model structure and behavior. The case study in this paper has illustrated how the proposed approach can help quantitatively analyze human errors, and explored the feasibility in risk mitigation strategies assessment. Yet a validity checking for SD model, as well as a data gathering method used for validation, has not been given at present due to the lack of historical data for modeling.

The view in this method stays at a holistic level, with the focus on assessment of human errors by calculating HEP, and it has not shed more light on risk-related phenomena at the level of individual tasks or operation procedures. The lack of specific modeling of human operation errors may negatively affect the widespread application of this method in human behavior studies.

The limitations of the proposed method give us new thoughts as a suggestion for our future study, and further efforts are needed to improve the method. Future work can be progressed in the investigation into the relationships modeling of social or technical factors within socio-technical systems, and the investigation result will hopefully support extension of the SD modeling, and subsequently bring stronger practicality in safety engineering. Efforts will also focus on the method of data collection and processing to the gathered data, so as to justify the SD model with less dependence on analysts' knowledge and bias. An alternative approach to gather data can be working directly with appropriate industry associations. Further work is also needed to enhance the human behavior modeling with the highlight on specific operation tasks, which will help with human error control at a deeper technical level.
