                  A Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) partnership places the responsibility on the vendor (rather than on buyers) to schedule purchase orders for inventory replenishment in the supply chain system. In this research, the supply chain network considers the Silver–Meal heuristic with an augmentation quantity replenishment policy between both traditional and VMI systems. We consider time-varying stochastic demand in two-echelon (one vendor, multiple retailers) supply chains. This paper seeks to find the supply chain that minimizes system cost through comparing performance between traditional and VMI systems. A mathematical model is developed, and total supply chain cost is used as the measure of comparison. The models are applied in both traditional and VMI supply chains based on pharmaceutical industry data, and we focus on total cost difference compared through the use of Adjusted Silver–Meal (ASM) and Least Unit Cost heuristics. Finally, a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis are also illustrated to show the applicability of the model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The most common type of a supply chain system is a traditional model in which the downstream stage makes decisions regarding local stock levels and the risks associated with replenishment decisions (Lee & Chu, 2005). VMI is one such efficient replenishment system; it is designed to improve the profitability of the supply chain. In a VMI system, the supplier manages and monitors inventory and make purchase order decisions instead of the buyer, so it is essential for the vendor to select retailers and wholesale prices to maximize profit. Yugang, Zhaofu, Linda, Liang, and Chengbin (2013) formulated the retailer selection problem so a vendor could optimally select his retailers to form a VMI system, and Verma, Chakraborty, and Chatterjee (2014) proposed an alternative model for a single vendor/multiple retailer case under a VMI partnership. Pasandideh, Niaki, and Nia (2010) point out that in a vendor managed inventory supply chain, the supplier controls the retailer's inventory level to ensure desirable customer service levels maintained. Emigh (1999) mention that VMI can improve supply chain performance by decreasing inventory levels and increasing fill rates.

In today's world, all industries face challenges due to demand variability; these challenges may be produced internally or externally (Ramesh, 2009). Internally, demand variability can occur due to the introduction of a new product that includes similar characteristics of an existing product. Another internal way of creating demand instability could be due to poor communication between different stages of the supply chain: demand is increased upstream in the supply chain, a factor known as the bullwhip effect (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997). Externally, demand variability can be created by the competition, who might utilize different campaigns or sales incentives to influence their own sales. Both internal and external challenges may impact demand fluctuations and result in demand uncertainty, which is called stochastic demand. Thus, a stochastic demand case represents a more complex situation for determining the best replenishment policy.

A vendor selling a product to multiple buyers may encounter demand variability due to fluctuations in the volume of orders placed because of differences in buyer demand. This situation was analyzed by Cachon (1999), who proved that reducing demand variability at the vendor level can be achieved if the buyers are limited to order at specific intervals or if their order frequency is constant. The advantage of decreasing demand variability is identified in lower supply chain costs. Chen, Hao, Li, and Yiu (2012) studied vendors’ optimal distribution policies which are affected by demand uncertainty in a two-echelon setup with single supplier and two retailers; they analyzed the effects of demand variability and transshipment on policies in a VMI environment. Wang, Makond, and Liu (2011) addressed a facility location and task allocation problem of a two-echelon supply chain against stochastic demand, which revealed that the proposed algorithm could efficiently yield nearly optimal solutions against stochastic demands. Taleizadeh, Niaki, and Wee (2013) studied a joint single vendor-buyer supply chain problem with stochastic demand and fuzzy lead-time, which minimized the expected total cost by determining the reorder point and order quantity. Several authors discussed the benefits of VMI (Achabal, McIntyre, Smith, & Kalyanam, 2000; Borade, Govindan, & Bansod, 2013; Claassen, Van Weele, & Van Raaij, 2008; Dong & Leung, 2009; Govindan, Grigore, Devika, & Senthilkumar, 2013; Disney, Potter, & Gardner, 2003; Razmi, Rad, & Sangari, 2010; Shen, Govindan, Borade, Diabat, & Kannan, 2013; Yu & Huang, 2010) and for a more detailed study about VMI benefits, refer to Govindan (2013).
                  

Different industries encounter different characteristics of products which imply different characteristics of the demand patterns. Fisher (1997) categorized the nature of the products in two categories, functional and innovative products, and based on this classification a matching type of supply chain is suggested. Functional products are identified as those used on a daily basis which have been on the market for a long time, products for which demand is easy to predict without significant fluctuations. Innovative products, on the other hand, are newly introduced to the market and they are characterized by highly uncertain demand. Because different industries offer different characteristics of products, they will experience different demand patterns. In the pharmaceutical industry, the development of new products takes a considerable amount of time; typically, a newly developed product reaches the maturity stage before entering the declining life pattern. This means that an innovative pharmaceutical product can be categorized as an innovative product at the beginning of its life, but can become a functional product once the product reaches a mature stage.


                     Fisher (1997) also identified that the innovative products should be handled with a responsive supply chain. The responsive supply chain is characterized by the ability to react quickly to market changes; however, this speed does not necessarily result in the lowest costs for the product. Combining the two product types framework described by Fisher (1997) with the existing research within lot sizing procedures, the following framework has been developed and is shown in Fig. 1.

The rationale behind placing the replenishment policies as illustrated above is that for a product with stable demand, a replenishment policy focused on deterministic demand would already give optimal results without the complexity incurred when applying a stochastic replenishment policy. However, when dealing with products of uncertain demand, utilizing a replenishment policy which integrates the demand uncertainty is essential. Therefore, the stochastic replenishment policy is identified to be relevant for the innovative category of products. Consequently, identifying a replenishment policy capable of acknowledging future demand changes would bring important benefits to a supply chain. A replenishment policy, also known as lot sizing in the literature, refers to the method through which the replenishment lot size to be ordered in one period of time is determined by considering the tradeoff between inventory holding costs versus costs of transportation and set-up. Using the most relevant replenishment method that fits the characteristics of the supply chain can result in important cost savings for the organization (Silver, Pyke, & Rein, 1998). Baboli, Fondrevelle, Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, and Mehrabi (2011) studied pharmaceutical supply chain using two models: centralized and decentralized models. These models consider the multiple products based on joint optimization under stable demand. Also, the authors applied their models to a specific family of products with a numerical example taken from a real-case study.

Some research papers deal with lot-sizing algorithms and their adjustments including safety stock (Absi & Kedad-Sidhoum, 2009; Aloulou, Dolgui, & Kovalyov, 2014; De Bodt, Van Wassenhove, & Gelders, 1982; De Bodt & Van Wassenhove, 1983; Dolgui & Prodhon, 2007; Pochet & Wolsey, 2006; Van Kampen, Van Donk, & van der Zee, 2010). Kleywegt et al. explore VMI in a stochastic environment (Kleywegt, Nori, & Savelsbergh, 2002
                     , 2004; Yao & Dresner, 2008). No papers, however, have analyzed the stochastic demand with low and high variability under VMI systems using heuristics-based safety stock. In summary, this paper analyzes stochastic demand, including both low and high variability, in traditional and in VMI supply chain systems. We use two different replenishment quantity methods: first, Adjusted Silver–Meal (ASM) heuristics with augmentation quantity to deal with demand variability, and second, a Silver–Meal heuristic method with safety stocks.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and research highlights, and Section 3 describes the problem and develops the mathematical model for the two methods, including the Silver–Meal heuristic with augmentation quantity and the Silver–Meal heuristic with SS. Section 4 applies the framework for numerical examples based on data from the pharmaceutical sector. In this section, the Adjusted Silver–Meal heuristic and the Least unit cost heuristic are compared. In Section 5, a sensitivity analysis is performed for the key parameters. The results of the application are summarized and discussed in Section 6, with a clear focus of identifying the method to determine the lowest supply chain costs. The final section, Section 7, provides our conclusions and recommends ways to further the scope of this research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In a traditional supply chain, buyers place orders to meet their requirements and decide upon replenishment quantities and timings. Conversely, in a VMI system, suppliers monitor the retailers’ inventory levels and make replenishment decisions. According to the characteristics of the two systems, we provide the following review articles that relate to the augmentation and safety stock principles under a time-varying stochastic demand replenishment policy.


                     Ribeiro and Lourenço (2003) analyzed the inventory routing problem under customer managed inventory (CMI) and VMI case under period review to determine the route and quantities delivered at the random demand points, minimizing total cost. The heuristic algorithm is used as a solution method because of its good level of performance in term of solution quality and convergence. Guimarães, de Carvalho, and Maia (2013) presented a VMI case from the perspective of a downstream member, exploring dimensions of VMI benefits, risks, barriers, and enablers through periodic review and weekly basis replenishments. Yu, Zeng, and Zhao (2009) identified the conditions under which the VMI model is favorable over the traditional chain structure; it requires the downstream buyer to share profit with the upstream supplier to cover the supplier's initial loss in order to exploit and sustain the benefits of the VMI. The performance of VMI, compared to the traditional system, is also studied in several papers. Fry, Kapuscinski, and Olsen (2001) mentioned VMI as a way to outsource activities by shifting the traditional burden of inventory management upstream in the supply chain, which is more beneficial under high outsourcing cost situations. Razmi et al. (2010) studied the two-echelon model with backorder allowed at a retailer level. The results show that VMI works better and delivers lower cost than traditional supply chains. Rad, Razmi, Sangari, and Ebrahimi (2014) indicated that greater reduction in total costs of a supply chain can be achieved by using VMI; they provided a comprehensive insight into a selection of inventory policies to improve commercial business and supply chain performance under the VMI and traditional systems in a single-vendor two-buyer supply chain.

When uncertainty in demand is encountered, Vargas and Metters (1996) combined the theory of lot sizing and safety stock to determine a cost efficient replenishment policy, and their simulation results were analyzed using data envelopment analysis; their model proved to be superior to existing production scheduling policies. Bookbinder and Tan (1988), Vargas and Metters (1996), and Tarim and Kingsman (2004) used a service constraint in establishing when and how much to add to the expected demands over the inter-order interval. Specifically, once it is deemed time to place an order (Pujawan & Silver 2008). A progressive hedging algorithm to prevent against uncertainties in the future has been developed by Haugen, Lokketangen, and Woodruff (2001). The algorithm integrated under the meta-heuristic solves the sub-problems of each scenario and proved to be an effective method. Wang (2013) considered a periodic-review inventory policy with multiple retailers under stochastic demand. The paper mentioned the proposed time-based inventory control policy can perform equally well or better than the commonly used stock-based policy. Guo and Li (2014) considered the integration of supplier selection and inventory control problems under stochastic demand for multi-echelon systems. Dellaert and Melo (2002) used Markov decision model to determine an optimal production policy for a partial known stationary demand with the aim of minimizing long run average costs.

The stochastic time-varying demand has been thoroughly analyzed under the traditional supply chain with different methods. A lot of attention has centered on the Silver–Meal heuristic adjustment for the stochastic demand, and many authors further developed the original heuristic to incorporate the demand instability. As we know, the EOQ is the best replenishment quantity method to use when there is no variability in the demand rate. When the demand is significantly variable, however, the replenishment quantity method does not work and it is necessary to utilize another heuristic. In order to address variability, Silver et al. (1998) addressed the various heuristic methods such as Silver–Meal, lot-for-lot, least unit cost, and part-period balancing, and tested against the basic economic order quantity on a wide range of examples. Pujawan and Silver (2008) and Silver et al. (1998) mentioned that Silver–Meal heuristic has performed excellently in deterministic cases. There are several evidences from the literature stating that Silver–Meal heuristics performed well under different situations. Pujawan and Silver (2008) and Chalmet, Bodt, and Wassenhove (1985) have addressed that Silver–Meal heuristics perform well when obsolescence is a key factor (Pujawan & Silver, 2008). Tempelmeier (2011) dealt with the generation heuristic for dynamic capacitated lot sizing with random demand. Baciarello, D'Avino, Onori, and Schiraldi (2013), Kropp, Carlson, and Jucker (1983), and Jeunet and Jonard (2000) pointed out that for unstable environments, Silver–Meal and the part period simplified algorithm represents the best trade-off between cost effectiveness and robustness. Baciarello et al. (2013) further presented an extensive experiment for eight of the main lot sizing techniques (Least unit cost, Silver–Meal, Groff's method, part period balancing, Freeland and Colley, part period simplified, McLauren's order moment, and maximum part period gain) and then benchmarked these techniques against Wagner and Whitin's exact algorithm. Pujawan (2004) considered the effects of relatively low variability in demand and evaluated the impact of two lot sizing methods such as the Silver–Meal heuristic and Least unit cost on the order variability under a stochastic case. The Silver–Meal heuristic brought more orders than the Least unit cost method, with lower inventory costs but higher ordering costs. The model assumed an extra quantity to be added to each order to overcome the variability in the demand between orders.

Therefore, in our work, we use the Silver–Meal heuristic to illustrate the cost performance under variable demand. Pujawan and Silver (2008) extended the Silver–Meal heuristic to account for an augmentation quantity for each replenishment in order to minimize the total expected costs. The paper also evaluates two models for selecting the augmentation factor for any given value of T (the target number of periods until the time of the next replenishment). The augmentation quantity is valuable for the situation where replenishment costs are low compared to inventory carrying costs.

For many years, calculating the safety stock based on a service level which must be accomplished seems to be a popular method as mentioned by Aucamp and Barringer (1987). Chopra and Meindl (2001) evaluated different ways of calculating the safety stocks: when a constraint is specified to meet a customer service level and variability in demand is expected, or when variability is expected in the replenishment lead time and demand. Talluri, Cetin, and Gardner (2004) created a safety stock framework based on the demand and lead time variability in order to improve safety stock calculations of a pharmaceutical company, a framework within which the formulas have been adopted from Chopra and Meindl (2001). The application showed significant improvement compared to the previous safety stock calculation which included only demand variability. Considering a periodic reviewed system, Eppen and Kipp (1988) evaluated safety stock calculation when the demand and lead time are variable. The paper shows how different distributions impact the end results. Li and Jiang (2012) modeled the heuristics for the safety stock placement problem in general acyclic supply chain networks. Osman and Demirli (2012) addressed the safety stock placement problem of a multi-stage supply chain comprising multiple sourced stock points; they proposed a consolidation model to achieve reduction in safety amounts that will result in a cost savings. Inderfurth and Vogelgesang (2013) considered a manufacturer's stochastic production problem under periodic review and presented methods for safety stock determination to cope with uncertainties that are caused by stochastic demand and the randomness of different yields. They suggested approaches for determining appropriate static safety stocks that are easier to apply in practice. Many studies exist in the EOQ model that explore pricing issues, backordering, dynamic demand, and delayed payment (Taleizadeh & Pentico, 2013; Taleizadeh, Pentico, Aryanezhad, & Ghoreyshi, 2012; Taleizadeh, Pentico, Jabalameli, & Aryanezhad, 2013). To summarize, we provide a quick overview of different replenishment quantity methods used in traditional supply chains under time-varying stochastic demands in Table 1
                     a, and in Table 1
                     b we provide an overview of replenishment policies under a VMI set-up.

The application of the Silver–Meal heuristic under stochastic demand for a traditional supply chain has been analyzed by Pujawan (2004) and Pujawan and Silver (2008). This paper offers an extension of Pujawan and Silver's work (2008). Both papers concluded that an extension of the Silver–Meal heuristic for the stochastic case is possible and proved to be a relevant replenishment policy even under uncertainty. The Silver–Meal heuristic is a replenishment policy for time-varying stochastic demand in a traditional supply chain, but no research considers how the policy benefits a VMI partnership in the supply chain. The novelty of this paper is as follows:

                        
                           •
                           Transition and evaluation of a Silver–Meal heuristic with an augmentation quantity used in a traditional supply chain at the moment to a VMI supply chain case,

Adjustment of the Silver–Meal heuristic is done with low and high demand variability, and

A modified Silver–Meal heuristic combined with a safety stock is proposed to overcome demand variability.

The paper evaluates a Silver–Meal heuristic replenishment policy under two different quantity methods for a time-varying stochastic demand pattern in a VMI environment. The stochastic demand pattern is predominantly encountered in real life situations and the modeling to account for uncertainty becomes more complex than the deterministic case.

Capturing the time-varying stochastic pattern within the replenishment policy is a key factor in order to ensure cost minimization. As a result, the scope of this paper is to identify an optimum replenishment policy which integrates the specific conditions, but also the behavior of the policy under VMI should be evaluated. The replenishment policy for the time-varying deterministic demand for a traditional supply chain should be also suitable for a VMI environment.

The replenishment policy for the products with time-varying stochastic demand utilized at the moment does not fit the specified characteristics and the management team identified that high inventory costs are involved due to it. As a result, the management team is interested in identifying a new method which would optimize the costs and be applicable to the VMI supply chain. Extensions of the Silver–Meal heuristics have been identified in the literature to account for the variability of demand and therefore this study will evaluate the impact of the method for both traditional and VMI supply chains.

The mathematical model within this paper is developed based on the Silver–Meal heuristic, with the aim of finding the optimal replenishment policy in different replenishment quantity methods under a time-varying stochastic demand in a VMI system. The focus is to strictly identify the best replenishment policy along a specified number of periods in which relevant data exists. Furthermore, the model is applied to both traditional and VMI supply chain types. Two policies are developed within the model, and their results are compared within the numerical application. Based on the results, a recommendation for implementing one of them can be made. The first model is based on an extension of the Silver–Meal heuristic combined with an augmentation quantity, divided into two situations: low demand variability and high demand variability. The second model is based on the Silver–Meal heuristic combined with a safety stock to illustrate the cost performance under the demand variability. Compared to the traditional supply chain, in VMI-based supply chains, suppliers manage the inventory. In simple words, supplier does the demand creation and demand fulfillment in VMI supply chains. Also in the VMI system, inventory cost reduces to the least possible amount and, hence, from a financial point of view, the supplier will show less interest in using the traditional system. At the same time there will be a reduction in the ordering cost for the buyer. So VMI systems will always have lower inventory and ordering costs compared to traditional systems (Razmi et al., 2010).

The model developed by Pujawan and Silver (2008) is adjusted and its performance under a traditional supply chain is compared with a VMI supply chain. Another difference between this proposed work and Pujawan and Silver's research (2008) is the demand of the beginning period. In Pujawan and Silver (2008) the demand in period 1 is already known at the time the replenishment quantity is selected, but in our work the demand in period 1 is unknown. The adjusted model is used to capture specific conditions from the current situation and, for the first time within the literature, the model is applied in a VMI supply chain. Two models, one for low variability in demand and one for high variability in demand, are modified and their performance is evaluated.

                              Stochastic demand with low degree of variability (for the low demand variability model).

Stochastic demand with high degree of variability (for the high demand variability model).

We consider a single level system as one vendor – multiple buyers with single product in multiple periods. The time varying demand is assumed to be stochastic for a specified number of periods, t = 1, 2, …, T.

The replenishments are constrained to arrive at the beginning of a period, with the flexibility to cover for one or more periods forward. If the available quantity at the beginning of a period covers the expected demand of the following period, no replenishment is considered to arrive at the beginning of the next period (same as in Silver et al., 1998).

The replenishment LT is known with certainty and is greater than zero. This means that any replenishment order has to be placed exactly x days (x = LT), in advance for a replenishment to arrive at the beginning of the desired period.

Based on the fact that LT is greater than zero assumes first period demand is unknown, the extension of the model starts the replenishment evaluation including period 1.

No inventory carrying costs are applicable to replenishments arriving at the start of a period, but inventory carrying costs are applied to quantities remaining at the end of that period (same as in Silver et al., 1998; Pujawan & Silver, 2008).

Geographically, the buyers are not positioned close to each other, which means that transportation costs must be considered separately for each buyer whenever a replenishment takes place.

For the numerical application, the transportation cost has the same value for all buyers, without differentiating based on distance differences.

The assumptions are common for both traditional and VMI supply chains, unless it is clearly stated to be specific only to one of them. The following structure gives the flow for the VMI study.

                           
                              
                           
                        
                     

Throughout the low demand variability model, Pujawan and Silver's (2008) aim was to determine the optimum order quantity to cover the demand over the number of periods initially identified in order to minimize the total costs. The augmentation quantity is utilized in order to avoid the need to place an order one period in advance than the planned period for the next replenishment. The low variability model assumes that the demand does not fluctuate too much from the predicted value and that the multiplication factor can take only positive values (m ≥ 0).

The difference from the original Silver–Meal heuristic is identified in the fact that extra holding costs are identified for the augmentation quantity and there is uncertainty toward the number of periods covered which are dependent on the occurring demand. In the deterministic Silver–Meal heuristic, the number of periods to be covered by a replenishment was known with certainty, but in the case of stochastic demand, the number of periods meant to be covered by a replenishment might fluctuate according to the randomness in demand. This means that if demand is higher than what was forecasted, the available quantity is not sufficient to cover the demand up to the planned period. The other extreme can be identified for the case when demand is lower and extra inventory is carried from one period to the next (Pujawan, 2004).

Considering the probability that the demand will vary to some extent, the model includes the assumption that t
                           a can take only a value of T − 1, T, or T + 1. Therefore, the probability that t
                           a becomes T − 1, T, or T + 1, and as presented by Pujawan and Silver (2008) can be expressed as:

In the following, the behavior of the Silver–Meal heuristic under stochastic demand with a low variability pattern for a traditional supply chain is presented. As we know, the expected total relevant costs per unit time (ETRCUT) during the interval covered by the current replenishment can be written as:

Here it must be mentioned that v
                              b from the middle term in the numerator should be considered only as long as the holding cost is given as a percentage of the price. If the holding cost represents a value on its own, the price or value should either be ignored or considered as equal to 1 to avoid any implications on the final costs.

The overall supply chain cost is equal to the sum of the costs of the vendor and the buyer and can be expressed as:

The first term in Eq. (11) represents the overall cost of the vendor which is equal to the sum of set-up cost and shipment release cost multiplied with the number of buyers, for all the periods.

In the VMI supply chain the vendor has the opportunity to consolidate the demands for a specific product of all buyers with whom a VMI partnership is established. This case is more interesting, as the estimated fluctuation of the demand is captured centrally by the vendor. In the numerical application which will follow, the difference between costs but also quantities will be observed.

Furthermore, evaluating the demand fluctuation centrally will give more possibilities to the vendor to manage inventories at a lower rate than if kept at each buyer. Some of the demands might be higher than forecasted for some of the buyers, but there is a chance of having lower demands for others. The vendor has the direct access to inventory levels of each buyer and can therefore prioritize the deliveries according to their exact need. In the literature, centralizing inventories is identified as a better solution of dealing with the variability in demand which results in lower levels of quantities to be maintained in the inventories (Waller, Johnson, & Davis, 1999).

Adjusting the formulas from the traditional supply chain to the VMI supply chain, the following cost is obtained for the vendor:

The numerical application for comparing the lot sizing between traditional supply chain and VMI under stochastic demand, for the three categories of SKUs (A, B, and C), will be done after the model section.

This model evaluates the outcome of the Silver–Meal heuristic when demand variability in time is high with the extension that the demand in the initial period is also uncertain. Assuming that the initial period's quantity is uncertain changes the calculations compared to the initial model. Furthermore, the model will be adjusted to be applicable for the VMI supply chain.

The assumption made in Section 3.1.1. where the estimated number of periods,
t
                           a, covered by a replenishment could take only a value of T − 1, T, or T + 1 is relaxed here and the probability that the demand can have higher fluctuations than that is evaluated.

The expected total period end inventory cost until the next replenishment for the high demand variability formula is adopted from Pujawan and Silver (2008) with a single adjustment to start the evaluation from period 1 instead of period 2.

The denominators above are different from the ones in Pujawan and Silver (2008), where they considered them σ
                              2, T − n
                               and σ
                              2, T − n + 1 respectively (considering that they started the calculations from period 2).

If, considering the example that t = 2 and n = 1 from Pujawan and Silver (2008), the standard deviation of σ
                              2, 1 should be calculated. However, the authors mentioned that the standard deviation can only be calculated from period 2 onward which means that σ
                              2, 1 is not possible to calculate for their case. There were no comments regarding this issue and therefore it has been assumed to be an error and has been corrected in our case.


                              Appendix A shows Pujawan and Silver's (2008) formula and clarifies the mistake identified.

At the end of this section, under Section 5, the reader will be able to see the benefits possible to accumulate simply by giving the vendor the authority to decide upon replenishment sizes and time intervals of deliveries, and also the impact on the extra quantity considered to overcome demand fluctuations will be evaluated.

This section introduces a model where the Silver–Meal heuristic application for a deterministic demand situation is applied to the stochastic demand case to identify the replenishment frequencies, and in order to prevent stock-outs from the demand variability, a safety stock should be calculated for each of the reordering periods.

The Silver–Meal heuristic adjusted for the stochastic demand integrates an extra quantity to overcome fluctuations in demand. The rationale behind the model is to take the forecasted demand for a specified number of periods and apply the general Silver–Meal heuristic model for the deterministic demand. Applying the Silver–Meal heuristic model to the estimated forecast will provide the replenishment quantities to be specific to each of the periods. The Silver–Meal heuristic with SS model is applicable to any type of demand variability as long as this is captured in the deviation of demand. Based on the identified replenishment quantities together with the demand deviation, a safety stock quantity will be calculated and allocated to each of the replenishment quantities.

Once the safety stock quantities are identified, the values are summed up with the corresponding replenishment quantities and the Silver–Meal heuristic is run another time; this time uses the summed replenishment quantities as the forecasted demand. This extra step is taken to double check if the replenishment rationale changes when the quantities are adjusted. The purpose behind this analysis is to have an understanding of the implications that such a method would have on a supply chain. The safety stock should be calculated based on demand variability, greater than zero but with certain replenishment lead time and with the goal of reaching a specific customer service level.


                        
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                        
                     

Taking the safety stock quantity calculation based on the corresponding replenishment lead time besides the demand deviation probably represents a more adequate method than the augmentation quantity which only integrates the forecast deviation. The safety stock is a common practice in all industries, and represents a buffer quantity determined on the demand, lead time, or supply variability and most of the time is linked to meet a specific customer service level. Having defined that each product must attain a service level of 99.93 percent, determining the safety stock in accordance seems like the best solution for the safety stock calculation. Also, according to assumption made in the beginning of the paper with regard to the


                        
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                        
                     

lead time, this eliminates the need to integrate the variability of lead time in the safety stock calculation. Therefore, the safety stock here is calculated based on demand variability, constant replenishment lead time, and specified customer service level. Silver et al. (1998) defined the safety stock to be equal to a safety factor, (k), multiplied with the standard deviation of errors forecast over the replenishment lead time (σ

The two components of the safety stock are evaluated in the following discussion:

                        Chopra and Meindl (2001) calculated the standard deviation of errors forecast as the product between the square root of the replenishment lead time and the standard deviation of sales.

Nevertheless, one remark here is that one should be aware that the lead time value should be expressed in the same value as the evaluated period (e.g. if replenishments are evaluated in months, then lead time data should also be expressed in months and not in days). Usually, replenishment lead times are given in days but other periods are considered such as weeks or months.

Using Silver et al. (1998) table from Appendix B, E(k) is identified under the fourth column of the table and its corresponding k value is utilized. The value of E(k) is used to identify the value of k, which can be taken from Silver et al. (1998). For example, if E(k) = 0.080 then k = 1.022. With both components identified, the value of the safety stock for the replenished period is identified. Using the determined SS quantity, the heuristic is run again to evaluate the frequency and the replenishment quantities based on the total quantity.

The reason for evaluating how the Silver–Meal heuristic behaves together with the combination of a SS quantity is due to the strong popularity of SS maintenance in all industries. Comparing the results of the two models will be the base of recommending either of the models to be used within the industry. The following section applies all three models developed above, and, based on the results, a recommendation toward the most relevant option will be made.

The numerical application of this paper focuses on comparing the two main models created: the Adjusted
Silver–Meal heuristic with augmentation quantity (for low and high variability) and the Adjusted
Silver–Meal heuristic combined with a SS quantity. The Adjusted
Silver–Meal heuristic combined with SS is suitable for all different levels of demand variability and therefore is comparable to both low and high demand variability situations.

Comparing the results of the two models based on the forecasted demand has been identified as a challenging case due to uncertain demand, which made it hard to identify which of the methods result in lower costs. Therefore, to have a clear distinction between the impacts of the models, the data used represents last year's forecasted demand.

Using the forecasted demand, the models are run and prospective replenishments and their costs over the year are determined. The replenishment quantities as determined within each of the models are then compared to the actual quantities that occurred within each period. Such a comparison enables us to identify extra inventory carrying costs or backordering remaining at the end of each period.


                     Company introduction: The company is one of the leading healthcare companies in the world. The company is structured in four divisions: pharmaceutical, vaccines and diagnostics, generics, and consumer health. The company engages 23 production sites with the outcome of over 13,000 finished products sold to 120 countries around the world. Around 10 percent of the business is outsourced to third party manufacturers. Analyses are executed for all three categories of SKUs: A, B, and C. All models have been developed in Excel in a template manner, meaning that the user only needs to update the relevant demand data and costs, and all remaining calculations will be done automatically and the optimal replenishment is obtained on the right hand side of the spreadsheet. The following section presents a detailed results analysis for an A class SKU, whereas for the B and C class SKUs, only the initial data and the outcome of the model is shown due to space restrictions.

The cost information corresponding to each type of SKU is presented in Tables 2–4.

The model assumes three buyers and time varying stochastic demand for 12 periods. Tables 5–7 show the demand patterns for each of the buyers and the consolidated number used under the VMI supply chain.

Here, the table adds the original data of A class SKU − (stochastic demand).

Before we start the numerical model analysis, we first compare the Adjusted
Silver–Meal heuristic with least unit cost heuristics based on data of C class SKU as follows.

The output obtained using Adjusted Silver-Meal heuristic for buyers 2 and 3 is shown in Table 7a1.
                           
                           
                           
                           
                        


                           
                           
                           The output obtained using Least unit cost heuristic for buyers 2 and 3 is shown in Table 7a2. Based on Tables 7a1 and 7a2 (for buyers 2 and 3), it illustrated the total cost of Adjusted Silver–Meal is lower than Least unit cost heuristic, so in our study we chose to use the Adjusted
Silver–Meal heuristic.

In the traditional supply chain, each of the three buyers makes its own decision regarding the replenishment quantities. The output corresponding to each buyer are obtained and the same is shown below (Tables 8–13).

The table above
                           
                           
                           
                           
                            shows the forecasted units, the value of m for which the lowest costs were identified for each of the periods and based on this, the forecasted quantity increased to include the augmentation quantity. Further, the replenishments are executed to cover the replenishment quantity including the extra augmentation quantity.

Due to high inventory holding costs, the model identified the minimum costs for all periods with m = 0. This means that no augmentation quantity was included for this case.

Based on the number and sizes of the replenishment, the costs of the buyer and vendor are calculated below.

Evaluating the replenished quantities against the actual quantities implies an identification of the inventory carrying costs for the stock remaining at the end of a period or a backordering cost for the periods were available quantities are lower than the actual requested quantities.

Within the VMI supply chain, the vendor has the opportunity to consolidate the demand and for that matter, also the corresponding augmentation quantity. The output corresponding to the VMI replenishment evaluations is shown below (Tables 14 and 15).

Just
                           
                           
                            as in the traditional case, the minimum costs were identified when m = 0 and no augmentation quantity.

The Silver–Meal heuristic combined with SS model is structured as first, the replenishment policy is identified according to the heuristic, and based on the replenishment quantities and their sizes the SS is calculated. The replenishment quantities are adjusted to include the required SS and the heuristic for the replenishments is run another time to evaluate if any changes occur based on the new quantities. The results corresponding to the low demand variability with SS under the traditional supply chain and VMI supply chain are shown in the following sections (Tables 16–23).


                           
                           
                        


                           
                           
                           
                        

For the high demand variability the same costs and initial forecasted demand data as for the low variability demand case is used. However, the only difference being captured is in the variability of demand. This means that the actual demand has higher deviations from what has been forecasted. The results corresponding to the high demand variability with augmentation quantity under the traditional supply chain and VMI supply chain are shown in the following sections (Tables 24–31
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        ).

The high demand variability model is more complex than the low variability demand but the Microsoft Excel file is still developed in a template style and the simple introduction of the corresponding data gives the optimal replenishment policy with the corresponding augmentation quantity.

Within the VMI supply chain, the vendor has the opportunity to consolidate the demand and for that matter, also the corresponding augmentation
                            quantity.

The results
                        
                        
                         corresponding to the high demand variability with SS under the traditional supply chain and VMI supply chain are shown in the following sections (Tables 32–39).


                           
                           
                        

The exact same rationale
                           
                           
                            as above has been applied for the B and C class SKUs and their corresponding results are presented in Section 6.

In order to study the effects of the changes in parameter values and to identify the parameters that are more relevant to optimal performance, a sensitivity analysis is performed and the results are shown in Figs. 2–13 and then explained. First, we analyse the cost performance for A class in the traditional supply chain.


                     Fig. 2
                     
                      illustrates that the coefficient of variation is inversely proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased coefficient of variation decreases the buyer cost, thereby it increases the supply chain profit in the traditional supply. Fig. 3 shows that the coefficient of variation is directly proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased coefficient of variation increases the buyer cost, thereby it increases the supply chain profit.


                     Figs. 4 and 5 show that holding cost is directly proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased holding cost level increases the supply chain cost, thereby it decreases the supply chain profit.


                     Figs. 6 and 7 refer that setup cost is directly proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased setup cost level increases the supply chain cost no matter what the demand rate is, thereby it decreases the supply chain profit.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                  

Second, we analyze the cost performance for A class in VMI supply chain.


                     Fig. 8 illustrates that the coefficient of variation is inversely proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased coefficient of variation decreases the vendor cost, thereby it increases the supply chain profit. Fig. 9 illustrates that the total supply chain cost including actuals remains stable when the coefficient of variation increases from 0.4 to 0.7, but it decreases when the coefficient variability increases from 0.7 to 0.8. After that it remains stable when the coefficient variability increases.

Both Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate that holding cost is directly proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased holding cost level increases the supply chain cost, thereby it decreases the supply chain profit.


                     Fig. 12 illustrates that setup cost is directly proportional to the total supply chain cost including actuals. The increased setup cost level increases vendor cost, thereby it decreases the supply chain profit. Fig. 13 illustrates that the total supply chain cost including actuals remains stable when the setup costs are 1000, 1500 and 2000, but it increases when the setup cost increases from 2000 to 2500. Similarly, the total supply chain cost including actuals becomes stable for the setup costs of 2500, 3000 and 3500. After that it increases when the setup cost increases. The results discussed above are obtained under a specific set of the parameter values. The cost varies proportionally with the setup cost and holding cost under the traditional supply, but inversely proportional with the coefficient of variation in low demand under the VMI supply chain.
                     
                  

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                        Tables 40–42
                        
                        
                        
                         give an overview of the results obtained on each type of SKU with the aim of comparing the results obtained in the augmentation quantity model versus the safety stock model for the high demand variability.

In general, the Silver–Meal heuristic combined with the safety stock performs better than the model with the augmentation quantity from above graphs. The strongest impact is observed under the A class SKU where the savings are almost double under the Silver–Meal heuristic with SS. This can be explained by the fact that from a cost standpoint, the augmentation model identified as the most optimal costs when no augmentation quantity is added. This will definitely have an impact in real life where demand is hard to predict as it can also be observed from the analysis. In the B and C categories, the performance of the two models is more equal, with the Silver–Meal heuristic model demonstrating a slighter better outcome. Also, the VMI model shows lower costs than the traditional supply chain; however, the impact is not very significant.

The same comparison as above is done for the low variability type of demand (Tables 43–45).

It is easily
                         observable from above tables that the Adjusted Silver–Meal heuristic with safety stock gives superior results under both traditional and VMI supply chains, compared to the augmentation quantity model for all three types of SKUs. Based on the above results, the Silver–Meal heuristic with SS model, no matter whether the variability is low or high, outperforms the results of Silver–Meal heuristic with augmentation quantity.

The cost performance in the traditional and VMI system is analyzed through a sensitivity analysis for the problem parameters under different demands. Changing the value of the parameters causes cost difference under different demands in two systems. It is shown that the total cost in VMI system reduces to the least possible amount and the supplier will show less interest in using the traditional system.

For this reason, the author's suggestion for the company is to implement the Silver–Meal heuristic combined with SS and to use VMI for the SKU handling. The combination of the two will result in overall supply chain costs reduction. The results have been presented to the planning and the leadership teams, who have been pleased with the Silver–Meal heuristic with SS implementation as well, not only because of its strong performance but also because of the trust which the industry has built on the SS over the years. The first data obtained when calculating the SS is expressed in weeks or days and this can be easily captured in the ERP system under the Safety Time indicator as shown in the picture below.

                           
                              
                           
                        
                     

Based on the replenishment frequencies identified from the model's application, where the A and B SKUs have been identified to be replenished every period and the C SKUs identified as suitable to order in quantities to cover longer period of times, the leadership decided to take a more simplistic approach for the implementation. The decision has been to order the A SKUs to cover the demand for one period, the B SKUs to cover the demand for two periods, and the C SKUs to cover the demand for six periods. This decision has been taken in accordance with the available capacity at the vendor, so that further complications could be avoided.

Based on this analysis, not only the company implemented the data for the time-varying demand SKUs, but the same has been applied to the constant demand SKUs as well. The progress so far seems to be going well and the impact on the inventories is already positive. As the VMI supply chain has been shown to strongly decrease costs, it has been adopted and the effects have been analyzed.

The study of adjusting the Silver–Meal heuristic with augmentation quantity is to be integrated in the VMI environment. Furthermore, a Silver–Meal heuristic combination with safety stock and its integration under a VMI partnership has been another part of the research.

The models have been applied in the pharmaceutical industry, capturing specific conditions such as time-varying stochastic demand, one vendor–multiple buyers, and one product. From the numerical applications, one of the key observations is that the Silver–Meal model with SS results in overall lower costs regardless of the type of the supply chain. Furthermore, the Adjusted Silver–Meal heuristic with Least unit cost heuristics are also compared based on data of C stocks class, which indicated the Adjusted Silver–Meal heuristic offers better cost saving than the Least unit cost heuristic. However, costs from the VMI supply chain are further decreased compared to the traditional supply chain. One of the key findings of this paper is that the more buyers who acquire the same product from the vendor, the better the opportunities for the vendor to consolidate the demand and to decide upon common replenishment dates. This approach provides the vendor with the possibility of reducing the operational costs.

In addition, the key parameters’ sensitivity analyses have been managed on the effect of coefficient variability, holding cost, and set-up cost with demand variability in both VMI and traditional modes. The results of sensitivity analyses indicate that the cost varies proportionally with the set-up cost and holding cost under the traditional supply, but is inversely proportional with the coefficient of variation in low demand under the VMI supply chain. VMI implementation for time-varying stochastic products is confirmed to be successful and brings lower overall costs for the supply chain. Since the proposed model of this research is representative of a certain type supply chain, the results are only true when the assumptions are held. Future research could focus on extending the Silver–Meal with augmentation quantity model to integrate the backordering cost and shortage. From the current application it was observed that the model does not integrate an extra quantity for products with high inventory carrying costs. Another extension could be directed toward evaluating the benefits of joint replenishment of products under a VMI partnership and exploring how the Silver–Meal heuristic behaves in such a situation. Furthermore, for future research, a new model in which suppliers work with logistics service providers may be considered. Finally, we suggest research to consider and analyze the problems presented in the three-echelon supply chain. Moreover, the model in which backorder and shortage are allowed can be another future research topic.

As presented by Pujawan and Silver (2008), the probabilities approximations for the high demand variability follow the same pattern as in the low demand variability but at a larger extent.
