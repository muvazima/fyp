                  This study presents a new weak signal detection method based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. The principle of the proposed method is described. A weak signal is detected through the transition from the chaotic to the periodic state. Numerical simulation shows that the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is sensitive to a weak signal under strong noise conditions. Several aspects of the proposed method, including the noise influence, influence of different frequency signals, and influence of the phase shift, are studied in detail. Results indicate that the application of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator to weak signal detection is feasible.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Weak signal detection is a challenging task in signal detection and early machinery fault detection. Conventional detection methods, such as wavelet method, are limited under strong noise conditions. The chaotic oscillator is highly effective in weak signal detection because of its properties of noise immunity and sensitivity to specific frequency signals.

The Duffing oscillator is the most frequently used chaotic oscillator for detecting weak signals [1–5]. When the Duffing system is in a critical state, a small perturbation may result in system state changes. The weak signal is often detected through the transition from the chaotic to the periodic state. Although the Duffing oscillator is widely used for weak signal detection, further research is necessary to determine whether other chaotic oscillators are suitable for detecting weak signals [6].

The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is employed to solve physical, engineering, and even biological problems. This oscillator type is a generalization of the classic van der Pol oscillator. The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator without an external force has a rich dynamic behavior [7,8], including chaos and bifurcation.

This study focuses on weak signal detection based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. First, we analyze the dynamic behavior of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Second, we realize weak signal detection according to the phase trajectory change of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator from the chaos to the periodic state. Finally, some problems are discussed relative to weak signal detection by the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. This study is the first to use the Van der Pol–Duffing oscillator for weak signal detection. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method has satisfactory detecting performance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Section 3 describes the principle and implementation of weak signal detection using the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Section 4 presents the related aspects of the proposed method. Section 5 concludes.

The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is described by the following nonlinear equation [9,10]:

                     Yamapi and Filatrella [10] reported that the driven van der Pol–Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behavior with the following parameters: μ
                     =5, α
                     =0.01, ω
                     =2.463.

The indicator used to analyze the presence of chaos is the maximum Lyapunov exponent. The relation between the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the amplitude F is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The maximum Lyapunov exponent exhibits both negative and positive (chaotic) behavior. If parameter F varies from small to large, the van der Pol–Duffing system state varies from the chaos (Fig. 2
                     ) to the periodic state (Fig. 3
                     ).

When the nonlinear dynamic system is in critical state, a small external force perturbation of the system may result in a qualitative change in system state [11]. This property can be used for weak signal detection. The criterion for distinguishing the state between periodic and chaotic behavior of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is the maximum Lyapunov exponent combined with the phase diagram.

After introducing the noise and to-be-detected weak signal, the van der Pol–Duffing equation is given by

                        , the state of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator changes despite F
                        1 being extremely small. Whether the periodical signal exists with ω frequency can be confirmed by identifying the state transformation.

The threshold of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is obtained by considering the Lyapunov exponent combined with numerical experiments. Given that h
                        =0.01 and ω
                        =2.463rad/s, the threshold Fa
                         is 5.03 with no external perturbation. The phase plane trajectories of the critical state are shown in Fig. 4
                        (a). Gaussian white noise with σ
                        =1 is then added, and the corresponding phase plane trajectories are shown in Fig. 4(b). The corresponding phase plane trajectories with the addition of a weak signal with an amplitude F of 0.01 is shown in Fig. 4(c). The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is significantly immune to noise and sensitive to the weak periodical signal (Fig. 4).

When the external exciting signal is Gaussian white noise ε(t), the phase plane diagram with different σ values are shown in Fig. 5
                        . This figure shows that the orbits are chaotic, which indicates that the orbits maintain the chaotic motion state under the noise influence.

The external signal s(t)=0.01cos(ωt)+
                        σε(t) is assumed, where σ is from 0.01 to 0.2 to inspect the ability of the weak signal detection with noise. The experimental results indicate that the weak signal is identified only when σ
                        ⩽0.07. Fig. 6

                        =0.06 and σ
                        =0.08. Therefore, the threshold of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the weak signal is larger than the following:

If the frequency of the external signal is different from that of the reference signal [e.g., s(t)=0.29cos(ωt), where ω is 0.5, 3, 10, or 100], will the orbits shift from the chaotic state to another? For ω
                        =0.5, 3, 10, 100, we again solve Eq. (5). The results show that the orbits maintain the chaotic state, and no evidence suggests that the motion state shifted (Fig. 7
                        ). This scenario indicates that the motion state does not shift when the external signal frequency is unequal to the reference signal.

Assume that the reference signal is Fb
                         cos(ωt) and the weak signal is acos(ωt
                        +

Compared with [6], weak signal detection based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is more robust against different frequency signals. However, the disadvantage of the proposed method is that the SNR threshold of the detected weak signal is higher than that of the Duffing oscillator-based method. The weak signal detection of the proposed method is thus less than that of the Duffing oscillator-based method.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study presents a new weak signal detection method based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. The weak signal detection principle and implementing model based on van der Pol–Duffing oscillator are discussed. Weak signal detection is conducted through the phase transition from the chaotic to the periodic state. A weak signal detection example demonstrates that the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator method for detecting the weak signal is effective and reliable. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is robust against the noise. The signal-to-noise ratio of the weak signal that can be detected by this method can reach −45dB. The proposed method is more robust than the Duffing oscillator-based method against different frequency signals. Our work indicates that weak signal detection based on a nonlinear oscillator other than the Duffing oscillator is feasible.
