                  Point-of-care testing glucose meters are widely used, important tools for determining the blood glucose levels of people with diabetes, patients in intensive care units, pregnant women, and newborn infants. However, a number of studies have concluded that a change in hematocrit (Hct) levels can seriously affect the accuracy of glucose measurements. The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for glucose calculation with improved accuracy using the Hct compensation method that minimizes the effects of Hct on glucose measurements. The glucose concentrations in this study were calculated with an adaptive calibration curve using linear fitting prediction and a support vector machine, which minimized the bias in the glucose concentrations caused by the Hct interference. This was followed by an evaluation of performance according to the international organization for standardization (ISO) 15197:2013 based on bias with respect to the reference method, the coefficient of variation, and the valid blood samples/total blood samples within the ±20% and 15% error grids. Chronoamperometry was performed to verify the effect of Hct variation and to compare the proposed method. As a result, the average coefficients of variation for chronoamperometry and the Hct compensation method were 2.43% and 3.71%, respectively, while the average biases (%) for these methods were 12.08% and 5.69%, respectively. The results of chronoamperometry demonstrated that a decrease in Hct levels increases glucose concentrations, whereas an increase in Hct levels reduces glucose concentrations. Finally, the proposed method has improved the accuracy of glucose measurements compared to existing chronoamperometry methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately 347 million people with diabetes globally, and the disease is one of the main causes of death in developing countries. The WHO predicted that the number of deaths due to diabetes would increase two-fold by 2030 compared to the current levels [1]. Point-of-care testing (POCT) glucose meters are important tools for diabetics and are widely used because they are relatively inexpensive and easy to use. It is strongly recommended that people with diabetes check their blood glucose levels regularly using glucose meters. Knowledge of their blood glucose levels helps people manage their diabetes and prevent future complications.

Although POCT glucose meters are widely used, many factors cause inaccurate measurement results, such as the varying blood sample volumes applied to the cell of the biosensors, poor peripheral circulation, oxygen tension, temperature, user errors, and widely different hematocrit (Hct) levels [2–9]. Research has shown that a change in Hct levels significantly affects the accuracy of blood glucose measurement [5]. Hct represents the volume percentage of solid particles in whole blood, including red blood cells (RBC). It is measured by separating the whole blood collected in a test tube (or capillary) into plasma and solid particles by centrifugation. The normal range of Hct levels for men is 41–50% and 36–44% for women [10]. However, the levels in anemic patients, pregnant women, and newborns may differ widely from the normal range [11–13]. In the case of a patient with anemia who normally has a low Hct level, a glucose concentration measured with a commercial glucose meter will appear higher than the actual level. On the other hand, in case of a patient with erythrocytosis, the reading may be lower than the actual glucose concentration. Depending on the manufacturer of the glucose meter, the measured glucose levels at various Hct levels may be biased by 4–40% from the value of 42% Hct, the normal mean Hct level recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15197, to a higher or lower value [3–5,14,15].

This phenomenon can be explained by blood viscosity [16–19]. The relationship between Hct and the logarithm of blood viscosity is expressed by a linear equation [16]. In other words, the blood viscosity increases at higher Hct levels, and the blood diffusion rate slows by the increased viscosity. Therefore, the ion transfer rate between the blood sample and the reagent layer of the test strip becomes slower in the electrochemical method, which decreases the current in the working electrode and leads to underestimation of the actual glucose concentration. On the other hand, the opposite phenomenon appears at low Hct levels. Therefore, an appropriate correcting method for the effect of Hct on blood glucose level measurements is one of the most important factors that can improve the accuracy of POCT glucose meters.

Many blood glucose meters measure the glucose level from whole blood or plasma (the fluid part of the blood). However, the glucose level in the plasma is usually 12–15% higher than in the whole blood because the glucose content in the whole blood is lower than the glucose content in plasma alone. The whole blood glucose level results were multiplied by 1.12 to convert plasma equivalent values [20]. Home blood glucose meters measure the glucose in whole blood, whereas most lab tests measure the glucose in the plasma. In the study, the glucose level was converted from the whole blood glucose to the plasma glucose values.

POCT glucose meters often use electrochemical test strip sensors [21,22]. To extract the Hct compensation parameters from the current/time curve and to calculate glucose concentrations, a mathematical model is created by applying a variety of potential waveforms, including alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). This compensation method is based on the measurement of electrical characteristics, such as impedance, resistivity, and conductivity [4,23].

The aim of the current study was to develop an easy-to-use POCT glucose meter with improved accuracy using simple DC amperometry with algorithms that minimize the Hct effect bias. We attempted the Hct compensation method, which consists of a prediction of the current curve and an adaptive calibration method based on a support vector machine (SVM), to reduce the Hct level-dependent bias. The prediction of the current curve involved calculating glucose concentrations by estimating the values outside the range of the current curve measured at the working electrode. To estimate the current curve profile outside the time-interval range, a slope at a specific interval was used. The point that minimized the bias and was less sensitive to the Hct effect was found from the estimated current curve, and the glucose concentration was calculated from that estimated current point value. The adaptive calibration method used an SVM to classify the Hct level such as low, mid, and high. A specific feature to classify the Hct level from the amperometry-based current curve was extracted, and a calibration curve was applied according to the classified Hct level. Simple electrochemistry-based chronoamperometry was performed to verify the effect of variation by the Hct. The present study also compared a simple chronoamperometry method with the results of the proposed method to evaluate the latter׳s performance. Finally, the results of the proposed method were analyzed to verify their strengths and limitations.

In this study, we used electrochemical test strips, analog and digital circuits, and a PC for signal measurements. 
                        Fig. 1 shows the structure of the glucose sensor used in this paper (CareSens N test strip, i-SENS Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The sensor consists of working, counter, and third electrodes. The glucose concentration is determined by the current at the interface between the working electrode and the counter electrode, and the counter electrode is connected to ground in the glucose meter system. However, the third electrode is distinct from the working electrode in terms of area and the position of the electrode (as shown in Fig. 1), and measures the electrical current against the counter electrode, such as the working electrode. The working and third electrodes in the sensor are located in the path of the sample flow and are distance, d (mm), apart. In this system, the glucose in the blood first reacts with the enzymes of the working electrode and then with the third electrode when the blood sample travels distance, d. The time interval of the reaction between the working and third electrodes is calculated to determine the injection time.

The currents of the working and third electrodes were connected to a microcontroller unit via a current-to-voltage converter circuit to conduct an analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). The resolution of the ADC was 12-bit, and full-scale was 2500mV. The AD-converted data were sent to the PC, and the current curve of each blood sample was stored.

Venous whole blood samples collected from a donor were centrifuged to separate the plasma and RBC. The blood samples were reconstituted with five different Hct levels (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%) to verify the changes in glucose concentrations according to their Hct levels. The Hct levels of the reconstituted blood samples were confirmed by a reference method (centrifugation). Each Hct level was spiked using a stock solution of 20,000mg/dL to produce four different target glucose concentrations (80, 150, 300, and 600mg/dL).

Each of the blood samples was measured 20 times as follows: n=G×H×N=4×5×20=400, where G is the glucose concentration, H is the Hct level, and N is the number of measurements. All the glucose measurements were conducted by a skilled researcher made using lots of the same test strip under the same environmental conditions. Half of the samples, i.e., 200 of the 400 samples, were used for the training datasets, and the other half were used in the testing datasets. The measurement was performed at a temperature of 23±5°C according to the ISO 15197 standard. The temperature was maintained within a range of ±2°C. To validate the methods proposed in this paper, YSI 2300 (Yellow Springs Instruments Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA) was used as the reference method for the glucose meter system. The measurement results from the reference method were converted from whole blood glucose concentrations to plasma-equivalent blood glucose concentrations as follows [20]:

The simple chronoamperometry method consists of an incubation period of 3s, followed by a reaction period of 2s (sampling frequency: 400Hz), with the glucose concentration calculated after 5s. 
                        Fig. 2(a) shows the current curves of the glucose concentrations of 80, 150, 300, and 500mg/dL with an Hct level of 42%. The DC voltage applied during the reaction period was 200mV. Eq. (2) was used to calculate the current flowing in the working electrode. As the sampling frequency was 400Hz, a current curve of 2000 samples was acquired for 5s in total.

                        Fig. 2(b) shows the calibration conducted using a 4.9s value for the current curve measured at the working electrode during the reaction period. In order to establish the best calibration performance, the data were averaged at 10 points in 4.9s for the current curve, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The result had a correlation coefficient of 0.9516 with a slope of 19.3 and an intercept of 25.3. Simple electrochemistry-based chronoamperometry was performed to verify the effect of the Hct variation. This method was also used to compare the Hct compensation method proposed in this paper and the subsequent results in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

As shown in 
                        Fig. 3(a), the method in the present study did not increase the measurement time. Instead, to find the current value that minimized the effect of the Hct level, the current value of the working electrode was estimated for 5–8s using the linear fitting prediction method.

The slope and the intercept were calculated by performing the linear fitting on 50 samples from 4.875 to 5.000s to estimate the current value for 5–8s after measuring the current for 5s. Then, using the calculated slope and the intercept, the current value for 5–8s was estimated. The solid line in Fig. 3(a) shows the current curve acquired for 5s, and the dashed line shows the estimated current value of the working electrode for 5–8s. It also shows the change in the current curve when the blood sample was 500mg/dL, and the Hct levels were 20%, 42%, and 60%. In the linear fitting prediction method, the calibration was done by finding the current point that had the minimum Hct effect in the additionally estimated current curve for 5–8s. Hct levels need to be classified to improve the accuracy of a POCT glucose meter since Hct levels are known to significantly affect glucose concentrations. In the present study, the Hct levels were classified as low (20%, 30%), mid (42%, 50%), and high (60%), then the calibration equations were applied according to the Hct levels. Fig. 3(b) shows the calibration curves of a linear regression fitting with a current value at 5.34s according to the low, mid, and high Hct levels.

An SVM is a supervised learning model that analyzes data and recognizes patterns, which is used for classification and regression analysis [24]. Various learning algorithms, including the neural networks, have the common goal of finding a hyperplane by which unlabeled data can be classified. Unlike other algorithms, an SVM can not only find a hyperplane that separates the data, but can also find the maximum hyperplane that produces the largest margin among a number of hyperplane candidates that separate the data [25]. Here, the margin refers to the minimum distance from the training data point of a hyperplane. In the present study, the Hct levels were classified as low (20%, 30%), mid (42%, 50%), and high (60%) levels using an SVM. The motive for using SVM as a nonlinear method for the Hct classification is that it showed a better performance in Hct estimation than the supervised learning algorithms based on neural networks [26–28]. The classification of the Hct levels using an SVM was computed in Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).

                           t=5.00s are proportional to the glucose concentration at the same Hct level, but they are inversely proportional to the Hct level at the same glucose concentration. Using these two current points, the two-dimensional feature vector, x(x
                        1, x
                        2), was defined.

The feature vector was calculated using a specific slope and point that could classify the Hct level most accurately while having the least effect on the glucose concentration. 
                        Fig. 4 shows the extracted feature vector according to the low, mid, and high Hct levels.

An SVM was initially designed for binary classification that categorizes data into two classes. However, the combination of binary classifiers can be used to solve multiclass classification. We applied a modified version of one-against-all method as multiclass SVM approach [29]. This method first classifies one class from the other n−1 classes, and then it processes the classification in the rest n−1 classes, where n is the number of classes. In the current study, there were three classes: low, mid, and high Hct levels. Therefore we first classified the low Hct level from the mid and high Hct level, and then the rest classes were classified into two categories: the mid Hct level and the high Hct level. An SVM can not only perform linear classifications but also nonlinear classifications using a kernel function that maps the input data into high-dimensional feature spaces. The kernel function with the highest correct rate (8) was applied using a linear (5), a polynomial (6), and a radial basis function (RBF) (7). The d of the polynomial kernel and the σ of the RBF kernel refer to the order and scaling factors, respectively. The performance of SVM is determined by the selection of a kernel, the parameters of the kernel, and the soft margin parameter C. For the optimal performance of RBF kernels and for the best combination of C and sigma, the parameters with the highest correct rate were selected in the range of 0.1–100 for C and in the range of 0.1–100 for sigma by the grid-search process [30]. Furthermore, the optimum values for linear and polynomial kernels were selected in the range of 0.1–100 for C as well.

                        Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of the Hct compensation method. The main processes for the training dataset were focused on determining a hyperplane to classify the Hct levels and the calibration curves of linear regression fitting according to the low, mid, and high Hct levels. For the testing dataset, each Hct level was first classified using the SVM, and then the glucose concentration was calculated by applying the calibration curve according to the classified Hct level. Furthermore, in order to improve the system accuracy, the glucose concentration was calculated by parallel processing of the chronoamperometry proposed in Section 3.1 besides the above method. If the resulting value of the calculation in the chronoamperometry method was below 100mg/dL, this value was selected as the final result.

The performance of the method proposed in this paper was analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV), bias, Bland–Altman analysis, and difference plot [31,32]. The CV and the bias in the performance evaluation were as follows:

The SD tended to become larger if the data had a large mean value. Therefore, the CV was calculated to compare the various glucose concentrations. The difference plot shows the deviation between the single measurement results of the POCT glucose meter and the reference measurement based on the ISO 15197 standard. A unit of glucose concentration can be represented by mmol/L or mg/dL. The conversion equation is 1mmol/L=18mg/dL. In this study, glucose concentration was measured as a unit of mg/dL.

According to ISO 15197:2003, 95% of individual glucose results must be within ±15mg/dL of the comparison-method results at glucose concentrations below 75mg/dL and within ±20% of the comparison-method results for glucose concentrations at or above 75mg/dL [33]. A revised version of the ISO standard, which includes tighter criteria for the minimum accuracy of blood glucose systems, was released in 2012. In ISO 15197:2013, 95% of individual glucose results must be within ±15mg/dL of the comparison-method results at glucose concentrations below 100mg/dL and within ±15% of the comparison-method results for glucose concentrations at or above 100mg/dL [34].

The data stored on the PC were analyzed and processed using Matlab. A p value <0.001 was considered statistically significant. The calculated glucose concentrations were then evaluated in a difference plot and Bland–Altman analysis with respect to the reference results.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The total number of measurements in the present study was 400 samples (training dataset: 200, testing dataset: 200). All the glucose measurements were made using lots of the same test strip and compared with the glucose concentrations measured using the reference method (YSI 2300). 
                     
                     Table 2 shows the mean, SD, and CV of the glucose concentrations. The total mean CV for chronoamperometry and the Hct compensation method were 2.43% and 3.71%, respectively.


                     
                     Fig. 6(a) shows the bias (%) in the concentrations calculated using the current point of 4.9s in the chronoamperometry. Due to the Hct effect, the glucose concentrations were overestimated by 20% and 30% compared to the baseline Hct level of 42%, thus showing an 8–23% bias in a positive direction. In contrast, the glucose concentrations were underestimated at 50% and 60% of the baseline Hct level, showing a 5–32% bias in a negative direction. The mean bias for all the Hct levels was 12.08%. Fig. 6(b) shows the results obtained with the proposed method in which the calibration curve was applied according to the Hct level after the Hct level had been classified based on the SVM. Table 1 shows the performance of the kernel function of the SVM, which was applied to classify the Hct levels into low, mid, and high levels. All three kernels had more than a 90% correct rate at the low Hct level, whereas categorization into the three classes showed that the correct rate of the RBF kernel was the highest at 94%. The low and high Hct levels had clear characteristics in common with each other, but there was no case in which a low Hct level was classified as a high Hct level. All the error rates increased when mid Hct levels were classified as low or high, or conversely, when low and high levels were classified as mid level. Fig. 6(b) shows the calculated results using the RBF kernel. The biases at 80mg/dL (Hct 20%) and 80mg/dL (Hct 30%) were the largest at +14%. The other blood samples had biases in the range of −8% and +10%. The mean bias for all the Hct levels was 5.69%.

The results of the chronoamperometry and the Hct compensation method were 4.16±103.83mg/dL and −1.16±37.68mg/dL, respectively, in the Bland–Altman analysis.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

POCT glucose meters are widely used in homes and hospitals because they allow people with diabetes to measure their glucose levels quickly and conveniently. Despite their levels of inaccuracy, the glucose concentrations measured by POCT glucose meters are highly regarded as important management tools for diabetics, newborn infants, patients in intensive care, and pregnant women, and are sometimes employed for quick clinical judgments. Critically ill patients may have unpredictable changes in their Hct levels. For example, patients with hyperglycemia who have abnormally high Hct levels or erythrocytosis, as well as patients with hypoglycemia who have low Hct levels or anemia, cannot expect to obtain accurate glucose measurements due to the effect of different Hct levels on glucose measurements.

Chronoamperometry is a very powerful quantitative analysis electrochemical method for testing glucose. However, the current study confirmed that although decreases in Hct levels increase glucose concentrations, increases in Hct levels decrease glucose concentrations, as shown in Fig. 6(a). This phenomenon may explain the effects of Hct on glucose meter measurements. For example, an increased number of erythrocytes in a whole-blood sample may mechanically impede the diffusion of plasma into the reagent layer [18,19]. That is, changes in Hct levels may alter blood viscosity and thereby decrease fluid permeability into the reagent layers of test strips.

As inaccurate readings of glucose values can lead to fatalities, we proposed a method to minimize the biases at different Hct levels (particularly at low and high Hct levels) and evaluated its performance. Initially, to find the current point that has the minimum effect of Hct, the current curve for 5–8s was estimated with linear fitting prediction without any additional measurement. Glucose meters on the market normally take 5s to measure a glucose level, although some have a faster measurement time of 3s. While the longer measurement time can calculate a glucose concentration using the current value at more stable intervals, users prefer a shorter measurement time. There are measurement techniques that use multiharmonic, square pulse excitation or white noise to shorten the measurement time in the impedance spectroscopy methods. Furthermore, a high-impedance spectroscopy method that has improved the above methods – which have disadvantages such as limitation of the measurement frequency selection, increased calculation errors, and variable sampling frequency – was proposed [35]. This method is based on the excitation of an object with a sinc signal.

And then, depending on the Hct classification using the SVM, the glucose concentrations were estimated by applying the adaptive calibration curve in the proposed method. Consequently, the results of the adaptive calibration method were better than those of the chronoamperometry at the glucose levels of 150, 300, and 500mg/dL, but they were worse at 80mg/dL. 80mg/dL is a critical glucose level that determines the hypoglycemic and normal range. A recent study reported that glucose variability was a meaningful risk factor for the complications of diabetes [36]. Because low glucose levels are as important as high glucose levels as an indicator of glucose variability, to improve accuracy at glucose levels below 100mg/dL, if the glucose level calculated by chronoamperometry was below 100mg/dL, that glucose value was substituted for the output. As shown in Fig. 2(b), because the effect of Hct is smaller at 80mg/dL compared with other glucose levels (150, 300, 500mg/dL), a higher accuracy can be obtained by calculating the glucose concentration with the single calibration curve of chronoamperometry.

All the results were then compared with the results of the chronoamperometry method. First, the CV (%) of the proposed method, 3.71%, was higher than the 2.43% CV of the chronoamperometry due to incorrectly classified blood samples at mainly the mid Hct level (42%, 50%). An improvement in the correct rate of the classified Hct levels will result in a lower CV, similar to that of chronoamperometry. Second, the mean biases for all the Hct levels were 12.08% and 5.69% in chronoamperometry and the proposed method, respectively. The improvement of bias was confirmed by Bland–Altman analysis and difference plot, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. As a result, the proposed method satisfied the revised ISO 15197:2013. It showed that 97.5% of the samples were within ±15% of the reference method (YSI), which was better than 72.5% of the samples for chronoamperometry. In contrast to the proposed method, calculating the glucose concentrations using a single calibration curve showed limited ability in reducing the effects of Hct.

The classification of the Hct levels using the SVM with nonlinear kernels showed better performance than the SVM based on linear kernels. Although there are five target Hct levels, there are only three classified Hct levels because the characteristics of the extracted features are very similar between 20% and 30% of Hct and between 42% and 50% of Hct. If more dependent features can be acquired for each Hct level, it would be easy to directly estimate Hct levels using SVM regression. In this study, only one point of the current curve was used to calculate glucose concentration (y=ax+b, x=current value). However, more robust results can be expected if the estimated Hct level is added to the calibration equation (y=ax+bh+c, x=current value, h=Hct level).

In this paper, the Hct compensation method showed the good performance for various levels of Hct and yielded more stable glucose results. In conclusion, although the method proposed here has some limitations in terms of CV, it can help to improve the inaccuracies of POCT glucose meters. In further research, an AC voltage with various frequencies, peak–peak amplitudes, offsets, and waveform shapes may be applied in addition to the DC voltage employed in chronoamperometry in order to minimize the effects of Hct on glucose measurements. Furthermore, we are planning to conduct a study with eight glucose levels (50, 80, 130, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600mg/dL) for a more robust algorithm and for more detailed statistical analysis of the performance evaluation.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

When using a glucose meter for point-of-care testing, the Hct compensation is important to reduce bias associated with the measurement of blood glucose concentration. A high Hct results in lowered blood glucose levels while for a low Hct it is increased from the actual values. The objective of this study was to develop an easy-to-use POCT glucose meter with improved accuracy that minimizes the Hct level-dependent bias. The Hct compensation method proposed in this study consists of a linear fitting prediction of the current curve and an adaptive calibration method based on SVM. Depending on the classified Hct level by SVM, the glucose concentration was calculated using the adaptive calibration curve. This method was evaluated using the coefficient of variation, bias, Bland–Altman analysis and difference plot based on the international organization for standardization 15197:2013. As a result, the proposed method was improved the accuracy of glucose measurements compared to existing chronoamperometry methods.
