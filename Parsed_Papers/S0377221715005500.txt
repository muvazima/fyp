                  Six Sigma is a widely used method to improve processes from various industry sectors. The target failure rate for Six Sigma projects is 3.4 parts per million or 2 parts per billion. In this paper, we show that when a process is exponential, attaining such performances may require a larger reduction in variation (i.e., greater quality-improvement effort). In addition, identifying whether the process data are of non-normal distribution is important to more accurately estimate the effort required to improve the process. A key finding of this study is that, for a low kσ level, the amount of variation reduction required to improve an exponentially distributed process is less than that of a normally distributed process. On the other hand, for a higher kσ level, the reverse scenario is the case. This study also analyzes processes following Gamma and Weibull distributions, and the results further support our concern that simply reporting the Sigma level as an indication of the quality of a product or process can be misleading. Two optimization models are developed to illustrate the effect of underestimating the quality-improvement effort on the optimal solution to minimize cost. In conclusion, the classical and widely used assumption of a normally distributed process may lead to implementation of quality-improvement strategies or the selection of Six Sigma projects that are based on erroneous solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since its launch in the 1980s, Six Sigma has generated great expectations and hype in the business world, driven largely by reports of significant business gains, e.g., GE reported 11% revenue and 13% earnings increases from 1996 to 1998, AlliedSignal had savings of $1.5 billion in 1998, and Harry and Schroeder (1999) claimed “10% net income improvement, a 20% margin improvement, and a 10–30% capital reduction” for each Sigma improvement. These business gains were based on management and technical methods for improving processes with a theoretical aim of a failure rate of 3.4 parts per million (ppm) or 2 parts per billion (ppb), depending on certain assumptions. Important assumptions in Six Sigma are that the process is normal and its specifications are two-sided.

The assumption of normal distribution is generally appropriate for many technological manufacturing systems (e.g., machines, tools, and robots). Although not all manufacturing processes follow a normal distribution, this assumption remains widely used and recognized in the field of quality. Invariably, the normality test should be a first step in any approach using the normality assumption. However, for service or transaction systems, which have become increasingly predominant in various applications, even in manufacturing ones, the normality assumption comes into question. For example, in supply chain management and goods production systems, fill rates and the probability to meet specified customer service levels are not governed by normal distributions (Nourelfath, 2011). In addition, in project management where a project will more likely finish late, the normality assumption does not hold; in particular, this is the case when the number of activities is too small to assume a normal distribution based on the central limit theorem. Another example is the procurement process of oil and gas companies, where it was observed that cycle time data more closely resemble a Gamma distribution rather than a normal distribution.

Identified in a survey of the relevant literature, English and Taylor (1993) provide a good study on the robustness of the normality assumption when the distribution is not normal. Montgomery and Runger (2011) studied the error associated with non-normality in the estimation of defects in parts per million; the authors recommended applying transformational functions to the underlying non-normal variable until a normal transformed variable is found. A major drawback of this trial-and-error approach is the lack of physical meaning in the resulting transformed variable, rendering it unappealing to non-academic practitioners. Other researchers suggested fitting the appropriate distribution to the data and then calculating the parameters that would yield the desired parts per million (Somerville & Montgomery, 1996; Clements, 1989; Farnum, 1996; Rodriguez, 1992).

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate non-normally distributed data in Six Sigma performance methodology. Using the exponential distribution case, we first analyze the amount of variation reduction required to improve the process. The efforts required to achieve the performance goal of Six Sigma are then compared between the normal and exponentially distributed cases. Then, we generalize our study to processes using Gamma and Weibull distributions. Finally, two optimization models are developed: the goal of the first model is to find the optimal trade-off between quality-improvement program costs and costs incurred as a result of poor quality, and the second model addresses the optimal selection of process-improvement strategies. These optimization models analyze the impact of a poor estimation of quality-improvement effort on optimal solutions to minimize costs.

It is often the case in the professional and academic communities of quality to set 3.4 parts per million as the goal of Six Sigma without due consideration for the underlying process distribution. This could lead to erroneous estimation of the efforts and costs to achieve that goal when the process is not normal, as often is the case in service applications. The contribution of this research is that it provides guidelines to help managers to more accurately estimate the efforts required to achieve the performance goal of Six Sigma, and analyze the robustness of proposed quality optimization models under inaccurate probability distributions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the relevant literature; Section 3 analyzes the Six Sigma performance methodology in exponential, Gamma and Weibull distribution processes; Section 4 presents two optimization models to illustrate the effect of inaccurate estimations of probability distributions; and Section 5 provides our concluding remarks.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There are two main bodies of literature that are related to our research. The first is the literature of Six Sigma implementation in service systems that are more often characterized by non-normal distributions. The second concerns approaches to the evaluation of Six Sigma performance without assuming normal probability distributions. Next, we discuss each of these two research areas.

Several studies have been conducted in regard to implementation of the Six Sigma methodology in large manufacturing companies; nevertheless, as confirmed by many literature reviews, relatively few studies have reported the successful implementation of Six Sigma in service systems that, arguably, represent the life-blood of the modern economy (Aboelmaged, 2010; Stone, 2012). Behara, Fontenot, and Gresham (1995) presented a case study to illustrate how the concept of zero defects, as measured by Six Sigma, can be applied to the measurement of customer satisfaction and to examine the impact of customer expectations on the company's strategies for improving satisfaction. The information presented is based on actual studies conducted for a high‐tech manufacturing company. Chakraborty and Chuan (2012) suggested that the implementation and impact of Six Sigma can be affected by contextual factors such as service types. The authors argued that management support and team member support are primary factors for success. Exploratory empirical evidence was provided through many case studies of organizations. They include a hospital, a public service organization, a consultancy service and a hotel. The major findings of the authors include an understanding about the suitability of Six Sigma implementation in service organizations. In addition, Chakraborty and Chuan (2013) highlighted that “top management commitment and involvement” are indeed important and critical factors for success, and the continuity of Six Sigma very much depends on these factors. The authors investigated the implementation of Six Sigma in service organizations through questionnaire surveys. They found that Six Sigma implementation in service organizations is limited across the globe. Service organizations in the USA and Europe are front-runners in implementation of Six Sigma, with Asian countries such as India and Singapore following behind. Their findings also showed that organizations from the healthcare and banking sectors have largely implemented the Six Sigma methodology, and other services, such as information technology, telecommunication services and transport services, are gradually incorporating Six Sigma. Antony, Antony, Kumar, and Cho (2007) presented some of the most common challenges, difficulties, common myths, and implementation issues in the application of Six Sigma in service industry settings. They also discussed the benefits of Six Sigma in service organizations and presented the results of a Six Sigma pilot survey in the UK. The results of their study showed that the majority of service organizations in the UK have been engaged in a Six Sigma initiative for just over three years. Management commitment and involvement, customer focus, linking Six Sigma to business strategy, organizational infrastructure, project management skills, and understanding of the Six Sigma methodology were identified as the most critical factors for the successful introduction, development and deployment of Six Sigma. Chakraborty and Leyer (2013) developed a framework that defined organizational conditions by which to implement Six Sigma in financial service companies. They showed that it is important to link Six Sigma to the strategic as well as the operational level. By analysing case studies of financial institutions in Thailand, Buavaraporn and Tannock (2013) formulated relationships between specific business process-improvement (BPI) initiatives and customer satisfaction. They developed a model based on service quality principles to explain the outcomes of BPI adoption at the operational level. In the context of Indian service companies,
Talib, Rahman, and Qureshi (2013)
 empirically investigated the relationship between total quality management practices and quality performance.

Our analysis of the literature regarding Six Sigma performance without the normality assumption reveals that this assumption is usually “taken for granted” without a proper inquiry into whether this assumption has been fulfilled or not. Given that critical attributes may contain data sets that are non-normally distributed, Setijono (2010) presented a method of estimating left-side and right-side Sigma levels. In this method, to fulfil the assumption of normality, the primary data were “replicated” by first generating random numbers that followed a normal standard distribution and then re-calculating these random numbers with the mean, standard deviation, and the skewness of the primary data. Simulation technique was then applied to generate a larger amount of secondary data as the basis for estimating left-side and right-side Sigma levels. This method was applied in a Swedish house-building construction project. The calculated Sigma levels suggested that the developer's performance was still far below Six Sigma level of performance. Because most service quality data follow a non-normal distribution,
Pan, Kuo, and Bretholt (2010)
 developed a new key performance index (KPI) and its interval estimation for measuring the service quality from customers' perceptions. Based on the non-normal process capability indices used in manufacturing industries, a new KPI suitable for measuring service quality was developed. In addition, the confidence interval of the proposed KPI was established using the bootstrapping method. The results showed that the new KPI allowed practicing managers to evaluate the actual service quality level delivered and to prioritize the possible improvement projects from customers' perspectives. Furthermore, compared with the traditional method of sample size determination, it was shown that a substantial amount of cost savings could be expected using the suggested sample sizes.
Hsu, Pearn, and Wu (2008)
 considered the problem of determining the adjustments for process capability with mean shift when data follow a Gamma distribution. Using the adjusted process capability formula in Hsu et al. (2008), engineers were able to determine the actual process capability more accurately. A real-world semi-conductor production plant was investigated and presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Pan and Wu (1997) developed new performance indicators for non-normal data by breaking quality characteristics into bilateral specifications, unilateral specification with target value, and unilateral specification without target value. They proposed formulas for performance measurement and put forward a flowchart for calculating performance indices of normal and non-normal data. There are also some approaches using Clements's method, Burr's method, and the BOX–COX method to estimate performance indices of non-normal processes.
Ahmad, Abdollahian, and Zeefungsecul (2008)
 compared these methods and concluded that estimations by Burr's method yielded better results that are closer to the real performance factors. Other existing approaches consist of transforming data such that they satisfy normality conditions. For example,
Chou, Polansky, and Mason (1998)
 and
Amiri, Bashiri, Mogouie, and Doroudyan (2012)
 considered data transformations to convert non-normal data into normal data. The process capability index also can be evaluated using approximate heuristic approaches. For example, in Abbasi (2009), an artificial neural network is proposed to estimate the process capability index (PCI) for right skewed distributions without appeal to the probability distribution function of the process. The proposed neural network estimated PCI using skewness, kurtosis and upper specification limit as input variables. The performance of the proposed method was validated by a simulation study for different non-normal distributions.

The above-mentioned papers confirm that Six Sigma theory and implementation have not been sufficiently studied for service processes. Only a few papers have dealt with this important issue. A challenge to applying Six Sigma methodology in service processes is the fact that, in most cases, the underlying processes are non-normal. Our literature review also shows that the majority of the existing studies are based on the normality assumption. Our work rather develops an approach for Six Sigma performance evaluation without assuming normal probability distributions. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, we evaluate the Six Sigma performance using exponential, Gamma and Weibull distributions. Guidelines are provided to help managers to more accurately estimate the efforts required to achieve the performance goal of Six Sigma. Next, two optimization models are developed to analyze the effect of inaccurately estimating the quality effort. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the Six Sigma performance methodology has been evaluated to analyze the robustness of quality optimization models under inaccurate probability distributions.

The proposed methodology can be summarized by the following steps.

                        
                           
                              Step 1 – Illustration of the Six Sigma failure rate goal of 3.4 parts per million or 2 parts per billion:
                           

This is based on the use of a simple example from the manufacturing industry.


                              Step 2 – Analysis of the Six Sigma performance for exponential processes:
                           

Using exponentially distributed data, this analysis is based on an analytical evaluation and a comparison of the values obtained for exponential and normal distributions.


                              Step 3 – Generalization of the analysis:
                           

The results of Step 2 are extended by considering Gamma and Weibull processes.


                              Step 4 – Analysis of the effect of inaccurately estimating the quality effort: For this, two optimization models are developed. Our first model is a step-loss quality model, and the second model addresses a problem that arises with Six Sigma project selection. These optimization models are presented to support our analysis of Six Sigma performance. They are proposed to analyze the robustness of quality improvement strategies.

The next sections detail each of the four steps above.

The 3.4 parts per million and 2 parts per billion process failure rates are major performance goals of Six Sigma. These goals are founded on two key assumptions: the process under analysis is normally distributed, and the process specifications are two-sided. The following example from the manufacturing industry sheds some light on these performance goals.

In this example, a manufacturer needs to produce cylindrical shafts with 2.00 ± 0.06 centimeter diameter specifications. Any shaft produced outside the 1.94 and 2.06 lower and upper specification limits (LSL and USL) is denoted as defective (Fig. 1
                        ). In the traditional goal-post or binary view of quality, a shaft produced with a diameter that falls anywhere within the specification limits is considered non-defective. However, in the parabolic view of quality, the process performance increases as the diameter of the manufactured shaft is closer to the target (nominal) value (TV) (and away from the upper and lower specification limits).

Assuming that the cylindrical shaft manufacturing process follows a normal distribution with a mean of 2.00 centimeter (equal to the TV) and a standard deviation (σ) of 0.02 centimeter, we calculate Δ, the difference between LSL or USL and TV in terms of the process variation σ, as follows:

                           
                              
                                 
                                    Δ

                                             )
                                          
                                       
                                       
                                          0.02
                                       
                                    
                                    =
                                    6
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

Therefore, the process is said to be a 3σ process (i.e., amount of variation on either side of TV) with a calculated failure rate of 2700 parts per million using the normal distribution function. If the engineer can improve the quality of the cylindrical shaft-making process, thereby reducing the process variation σ to 0.01 centimeter, then Δ = 12. This results in a 6σ process with a failure rate of 2 parts per billion, as illustrated in Fig. 2
                        . For statistical references, see, for example, Montgomery and Runger (2011) or Chandra (2001).

The assumption of a normal distribution is generally appropriate for machine manufacturing; however, for service or transaction systems, the normality assumption comes into question. Because many professionals do not confirm normality, or calculate the difference between the process mean and the target value, a common practice is to account for normality deviation by allowing for a shift of ± 1.5σ on either side of the target value (Bothe, 2002). This leads to Δ = 9, a 4.5σ process with a failure rate of 3.4 parts per million. Fig. 3
                         shows the effect of a 1.5σ process shift to the right. Note that such a shift has a greater consequence in the case of 3σ processes, resulting in a defect rate of 66,810 parts per million.

As previously mentioned, many transactional and service processes do not follow a normal distribution. Moreover, their specification limits are not necessarily two-sided. This would generally yield a different approach and, consequently, different failure rates. Such non-normality is commonly accounted for in the Six Sigma projects using the ±1.5σ allowance. However, in this section, we show that for certain applications, a seemingly ample allowance of 1.5σ is not always adequate.

As an example, take the payment by oil companies of their suppliers' bills, which industry practice requires be paid within 30 days upon receipt of an accurate bill. This process could be modeled by an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 days. Because the specification is one-sided with a target value (TV) of zero, a kσ process should be redefined such that the entire deviation, 2kσ, is one-sided. This concept also requires that the one-sided normal be redefined so that TV is not equal to the mean of 15 days, and therefore the total failure rate is also on one side of the TV.

For the exponential distribution, the standard deviation equals the mean, and the resulting 3σ process has a failure rate of 2479 parts per million. This performance compares favourably against the 3σ process of 2700 parts per million in the normally distributed case. Furthermore, to improve the process average to 2.5 days, we obtain a 6σ process with a failure rate of 6.144 parts per million, which in this scenario, compares much less favourably against the 6σ normal process claim of 0.002 parts per million (Table 1
                           ).


                           Table 1
 also demonstrates that for the normal distribution 6σ goal of 2 parts per billion to be valid for an exponential distribution, a 10σ process needs to be targeted with mean and standard deviation of approximately 1.5 days.


                           Fig. 4
                            shows the behaviour of kσ processes for the two distribution types on a logarithmic scale. It is interesting to note that the exponential distribution has a lower failure rate than the normal distribution up to approximately 3σ; then, the situation reverses with an increasingly greater difference in failure rates.

Now, if we assume a 1.5σ shift in the process mean, then the direction of shift becomes an important consideration. For the 6σ exponential case, a 1.5σ shift in the process mean to the left is inconsequential because the mean would be below the TV of zero, and in all cases, any shift to the left side should not be considered because it is in the direction of improvement. However, if we were to allow the mean to shift 1.5σ to the right from its current value of 2.5 days as shown in Fig. 5
                           , this would produce a failure rate of 8230 parts per million (Table 2). By applying a similar analysis to the 3σ process, the calculated failure rate is 90,720 parts per million for the shifted mean exponential.

From
Table 2
, for the shifted 6σ normally distributed goal of 3.4 parts per million to be valid for an exponential distribution, a 15.75σ process must be targeted with a mean and standard deviation of approximately 0.9523 days. Similar to Fig. 4, Fig. 6
                           
                            shows that the exponential distribution has a lower failure rate than the normal distribution up to somewhere between 2σ and 3σ, and then the situation reverses with an increasingly greater difference in failure rates.

From the analysis of the exponential distribution example, it is clear that one must first determine the distribution of the underlying data in order to estimate the efforts, as defined by the amount of reduction in σ, required to improve performance. For example, in the un-shifted case, exponentially distributed data from a process performing at less than 3σ would achieve improvement faster than normally distributed data. However, if the process is performing at higher than 3σ and the target is to achieve the goal 6σ failure rate of 2 parts per billion, then the exponential process would require more than twice the variation reduction as that of a normal distribution. The variation reduction required is even larger for the shifted case (more than four times). It is important to emphasize that higher Sigma processes for a given distribution are generally more difficult to improve than lower ones, which would further add to the total effort required to achieve Six Sigma performance level goals.

The tables given in the Appendix show the failure rates for Gamma and Weibull distributions with respect to the Sigma level. Of note, the failure rate with respect to the Sigma level for both distributions is affected only by the shape parameter α, and the scale parameter β has no effect. As shown in the Appendix, the failure rate for the Weibull distribution is much more sensitive to the value α than the failure rate for the Gamma distribution. These results support our concern that simply reporting the Sigma level as an indication of the quality of a product or process can be misleading. For example, for a quality characteristic that follows the Weibull distribution with shape parameter 3, the failure rate is greater than 25% for a 6 Sigma level of performance. This is Weibull distribution performance that is worse than the 2 parts per billion failure rate for the normal distribution.

In this section, two optimization models are developed to analyze the effect of inaccurate estimations of probability distributions on the optimal solutions. The first model is a step-loss quality model, and the second addresses a problem in Six Sigma project selection.

This optimization model is voluntarily simplistic. It is developed for a preliminary illustration of the effect of underestimating the effort required to improve quality on the total cost. Consider that many quality-improvement strategies are available. Each strategy is characterized by cost and a potential quality level. For example, a 6 sigma quality-improvement strategy is more expensive than that for 5 Sigma. We need to select the most appropriate alternative. The objective function, which consists of minimizing the total cost, is the sum of (1) the cost incurred in deploying the selected quality-improvement strategy and (2) the cost incurred as a result of defective items or services. On the one hand, selecting the best quality-improvement strategy is more expensive but leads to fewer defective items or services. On the other hand, less expensive improvement strategies lead to higher costs as a result of poor-quality items or services. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the most favourable trade-off between quality-improvement costs and poor-quality costs.

We use a step-loss function based on a conformance quality definition of a quality characteristic being acceptable if it falls inside predetermined specification limits

                           , represents an estimation of the annual cost incurred as a result of poor quality. For tangible products, this may correspond to the costs of annual production, rework, repair or scrapping, etc. In service systems, this may correspond to any cost incurred because of failure to fulfil the service on time. The failure rate FR
                              i
                            depends on the selected quality level. For example, for a 6 Sigma quality level, this is equal to 3.4 parts per million for a shifted normally distributed process and to 8230 parts per million for a shifted exponentially distributed one (see Table 2).

Consider that 10 quality-improvement strategies (n = 10) are possible. Each
                           
                            strategy i corresponds to a kσ process in Table 2 (k = i = 1,…,10). Table 3 presents the costs of each kσ process with corresponding failure rates. The costs in Table 3 correspond with the fact that, in most cases, more effort will be required to improve a process from a 5 Sigma to 6 Sigma level compared to improving a process from a 3 Sigma to 4 Sigma level. The average number of services per year is Q = 100,000. We assume that the unitary rejection cost is r = $10,000.

The results are presented in Table 4 and show that when we consider a normal distribution, the optimal solution is found for a 6 Sigma level with a total cost of $403,400. However, if the probability distribution is instead exponential, the optimal solution corresponds to a 9 Sigma level with a total cost of $2,847,000. On the other hand, the actual total cost if we consider a 6 Sigma level is $8,630,000 for an exponential process (instead of $403,400 calculated under the normal assumption).

The total quality cost of the objective function in models (2)–(4) consists of: Failure/Rejection costs (e.g. scrap, rework, warranty, investigation, correction, reputation, and loss of customers); and Appraisal and Prevention costs (e.g. inspection, audit, reviews, and improvement projects). It is true that not all costs are easy to quantify (e.g. reputation, image, and loss of customers). However, many organizations managed to estimate the various components of quality costs. Therefore, it is not unusual to select a strategy with higher failure cost and lower prevention cost if it minimizes the total cost (i.e. the Failure/Rejection, plus Prevention and Appraisal costs). This remark was explicitly pointed out for example by Juran and Gryna (1993) and Kubiak and Benbow (2009). As for zero defects, it is a goal that is not possible to achieve, even in life threatening operations (e.g. airplanes). It remains that for companies that are very sensitive to service level, the failure cost will be relatively high (because the estimated costs related to loss of customers, image and reputation are very high). In this case, the lowest failure rate is preferred as long as the available quality budget allows this.

This optimization model is developed to highlight the effect of assuming a normal distribution on the selection process of Six Sigma projects. Because many of the most successful manufacturing and oil and gas companies implement thousands of Six Sigma projects every year, let us consider a set of processes with nj
                            quality-improvement candidate projects for each process. Each project i

                            is characterized by a cost and a quality level. Note that project 0 corresponds to the case where no quality improvement is implemented (status quo).

We need to select the most suitable set of Six Sigma projects and the corresponding quality levels. We consider that the objective consists of maximizing the total profit, as defined by the selling price minus the total cost. The latter is the sum of (1) the cost incurred in implementing the selected quality projects for the selected processes and (2) the cost incurred because of defective items or services in all selected projects. On the one hand, selecting many processes and the best quality-improvement projects is more expensive but leads to fewer defective items or services. On the other hand, fewer selected processes and less expensive projects lead to higher costs incurred as a result of poor quality. The goal of the optimization model is to select the appropriate set of processes/projects and quality levels, while taking into account the trade-off between quality-improvement and poor-quality costs. Indeed, as the objective is to maximize the total profit, the selling price of the conforming items is also taken into account.

                           , represents an estimation of the annual cost incurred as a result of poor quality for all selected projects. Constraint (6) specifies that for each process, only one quality-improvement project can be selected. Constraint (7) specifies the budget constraint. In fact, most companies do not have unlimited funds to implement process-improvement projects. Therefore, there is generally a limited budget allocated to all Six Sigma projects. Thus, constraint (7) guarantees that the budget limit is not exceeded. The last constraint specifies that the decision variables are binary.

Consider that we must choose between 2 candidate processes or operations for improvement (j = 1, 2) and that 2 potential quality-improvement projects are possible (i = 1, 2). For both processes, the first project corresponds to a 3 Sigma quality level, and the second is a 6 Sigma quality level. We assume that the current situation (i = 0) corresponds to a One Sigma quality level. The failure rates of normal and exponential distributions are grouped in Table 5. The available budget is B =  $200,000. All other data are presented in Table 6.

The results are given in Tables 7
                            and 8
                            for normal and exponential distributions, respectively.

We note the following for the status quo situation (one Sigma level):

                              
                                 •
                                 A loss is observed under the normal distribution assumption (– $416,728);

A profit of $1,212,402 is realized for the exponential distribution case.

This is because the failure rate of an exponentially distributed process is less than that of a normal process for less than 3 Sigma quality levels. On the other hand, for 3 and 6 Sigma levels, the situation reverses.

We conclude the following from this example:

                              
                                 –
                                 Under the normality assumption, the optimization model selects Process 1 with Quality level 1 and Process 2 with Quality level 2;

When distributions are considered exponential, the model instead selects Process 1 with Quality level 1 and Process 2 with Quality level 1.

The aforementioned difference is the quality level (i.e., project) selection for Process 2. The optimal profit realized under the normal distribution is 3,786,197; this same solution is infeasible for exponential processes under the fixed budget constraint.

The results above confirm that it is mandatory to accurately estimate the efforts required to achieve the performance goal of Six Sigma. That is once data are collected, a special emphasis must be put in identifying the right probability distribution, instead of merely assuming a normal distribution as it is often the case in the current practice.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the existing literature, Six Sigma theory and implementation have not been sufficiently studied for service processes. Only a relatively small number of papers have dealt with this important issue. A challenge to applying Six Sigma methodology in service processes is the fact that, in most cases, the underlying processes are non-normal. However, the majority of the existing studies are based on the normality assumption. Unlike the prior literature, this paper has developed an approach for Six Sigma performance evaluation without assuming normal probability distributions. In comparison to the existing studies, the contributions of this study are twofold. First, we have evaluated the Six Sigma performance using exponential, Gamma and Weibull distributions. Next, two optimization models were developed to analyze the effect of inaccurately estimating the quality effort. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the Six Sigma performance methodology has been evaluated to analyze the robustness of quality optimization models under inaccurate probability distributions. Managerial insights were provided through the paper using many illustrative numerical examples. Guidelines were then provided to help managers to more accurately estimate the efforts required to achieve the performance goal of Six Sigma. We demonstrated that, by using the exponential distribution rather than the normal distribution, the variation reduction required to improve a process at a lower than given kσ level is less than that when the process is beyond that level. Moreover, we have shown that achieving the performance goal of Six Sigma when the process is exponential is more demanding than that for the normally distributed case. The consequences of non-normality on the failure rate were analyzed for Gamma and Weibull distributions. These analyses demonstrate that attaining the Six Sigma performance goals require varying different effort levels based on the distribution type. Therefore, it is reasonable that the distribution type is accounted for and specifically calculated when an organization plans for its next Six Sigma initiative. We have shown that achieving the performance goal of Six Sigma in the exponential, Weibull and Gamma cases requires a greater variation reduction than that for the normally distributed case, although for less than the Six Sigma level, it is possible that less variation reduction is required. Finally, using two optimization models, we have analyzed the robustness of the optimal solution to minimize cost when an exponential process is assumed to be normal. The results indicated that an incorrect estimation of the probability distribution, and thus the quality effort may lead to erroneous solutions when selecting quality programs and Six Sigma projects.

The purpose of this article is not to advocate for changing the term Six Sigma or cast doubt on its business value. Instead, we hope to highlight the effect of distribution types in an effort to promote professionalism and accuracy in regard to the 3.4 parts per million or 2 parts per billion target performance goals made by Six Sigma practitioners. That is, instead of systematically assuming normal distributions in Six Sigma projects, managers need to make significant efforts and a sense of awareness to identify the right probability distribution for each process.

This paper does not identify which distribution is better for service systems. We are currently developing a theoretical model to explain why the normality assumption is highly questionable for cycle times in service processes. In addition, no field study is provided to support our claims. Future work will aim to apply the results of this study to the Commercial Department of a Gas and Oil company in Kuwait.

In this section, the failure rates for the Gamma and Weibull distributions are presented for different sigma levels. Because the failure rates for both distributions are only affected by the value of their shape parameter α, the scale parameter β is fixed at an arbitrary value of 2 in all the calculations below. The probability density function, mean, and variance for the Gamma distribution are given by, respectively
