                  In this article, we consider the T
                     2 control chart for bivariate samples of size n with observations that are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. The cross covariance matrix of the sample mean vectors is derived with the assumption that the observations are described by a multivariate first order autoregressive model – VAR (1). The combined effect of the correlation and autocorrelation on the performance of the T
                     2 chart is also investigated. Earlier studies proved that changes in only one variable are detected faster when the variables are correlated. This result extends to the case that one or both variables are also autocorrelated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In most literature on statistical process control, it is assumed that observations are independent over time. However, in many applications the dynamics of the process induce correlation in observations that are closely spaced in time. The autocorrelation has a serious impact on the performance of conventional control charts (Kalgonda & Kulkarni, 2004). Recently, Du and Lv (2013) proposed a control chart based on the minimal Euclidian distance to detect mean shifts in autocorrelated processes. Lin, Chou, Wang, and Liu (2012) considered the economic design of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) control chart, which has been shown to be suitable for monitoring series of autocorrelated data. Franco, Costa, and Machado (2012) considered the first-order autoregressive model, AR (1), to describe the wandering behavior of the process mean, and they used Duncan’s model to obtain the optimum values of the 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                      chart parameters. Costa and Machado (2011) also used the AR (1) model to investigate the effect of the wandering behavior of the process mean on the performance of the variable parameter 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                      chart and on the performance of the double sampling 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                      chart.

To reduce the negative effect of autocorrelation on the statistical performance of the Shewhart 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                      control chart, Costa and Castagliola (2011) proposed a sampling strategy denoted ‘s-skip’. According to this strategy, samples are obtained by collecting one item from the production line and then skipping s consecutive items before selecting the next one. Alternatively, Franco, Castagliola, Celano, and Costa (2013) introduced the mixed sampling strategy where the samples are composed with units selected from the last two rational subgroups. A numerical analysis shows that the mixed sampling outperforms the skip sampling strategy for high levels of autocorrelation. Recently, Franco, Celano, Castagliola, and Costa (2014) investigated the economic-statistical design of the 
                        
                           X
                           ¯
                        
                      chart with the skip sampling strategy.

Modern manufacturing systems with advanced technology and high production rates results in processes that are multidimensional, cross and serially correlated. Hotelling (1947) suggested the use of the T
                     2 statistic for monitoring the mean vector of multivariate processes. Seven decades later, Chen (2007) and Chen and Hsieh (2007) considered adaptive sampling schemes to enhance the performance of the T
                     2 chart. Pan and Jarrett (2011) described some processes that are both multivariate and serially correlated. According to Huang, Bisgaard, and Xu (2014), autocorrelation increases the false-alarm risk, while cross-correlation reduces the power of the control chart. The combined effect of autocorrelation and cross-correlation on the performance of the T
                     2 chart is worth to be investigated.

In many modern processes the observations of correlated quality characteristics gathered in rational subgroups of size n are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. In this context, and under the assumption that the observations are given by a multivariate first order autoregressive model, VAR (1), in this paper we obtain the cross-covariance matrix of the sample mean vector (
                        
                           Γ
                           
                              X
                              ¯
                           
                        
                     ). The cross-covariance matrix 
                        
                           Γ
                           
                              X
                              ¯
                           
                        
                      is important for the investigation of the effect of cross-correlation and autocorrelation on the performance of the T
                     2 chart.

The paper is
                      organized as follows. Section 2 and Appendix A describe the VAR (1) model and the bivariate cross-covariance matrix of the sample mean vector. Section 3 investigates the effects of autocorrelation and cross-correlation on the performance of the T
                     2 chart. Section 4 presents an illustrative example. Section 5 gives the conclusion and suggests for future research. In Appendix B, we investigate the level of the autocorrelations for which the detection power of the T
                     2 chart for individual observations is equal to the detection power of the T
                     2 chart for samples of size n.

Autocorrelation measures
                     
                      the dependence between observations of the same quality characteristic, while cross-correlation measures the dependence between observations of the monitored quality characteristics. The multivariate autoregressive model for cross and serially correlated data has been adopted in recent studies dealing with multivariate control charts (Huang et al., 2014; Huang, Xu, & Bisgaard, 2013; Hwarng & Wang, 2010; Pan & Jarrett, 2007).

The Hotelling T
                     2 control chart is the most referenced control scheme for detecting mean shifts in multivariate processes (Hotelling, 1947).

To study the effects of auto- and cross-correlation on the performance of the T
                     2 chart for bivariate process and we assume rational subgroups of size n = 4. The performance of the T
                     2 chart is measured by the average run length (ARL). When the process is in-control, the ARL measures the rate of false alarms. A chart with a larger in-control ARL (ARL0) has a lower false alarm rate than other charts. A chart with a smaller out-of-control ARL has a better ability to detect process changes than other charts. In practice, a preliminary sample is taken to estimate the cross-covariance matrix 
                        Γ
                      and, subsequently, the parameters a, b and ρ; see Eqs. (3) and (4).

In this figure, disturbances affecting either a single variable or both of them were also considered. It is interesting to notice that the ARL is not affected by the autocorrelation if only one of the two independent variables is autocorrelated and robust to the occurrence of assignable causes (ρ = 0, a = 0, b ≠ 0, δ
                     2 = 0). As λ is a function of

                      the performance of the T

To investigate the effect of the autocorrelation level on the overall performance of the bivariate T
                     2 charts, the ARLs in Tables 2, 3 and 4 were computed with Eq. (9). We considered uncorrelated variables,

                      and variables with low and high correlation,

                      or 0.7. Tables 2 and 4 consider the cases in which the two variables are affected by the assignable cause (in Table 2,

                     1 ≠ δ
                     2). Table 3 considers the cases in which only one variable is affected by the assignable cause (δ
                     1 or

                     2) = (0, 0.2, 1.0, 0) and the two variables are uncorrelated (ρ = 0), the T
                     2 chart requires, on average, 9.41 samples to signal. This number decreases to 3.24 when the variables are highly correlated (

                     2) = (0, 0.2, 0, 1.0) the T
                     2 chart requires, on average, 13.99 samples to signal. This number decreases to 8.08 when (a,  b,  δ

The performance of the T
                     2 chart depends on the inverse of the cross covariance matrix of the sample mean vector. Its parameters θ
                     11 and θ
                     22 increase with the size of the sample, but θ
                     11 decreases with a, and θ
                     22 decreases with b. Table 5 shows several combinations of ρ, a, b, and n for which

To investigate the effect of the sample size on the performance of the T

The inner diameter (X) and the thickness (Y) of carbon fiber tubes are monitored during the drilling process. With the process in control, a preliminary sample was collected and the two quality characteristics were measured, see Table 9. This example was introduced by Santos Fernández (2012).

A study based on this database allowed to conclude that the two variables satisfactorily fits to a VAR (1) model. The adequacy of the model was tested using the goodness-of-fit Portmanteau test, for details see (Lütkepohl, 2005). The database was also used to estimate the in-control mean vector, the cross covariance matrix 
                        Γ
                      and the autocorrelation matrix, see (Montgomery, 2009) for details

In this
                      article we evaluated the performance of the bivariate Hotelling’s T
                     2 chart for rational subgroups with observations that are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. The autocorrelation has a strong and negative impact on the performance of the T
                     2 chart, especially when more frequents and/or larger shifts occur on the mean of the variable with the higher level of autocorrelation. It is also worth to note that, depending on the level of the autocorrelations the T
                     2 chart based on individual observations signals faster than the T
                     2 chart based on rational subgroups. For example, when the observations of two variables have the same level of autocorrelation and they are moderate or high (
                        
                           a
                           =
                           b
                           >
                           0.5
                        
                     ), the bivariate T
                     2 chart for individual observations performs better than the bivariate T
                     2 chart for rational subgroups of size two. Regarding to the correlation, if the dependence among X observations and among Y observations are the same (or close), that is, a ≅ b, T
                     2 chart has a better overall performance when the variables X and Y are highly correlated.

The authors are currently investigating the use of the skip sampling strategy proposed by Costa and Castagliola (2011) and the mixed sampling strategy proposed by Franco et al. (2013) to reduce the negative effect of the autocorrelations on the statistical performance of the T
                     2 control chart.

If n units of the sample are collected close together in time, and the length of the sampling interval h is large enough to eliminate any dependence between samples, the vector with the observations of the jth unit is described by a first-order autoregressive model:

The detection power of the control chart is function of λ
                     2(n), the non-centrality parameter of the chi-square distribution; consequently, if λ
                     2(1) =λ
                     2(n) the detection power of the T
                     2 chart for individual observations is equal to the detection power of T
                     2 chart for samples of size n.

                     Table 5 also provides the values of b

                     2(1) = λ
                     2(n) for (δ
                     1 =  0, a = 0). The value of b
                     * is independent of δ
                     2 but dependent on ρ. When a = b > a

                     2 chart for individual observations performs better than the T
