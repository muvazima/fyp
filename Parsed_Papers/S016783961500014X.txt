                      continuous splines of degree 2, defined on Sibson–Thomson refinement. The basis functions have a local support, they are nonnegative, and they form a partition of unity. The dilatation equation can be found by applying the dyadic subdivision scheme directly to the Sibson–Thomson spline basis functions. As an application, a quasi-interpolation method, based on this Sibson–Thomson B-spline representation, is described which can be used for the efficient visualization of gridded surface data.

                      can be obtained from a rectangular mesh by dividing each rectangular patch into four rectangles by arbitrary parallels to its vertical and horizontal edges. Then, each subrectangle is subdivided into four triangles by its diagonals. The structure of these splines has been analyzed in Beatson and Ziegler (1985), Lorente-Pardo et al. (2000), Sibson and Thomson (1981), Sibson (1980) and they can be computed in Bernstein–Bézier form (Farin, 1986; Lorente-Pardo et al., 2000). In Dubuc and Merrien (1999), given f and ∇f at the vertices of a rectangular mesh, Dubuc and Merrien have studied an algorithm

                     Sorokina and Zeilfelder (2004) have presented a method to construct quasi-interpolation operators based on quadratic

                     -splines on uniform type-2 triangulation. The Bernstein–Bézier coefficients of the piecewise quadratic polynomials are directly determined by appropriate combinations of the data values. Their motivation, it seems difficult – if not impossible – to construct local and stable bases for splines

                     -splines on uniform type-2 triangulation. However, representing complex surfaces requires the use of a large number of Bézier triangles. Preserving a certain degree of continuity between all patches results in a large set of non-trivial relations between their Bézier ordinates. These relations are hard to implement and they hinder the designer to make predictable local changes (Vanraes, 2004). On the other hand, the operator described in Sorokina and Zeilfelder (2004) was first developed in Chui and He (1986) (see also Dagnino and Lamberti, 2005; Sablonnière, 2003) by using a completely different approach based on the so-called box-splines, which are locally supported and not linearly independent splines. A well-known example where linear independence does not hold is the

                     -quadratic Zwart–Powell element defined on a four-directional (criss-cross) partition of the plane (Wang, 2001).

The aim of this paper is to show that ST splines could be compactly represented in a normalized B-spline basis. The basis functions have a local support, they are nonnegative, and they form a partition of unity. This representation has an intuitive geometric interpretation involving tangent control triangles. There exist many sets of basis functions with a similar construction based on Powell–Sabin partitions with different degrees (see for example Dierckx, 1997; Lamnii et al., 2014; Speleers, 2010a, 2013b). Similar B-spline representation for bivariate reduced Clough–Tocher splines has been considered in Speleers (2010b). Recently, a simplex spline basis for the 
                        
                           
                              C

                     -quadratics on the Powell–Sabin-12 with all the usual properties of the univariate B-spline basis was discovered (Cohen et al., 2013).

In addition, we discuss dyadic subdivision scheme for the ST spline surfaces. The goal is to calculate the B-spline representation of a surface on a dyadic refinement of the given triangulation. More precisely, we show that the basis functions are translated and dilated of one vectors of scaling function. Hence, the dilatation equation can be found by applying the subdivision scheme directly to the ST spline basis functions. Moreover, we use some results on blossoming to establish general Marsden identities representing polynomials of at most degree 2 in terms of ST B-splines of 
                        
                           
                              C

                     -smoothness. As a consequence, we employ the bivariate polarization formulas to construct different families of differential and discrete quasi-interpolants (q.i.s.) reproducing bivariate polynomials of degree 2 and have an optimal approximation order.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the definition of the ST spline space. Section 3 describes the construction of a normalized B-spline basis, which is based on determining a set of triangles that contain a specific set of points, and the Marsden's identity for the

                     -continuous ST splines. In Section 4 we discuss dyadic subdivision scheme for the ST spline surfaces. In Section 5, we present an approach to construct the q.i.s. based on this representation. The approach is illustrated by the construction of Hermite interpolant and particular q.i.s. based on function evaluations. Finally, in order to illustrate our results, we give in Section 6 some numerical examples.

                     , forming the ST triangle. ST triangles are very useful to geometrically identify and describe ST B-splines and their properties. ST triangles are not uniquely defined (see Fig. 4
                     ). One possibility for their construction is to calculate a triangle of minimal area subjected to the constraints of Theorem 1. As Powell–Sabin B-splines (Dierckx, 1997), we can propose an optimization strategy to select triangles with minimal area ensuring positivity of the corresponding ST B-splines.

                     Dubuc and Merrien (1999) show that the quadratic finite element of ST can be constructed by Hermite dyadic interpolation. Lounsberg et al. (1997) proved that with every subdivision scheme, a sequence of nested linear spaces, with the corresponding basis functions, the scaling functions can be associated. It is then possible to associate the ST B-splines and

In order to simplify the construction the uniform ST B-splines, we give explicitly the 3 B-spline functions

Frequently in practice one has to approximate given values at scattered data points where no derivative information is provided. In this case, we propose some q.i.s. based on point evaluators. More precisely, we look for q.i.s. of the form (27) with

                         An interesting question is how to construct sets of points satisfying the GC condition. Busch (1990) has been proved that the set of 6 points in the plane satisfying the GC condition must contain 3 collinear points. Some important examples have been given in Chui and He (1986), such as natural lattices and principal lattices. First example, consider the triangle
