                  Introduction
                  This article explores how measures of semantic similarity and relatedness are impacted by the semantic groups to which the concepts they are measuring belong. Our goal is to determine if there are distinctions between homogeneous comparisons (where both concepts belong to the same group) and heterogeneous ones (where the concepts are in different groups). Our hypothesis is that the similarity measures will be significantly affected since they rely on hierarchical is-a relations, whereas relatedness measures should be less impacted since they utilize a wider range of relations. In addition, we also evaluate the effect of combining different measures of similarity and relatedness. Our hypothesis is that these combined measures will more closely correlate with human judgment, since they better reflect the rich variety of information humans use when assessing similarity and relatedness.
               
               
                  Method
                  We evaluate our method on four reference standards. Three of the reference standards were annotated by human judges for relatedness and one was annotated for similarity.
               
               
                  Results
                  We found significant differences in the correlation of semantic similarity and relatedness measures with human judgment, depending on which semantic groups were involved. We also found that combining a definition based relatedness measure with an information content similarity measure resulted in significant improvements in correlation over individual measures.
               
               
                  Availability
                  The semantic similarity and relatedness package is an open source program available from http://umls-similarity.sourceforge.net/. The reference standards are available at http://www.people.vcu.edu/∼{}btmcinnes/downloads.html.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Semantic similarity and relatedness measures quantify the degree to which two concepts are similar (e.g., liver-organ) or related (e.g., headache- aspirin). Relatedness encompasses many kinds of relations, but generally shows how associated two concepts are with each other. For example, a headache can be treated with aspirin. Similarity is a specific relation that is a subset of relatedness, and is based on the degree to which two concepts are connected through hierarchical is-a relations. For example, organ could be an ancestor of liver in an is-a hierarchy, and would therefore have a high similarity score. Headache and aspirin, on the other hand, are not closely connected by any is-a relations, and so would have a low similarity score. However, since they may be connected by other kinds of relations (e.g., treated by) they could have a very high relatedness score.

The automated discovery of groups of semantically similar or related concepts and terms is critical to improving the retrieval [1] and clustering [2] of biomedical and clinical documents, and the development of biomedical terminologies and ontologies [3]. As such, a number of different similarity measures have been developed for the biomedical domain. These have been evaluated intrinsically via comparisons to various human reference standards [4,5], as well as extrinsically depending on how well they contribute to the performance of secondary applications [6,7]. However, to date there has been little work that considers the type of concept being evaluated. Our objective is to evaluate how measures of similarity and relatedness perform depending on the semantic groups of the concepts involved.

Similarity measures find paths between concepts in an is-a hierarchy. Concept pairs from different semantic groups may well be in different hierarchies and therefore not be connected by is-a relations. In addition, these different hierarchies may have different levels of granularity and coverage. Given these considerations, our hypothesis is that there will be a large degree of change in the correlation of similarity measures with human reference standards when the concepts in a pair are from different semantic groups. Our results support this hypothesis. We found that no single measure performed best over all the different semantic group pairs.

In this work, we also combined measures based on the hypothesis that measures of similarity and relatedness will be complementary, and may result in more robust measures that more closely correlate with human judgments. Our goal is to identify pairs of measures that provide complementary information that will improve our ability to quantify the degree of similarity and relatedness between two terms. Bill et al. [8] showed that a linear combination of the similarity measures proposed by Resnik [9] and Lin [10] increased the accuracy of identifying similar terms. The results, here in this paper, show that combining relatedness and similarity measures improved correlation scores overall. However, these results varied depending on the reference standard used and so no single pair of measures was found to always improve correlation.

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), which is our main source of data on concepts and their relations. Section 3 reviews the measures of semantic similarity and relatedness used in this study. Section 4 describes resources used beyond the UMLS for formulating some of the measures. The reference standards used in our evaluation are introduced in Section 5, and the details of our experiments on these standards are summarized in Section 6. Our results are presented in Section 7, and the article closes with our conclusions in Section 8.

The UMLS is a data warehouse containing three knowledge sources: the Metathesaurus, the Semantic Network and the SPECIALIST Lexicon. The Metathesaurus contains approximately 2 million biomedical and clinical concepts from over 100 different terminologies that have been semi-automatically integrated into a single source. One such source is the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), which is a comprehensive clinical terminology created for the electronic representation of clinical health information. The concepts in SNOMED CT are organized in a hierarchical structure in order to permit searching at various levels of specificity. The concepts are connected by two main types of hierarchical relations: parent/child (PAR/CHD) and broader/narrower (RB/RN). The PAR/CHD relations are strictly is-a relations while the RB/RN relations contain part-of relations.

The Semantic Network consists of a set of broad subject categories called semantic types in which each concept in the Metathesaurus is assigned one or more semantic type. For example, the semantic type of C0206250 [Autonomic nerve] is Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component. Currently, there exist 135 semantic types in the Semantic Network.

The SPECIALIST Lexicon contains terms that are used in the biomedical and health-related domain along with linguistic information such as spelling variants.

Included in the UMLS is also a categorization of semantic types referred to as semantic groups. A semantic group is a coarse grained grouping of the semantic types in the UMLS developed by [11] to provide a coarse-grained distinction between UMLS concepts based on their semantic validity, parsimony, completeness, exclusivity, naturalness, and utility. Examples of semantic groups include: Anatomy, Phenomena, Disorders and Chemicals & Drugs. There currently exists 15 semantic groups.

This section describes the similarity and relatedness measures used in this work.

We classify the similarity measures into two broad categories: path-based and information content (IC)-based. The path-based similarity measures provide information about the co-location of the terms in a taxonomy. The IC measures use the taxonomy information but also include additional information about the concept with respect to its relationship with the other concepts. There are two methods used to calculate IC: corpus-based which uses the probability of the concept occurring in an external corpus, and intrinsic-based which uses the informativeness of a concept based on its placement within the taxonomy. The remainder of this subsection describes the various measures and how they are calculated.

Rada et al. [1] introduce the Conceptual Distance measure, which is the length of the shortest path between two concepts (

                           ) in MeSH using RB/RN relations. Caviedes and Cimino [12] later evaluated this measure using the PAR/CHD relations. The path measure is a modification of this and is calculated as the reciprocal of the length of the shortest path as defined in Eq. (1).

Wu and Palmer [13] extend this measure by incorporating the depth of the Least Common Subsumer (LCS). The LCS is the most specific ancestor two concepts share. In this measure, the similarity is twice the depth of the two concepts’ LCS divided by the product of the depths of the individual concepts as defined in Eq. (2).

Leacock and Chodorow [14] extend the path measure by incorporating the depth of the taxonomy. Here, the similarity is the negative log of the shortest path (spath) between two concepts divided by twice the total depth of the taxonomy (D) as defined in Eq. (3).

Information content (IC) is formally defined as the negative log of the probability of a concept. Resnik [9] modified IC to be used as a similarity measure. He defined the similarity of two concepts to be the IC of their LCS as shown in Eq. (4).

Jiang and Conrath [15] and Lin [10] extended Resnik’s IC measure by incorporating the IC of the individual concepts. Lin defined the similarity between two concepts by taking the quotient between twice the IC of the concepts’ LCS and the sum of the IC of the two concepts as shown in Eq. (5). This is similar to the measure proposed by Wu & Palmer; differing in the use of IC rather than the depth of the concepts.

Jiang and Conrath defined the distance between two concepts to be the sum of the IC of the two concepts minus twice the IC of the concepts’ LCS. We modify this measure to return a similarity score by taking the reciprocal of the distance as shown in Eq. (6).

The information content of a concept can be calculated using information derived from a corpus (corpus-based) or information derived from a taxonomy (intrinsic-based). In this section, we describe both techniques.

As previously stated, IC is defined as the negative log of the probability of a concept. For corpus IC, we calculate the probability of a concept, c, by summing the probability of the concept,

The challenge with probability calculations for concepts is that a large number of annotations are required in order to provide sufficient coverage of the underlying taxonomy to achieve reasonable estimates. Intrinsic IC seeks to alleviate this problem while still capturing the generality and concreteness of a concept. It assess the informativeness of concept based on its placement within the hierarchy by looking at its incoming (ancestors) and outgoing (descendant) links.

In this work, we use the intrinsic IC calculation proposed by Sanchez et al. [16] defined in Eq. (9).

Lesk [17] introduces a measure that determines the relatedness between two concepts by counting the number of overlaps between their two definitions. An overlap is the longest sequence of one or more consecutive terms that occur in both definitions. When implementing this measure in WordNet, Banerjee and Pedersen [18] found that the definitions were short, and did not contain enough overlaps to distinguish between multiple concepts, therefore, they extended this measure by including the definitions of the related concepts.

Patwardhan and Pedersen [19] extend this measure using second-order co-occurrence vectors. In this method, a vector is created for each word in the concept’s definition containing terms that co-occur with it in a corpus. These word vectors are averaged to create a single co-occurrence vector for the concept. The similarity between the concepts is calculated by taking the cosine between the concepts’ second-order vectors. Liu et al. [5] modify and extend this measure to be used to quantify the relatedness between biomedical and clinical terms in the UMLS.

This section describes the data sources used in formulating the information content and vector measures. These sources are not a part of the UMLS and so are discussed here separately.

The IC similarity measure data is used to calculate the probability of a concept occurring in a corpus. We use the UMLSonMedline dataset created by NLM which consists of concepts from the 2009AB UMLS and the number of times they occurred in a snapshot of Medline taken on 12 January, 2009. The frequency counts were obtained by using the Essie Search Engine proposed by Ide et al. [20] which queried Medline with normalized strings from the 2009AB MRCONSO table in the UMLS. The frequency of a CUI was obtained by aggregating the frequency counts of the terms associated with the CUI to provide a rough estimate of its frequency. The IC measures use this information to calculate the probability of a concept.

The relatedness measure data is used by the vector measure to build the second-order co-occurrence matrix. We use the vector matrices, developed by Liu et al. [5], that are included in the UMLS::Similarity package. These matrices were created using the inpatient clinical reports that were collected from 2003 to 2008 at Fairview Health Services. These semi-structured reports consist of admission history, physical operation, discharge summaries, and consultation notes. These reports contain on average 500 words; after pre-processing (e.g. removal of stop words, numerals and punctuation), each note contained approximately 300 words. The total size of the resulting reports consisted of approximately 208.7 million words.

We use four reference standards
                        2
                        
                           http://www.people.vcu.edu/∼btmcinnes/downloads.html.
                     
                     
                        2
                      to evaluate the semantic similarity and relatedness measures: the UMNSRS tagged for similarity, the UMNSRS tagged for relatedness, the MayoSRS tagged for relatedness and the MiniMayoSRS tagged for relatedness. In this section, we describe the reference standards and then briefly discuss some of their differences.

MayoSRS, developed by Pakhomov et al. [21], consists of 101 clinical term pairs whose relatedness was determined by nine medical coders and three physicians from the Mayo Clinic. The relatedness of each term pair was assessed based on a four point scale: (4.0) practically synonymous, (3.0) related, (2.0) marginally related and (1.0) unrelated. We evaluate our method on the mean score of the physicians and medical coders as provided by Pakhomov et al. [21].

MiniMayoSRS is a subset of the MayoSRS and consists of 30 term pairs on which a higher inter-annotator agreement was achieved. The average correlation between physicians is 0.68. The average correlation between medical coders is 0.78. We evaluate our method on the mean of the physician scores and the mean of the coders’ scores in this subset in the same manner as reported by Pedersen et al. [22].

UMNSRS, developed by Pakhomov et al. [23], consists of 725 clinical term pairs whose semantic similarity and relatedness was determined independently by four medical residents from the University of Minnesota Medical School. The similarity and relatedness of each term pair was annotated based on a continuous scale by having the resident touch a bar on a touch sensitive computer screen to indicate the degree of similarity or relatedness. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the reference standard tagged for similarity was 0.47, and 0.50 for relatedness. Therefore, as suggested by Pakhomov and colleagues,we use a subset of the ratings consisting of 401 pairs for the similarity set and 430 pairs for the relatedness set which each have an ICC equal to 0.73.

As stated in Section 2, a semantic group is a coarse grained grouping of the semantic types. Each CUI in the UMLS can be categorized by their semantic group. Table 1
                         shows a breakdown of the semantic groups for the concepts in each of the reference standards.

We conducted our experiments using the freely available open source software package UMLS::Similarity [24] version 1.13.
                        3
                        
                           http://search.cpan.org/dist/UMLS-Similarity/.
                     
                     
                        3
                      This package takes as input two terms or concepts and returns the similarity between any two concepts using the path information in any of the sources available in the UMLS, including SNOMED CT, for each of the measures discussed in Section 3.

These experiments were conducted using the 2013AB version of the UMLS. We use the SNOMED CT taxonomy located in the UMLS Metathesaurus for the similarity measures and the entire UMLS (Level 1+SNOMED CT) for the relatedness measures. Correlation between the results of the similarity measures and human judgments were conducted using Spearman’s Rank Correlation (ρ). Spearman’s measures the statistical dependence between two variables to assess how well the relationship between the rankings of the variables can be described using a monotonic function. We used Fisher’s r-to-z transformation [25] to calculate the significance between the correlation results.

As previously stated, the goal of combining the measures is to capitalize on each of the measures strengths in hopes that their combination provides complementary information for quantifying the degree of similarity/relatedness between the two terms. The path-based similarity measures provide information about the co-location of the terms in a taxonomy; the intrinsic IC measures provide information about the concept in relation to the other concepts in the taxonomy; the corpus IC measures provide probability information regarding its occurrence in an external corpus; and relatedness measures provide contextual information about the term. We combined the similarity and relatedness measure by first standardizing the individual scores to place them on the same scale and then averaging the standardized scores. We standardize the scores by subtracting the score by the sample mean and then dividing it by the standard deviation as shown in Eq. (10) where

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Table 2
                      shows the Spearman’s Rank Correlation between the human scores from the four reference standards and the scores obtained by the path measure (path); the path-based measures proposed by Leacock & Chodorow [14] (lch) and Wu & Palmer [13] (wup); the IC measures proposed by Resnik [9] (res/i-res), Jiang & Conrath [15] (jcn/i-jcn) and Lin [10] (lin/i-lin) using the corpus and intrinsic IC respectively; the relatedness measures proposed by Lesk [17] (lesk) and Patwardhan & Pedersen [19] (vector); and the random baseline (random) which randomly assigns a term pair a similarity score between zero and one.

The results show that for the UMNSRS, the similarity measure 
                        
                           path
                           /
                           lch
                        
                      obtained the highest correlation on the standard tagged for similarity (
                        
                           p
                           ⩽
                           0.005
                        
                     ) and lesk obtained the highest correlation on the standard tagged for relatedness (
                        
                           p
                           ⩽
                           0.03
                        
                     ). For the MayoSRS, lesk obtained the highest correlation (
                        
                           p
                           ⩽
                           0.05
                        
                     ). For the MiniMayoSRS, the similarity measure lin obtained the highest correlation with the coders (
                        
                           p
                           ⩽
                           0.02
                        
                     ) but the relatedness measure lesk obtained the highest correlation with the physicians (
                        
                           p
                           ⩽
                           0.08
                        
                     ).

In this section, we analyze how the measures perform over the semantic grouping associated with the term pairs. Table 3
                         shows a breakdown of the correlation results based on the term pairs’ semantic groups in the UMNSRS reference standard tagged for relatedness and the overall correlation score for reference; Table 4
                         shows the same results on the reference standard tagged for similarity; and Table 5
                         shows the results for the MiniMayoSRS and MayoSRS references standards.

As previously discussed, the semantic groups of the terms in the reference standards can be classified as Disorder–Disorder (D–D), Disorder–Chemical&Drug (D–C), and Chemical&Drug–Chemical&Drug (C–C).

The UMNSRS tagged for relatedness results in Table 3 show that for the D–D pairs, the corpus IC measure jcn obtained the highest correlation (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.003
                           
                        ). The results indicate that the information captured within the taxonomy is a better indicator of two Disorder’s (D–D) relatedness than the contextual information used by the relatedness measures. This is not the case for the C–C pairs where the relatedness measure lesk obtained the highest correlation (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.03
                           
                        ); indicating that unlike Disorders terms the contextual information describing Chemical&Drug terms provides a better indicator of their relatedness than their location within the taxonomy. The D–C pairs results are not surprising given that there is little taxonomic information that connects a Disorder term and a Chemical&Drug term through an is-a hierarchy. The results show that the relatedness measures lesk and vector obtained the highest correlation (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.1
                           
                        ).

The results for the UMNSRS reference standard tagged for similarity shown in Table 4 are consistent with Table 3, although the correlation for the homogeneous D–D and C–C pairs is considerably higher. The results for the D–D pairs shows that the similarity measures path and lch have the highest correlation (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.05
                           
                        ). It is perhaps not surprising that a reference sample where humans have specifically rated for similarity should result in high correlation with similarity measures, although it is important to see such intuitions confirmed experimentally.

However, for the C–C pairs there is again a slightly counter-intuitive result (as was also seen in Table 3) where the lesk relatedness measure performs at a significantly (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.01
                           
                        ) higher level of correlation (0.7319). This is perhaps surprising since with the pairs rated for relatedness the lesk measure attained a somewhat lower correlation (0.4519 from Table 3). One possible intuition to explain these results is that similar concepts should have similar definitions, and that lesk is able to capture this particularly well. Why this would be significantly better than the information obtained from positions in the taxonomy remains an interesting question for future work.

The term pairs in the MiniMayoSRS and MayoSRS consist primarily of Disorders (D–D); the number of additional term pairs in each category are too small to evaluate as shown in Table 1. The results show that the relatedness measures obtained a higher correlation than similarity measures between the Disorder pairs (D–D) with lesk obtaining the highest (
                           
                              p

                        ). This is contrary to what we saw in Tables 3,4 for the UMNSRS reference standards where similarity measures attained the highest correlation for the D–D pairs.


                        Table 6
                         shows the results when combining each of the similarity and relatedness measures on the UMNSRS. The upper right portion of the table are the results using the reference standard tagged for relatedness, and the lower left are the results using the reference standard tagged for similarity.

The results show that for the UMNSRS tagged for relatedness the combination of the i-jcn and the lesk measures obtain the highest correlation with human judgments (0.4664). This is significantly higher (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.03
                           
                        ) than the highest individual results shown previously in Table 2 where lesk obtained the highest correlation (0.4379). One might expect that the combination of lesk and path would produce the higher correlation, since these two measures are very different from each other and seem likely candidates to be complementary. However, in this case the correlation of lesk on its own is actually much better (0.4379, see Table 2) than the combination of lesk and path (0.3858, see Table 6).

For the UMNSRS tagged for similarity, the combination of the lch and vector measures obtains the highest correlation (0.5923). This is significantly higher (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.05
                           
                        ) than the highest individual results where path/lch obtained the highest correlation (0.5335).


                        Table 7
                         shows the results when combining each of the similarity and relatedness measures on the MiniMayoSRS. The upper right portion of the table are the coders’ correlation results and the lower left are the physician’s correlation results. These results show the i-jcn and the lesk measures obtain the highest correlation for both datasets. As with the UMNSRS results, the combination of the relatedness and similarity measure obtained a higher correlation with the human judgments. For the set tagged by coders, the combined correlation results (0.7352) are higher than the highest individual results obtained by lin (0.5396) but given the sample size the results are not significant (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.19
                           
                        ). Similarly, for the set tagged by physicians, the combined correlation results (0.6753) are higher than the highest individual results obtained by lesk (0.4965) but the results are not significant (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.17
                           
                        ).


                        Table 8
                         shows the results when combining each of the similarity and relatedness measures on the MayoSRS. The results show that the i-jcn and vector measures obtain the highest correlation with human judgments (0.4206). This is significantly higher (
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.05
                           
                        ) than the highest individual results shown previously in Table 2 where lesk obtained the highest correlation (0.3676).

To summarize the increase in results when combining the measures, Table 9
                         shows the highest correlation using the individual measures and the highest correlation achieved when combining the measures for each of the reference standards. The results show that overall combining the measures obtains a higher correlation to human judgments.

To analyze the individual measures, we calculated the correlation of the rankings between them. Table 10
                         shows the correlation using the UMNSRS tagged for relatedness (upper) and similarity (lower). Table 11
                         shows similar results for the MiniMayoSRS (upper) and MayoSRS (lower).

The correlation results show that for the UMNSRS, the combination of relatedness measures and path-based measures obtain a higher correlation with human judgments than the individual measures. However, with the MiniMayoSRS and MayoSRS results, it is the combination of relatedness measures and IC similarity measures that attain the highest correlation.

For the UMNSRS data tagged for relatedness, the combination of the lesk relatedness measure and the i-jcn (IC similarity measure) obtain the highest correlation with human judgments (0.4664, from Table 6). Note as well that in Table 10 the relatively low correlation between the measures (0.6172) provides some evidence of their complementary nature. However, it’s important to point out that the measures with the least correlation between them (0.5205 from Table 10, for the path based wup measure and the lesk relatedness measure) end up having rather moderate correlation with human judgments (0.3394, from Table 6).

For the UMNSRS data tagged for similarity, the combination of the vector relatedness measure with either the path or lch path-based measures results in the highest correlation with human judgments (0.5923 from Table 6). Once again their between measure correlation is a relatively low value compared to many of the other pairs (0.5814 from Table 10).

For the MiniMayoSRS and MayoSRS, both of which were tagged for relatedness, the combination of the lesk relatedness measure and i-jcn (IC-similarity measure) obtained the highest correlation with human judgments (see Tables 7, 8) and also have the lowest between measure correlation for relatedness (0.4523 from Table 11).

These results suggest that finding pairs of measures that have low correlation between could identify measures that are complementary to each other, and that may attain higher correlations to human judgments than the individual measures. However, as our results show this is not always exactly the case, and so this between measure correlation (as shown in Tables 10, 11) should only be considered as one of several possible means of deciding how to combine measures. However, we do observe that the combination of relatedness measures with IC similarity measures may be better suited to quantify relatedness, whereas relatedness measures combined with path-based similarity measures may be better able to measure similarity. The methods by which effective combinations of measures may be discovered seems to be a particularly promising avenue for future research.

In this work, we also analyzed how well combinations of measures performed on the different semantic groupings. Table 12
                         shows the combination results of the similarity measures i-jcn and lch combined with lesk and vector, and the highest correlation obtained by the individual measures (indiv. meas.) from Tables 3,4 for each of the reference standards and the semantic grouping pairs that have at least twenty term pairs in their respective datasets.

The results show that overall using lesk in combination with i-jcn attains the highest correlation for most of the homogeneous pairs (D–D and C–C), although there are a few cases where using vector or lesk with lch perform the best. In general, this shows that the homogeneous pairs can be significantly improved via measures that combined relatedness and similarity measures. The heterogeneous pairs (D–C) do not tend to improve as much (if at all) with combined measures.

In summary, the individual results discussed previously in Tables 3 and 4 and the combination results discussed here in Table 12 show that different measures attain higher correlations with human judgments, and that this appears to be dependent on the particular semantic groups involved in the semantic grouping pair. Similarity measures do not fare well in heterogeneous comparisons (D–C). While relatedness are somewhat more successful, there is still room for improvement.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we analyzed the correlation of semantic similarity and relatedness measures to human judgments over various semantic groupings of the term pairs. The results show that no one measure performed best over all of the semantic grouping pairs analyzed in this article. The results also indicated that using similarity measures on term pairs across disparate semantic groupings does not result in high correlation because there is little taxonomy information connecting them; relatedness measures are a better choice for these term pairs. In the future, we would like to analyze additional semantic groupings in order to determine if this is the case across all semantic groups.

We also analyzed the results of combining various measures to determine if they are complementary. The results showed that combining relatedness and similarity measures improved the correlation scores; specifically we found that using lesk and the i-jcn measure obtained the highest overall correlation over the datasets; although vector with lch or i-jcn also performed well. In the future, we plan to explore and develop additional measures that incorporate aspects of semantic similarity and relatedness measures into a single measure.

In the future, we also plan to evaluate what constitutes a high correlation and at what level do the measures need to correlate with human judgments to be practically useful. In an intrinsic evaluation, such as this study, it is difficult to pick out a particular correlation level and say ‘this is good enough’. Therefore, we plan to conduct an extrinsic evaluation by analyzing the measures with respect to their correlation in a secondary application.
