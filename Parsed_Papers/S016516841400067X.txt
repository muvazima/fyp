                  The Doppler rate estimation on coherent sinusoidal pulse train, which can be applied in the passive emitter location systems, is investigated in this paper. When the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is constant, a DFT-based Doppler rate estimation algorithm is proposed and its performance is briefly analyzed. In the case of non-constant PRI, a least-squares-fitting based Doppler rate estimator (LSFE) is proposed. The mean square error is computed in closed form and the threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed. The Cramer–Rao lower bound on Doppler rate estimation is derived whereafter, and is compared to the mean square error of the LSFE. Monte Carlo simulations show that when operating above the threshold SNR, the proposed approach achieves the CRLB. The threshold SNRs in the simulations are basically coincident with the theoretical values.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of locating an emitter from passive measurements is encountered in a variety of radar and sonar applications. The location can be performed either by a single sensor [1,2] or in an array of spatially distributed sensors [3–8]. The single sensor solution has the following advantages: (1) there is no need to synchronize and transfer data between sensors; (2) its system configuration is simple; (3) it is easy to implement in real applications. However, due to relatively few measured information, it is more difficult to design corresponding algorithms for positioning, tracking and parameter estimation. Array with multi-sensor methods can be divided into two types: uniform linear array (ULA) and non-uniform linear array (NULA). For ULA, the restrictive condition that the element distance 
                        d
                      should be smaller than one half of the wavelength of the signal 
                        λ
                      limits the size of the array. Consequently, antenna gain is limited and mutual couplings between the antenna elements significantly affect the performance. For NULA, when 
                        d
                      is larger than 
                        λ
                        /
                        2
                     , the measured results may be ambiguous and extra ambiguity resolution operation should be performed. Multi-sensor solutions and single sensor solutions have their own merits and drawbacks. The applications where the size of the passive location system is limited can be of major interest in single sensor solution.

There are several methods of position estimating. The standard method is based on bearing measurements at different points along the sensor trajectory, which is called the bearing method (BM) [9–13]. Another method is based on Doppler shift of the emitter frequency due to relative motion between the emitter and the observer. This method is called the frequency method (FM) [10,14]. If the motion locus is known, the position of a stationary emitter can be estimated from several frequency estimation values taken at different points in the sensor trajectory. The third method, which combines the BM and FM, is called the combined method (CM) [1,2] in the sequel. A research group of National University of Defense Technology of China investigates the single observer passive location algorithms and technologies in recent 20 years. Based on the conventional bearing method, they add new observed quantities, such as angle-of-arrival (AOA) rate and Doppler rate, and propose a novel method [15,16], which outperforms conventional methods in location and tracking accuracy and speed of convergence. With the continuous measured bearing and frequency parameters, the geolocalization is computed using conventional two-step methods (also known as decentralized methods) or one-step methods (also known as centralized methods). In this paper, we mainly focus on Doppler rate estimation used for geolocalization, detailed post-processing after parameter estimation can be found in [1,15] and other cross-citations of these two papers.

FM and CM methods all need to measure frequency. The accuracy of frequency estimation must be sufficiently high because the Doppler frequency and Doppler rate are usually small. Since the transmitted radar waves are generally pulsed waveform and the scales of pulse duration are commonly microsecond (μs), the estimated accuracy from single pulse can hardly fulfill the requirements of the passive emitter location systems. As we know, accumulation of multiple pulses can improve the performance of frequency estimation. Multi-pulse frequency estimation algorithms can be divided into two types: non-coherent [17] and coherent [18–21]. The non-coherent algorithm consists of averaging the frequency estimates of individual pulses. Its accuracy is inversely proportional to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     , where

                      denotes the observation time, or the number of pulses in this case. The non-coherent algorithm requires a long observation time before the emitter can be accurately located. When the number of pulses received by receiver is not so much or the emitter only transmits several pulses in one frequency point, the accuracy will be insufficient. This causes problems in practical application.

In order to estimate range, radial velocity, and acceleration of a target accurately, coherent technologies are widely used in modern radar systems. Coherent pulses are portions of a continuous wave and so the phases from pulse to pulse are in phase with the original wave. Parameters estimation on returned coherent pulse train has been investigated in previous works. For example, joint estimation of delay, Doppler, and Doppler rate [18], measurement of range, radial velocity, and acceleration [19,20], frequency estimation from short pulses of sinusoid signals [21], etc.

Since the carrier frequency and initial phase are prior parameters in radar, coherent accumulation can easily be implemented. In passive emitter location, however, these two parameters are unknown commonly. In order to use the coherent information in passive location, some extra processes should be taken. The Doppler rate-of-change (also called Doppler rate) of the signal received from remote emitter can be used for emitter location [15,16]. To this end very accurate frequency estimates are necessary.

Frequency estimation from short coherent pulses of a sinusoidal signal was investigated in [22]. The Cramer–Rao lower bound on differential Doppler frequency estimate was derived in [23], where the threshold SNR was also analyzed. Doppler shifted estimation can then be obtained from the difference of the adjacent Doppler estimations, which belongs to a kind of indirection method. In fact, the Doppler shifted frequency can be extracted directly. Since there is no prior knowledge, the frequency of each pulse should be estimated first, and a coherent accumulation can be performed subsequently. The accumulation results of successive pulse contain the information of Doppler rate, which can be extracted by parameters estimation methods, e.g., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [24], discrete polynomial-phase transform (DPT) [25,26], least mean square (LMS) [27], and others [28,29]. When the PRI is constant, MLE, DPT, and Kay estimator [28] can be used. However when the PRI is varying (e.g., stagger, jitter, sliding, etc), least-squares-fitting (LSF) will be a good choice.

In this paper, we investigate the Doppler rate estimation algorithm on coherent sinusoidal pulse train. First, we need to detect the pulses and measure the leading edge and trailing edge of each pulse. The methods proposed in [30,31] can estimate the leading and trailing edges under low SNR condition and can be used in our algorithm. When the PRI is constant, a Doppler rate estimation algorithm based on DPT is proposed, and the performance is briefly analyzed. In the case of non-constant PRI, a LSF based Doppler rate estimator is investigated. Then we derive the Cramer–Rao lower bound on Doppler rate estimation. Thereafter the mean square error of LSFE is computed in closed form and compared to the CRLB. The threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also analyzed. In Section 4, we extend our algorithm to other forms of coherent pulse train. The coherent LFM (linear frequency modulated) pulse train is taken as an example. Finally Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the LSF estimator against the CRLB for various signal-to-noise ratios. A typical non-rectangular pulse shape, i.e., Gaussian pulse, is used in simulations to demonstrate the performances for non-rectangular cases.

Consider a stationary emitter with coordinates (0, 0) and a sensor is moving relative to the emitter (
                     Fig. 1). In this case, the delay that signals propagate from the emitter to the sensor is a function of time

                      is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In passive emitter location scenarios, there is no a priori knowledge of the received signals, therefore, the receiver should detect the intercepted pulses and measure the leading edge and trailing edge of each pulse. In our derivations we assume that all pulses are detected and the leading and trailing edges are estimated without error. The performance will degrade when these two assumptions are not meet, which can be observed from the simulation results in Section 7.

The signal of the pth pulse can be written as

                        α
                      respectively. Doppler rate can be obtained by estimating the chirp slope. Many parameter estimation methods for chirp signals have been proposed in previous works, e.g., Newton iteration algorithm [24], DPT [25,26], etc. Since the computation load of DPT is low and its variance is only about 7% higher than the CRLB at high SNRs [25], Doppler rate in (11) can be calculated by DPT. In [25], it is showed that the optimal delay for estimating frequency slope with DPT is

When the PRI is not a constant, DPT or Newton iteration cannot be used to estimate Doppler rate directly. As can be observed from Eq. (10), the phase of noise-free

                     . However, stagger ratio used in radar may be large, say, 31/32/33 [42, 43], in this case the range of resolving phase ambiguity is very small. For other cases of PRI diversity (e.g., jitter, sliding), the Chinese Remainder Theorem will be inapplicable. We give a more general method for the estimation of

                        l

If the maximum likelihood-based frequency estimators are used, the frequency estimation variance of each pulse will be [40]

Notice that (76) is equal to (72), namely, when the SNR is higher than the threshold SNR, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is the same as CRLB.

Generally, the variance of an estimator increases sharply when the SNR is below some threshold SNR. Next, we analyze threshold SNR of the LSFE. First, the frequency of each pulse is estimated by DFT-based (discrete Fourier transform) algorithms. Experience shows that, in DFT-based estimation, the most important factor affecting the goodness of the estimate is the output signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The OSNR is defined as the ratio of the signal energy at the point

                      times gain after coherent accumulation, the SNR needed for Tretter approximation is lower than the threshold OSNR for DFT-based algorithms, which implies that once the frequency of each pulse can be extracted accurately, the LSFE will work well.

In this paper, we mainly focus on Doppler rate estimation on coherent sinusoidal pulse train, which has no phase/frequency modulation. In fact, the proposed method can be extended to radar signals with phase and/or frequency modulation. In this section, we extend our algorithm to coherent LFM pulse train, which is a typical frequency modulated coherent pulse train widely used in modern radar systems.

Next, we directly give the Doppler rate estimation algorithm for coherent LFM pulse train without further derivation:

Simulations are conducted to characterize the performance of Doppler rate estimator. One thousand Monte Carlo trials per SNR are used to compute a root-mean-square error of the Doppler rate estimates. The parameters of the transmission pulse train are assumed to be radio frequency (RF)

                     = 51:62:53:61:58, respectively. The stagger ratios are taken from [42] where they have been discussed in detail. The total pulse number for each train is 60, which means the period number of each pulse train is 20, 15, 12, i.e., the observation time are (31+32+33)/31⁎20ms≈61.94ms, (25+30+27+31)/25⁎15ms≈67.8ms, and (51+62+53+61+58)/51⁎12ms≈67.06ms, respectively. It is assumed that the TOA and PW of each pulse are known and the pulse shape is rectangular. The RMSEs and CRLBs are shown in 
                     
                     
                     Figs. 2–4.

In the case of medium PRF, two different pulse trains are simulated. The PRIs are {96, 94, 92, 72, 70, 68, 57, 55, 53}μs and {50, 52, 54, 57, 60, 63, 67, 71}μs, respectively. The stagger ratios here are taken from [43] where the performance of radars using such stagger ratios has been investigated in detail. The total pulse numbers used in simulation are 450 and 480, which means the period numbers are 50 and 60, i.e., theobservationtimeis (96+94+92+72+70+68+57+55+53)⁎50μs=32.85msand (50+52+54+57+60+63+67+71)⁎60μs=28.44ms, respectively. It is assumed that the TOA and PW of each pulse are known and the pulse shape is rectangular. The RMSEs and CRLBs are shown in 
                     
                     Figs. 5 and 6.

The performance curves with the triangle sign in Figs. 2–6 are the results of constant amplitude cases. While the circle sign is corresponding to random amplitude cases and the varying slope is 1dB.

The sample number of each pulse is 100 with the pulse width of 1μs and sampling rate 100MHz. From (81) we can get the threshold SNR

                        dB
                     . As can be seen from simulation results, in the cases of constant amplitude, the threshold SNR is 
                        −
                        6
                        
                        dB
                      when the PRI is {96, 94, 92, 72, 70, 68, 57, 55, 53}μs, which is consistent with the theoretical value. The threshold SNRs for the other experiments are 
                        −
                        5
                        
                        dB
                     , close to 
                        −

                        dB
                     . When the SNRs are higher than the threshold SNR, the accuracy are all close to CRLB. When the amplitude is fluctuating randomly, the threshold SNRs and accuracy in Fig. 2–4 are almost the same as the constant amplitude cases. For the latter two cases, however, the threshold SNRs increases for about 2dB and 1dB respectively.

Although the number of pulses and samples used in the case of medium PRF is much more than that of low PRF, the accuracy of the medium PRF is slightly lower, compared to the low PRF cases. This is because the accuracy of parameter estimation for coherent pulse train is primarily determined by the total observation time, not the number of pulses and samples, which can be observed from the variance of the estimate (i.e., (75) and (76)) and the CRLB (i.e., (62) and (72)).

Simulations are performed for cases where the TOA is unknown or the pulse shape is non-rectangular. In 
                     Fig. 7, we compare the simulated results with the cases of known TOA and rectangular pulse shape. The Gaussian pulse is chosen as the non-rectangular pulse. As observed from the results, the threshold SNRs in TOA unknown cases are higher than that in TOA known case. The threshold SNR for Gaussian pulse is higher than that for rectangular pulse. When the SNR is higher than the threshold SNR, the accuracy for rectangular pulse with unknown TOA is closed to that of the case with known TOA. In the case of Gaussian pulse, the accuracy is about 2–3dB poorer than that of rectangular pulse.

The performance of Doppler rate estimation for coherent LFM pulse train is shown in 
                     Fig. 8. The bandwidth of the LFM pulses is 1MHz and other parameters are kept the same as the sinusoidal case. The impact of TOA and pulse shape on the performance for LFM is similar to the sinusoid case. The threshold SNRs for LFM are higher than those for sinusoid since one more parameter, i.e., the sweep rate of LFM, needs to be estimated. Notice that in Fig. 8, the CRLB for coherent sinusoidal pulse train is used. When there is no a priori knowledge of TOA and pulse shape, the CRLB for coherent LFM pulse train maybe closed to, but different from that for sinusoidal case. From the derivation of CRLB and performance analysis, we can see that when there is no phase/frequency modulation, the CRLB for Doppler rate is independent from the form of 
                        g
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     . But for LFM and other waveforms, this conclusion is no longer valid.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We investigate the Doppler rate estimation algorithms, which can be applied in the passive emitter location systems. The DFT-based Doppler rate estimator is briefly discussed with respect to constant PRI. To non-constant PRI, however, the least-squares-fitting is used to extract the Doppler rate from the unwrapping phase of the pulse train after coherent accumulation. The mean square error of the least-squares-fitting based Doppler rate estimator is derived in closed form. Subsequently, the threshold SNR is analyzed. The CRLB for this problem is also computed in an analytic form. Further analysis shows that the variance of the least-squares-fitting based Doppler rate estimator is equal to the CRLB, which verifies that when the noise is Gaussian, the least-squares estimates are equivalent to maximum-likelihood estimates. Simulation shows when operating above the threshold SNR, the proposed approach achieves the CRLB. The threshold SNRs in the simulations are basically identical with the theoretical values.

The first-order perturbation analysis is used to derivate the mean-square error of Doppler rate estimate with respect to constant PRI. The derivation is in a similar way with the derivation of mean-square error of frequency slope of LFM [25].
