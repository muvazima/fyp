                  Geometric branch-and-bound techniques are well-known solution algorithms for non-convex continuous global optimization problems with box constraints. Several approaches can be found in the literature differing mainly in the bounds used.
                  The aim of this paper is to extend geometric branch-and-bound methods to mixed integer optimization problems, i.e. to objective functions with some continuous and some integer variables. Mixed-integer non-linear and non-convex optimization problems are extremely hard, containing several classes of NP-hard problems as special cases. We identify for which type of mixed integer non-linear problems our method can be applied efficiently, derive several bounding operations and analyze their rates of convergence theoretically. Moreover, we show that the accuracy of any algorithm for solving the problem with fixed integer variables can be transferred to the mixed integer case.
                  Our results are demonstrated theoretically and experimentally using the truncated Weber problem and the p-median problem. For both problems we succeed in finding exact optimal solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Geometric branch-and-bound methods are popular solution algorithms for continuous and non-convex optimization problems with a small number of variables, see e.g. Horst, Pardalos, and Thoai (2000) or Tuy (1998). These techniques find applications for example in facility location problems, see Plastria (1992), Drezner and Suzuki (2004), Blanquero and Carrizosa (2009), and Schöbel and Scholz (2010a) for general geometric branch-and-bound solution approaches in location theory and, e.g. Drezner and Drezner (2007), Fernández, Pelegrín, Plastria, and Tóth (2007), Blanquero, Carrizosa, and Hansen (2009), and Blanquero, Carrizosa, Schöbel, and Scholz (2011) among plenty of other references for some specific location problems solved by these techniques.

The most important task throughout any branch-and-bound algorithm is the calculation of lower bounds on the objective function for some smaller rectangles or boxes. Different techniques to do so are collected in Schöbel and Scholz (2010b), Scholz (2012b), and Scholz (2012a). Therein, the 
                        rate of convergence
                      is introduced that allows to evaluate the quality of some well-known bounding operations.

All the above mentioned techniques deal with pure continuous objective functions. The contribution of this paper is to extend the method to mixed-integer non-linear (MINLP) optimization problems, see Hemmecke, Köppe, Lee, and Weismantel (2010, chap. 15) for a recent survey about methods in this field. Problems of this type are extremely hard to solve, containing several classes of NP-hard problems as special cases, among them, e.g.:
                        
                           •
                           the class of integer linear problems which is well known to be NP-hard, see Garey and Johnson (1979),

the class of continuous quadratic programs with box constraints which is NP-hard if the problem is non-convex, see Pardalos and Vavasis (1991), or

the problem of minimizing a polynomial function of degree 4 over 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          Z
                                       
                                       
                                          n
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              , which is NP-hard due to Lasserre (2001).

In contrast to the classical discrete branch-and-bound approach for mixed-integer (linear) optimization we propose a geometric branch-and-bound approach for solving mixed-integer non-linear problems. The idea is the following: In every step we branch along the continuous variables (as done in geometric methods such as, e.g., the big square small square method, see Plastria (1992)) and solve the discrete problem in any node to get a lower bound. Note that this is contrary to the usual discrete branch and bound approaches in which branching is done along the discrete variables and the continuous relaxation is solved in each node in order to obtain a bound.

Although the algorithm we propose can theoretically be applied to any (MINLP), it only works efficiently if the (MINLP) admits some special properties. These are a small number of continuous variables admitting some box-constraints, and that fixing the continuous variables results in a discrete problem which can be efficiently solved, or at least bounded. Such problems appear in many fields (e.g. location theory or robust statistics), many of them being NP-hard, see Section 5 for more examples and references.

In order to apply geometric branch-and-bound techniques to mixed integer non-linear problems we derive some general bounding operations and we present theoretical results about the rate of convergence similar to Schöbel and Scholz (2010b). Moreover, we discuss an extension of the method which leads to exact optimal solutions under certain conditions given below. We implemented the approach and applied it to some facility location problems. The numerical results show that we succeeded in finding exact optimal solutions and that our method outperforms standard solution approaches.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we will summarize notations and basic concepts which we use throughout the paper. Section 3 presents the geometric branch-and-bound prototype algorithm for mixed integer optimization problems before we prove the convergence of our algorithm in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss some general bounding operations and results concerning their rates of convergence. Next, in Section 6 we suggest an extension of the algorithm which leads to exact optimal solutions under certain conditions. In the following two sections (Sections 7 and 8) we apply the proposed techniques to some facility location problems and report on some numerical results. Finally, a brief conclusion and aspects of further research can be found in Section 9.

The algorithm suggested in this section is a generalization of the 
                        big cube small cube
                      method presented in Schöbel and Scholz (2010a). Here, we extend the problem to mixed integer minimization problems, i.e. to problems which contain continuous and integer variables.

We remark that it is a non-trivial task to calculate the lower bound LB(Y) as required throughout the algorithm. We will address this question in Section 5.

In order to evaluate the quality of bounding operations, we first extend the definition for the rate of convergence given in Schöbel and Scholz (2010b).

As shown in Schöbel and Scholz (2010b) for pure continuous objective functions, the larger the rate of convergence the smaller the number of iterations needed throughout the algorithm.

The next theorem shows that the proposed algorithm terminates after a finite number of iterations if the bounding operation has a rate of convergence of at least one.

This yields a bounding operation for the continuous function 
                              
                                 g

                            with a rate of convergence of p
                           ⩾1. From Schöbel and Scholz (2010b) we hence know that the algorithm terminates after a finite number of iterations with an absolute accuracy of ε from the global minimum.□

Note that it is also possible to compute how many iterations are necessary in the worst case, see Theorem 2 of Schöbel and Scholz (2010b).

Our general scheme is applicable to all mixed-integer programming problems. However, the geometric branch-and-bound algorithm we propose runs efficiently only if we are able to compute good lower bounds in every step, i.e., if a good bounding operation is at hand. To this end, we need a class of (MINLP) problems for which such bounding operations can be developed. Problems we have in mind contain a combinatorial part which can be easily solved once the continuous variables are fixed. This restriction seems to be strong, but it turns out that many well-known problems admit these property, most of them being NP-hard. Since continuous branch-and-bound approaches only run efficiently if the number of variables is not too high we are furthermore interested in problems having only a few number of continuous variables. Some example applications satisfying the required properties are given below.
                        
                           •
                           The p-median problem (see Section 7.1) is a classical example for a mixed-integer location problem in which not only the location of the facilities but also the assignment between the facilities and its customers has to be determined. If the location of the facilities is fixed, the assignment of the customers can be done by just choosing the closest facility for every customer. The problem in NP-hard. Its discrete counterpart is the uncapacitated facility location problem, see Nemhauser and Wolsey (1999).

A similar situation occurs for (planar) hub-location problems, see Hamacher and Meyer (2009), in many different variations and with different objective functions.

Another problem which fits very well into our framework are ordered median problems, see Nickel and Puerto (2005). Here one looks for a set of facilities (described by continuous variables) where the weights in the objective function depend on the ordered distances of these facilities to some existing points. Again, if the facilities are fixed, the remaining discrete problem can be solved just by computing the distances. A special case is the truncated Weber problem, see Section 7.2.

A recent application concerns problems in image registration, see Pfeuffer, Stiglmayr, and Klamroth (2012), where two images should be compared. The discrete problem in this case is a bipartite matching problem which can be solved efficiently if the continuous variables (describing the transformation between the images) are fixed.

Also in robust statistics similar problems appear. An example are trimmed regression problems where outliers should be neglected and the quality of the estimation is only measured to a fixed percentage of the (best fitted) data points. If the regression line (described by only two continuous variables) is fixed, the outliers can be determined easily.

Integrated location problems, e.g. the simultaneous scheduling and location problem (ScheLoc), see Elvikis, Hamacher, and Kalsch (2009) and Kalsch and Drezner (2010), are again mixed-integer problems which reduce to a known discrete problem once the continuous variables are given.

Finally, also in number theory, one may end up with a problem with only few (three or four) continuous and thousands of binary variables where a solution can very easily determined if the continuous variables are fixed, see Blomer and Schöbel (2012).

Our main goal in this section is to extend some known bounding operations known from continuous optimization to mixed integer optimization problems and to analyze their rates of convergence in this case.

For the concave bounding operation, we assume that we are in a position to solve the combinatorial problem

In contrast to the concave bounding operation, we assume for the d.c. bounding operation that for any subbox Y
                        ⊂
                        X and for all x
                        ∈ 
                        V(Y) we are able to solve the combinatorial problem

Note that this combinatorial problem is identical to the minimization of f(x,
                        π) for any fixed x since the d.c. decomposition was done with respect to the continuous variables x. Hence, the example applications mentioned at the beginning of Section 5 satisfy the required property.

So far the prototype algorithm solves a series of continuous problems until the boxes get small enough and relies on the solvability of the combinatorial problem for fixed continuous variables x. However, if the continuous problem can be solved efficiently with a high accuracy for fixed values of the integer variables π we may improve the prototype algorithm by adding a further discarding test, see Step 
                        (
                     8) in the prototype algorithm in Section 3. This discarding test even ensures that the mixed integer problem can be solved exactly under special conditions.

We assume that for any fixed π
                     ∈
                     Π we are in a position to solve the pure continuous problem

                     ∈

Note that the choice of the parameter 
                        
                           M
                           ∈
                           N
                        
                      strongly depends on the given objective function. If M is too small, the condition ∣Ω(Y
                     
                        i
                     )∣⩽
                     M might be satisfied only rarely. On the other hand, if M is too large, it could be too expensive to solve all ∣Ω(Y
                     
                        i
                     )∣ minimization problems. Therefore, we suggest to start the algorithm with a small value for M and increase M throughout the algorithm if the method does not terminate.

                           8) also has an absolute accuracy of ε′.

Thus, the discarding test 
                              (
                           8) ensures the termination of the algorithm with an absolute accuracy of at least ε′ after a finite number of iterations.□

Note that Lemma 6 holds independent from the bounding operation chosen.

Finally, an interesting implication of Lemma 6 should be mentioned. Many practical mixed integer optimization problems admit the property that both, the combinatorial and the continuous part can be solved exactly if the respective other variables are known. This is the case for the truncated Weber problem of the next section, for many ordered median problems, and also for many applications in robust statistics. In such a case we can use our results to find an exact global minimum by setting ε
                     =0 and ε′=0, i.e. we only delete subboxes

The p-median problem is one of the most studied facility location problems and still a challenging problem since it is NP-hard due to Megiddo and Supowit (1984). Drezner (1984) presented an exact algorithm for p
                        =2 using the Euclidean norm, some more general global optimization approaches can be found in Chen, Hansen, Jaumard, and Tuy (1998) and Schöbel and Scholz (2010a). Also the variable neighborhood search heuristic was applied in Brimberg, Mladenović, and Salhi (2004) and Brimberg, Hansen, and Mladenović (2006). Recently, a branch-and-price algorithm for large instances of the problem has been developed in Righini and Zaniboni (2007), and a big triangle small triangle approach is under investigation in Suzuki (2012). A survey is provided in Brimberg, Hansen, Mladenović, and Salhi (2008).

We use the problem to demonstrate the application of the geometric branch-and-bound method for mixed integer programs. We can again make use of the d.c. bounding operation since the objective function is convex for all fixed π

                        where d is a given distance function. Note that this problem is a special case of the general ordered median problem, see Nickel and Puerto (2005), and moreover a special case of the general location-allocation problem introduced by Plastria and Elosmani (2008). Solution algorithms can be found in Drezner and Nickelm (2009b) and Drezner and Nickel (2009a). Note that these methods do not provide an exact optimal solution.

                     . Moreover, we used ε
                     =0 and M
                     =4 throughout the algorithm and note that we found an exact optimal solution in all problem instances.

The p-median problem was solved for p
                        =2 and p
                        =3 new facilities. Here, every selected box Y throughout the algorithm was split into s
                        =2 subboxes, i.e. Y was bisected in two subboxes perpendicular to the direction of the maximum width component. Our results are collected in Table 1
                        .

As can be seen, for the p-median problem the number of solved pure location problems increases with the number m of demand points. However, even with m
                        =5000 the 2-median problem could be solved by considering only a few hundred single facility problems.

In our second example problem, we set K
                        =
                        round(m/5) and all boxes were split into s
                        =4 congruent subboxes. Our results are illustrated in Table 2
                        . Therein, the run times, the number of iterations throughout our geometric branch-and-bound algorithm, and the number of solved single facility location problems in Step 
                           (
                        8) are reported.

Observe that the average number of solved facility location problems is for all values of m almost constant.

Our further goal is to compare the presented geometric branch-and-bound algorithm to two standard approaches. These are

                              using a straightforward formulation as non-linear program and a non-linear integer solver and

using a formulation as mixed integer linear program and a linear integer programming solver.

We exemplarily do this for the truncated Weber problem. The formulation as nonlinear mixed-integer program uses the continuous variables x

Ten problem instances for various values of 10⩽
                        m
                        ⩽100 were solved three times each: employing our geometric branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B), solving the non-linear program (NL), and solving the mixed integer program (MIP). Both the non-linear and the mixed-integer linear program were solved using the FICO Xpress optimization suite. In particular, Xpress-optimizer was used for solving the MIP and Xpress-SLP (a solver for non-linear problems via sequential linear programming) for solving (NL).

Our results are described next. First, we look at the solution values. The MIP solver found (the same) optimal solution as our geometric branch-and-bound approach whenever it was able to solve the problem within our time limit of one hour (which was possible up to 70 demand points). The non-linear solver found an optimal solution in 16% of all runs and got stuck in local optima otherwise. Table 3
                         presents the average absolute gap between the global minimum x
                        ∗ found by (B&B) (as well as by (MIP) for m
                        ⩽60) and the solution x
                        (NL) found by (NL). As can be seen, the solution x
                        (NL) found by (NL) might be far away from an optimal solution, see Fig. 4
                        .

The average run times in milliseconds can be found in Table 4
                        . Obviously, the run times using the mixed integer program (MIP) increase exponentially and they are very high compared to the geometric branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B) and the non-linear program (NL). Furthermore, also the run times of (NL) are considerably larger than the run times of the geometric branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B), see Fig. 5
                        , although in general no global minimum was found by (NL).

Hence, we summarize that the suggested geometric branch-and-bound algorithm outperforms commonly used optimization tools such as Xpress.

In this paper, we suggested an extension of well-known geometric branch-and-bound methods for mixed integer optimization problems. The main contribution of our work were some general bounding operations and we proved their theoretical rate of convergence. Hence, we provided a general algorithm to solve mixed integer optimization problems. The method was demonstrated on some location problems and we succeeded in finding exact optimal solutions. Note that the example problems can also be solved in the same manner using the Euclidean norm and the Weiszfeld algorithm for the solution of the pure location problems, see Weiszfeld (1937).

However, as in the classical pure continuous algorithms, the method is only suitable if the number n of continuous variables is relatively small. Moreover, for all bounding operations we assumed that for any fixed x the pure combinatorial problem can be solved easily. As a part of further work, the presented techniques and theoretical results should be tested at other applications, e.g., for image registration problems.

On the theoretical side, new ways of combining the geometric branch-and-bound approach with discrete branch-and-bound methods seem to be interesting. To this end, discrete branch-and-bound approaches for (MINLP), see Buchheim and Rinaldi (2007) and Bonami et al. (2008), may be used, and the development and usage of other bounds as developed in Hübner and Schöbel (2011) is under research.

If the discrete problem is hard to solve one may apply some discrete branch-and-bound algorithm for the pure combinatorial part. In particular, if Ω(Y)⩽
                     M for some boxes Y, we can find the optimal solution for all x
                     ∈
                     Y and all π
                     ∈
                     Ω(Y) branching the integer variables π.

Finally, it is interesting to apply the method also for more complicated constraints on the continuous variables, e.g. by using barrier or penalty functions, or by explicitly incorporating the structure of the constraints in the procedure.
