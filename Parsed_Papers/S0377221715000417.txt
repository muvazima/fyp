                  We present a column generation algorithm for solving the bi-objective multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem. This method is based on the bi-objective simplex method and Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. The method is initialised by optimising the problem with respect to the first objective, a single objective multi-commodity flow problem, which is solved using Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. Then, similar to the bi-objective simplex method, our algorithm iteratively moves from one non-dominated extreme point to the next one by finding entering variables with the maximum ratio of improvement of the second objective over deterioration of the first objective. Our method reformulates the problem into a bi-objective master problem over a set of capacity constraints and several single objective linear fractional sub-problems each over a set of network flow conservation constraints. The master problem iteratively updates cost coefficients for the fractional sub-problems. Based on these cost coefficients an optimal solution of each sub-problem is obtained. The solution with the best ratio objective value out of all sub-problems represents the entering variable for the master basis. The algorithm terminates when there is no entering variable which can improve the second objective by deteriorating the first objective. This implies that all non-dominated extreme points of the original problem are obtained. We report on the performance of the algorithm on several directed bi-objective network instances with different characteristics and different numbers of commodities.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem (MCMCF) is a network optimisation problem where several commodities need to be sent from their source nodes to their sink nodes. Individual commodities share arcs and compete for the capacity of the arcs. The MCMCF problem can be modelled as a linear optimisation problem with two sets of constraints: The flow conservation constraints and the capacity constraints which tie the commodities together. These constraints have a special block diagonal shape. Taking advantage of this special structure, several decomposition approaches for solving the problem have been developed (see Assad, 1978 and references therein). In many application contexts of network models such as transportation, assignment, transshipment and location problems, there is more than one objective that has to be taken into account. These objectives include time, cost, risk, environmental concerns etc. Thus, multi-objective flow models are more appropriate for modelling real-world decision making situations than single objective models (Aneja and Nair, 1979; Current and Marsh, 1993; Current and Min, 1986; Lee, Green, and Kim, 1981; Lee and Schniederjans, 1983; Moore, Taylor, and Lee, 1978; Ulungu and Teghem, 1994). In this paper we consider the bi-objective multi-commodity minimum cost flow problem (BMCMCF). We propose a decomposition algorithm that is based on the bi-objective simplex algorithm and employs a new generalisation of Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition to bi-objective linear programmes.

The BMCMCF problem (1) is a bi-objective linear optimisation problem which can be solved by existing bi-objective linear programming algorithms (Moradi, Ehrgott, and Raith, 2012), such as the bi-objective simplex method, see e.g. Ehrgott (2005) and Section 3.1. The specially structured block diagonal constraint matrix of problem (1) permits the application of the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method. This has been done in the single objective case, see Section 3.2, In this paper, we generalise this approach to the bi-objective case. We demonstrate how Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition can be used to generate columns of the BMCMCF problem in the context of the bi-objective simplex method, thereby extending our preliminary results in Moradi, Raith, and Ehrgott (2013).

By integrating the bi-objective simplex method with the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method we present a new method for solving the BMCMCF problem which we shall refer to as the bi-objective simplex decomposition (BOSD) method.

This paper is organised as follows: Recent literature is briefly discussed in Section 2. Necessary mathematical background as well as the bi-objective simplex method and standard Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method are explained in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce our proposed BOSD method. Finally numerical results are illustrated in Section 5.

There does not exist a lot of research on multi-objective MCMCF problems, so we also review research conducted on multi-objective minimum cost flow problems with only a single commodity. The most recent survey on multi-objective minimum cost flow problems is by Hamacher, Pedersen, and Ruzika (2007). We will therefore briefly mention only newer published work on multi-objective network flow problems, one of which considers multiple commodities.


                     Sedeño-Noda, González-Martín, and Alonso-Rodríguez (2005) present a change of variables method to solve the bi-objective undirected two-commodity minimum cost flow problem. They formulate the problem as follows:

By using absolute values for the amount of flow in the last set of constraints of (2), the values of the flow can be negative for each edge. The method by Sedeño-Noda et al. splits the problem into two bi-objective minimum cost flow problems with a single commodity and uses the parametric network simplex method to solve these problems. This method cannot be extended to more than two commodities and also works only for undirected two-commodity problems.


                     Eusébio, Figueira, and Ehrgott (2008) develop a primal–dual bi-objective simplex algorithm for the bi-objective single commodity network flow problem that is based on the bi-objective primal–dual simplex algorithm of Ehrgott, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2007) but uses reduced cost information to avoid redundancy. They report that their method does not perform efficiently on large scale instances.


                     Raith and Ehrgott (2009) present an algorithm to compute a complete set of efficient solutions for the bi-objective (single commodity) integer minimum cost flow (BIMCF) problem based on the two-phase method, see Przybylski, Gandibleux, and Ehrgott (2011) for a recent survey on the two-phase method. In Phase 1 they use a parametric network simplex algorithm (Sedeño-Noda and González-Martín, 2000) to compute all integer solutions the images of which are extreme points of the boundary of

                      is the convex hull of its argument and 
                        Z
                      is the image in objective space of the feasible set. Since they solve an integer bi-objective optimisation problem, the images of some of the efficient solutions lie in the interior of 
                        
                           conv
                           (
                           Z
                           )
                        
                     . In Phase 2, these remaining efficient solutions are computed using a k best flow algorithm Hamacher (1995) on single objective weighted sum problem. Since multi-objective integer problems are harder than continuous ones, BIMCF instances solved in literature all have small size and all algorithms mentioned here perform well only for small and medium sized instances.


                     Eusébio and Figueira (2009b) present and implement an algorithm for finding all supported efficient solutions to the BIMCF. Their method is based on a negative-cycle algorithm used in single objective minimum cost flow problems (Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin, 1993) applied to a sequence of parametric problems. They prove that all supported efficient solutions are connected via a chain of zero-cost cycles in the incremental graph constructed from basic feasible solutions corresponding to extreme efficient solutions.


                     Eusébio and Figueira (2009a) solve a sequence of ɛ-constraint problems (Chankong and Haimes, 1983) in the context of finding all the non-dominated solutions of the BIMCF problem. The integer optimal solutions to the ε-constraint problems are obtained by a branch-and-bound method. Similar to Eusébio et al. (2008), this method performs well only on small or medium size instances.

With the exception of work on undirected bi-objective two-commodity MCMCF problem (Sedeño-Noda et al., 2005) there does not exist any research on the multi-objective MCMCF problems, in particular there is no published research on Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition for multi-objective network flow problems.

In this section, the necessary mathematical background is introduced. We also summarise the bi-objective simplex method and the application of standard Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition to the single objective MCMCF problem.

Modelling the BMCMCF problem (1) as a linear programme permits the use of the standard bi-objective simplex method. Ehrgott (2005) gives a comprehensive explanation of this method and we use the same notation here. The bi-objective simplex method initially starts by optimising the problem with respect to the first objective. The method then iteratively moves from one non-dominated extreme point to the next one by finding entering variables with the maximum ratio of improvement of the second objective over the deterioration of the first objective, see also selection of t in Step 5 of Algorithm 1
                        . The method stops when all the non-dominated extreme points are obtained. The initial solution may be weakly efficient and the algorithm may find some efficient solutions that do not define non-dominated extreme points. These solutions can be easily discarded at the end of the algorithm. Note that the resulting set might still contain solutions which map to the same point in objective space. All non-dominated points can then be obtained as convex combinations of the obtained extreme non-dominated points. The procedure is stated as Algorithm 1.


                        Tomlin (1966) has devised an algorithm for solving the MCMCF problem based on the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method. In the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method the original problem, a single objective version of (1), is reformulated into a master problem (MP) over a set of capacity (complicating) constraints, and q sub-problems, each over a set of flow conservation constraints, Ex

                         for k ≔ 1, 2, … , q. The MCMCF can be written as follows:

Based on these cost coefficients an optimal solution of each sub-problem is obtained. These solutions are the most improving columns (corresponding to non-basic variables) to enter the MP basis. This method continues until no sub-problem can find a column to improve the MP and it is guaranteed that the optimal solution of the MCMCF problem is obtained.

If we consider the case in which the network has a single source and sink for each commodity k ≔ 1, 2, …, q, which we may do without loss of generality, then the sub-problem (7) requires finding a minimum cost flow in a network with no capacity on arcs and with arc costs (c

                         − w). By adding all slack variables sa

                        . Therefore, (c

                         − w) is positive for all arcs a ∈ A. In this case sub-problem (7) is a shortest path problem which can be solved by many efficient shortest path algorithms (Gallo and Pallottino, 1988). If the optimal solution

                         is an entering variable for the basis of the MP. After finding the entering variable, it is added to the basis of the MP and the leaving variable is determined in the usual way in the simplex algorithm. By pivoting, the basis inverse, dual variables, and right-hand-side are updated. The method continues until the dual feasibility conditions are satisfied, which means there does not exist any candidate variable to enter the basis and an optimal solution of the MCMCF problem is obtained. This procedure is stated as Algorithm 2.

In this section we present the proposed BOSD method for solving the BMCMCF problem. The BOSD method reformulates the BMCMCF problem into a bi-objective master problem (BMP) over a set of capacity constraints and q sub-problems, each over a set of network flow conservation constraints, Ex

                     hard ≔ [I, …, I] is composed of q identity matrices of size m × m. The BOSD method works with the BMP, while sub-problems generate the columns to move from one non-dominated extreme point to the next one.

Applying the change of variables (5), the BMCMCF problem (1) can be written as BMP 
                     (9). Notice that each constraint now has two dual variables, one associated with each of the two objective functions. These are listed to the right hand side of the vertical line.

The BOSD method initially starts by obtaining a solution which is minimal with respect to the first objective component. In this step, problem (9) becomes a single objective MCMCF problem, and the standard Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method, as explained in Section 3.2, can be applied. Suppose that we have an initial extreme efficient solution of (9) and let

                     1 and w
                     2 have m components. The BOSD method then iteratively generates entering variables which have a maximal ratio of improvement of the second objective function over deterioration of the first. This ratio is analogous to the ratio needed in the entering variable selection in Step 5 of Algorithm 1. Slack variable sa

                      is a candidate to enter the basis. Among the entering variable candidates we choose the one with maximum ratio, i.e. maximum value of (10) or maximum objective function value of (11). The identified entering variable is added to the basis of the BMP and the leaving variable is determined according to standard simplex rules as in Step 12 of Algorithm 3
                     . The BOSD method continues until there does not exist any entering variable which can improve the second objective by deteriorating the first objective, which implies that all non-dominated extreme points are obtained. Note that the resulting set might still contain solutions that map to the same point in objective space, as in Algorithm 1. The BOSD Algorithm is stated as Algorithm 3.

In this section, we perform computational experiments with the BOSD method on several directed bi-objective network instances with different characteristics and different numbers of commodities. All numerical tests are performed on a Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1 computer with Intel (R) Xeon(R) CPU, 2.67 gigahertz, 6.00 gigabytes RAM and 64-bit Operating System. The method is implemented in MATLAB R2013b Pro. All single objective linear sub-problems were solved by GUROBI 5.6 (Gurobi Optimization Inc. (2014).) We provide computational results obtained from several types of directed bi-objective network instances with one, two, three and five commodities.

We consider four groups of directed network instances. Instances N01–N12, F01–F12 and G01–G12 have the same structure as the bi-objective single commodity instances used in Raith and Ehrgott (2009), which we modify to include several commodities. Instances of groups B01–B05 and G13–G15 have a larger number of nodes and arcs compared to the instances used in Raith and Ehrgott (2009). Instances of groups N01–N12, F01–F12 and B01–B05 are directed network instances generated by the NETGEN (Klingman, Napier, and Stutz, 1974) generator which is modified to include a second objective function and multiple commodities. Table 1
                      shows NETGEN parameters for the generation of each set of networks, such as number of nodes, arcs, sources and sinks, etc. There are 30 instances for each set of parameters. Groups N01–N12 have varying total supply

                     Fig. 1
                      shows the non-dominated extreme points for one instance of class F12, with 80 nodes and 400 arcs, for one, two, three and five commodities which illustrates the trade-off between objective functions. This is typical for all examples. The large number of points for each commodity clearly illustrates the non-dominated set in objective space in each case, without additional lines to indicate the convex combinations of non-dominated extreme points. From Fig. 1 we can also see that the number of non-dominated extreme points increases with the number of commodities. We note that curves do not exhibit a monotonic translation in any particular direction as the number of commodities increases.

For the groups comprised of small and medium sized instances, the average CPU times for solving the instances are between 0.06 and 19.45 seconds. For instances of groups B01–B05 and G13–G15, the average CPU time is between 12.90 and 648.58 seconds.

                     . The average CPU time t

                     avg between the groups N01–N12 and the groups F01–F12 we can see that t

                      and the number of commodities, the average CPU time does not always increase when the number of
 commodities increases, which can be seen for instances of groups N08, N10, N11, N12 and F12. This may be due to the fact that by increasing the number of commodities there is a larger number of edges incident on each extreme point of the feasible polyhedron in decision space, hence it is more likely that we find an adjacent point with distinct objective value, i.e. the problem tends to have less degeneracy for our instances with two and three commodities compared to single commodity instances.

In this paper, by integrating Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition with the bi-objective simplex method, we present a new method for solving the BMCMCF problem. The method is the first application of column generation (Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition) in bi-objective optimisation. The method reformulates the problem into a bi-objective master problem over a set of capacity constraints and several single objective linear fractional sub-problems each over a set of network constraints. After finding an optimal solution of the problem with respect to the first objective, the linear fractional sub-problems generate entering columns for the basis of the bi-objective master problem to move from one extreme non-dominated point to the next one. We investigate the performance of our method on different sets of bi-objective network instances with several commodities. According to our computational results, the number of commodities has a positive correlation with the average number of non-dominated extreme points and has a strong negative correlation with the ratio of the number of iterations over the number of non-dominated extreme points (

                     ). This means that increasing the number of commodities does not necessarily increase the average CPU time.

In the literature on Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition for single objective multi-commodity flow problems, it is generally assumed that the problems are structured with a single source and single sink for each commodity (Tomlin, 1966). The sub-problems are then shortest path problems. For our BMCMCF problem we can also assume we have a single source and single sink for each commodity. In the bi-objective case, the sub-problem (11) involves finding a minimum cost flow in a network with no capacity on arcs and with fractional objective function

                     Due to the fractional objective function, and due to the fact that the column generation sub-problem needs to find variables with reduced cost that are negative for one and positive for the other objective the arising sub-problems are no longer easily solved as shortest path problems. In the future, we will address the application of methods, which are able to exploit the network structure of the sub-problems.

Since the proposed method is based on the bi-objective simplex method, an extension of the approach to three or more objectives may be possible by investigating the multi-objective simplex method. However, finding entering variables to the basis in the multi-objective simplex method requires the solution of single objective linear programmes that do not necessarily have a network structure, see e.g. Ehrgott (2005). Such a potential extension to more than two objectives is also the subject of further research.
