                  A Passive Optical Network (PON) is a network technology for deploying access networks based on passive optical components. In a single PON access network, the client terminals are connected to a Central Office through optical splitters and interconnecting fibers where each splitter splits in equal parts the input optical signal coming from the Central Office over its different output fibers. In this paper, we consider PON topology solutions where the splitting ratio and the number of splitting stages are not constrained to a given target design but, instead, are decided based on the cost of the solutions. We present different Integer Linear Programming formulations to model this problem and provide computational results showing that the optimal solutions can be computed for realistic problem instances. In addition, we describe how the formulations can be adapted for the traditional PON topology approaches and present computational results showing that significant cost gains are obtained with the unconstrained splitting stage approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In access networks based on passive optical components, a Passive Optical Network (PON) connects an output port of an OLT (Optical Line Terminal), located in a Central Office, to a set of ONUs (Optical Network Units), one for each client (herein, designated as client terminals). Such connections (from the Central Office to the client terminals) are based on passive optical components, i.e., optical splitters and fibers. When the number of client terminals is larger than the capacity of a PON, multiple PONs are deployed, each one corresponding to one output port of the OLT.

In this paper, we address the single PON network design problem in the context of densely populated urban scenarios. In these scenarios, client terminals are concentrated on a small number of locations (i.e., buildings) which enables us to model the problem with fewer variables and constraints. In the general case, the length of the path from the Central Office to each client terminal, and the number of splitters on it, is constrained by the maximum optical power that can be sent by the Central Office and the power loss suffered by the optical signal on fibers and splitters. In densely populated urban scenarios, though, distances between the Central Office and the client locations are short and such constraints do not need to be considered. Moreover, network infrastructures, like ducts or fiber cables, are usually available in these scenarios (or can be used from other utility entities) which enable us to model connection costs by a cost per fiber model.

In the single PON network design problem, we have to decide where to install splitters and how to interconnect all network elements (Central Office, splitters and client terminals) through optical fiber connections. Splitters are optical devices that split in equal parts the optical signal coming from the Central Office over their output ports in a power of 2; this is the splitting ratio of the splitter, which can be 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and so on. There are costs associated with the different splitter types (defined by their splitting ratios) and splitter locations and there are costs associated with fiber connections which are higher for longer fibers. The objective is to determine the minimum cost PON configuration.

Current research dedicated to PON network design usually assumes a PON capacity of 64, i.e., each output port of the OLT hosted in the Central Office can connect a maximum of 64 client terminals to the network. Nevertheless, it is foreseen that in the near future the capacity of the PONs will evolve to 128 or 256 client terminals as pointed out in ITU Standard (2010).

Most of recent works (an overview of these works is presented in next section) address the multiple PON network design problem where a set of clients are to be connected through more than one PON because the total number of clients is higher than the capacity of a single PON. This is a very complex optimization problem since besides the design of each PON, this problem also includes the clustering of client terminals to PONs. Due to its complexity, the multiple PON network design problem is tackled with approximate methods. Such solution techniques are of interest for quickly finding solutions in the evaluation process of many different network scenarios and for deciding which PONs should be implemented and which client terminals should be connected to each PON. Nevertheless, for the final network design, exact methods that can find optimal solutions for each PON are preferable.

In this work, we address the single PON network design case, i.e., we assume that the clustering of client terminals to PONs has been previously decided and each PON design must be individually determined. Unlike most of previous works, we consider a PON topology where the splitting ratio and the number of splitting stages are not constrained to any target design but, instead, are decided by the optimization task based on the minimum cost objective. Unlike the traditional approaches, where the single PON network design is easy for real size problem instances, this is a hard problem as it will be seen in the computational results.

We start by presenting a generic model for the single PON network design problem, which is non-linear. Then, we propose several ILP (Integer Linear Programming) models and test them by solving test instances with up to 256 client terminals (a PON capacity value which is foreseen in the near future). In the context of the computational results, we compare the efficiency of the different models and show that the most efficient modeling alternatives are able to solve to optimality all problem instances.

In addition, we describe how the proposed models can be adapted for the traditional PON topology approaches. We present computational results that compare the obtained optimal costs between the different approaches. These cost comparisons show that significant cost gains are obtained for PONs of larger capacity with the unconstrained splitting stage approach when compared with the traditional approaches.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the optimization problem and overviews the recent works on PON network design. Section 3 presents the several modeling alternatives to the problem. Section 4 presents and discusses the problem instances and the computational results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and the issues for future research.

Consider the example shown in Fig. 1
                      defining the location of the Central Office (where the OLT is hosted) and of the client terminals that must be connected in a total of 64 client terminals (numbers close to client locations indicate the number of client terminals). Fig. 1 also shows the potential locations for the splitters.

The simplest possible PON configuration considers a single splitting stage. In this case, the Central Office is connected to a splitter and this splitter is connected to the individual client terminals. Since the number of terminals is 64 in our example, the splitter must have a splitting ratio of 1:64 (as illustrated in Fig. 2
                     ). In the downstream, the optical signal sent by the Central Office is split in equal parts by the splitter among all its output ports. This solution minimizes the cost associated with splitters while penalizing the cost associated with fibers. Note that if the number of terminals is lower than 64, but higher than 32, a splitter with splitting ratio 1:64 is still required although some of its output ports are not in use.

Some recent works have considered single splitting stage solutions in the design of multiple PONs in the context of greenfield scenarios, i.e., scenarios where no infrastructure exists and its deployment costs must be considered in the optimization task. Approximate solution methods are proposed both in Bley, Ljubic, and Maurer (2013) and in Li and Chen (2009) where this last work also considers maximum length constraints to the fiber lengths of each PON.

A more flexible solution is to consider two splitting stages, which often arises in practice. In this case, the Central Office is connected to a first stage splitter, then this splitter is connected to different second stage splitters and, finally, these splitters are connected to the individual client terminals. In Fig. 3
                     , we illustrate a two splitting stage solution where the splitting ratio is 1:4 in the first stage and 1:16 in the second stage (note that other splitting ratios can also be adopted on each stage). As in the previous case, the optical signal sent by the Central Office must be split in equal parts by 64 before reaching each client terminal. Nevertheless, in this case, the split of the optical signal is distributed by the two splitting stages instead of being done on a single splitting stage (as in the previous case): it is first split by 4 in the first stage (the number of terminals served by each of these output connections is 64/4=16) and, then, each of these output signals is split by 16 in the second stage (the number of terminals served by each of these output connections is 16/16=1).

Note that, in this case, the client terminals in the same location can be connected to the network through different splitters (in Fig. 3, this is the case in two different client locations). When compared with the single splitting case, this solution increases the cost associated with splitters (there are more splitters in the network) while decreasing the cost associated with fibers (most of the fibers are shorter since this solution enables the second stage splitters to be located closer to the client locations).


                     Chardy, Costa, Faye, and Trampont (2012) have recently addressed the design of multiple PONs using two splitting stage solutions for each PON where the splitting ratio of each stage is pre-defined. As in our case, they consider densely populated urban scenarios with existing network infrastructures. They propose an ILP model with additional strengthening constraints and graph reduction techniques that can obtain feasible solutions with small gaps for realistic problem instances. Kim, Lee, and Han (2011) consider the design of PON access networks where the objective is to minimize the network cost by proper location of the optical splitters. They formulate the problem as a multi-level capacitated facility location problem on an underlying tree topology with non-linear link costs. The single splitting and two splitting stage variants are addressed with separate formulations for each case.

In our work, we consider a more general approach, which we name unconstrained splitting stage approach. In this case, we let the number of splitting stages from the Central Office to the client terminals to be different for different terminals. As a consequence, in the same splitting stage the ratio may differ from one splitter to another. In Fig. 4
                     , we illustrate a possible unconstrained splitting stage solution. In this case, the clients on the right-hand side of the figure are connected to the network through two splitting stages (1:2 in first stage and 1:32 in second stage) while the clients on the left-hand side of the figure are connected through three splitting stages (1:2 in first stage, 1:2 in second stage and 1:16 in third stage). Note, though, that the number of splitting stages and the splitting ratio of each stage is still such that the optical signal sent by the Central Office is split by 64 before reaching each client terminal. Finally, as in the previous case, we can also have client locations whose terminals are connected to the network through different splitters.

The main advantage of the unconstrained splitting stage approach is to enable more flexibility in the PON topology, aiming to reach cost savings in the network design solutions. In the computational results, we will show that for PONs of larger capacity, the cost savings can be significant when compared to the best of the previous approaches.

The work with a PON design variant similar to ours is the one proposed in Eira, Pedro, and Pires (2012), which deals with the design of multiple PONs with unconstrained splitting stages. That work considers not only equipment and installation costs (CAPEX) but also network operational costs (OPEX). It proposes an ILP model based on a complex generalization of the hierarchical concentrator location problem. Nevertheless, the reported computational results show that instances with 100 client terminals and 12 possible splitter locations take almost 40hours to be solved by CPLEX and, because of this, the authors also propose an approximate algorithm for the two splitting stage case. As it will be shown in the computational results, our most efficient ILP models are able to find optimal integer solutions for PONs with up to 256 client terminals and up to 42 possible splitter locations with much shorter running times. One important conclusion of the work presented in Eira et al. (2012) is that, due to the OPEX cost component, optimal solutions always consider a minimum number of PONs (i.e., OLT ports) and the number of client terminals assigned to each PON is closer to its maximum capacity for most of the PONs.

As a final remark, in this section we have considered the different PON topology approaches using an example (Fig. 1) where the Central Office is not a possible splitter location. In the general case, PON operators might consider that the first stage splitter can be hosted in the Central Office (directly connected to the output port of the OLT). This case can be easily considered in our models by including the Central Office in the set of the potential locations for the splitters.

In this section, we present several formulations for the single PON network design problem. This problem is formulated on a network, where the Central Office, the intermediate locations and the client locations are represented by nodes of the network. The intermediate nodes represent the eligible locations for optical splitters and, thus, some of them may not be included in the PON. Two modeling alternatives can be chosen for the client terminals: either each terminal is represented by a node or the terminals sharing the same location are represented by a single node. Since in densely populated urban areas several client terminals share the same location (i.e., multiple clients in the same building), we have adopted the second alternative since it involves fewer nodes and the resulting models involve fewer variables and constraints.

Note that when the number of client terminals is exactly the capacity of the PON (which is a power of 2) and since the splitting ratios of splitters are a power of 2, the number of terminals served by each fiber connection is always a power of 2. Consider the previous example of Fig. 4. The connection from the Central Office to the first stage splitter serves 
                        
                           64

                      client terminals. The connections from the first stage splitter to the second stage splitters serve 
                        
                           32
                           =
                           
                              
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 5
                              
                           
                        
                      client terminals each (=64/2). Then, the connections from the 1:2second stage splitter to the third stage splitters serve 
                        
                           16
                           =
                           
                              
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 4
                              
                           
                        
                      client terminals each (=32/2). Finally, the connections from all other splitters to clients serve 
                        
                           1
                           =
                           
                              
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                      client terminal each.

In our problem, the number of clients served by each connection is interpreted as a flow. The single PON network design problem can be modeled as a single-source/multi-destination network flow problem with flow constraints and additional constraints on the intermediate nodes. We consider that the number of client terminals is always equal to the capacity of the PON. If not, a dummy client location node with the required number of client terminals is included in the graph with arcs from all intermediate locations and associated costs equal to zero. With this modeling approach, the possible flow values of each connection are reduced to a minimum set composed by all powers of 2 (between 1 and the capacity of the PON). As it will be seen later on, this approach enables the definition of efficient ILP models.

In our problem, a PON has to satisfy the following five conditions: (i) it involves exactly one connection outgoing from the Central Office and serving NT client terminals (NT is the capacity of the PON); (ii) there is at most one connection incident on each intermediate node; (iii) each intermediate node hosts at most one splitter; (iv) the number of client terminals served by the output connections of a splitter is equal for all its output connections (a direct consequence of the split in equal parts of the incoming optical signal over the output connections) and (v) the number of output connections of each splitter is a power of 2. Before formulating the problem, we present the notation used in this paper.

We can obtain different formulations by specifying different sets of linear constraints for the problem described before. We start with a non-linear flow based model, similar to others used in the literature, with additional adequate constraints.

For this generic formulation, we consider the following sets of variables: binary variables

                        The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of intermediate nodes, optical splitters and fibre connections. Constraint (2) guarantees that the solution is connected to the Central Office by exactly one connection, whereas constraints (3) ensure that there is at most one connection ingoing to each intermediate node. Constraints (4) guarantee that each intermediate node hosts at most one splitter, whereas constraints (5) ensure that there are m connections outgoing from the intermediate node i if and only if this intermediate node hosts a splitter of type 1:m. These m outputs are either connections from i to other intermediate nodes

                        . The flow conservation is ensured by constraints (6). Constraints (7) guarantee that each terminal is included in the solution. Constraints (8) guarantee that the connection outgoing from the Central Office serves NT terminals, whereas constraints (9) together with (10) ensure that the flow outgoing from an intermediate node is equally divided in powers of 2. Furthermore, constraints (5) together with (6), (9) and (10) guarantee that the connections outgoing from an intermediate node are either connections between intermediate nodes or connections to terminal nodes. Finally, (11)–(13) are the domain constraints. Constraints (9) are the non-linear constraints and guarantee that the flow in connection (
                           
                              i

As the previous model shows, with the chosen set of variables it is far from obvious how to write linear constraints guaranteeing that the flow value on each arc leaving a splitter is equal to a power of 2 as well as to guarantee that the flow is equally divided by all arcs leaving a given splitter. More precisely, this happens for arcs (

By either adding these equalities or doing the adequate substitutions on the previous model, we obtain a model for the problem which guarantees that the flow on each connection is a power of 2. However, we still need to guarantee that the output flow of a splitter is the same on each outgoing connection. To guarantee this condition, we consider new binary variables

Constraints (16.1) and (16.2) match the flow value in variables w with the flow in variables z. Also, due to constraints (3), (14.1) and (14.2), the right-hand side of (17) is not greater than 1 and thus, the flow entering each intermediate node is split in only one way. Thus (16.1) and (16.2) and (17) ensure the flow values outgoing from an intermediate node i are equal. Furthermore, (17) guarantee that if there is a flow entering node

                        . Constraints (8) have become redundant and are removed from the model, whereas (9) and (10) are guaranteed by the definition of the new flow variables together with (16.1), (16.2), (17) and (20), and are also removed. Finally, (13), (24)–(26) are the domain constraints.

In the next sections, we propose several model enhancements. In Section 3.3 we derive valid inequalities from a subproblem defined by (16.1), (24) and (26). Then, in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, the enhancements are based on disaggregation of variables and constraints. In Section 3.4, the variables defined for the optical splitters are disaggregated by adding information on the value of the outgoing flow; the constraints concerning the splitter output connections are disaggregated accordingly. In Section 3.5, valid equalities relating the variables w to the new variables introduced in the previous subsection are included in the model; these equalities motivate the disaggregation of another set of constraints.

One typical way of improving the linear programming (LP) relaxation of a model is to find substructures in the model for which valid inequalities are known. In the case of model P1A, we consider the subproblem defined by constraints (16.1), (24) and (26). The LP relaxation of such a model can be easily improved (see, e.g., Gouveia, Moura, & Sousa (2011)) by adding the constraints:

                        Note that constraints (27.2) can be seen as a disaggregation of constraints (16.2) because we obtain (16.2) adding (27.2) for all

                        . Since the inclusion of constraints (27.1), instead of constraints (16.1), also permits the definition of a valid model with the remaining constraints, we denote by P1B the model P1A with (27.1) replacing (16.1), and with (27.2) replacing (16.2).

We denote by P1AB the model P1A with constraints (27.1) and (27.2). As mentioned before, constraints (27.2) are a disaggregation of constraints (16.2). Thus, constraints (27.2) dominate (16.2), which can be removed from P1AB. However, some preliminary computational experiments showed that the inclusion of (16.2), besides (27.2), reduces the CPU time for determining the optimal integer solutions. Naturally, P1AB can be considered as either P1A augmented with (27.1) and (27.2) or P1B augmented with (16.1) and (16.2).

The following result summarizes the relation between the LP relaxation of the models presented so far (we denote by PL the LP relaxation of model P and by v(P) the optimal value of model P).

                        Note that the above inequalities follow directly from the construction of the models. The computational results show that for all the instances tested the inequalities are strict. Also, it is easy to show that there is no relation between the values v(P1A
                           L
                        ) and v(P1B
                           L
                        ). However, for all the tested instances the relation v(P1A
                           L
                        )<v(P1B
                           L
                        ) holds.

The computational results presented in Section 4 will show that the models proposed until now are extremely time-consuming for the largest problem instances and, for several of the instances none of the proposed models was able to determine the optimal integer solution in six hours of runtime. The computational results will also show that the Linear Programming bounds are weak. In general, P1B generates better LP bounds than P1A and P1AB generates only slightly better LP bounds than P1B.

In order to derive formulations with a stronger linear programming relaxation, we follow a strategy used for strengthening node degree variables as in Duhamel, Gouveia, Moura, and Souza (2012) and Gouveia et al. (2011) (see also Gouveia & Moura (2012)) and disaggregate the variables

                        , in model P1A, by the right-hand side of (28). The new model has the same LP relaxation value as the original model P1A since we have only performed variable substitution and for the moment nothing has been gained from adding more variables. However, the main idea of this disaggregation is to observe that the output flow values of an optical splitter must be equal to the flow value on connections outgoing from this optical splitter (see constraints (30.1) and (30.2) below). Thus, the constraints concerning the optical splitter output, rewritten using relations (28),

                        We can simplify the resulting model by using the following observations. First, note that, as pointed out before when motivating (30.1) and (30.2), we obtain (29) after adding (30.1) for all q and then adding the result to (30.2). Thus, constraints (29) can be removed from the model. We denote by P2A the model obtained by using relations (28) to replace each variable

The objective function (31) and constraints (32) are obtained by applying relations (28) to (18) and (4), respectively. In addition to (24)–(26), (33) are domain constraints.

Similarly to what has been described in Section 3.3, in the context of model P1A, we obtain a second model, denoted by P2B, by replacing, in P2A, constraints (16.1) and (16.2) by (27.1) and (27.2) and a third model, denoted by P2AB, by augmenting P2A with constraints (27.1) and (27.2). The following results (Result 2 and Result 3) update the relation between the LP relaxation of the models presented so far (as before, the inequalities follow from the construction of the models).

                        The computational results show that for some instances the second and third inequalities are strict. For the first inequality, all instances tested provided the same bound and, thus, it is still open whether equality holds or there are instances for which strict inequality holds.

The computational results presented in Section 4 show the advantages of the disaggregation described in this subsection, namely the reductions in CPU times required to obtain the optimal integer solutions. However, these CPU times are still large for the largest instances. Furthermore, for several of the instances tested none of the proposed models so far has been able to determine the optimal integer solution within six hours of runtime. This has motivated the disaggregation described next.

In the previous sections, the decision variables originally associated with the optical splitters have been disaggregated. The new variables consider information not only about the optical splitter type but also about the optical splitter output flow. However, the models also involve the binary variables

In this section we introduce constraints linking these two sets of variables and exploit them to derive new models.

Constraints (35.1), (35.2) and (36) are obtained by applying (34) to constraints (16.1), (16.2) and (17). Note that either constraints (20) or (32) can be removed from the model, since one of these sets becomes redundant, due to constraints (36). We will remove constraints (20) since they involve more variables than (32). Note also that (35.1) and (35.2) can be removed since they are dominated by constraints (30.1) and (30.2), because the coefficients of variables

Constraints (34) also permit us to disaggregate constraints (36) into:

To see this, note that multiplying each constraint (30.1) by q and then adding the results to (30.2) we obtain:

The previous model is denoted by P3A. In the previous sections, different sets of linking constraints have been considered to derive other models. Models P1B and P2B have been obtained by replacing in P1A and P2A constraints (16.1) and (16.2) by (27.1) and (27.2), respectively. With respect to P3A, constraints (16.1) and (16.2) have been rewritten as (35.1) and (35.2) and then shown to be redundant. Also, constraints (27.1) and (27.2) need to be rewritten since they involve the variables

From an integer point of view, constraints (40.1) and (40.2) do not need to be involved in the previous model since constraints (30.1) and (30.2) already link the flow variables with the variables defined for optical splitters. Thus, we may view constraints (40.1) and (40.2) as valid inequalities to strengthen the linear programming relaxation of model P3A. We denote by P3AB the model P3A augmented with these inequalities to be consistent with the notation of the model P1 and P2.

The following results (Result 4, Result 5 and Result 6) update the relation between the LP relaxation of the models presented so far (as before, the inequalities follow from the construction of the models).

                        The computational results show that for all instances the bounds are equal with respect to the bounds of the first inequality. However, we have built unrealistic instances (where we consider the cost of a splitter type much greater than the cost of the other splitter types) for which strict inequality holds.

Here, the computational results show that for many instances the inequalities in results 5 and 6 are strict (and substantial improvements are obtained).

The computational results will show that the models proposed in this subsection reduce significantly the CPU times required to determine the optimal integer solution. The improvement on the LP bounds generated by the model P3AB is also significant, when compared with the ones obtained with the models P2B and P2AB. It is interesting to point out that the models P3 differ from the models P2 augmented with the equalities (34) mainly because of the disaggregation of constraints (36). This disaggregation seems to be the key to reduce the CPU times.

Note that the cost of an optimal solution is a trade-off between fiber costs (given by

                     ). In general, the relation between these two cost components depends on each particular case (for example, ownership or third party rental of fiber cables and ducts, fiber termination labor costs that can vary between different countries, etc.). If fiber costs are dominant, optimal PON solutions include more splitters in order to minimize the total fiber length. On the other hand, if splitter associated costs are dominant, optimal PON solutions include fewer splitters in order to minimize the splitter costs.

In order to study the efficiency of the proposed models in both cases, we have defined two test instances for each previously described scenario and indicate them as A and B. In both cases, we have considered the fiber costs given by

For all 24 test instances, we have solved all ILP models presented in Section 3 using CPLEX 12.3 from IBM ILOG. First, we have computed the LP lower bounds. Table 2
                      presents the obtained gaps (in percentage) between the LP lower bounds and the value of the optimal integer solutions. Table 2 also shows, in its last line, the average gaps exhibited by each model. The conclusions from these results are that, for these instances, models P1A, P2A and P3A have always the same LP bound and that the additional constraints considered in the other models always improve the gaps. Note that, in particular, the additional constraints (40.1) and (40.2) used in model P3AB have reduced significantly the LP bound of model P3A.

While solving the ILP models with CPLEX, we have defined the following branching priorities: for models P1, we have set a higher branching priority to variables

                     . No priority was set to the remaining variables. The assigned branching priorities were motivated by the analysis of the LP relaxation solutions. These priorities aim to quickly remove (in the branch-and-cut tree) the characteristics of the LP solutions not included in feasible integer solutions. In LP solutions, many variables associated with the optical splitters of higher ratio 1:NT take non zero values (

                      in models P2 and P3), whereas in an integer solution only one of such variables might be non-zero. In addition, when one of these variables is fixed to one, the ILP is trivially solved. Therefore, the highest priority value was assigned to these variables. On the other hand, in LP solutions many variables associated with connections outgoing from the Central Office take non zero values, while in an integer solution only one of these connections is in the solution. Furthermore, after fixing the inclusion of one of these connections, the resulting problem is reduced to a subproblem with one less level. Thus, the second highest priority value was assigned to these variables.

Remember that, as described in Section 3, model P3AB is defined based on model P3A augmented by constraints (40.1) and (40.2). The number of these additional constraints is very large when compared with the number of constraints of model P3A. Since these constraints are not needed to define the problem, we have defined them in CPLEX as “user cuts”. In this way, CPLEX adds them to its own sets of cuts and uses them only if they help in its own optimization process. The runtimes of P3AB reported in the next tables were obtained in this way.

The computer used to obtain the optimal solutions is an Intel (R) Core (TM) i3 550 3.2gigahertz with 4gigabyte. We have defined a runtime limit of six hours for CPLEX to obtain the optimal integer solutions. Tables 3–5

                     , respectively. Besides the cost of the optimal integer solution of each test instance (column ‘OPT’), these tables present for each model the runtime (in seconds) for obtaining the optimal integer solution. When a percentage value is presented, it means that CPLEX did not solve to optimality the model within the six hours of runtime limit and the percentage value is the gap between the obtained upper and lower bounds at the end of the execution.

The results of Table 3 indicate that the problem instances of set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S

                      are easy to solve with all proposed models. All instances have been solved to optimality within at most a few minutes. Note that these instances are easy also because the instance sizes (in number of elements of sets S and 
                        
                           T
                        
                     ) are small. Nevertheless, models P3A and P3AB already exhibit a better performance than the others since they can solve all problem instances within at most 2seconds. Table 4, shown next, presents the results obtained for the instances of set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S

                     .

These results indicate that some of these instances are harder to solve. Moreover, the differences between the results obtained by the different models become more significant: the P1 models do not solve to optimality some of these instances; the P2 models can still find all optimal solutions within the maximum running time and the P3 models solve all instances with small running times (at most 28seconds with P3A and 26seconds with P3AB). Table 5, shown next, presents the results obtained for the instances of set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        
                     .

The results of Table 5 show that only models P3A and P3AB have solved all problem instances to optimality, some of them with short computing times. All other models have performed quite worse than these two models since they could not solve to optimality many instances. In fact, we consider that P3AB is better than P3A because it was able to solve the hardest problems in shorter runtimes (namely, instances 12A and 11A). Nevertheless, for the other easier instances, both models (P3A and P3AB) seem to be equivalent.

A global analysis of the results shown in Tables 3–5 shows two additional relevant conclusions. First, the required runtimes to solve the test instances is higher for instances A than for instances B. Note that instances A consider lower splitter associated cost, which means that the PON design problem is harder when the fiber associated costs are dominant. Second, the test instances with lower client terminal concentration values (i.e., the same number of client terminals distributed over a larger number of locations) are harder for all models. This observation is not surprising since the models of these instances exhibit more variables and constraints.

In order to access the improvements obtained by the adopted branching priorities and the use of constraints (40.1) and (40.2) as CPLEX “user cuts”, in the next Table 6
                      we present the running times obtained by models P3A and P3AB without such settings (shown in columns ‘P3A∗’ and ‘P3AB∗’). For comparison reasons, we repeat the running times of models P3A and P3AB already shown in the previous Table 5. We show these results only for set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                        
                     , which is the set of the hardest problem instances where the differences are more significant. These results clearly show that without using the branching priorities (and ‘user cuts’, in case of P3AB), the running times become larger (in particular for the hardest problems) and one of the instances (instance 12A) could not be solved to optimality by model P3AB.

Note that the proposed models can be easily adapted to address the single PON design problem for the traditional PON topology approaches (see discussion of Section 2). Using model P3A, this is done in the following way. In the single splitting stage case, we only consider the variables associated with splitters of maximum ratio

                     , or equivalently, we set the variables associated with splitters of all other ratios equal to zero. In addition, we do not consider the variables associated with fiber connections between intermediate nodes, i.e., we set them equal to zero. In the two splitting stage case, let 1:

                      show the optimal cost values obtained for the three sets of instances and for the different single splitting and two splitting stage configurations. These tables also include the (previously presented) optimal cost values obtained for the unconstrained splitting stage solutions (column ‘U’) and the last column (‘Gain’) shows the cost gains, in percentages, obtained by the unconstrained splitting stage solution when compared with the best among all other solutions.

Note that the optimal unconstrained splitting stage costs cannot be worse than any of the other costs because all other solutions are feasible solutions for our problem. In general, Tables 7 and 8 show that for PONs with a capacity of 64 and 128 terminals, relevant cost gains are already obtained for many instances A (i.e., with lower splitter associated costs) and Table 9 shows that for PONs of higher capacity (256 terminals), there are cost gains in almost all instances and the cost gains are quite significant for instances A. These results demonstrate the relevance of the problem addressed in this paper, i.e., the optimal design of unconstrained splitting stage PONs.

As a final remark, we note that the single splitting stage and the two splitting stage adapted formulations are much more compact when compared with the unconstrained splitting stage formulations and this has a strong impact in the runtime required to solve the problem instances. All instances from 1 to 10 were solved to optimality within 2seconds of computational time and the hardest cases were instance 12B, with a splitting stage distribution of 1:8+1:32, that took 21seconds and instance 11B, with a splitting stage distribution of 1:16+1:16, that took 11seconds.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have addressed the single PON network design problem with unconstrained splitting stages, i.e., the splitting ratio and the number of splitting stages are not constrained to a given target design but, instead, are decided based on the cost of the network solution.

We have proposed several models for this problem, which are reformulations, based on discretization of variables and disaggregation of variables and constraints, of a generic single-source/ multi-destination flow model with additional constraints on the intermediate nodes. The results showed the advantages of the reformulations in the sense that the reformulations introduced on the models always helped in reducing the solution runtimes. Moreover, with the last reformulations, we were able to solve to optimality all considered problem instances.

We have also described how model P3A can be adapted for the traditional PON topology approaches (both single and two splitting stage problems). Note that the same adaptation can be used in all other proposed models. We have presented computational results showing that for PONs of larger capacity significant cost gains can be obtained with the unconstrained splitting stage approach when compared with the traditional approaches.

For future work, a natural follow up is to address the network design of multiple PONs with unconstrained splitting stages and allowing different topologies for each PON. This problem is of particular interest in the network planning stages when PON equipment solutions for 128 and 256 client terminals are envisaged. The clustering of client terminals to PONs taking into account that each PON can have any topological configuration (i.e., not constrained to a traditional topology) is potentially more efficient than current solution techniques available from the literature, provided that techniques able to find solutions with small optimality gaps can be achieved.
