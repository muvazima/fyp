                  Theory of belief function can be introduced to the interval set by defining interval-valued belief structures. The Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory of evidence has been extended to combine interval-valued belief structures for decades. Although there already exist several combination approaches proposed by previous researchers, this problem has not been fully resolved so far. A novel combination of interval-valued belief structures is developed after analyzing existing irrational or suboptimal approaches. The novel combination approach is modeled based on intuitionistic fuzzy set, rather than nonlinear programming models, which are computational complicated. Numerical examples are implemented to illustrate the performance of the proposed novel approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since it was firstly presented by Dempster [1], and was later extended and refined by Shafer [2], the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, or the D–S theory for short, has generated considerable interest. Its application has extended to many areas such as expert systems [3], diagnosis and reasoning [4,5], pattern classification [6–9], information fusion [10], knowledge reduction [11], global positioning system [12], regression analysis [13], and data mining [14]. However, for its counterintuitive results in some cases, especially when there is high conflict among bodies of evidence, various alternatives to D–S theory have been presented [15–22].

The original D–S theory requires precise belief degrees and belief structures, whereas in practice some or all probability masses can be uncertain or imprecise. Such uncertainty or imprecision may be caused by the incompleteness, the lack of information, linguistic ambiguity or vagueness. For example, in the problem of pattern recognition, a classifier may be unable to give a precise decision about the unknown pattern, and even worse, its belief degree on each class may be imprecise. In this case, an interval-valued belief degree rather than a precise one may be provided. In the group decision making, different experts may give different degrees of belief. Of course these degrees can be averaged to get a real valued estimate, but this leads inevitably to the loss of some important information. Therefore, the use of interval-valued belief degree seems to be a sensible option. This would preserve the different belief degrees, thereby facilitating further discussion. So we can say that interval-valued belief structures represent the belief information which is known but not precise. Hence the problem of extending D–S theory to interval-values belief function arises.

There have been several attempts to extend the D–S theory to interval-valued belief structures [24,42]. However, the issues of combination and normalization of interval-valued belief structures have not been fully resolved. One apparent drawback existing in the previous approach is the violation of associativity, which is crucial for multi-evidence combination. Besides, the process of nonlinear optimization may bring additional computational burden. The purpose of this paper is to reinvestigate the issues and to develop a novel approach for combining interval-valued belief structures. This approach, satisfying the associative requirement, is founded based on intuitionistic fuzzy set, in a relative simple way.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief recall of the D–S theory of evidence, together with introductions of interval-valued belief structure and operations on interval values. In Section 3, we review and critically analyze the existing approaches for combining and normalizing interval-valued belief structures and point out the drawbacks of these methods. A novel approach for combining interval-valued belief structures is developed in Section 4. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the performance of the novel approach in Section 5. We come to the conclusion of this paper in Section 6.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The background material presented in this section deals with the following four main points: (1) the interpretation of Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, that will be used in this paper to ease the exposition, (2) axiomatic definitions on interval-valued belief structure, (3) basic operations on intervals, (4) the presentation of interval-valued Bayesian belief structure, which will facilitate the combination of interval-valued belief structures, and (5) a brief review of intuitionistic fuzzy set and its operations.

Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence was modeled based on a finite set of mutually exclusive elements, called the frame of discernment denoted by Ω 
                        [1]. The power set of Ω, denoted by 2
                           Ω
                        , contains all possible unions of the sets in Ω including Ω itself. Singleton sets in a frame of discernment Ω will be called atomic sets because they do not contain nonempty subsets. It is assumed that only one atomic set can be true at any one time. If a set is assumed to be true, then all supersets are considered true as well.

An observer who believes that one or several sets in the power set of Ω might be true can assign belief masses to these sets. Belief mass on an atomic set A
                        ∈2
                           Ω
                         is interpreted as the belief that the set in question is true. Belief mass on a non-atomic set A
                        ∈2
                           Ω
                         is interpreted as the belief that one of the atomic sets it contains is true, but that the observer is uncertain about which of them is true. The following definition is central in the Dempster–Shafer theory.
                           Definition 1
                           Let Ω
                              ={A

For agreement with other literatures, the terminology of belief structure will be adopted in this paper. For each subset A
                              ⊆
                              Ω, the value taken by the BPA at A is called the basic probability mass of A, denoted by m(A).

A subset A of Ω is called the focal element of a belief structure m if m(A)>0.

A Bayesian belief structure (BBS) on Ω is a belief structure on Ω whose focal elements are atomic sets (singletons) of Ω.

Given a belief structure m on Ω, the belief function and plausibility function which are in one-to-one correspondence with m can be defined respectively as:

Considering generalized summation and multiplication operations, there is the need for the selection of parameter, which is highly subjective and arbitrary. Different choices may lead to different results. So the interval arithmetic operations, with simpler manifestations, are taken into extensive application.

                        b] and [c,

                              ∉
                              Ω. Therefore, m
                              ′ is an interval-valued belief structure. □

Considering above interpretation, the Bayesian belief structure corresponded to a normalized interval-valued belief structure can be called an interval valued Bayesian belief structure.

Look at the belief structure on Ω
                        ={A
                        1,
                        A
                        2,
                        A
                        3} with interval probability masses as: m(A
                        1)=[0.2,0.4], m(A
                        2)=[0.3,0.5], m(A
                        2
                        A
                        3)=[0.1,0.3], m(A
                        1
                        A
                        2)=[0,0.4]. It can be transformed to a Bayesian belief structure as: m
                        ′(A
                        1)=[0.2,0.6], m

                        2)=[0.35,0.85], m
                        ′(A
                        3)=[0.05,0.15]. It’s easy to find that

                         violets the properties in Definition 8. So it’s not a normalized interval-valued belief structure. The conclusion can be drawn that the interval-valued Bayesian belief structure generated by a normalized interval-valued belief structure may not necessarily be normalized. Obviously, the non-normalized interval-valued Bayesian belief structure can be normalized by Eqs. (10) and (11).

Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), as one of the generations of the fuzzy set, was first proposed by Atanassov to deal with vagueness [28]. The main advantage of the IFS is its property to cope with the uncertainty that may exist due to information impression. Because it assigns to each element a membership degree and a non-membership degree, and thus, IFS constitutes an extension of Zadeh’s fuzzy set which only assigns to each element a membership degree. So IFS is regarded as a more effective way to deal with vagueness than fuzzy set. Although Gau and Buehrer later presented vague set, it was pointed out by Bustince and Burillo that the notion of vague sets was the same as that of IFS. Since its inception, IFS has been used in many areas, such as decision making [29–34] and pattern recognition [35–37].

In this section, we briefly recall the basic concepts related to IFS, and then list the operations on IFS.

It can be proved that the above addition and multiplication rules are commutative and associative. However, the multiplication rule does not satisfy the distributive law, i.e., A
                        ·(B
                        +
                        C)=
                        A

                        A

                        C would not hold in general.

The classical D–S theory is not originally suited to handling uncertain evidence, by which we mean some or all probability masses assigned to focal elements are interval values. There have been several attempts to extend the D–S theory to interval-valued belief structures. Wang et al. [41] have summarized most of the existing approaches for combining interval evidence. Here we briefly recall some of the representative approaches, together with the latest approaches.

Based on the generalized summation and multiplication operations, Lee and Zhu [23] expressed the combination of two pieces of interval evidence as:

Wang et al. [41] pointed that this approach had at least two following drawbacks. The first of them is the need for the selection of parameter w, which is highly subjective and arbitrary. Different choices may lead to different results. The second one is the use of non-normalized interval evidence both before and after combination. Therefore, their approach seems to be a problematic one.

Consider their numerical example of pneumonia diagnosis, in which there are three possible organisms causing the pneumonia:

The frame of discernment is denoted as Ω

                     L,

The two pieces of interval evidence they utilized are recorded as:

Regardless of Lee and Zhu’s inconsideration of normalization analyzed in [41], here we investigate the influence of parameter w on the combination results. Results of combination using different w are presented in Table 1
                     .

It is shown that the probability masses of m
                     1
                     ⊕
                     m
                     2 vary greatly with the change of parameterw. The probability masses assigned to {L}, {LK}, and Ω are zero for w
                     =1, which is meaningless for decision. In our considering range, both the lower and upper bounds of probability masses on {L}, {PL}, {LK}, and Ω increase monotonically with w. The lower bound of m
                     1
                     ⊕
                     m
                     2(P) increases with the increasing w, while its upper bound climbs up firstly and then declines. Although these trends are not very representative, the instability of this approach can be reflected by them.

Denoeux [24,25] systematically studied the issues of combination and normalization of interval evidence and he found that conventional interval arithmetic is not a good option to compute the combined probability masses of two pieces of interval evidence. He constructed the following pair of quadratic programming models to calculate the combined probability masses of two pieces of interval evidence:

Denoeux also found that the combination of interval evidence has no property of associativity, i.e. (m

                     3) in general. This lack of associativity is obviously a drawback and it makes the result of the combination of several interval-valued belief structures dependent on the order in which they are combined. In order to overcome this drawback, he suggested combining all interval evidence in one step. After the combination of interval evidence in one step, the following normalization approach was developed to normalize all the combined but non-normalized interval-valued probability masses:

                      is the normalized interval-valued probability mass of m(A)∈[m
                     −(A),
                     m
                     +(A)]. All the normalized interval-valued probability masses form a piece of interval evidence, also called an interval-valued belief structure.

It can be seen that the combination and the normalization of interval evidence are separated from each other and optimized individually. The numerical example taken in [41] illustrated that the resulting normalized interval-valued probability masses provided by Denoeux’s approach are too wide to be true.

Yager [26] explored the issues of the combination and normalization of interval evidence, based on the application of interval arithmetic operations. However, Yager’s approach has been found to have the following two fundamental faults by Wang et al. [41]. The first of them is the use of interval arithmetic in computing the combined probability masses of two pieces of interval evidence. The second drawback is the inability of this approach to normalize the combined interval-valued probability masses. Moreover, it was shown in [41] that the upper bound of interval probability generated by the Yager’s method may be less than the lower bound of this probability. Of course, such inverted intervals cannot be used in the analysis.

Wang et al. [40,41] investigates the issues of combination and normalization of interval-valued belief structures within the framework of Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. They presented a new logically correct optimality approach, where the combination and the normalization are optimized together rather than separately. They defined the interval-valued belief structure of m

Since its better performance illustrated by numerical examples, the optimality approach has been successfully applied to a cargo ship selection problem, which is a complex multiple criteria decision making problem. However, the non-associativity of the combination is apparent. The issue of computational complexity of the optimality approach has been also pointed out. The optimality approach combined and normalized interval evidence in one step to obtain a precise solution rather than separately to achieve a suboptimal solution and involves the solution of a number of nonlinear programming models. There is no doubt that it is computationally complicated than Denoeux’s approach [24,25].

As the latest work on the combination and normalization of interval-values belief structures, Sevastianov et al. [42] developed a new framework for rule-base evidential reasoning in the interval setting. The interval-valued belief structures from different sources were combined by the so-called “interval extended zero” method, which was based on the interval arithmetic operations as Eqs. (20)–(23). The interval probability masses were multiplied by a normalization factor, denoted by NF, to complete the procedure of normalization. It is important to note that the combination method needs only not complicated calculations based on the conventional interval arithmetic, rather than nonlinear programming models. However, the irrationality lies behind the normalization process is the fact that the normalized interval-valued probability may exceed one. To show this point clearly, let us take a look at the following example.

It is clear in the above results that the upper bound probability of m
                     ∗(A
                     1) exceeds one. Such a normalized interval-valued belief structure is obviously irrational and unacceptable. This shows that the proposed normalization is not a good option to compute the normalized probability masses of interval-valued belief structures.

The above review indicated that the issues of combination and normalization of interval evidence have not been fully resolved so far. Therefore, there is an urgent necessary to reinvestigate them. In the following section, we will develop a novel approach for combining and normalizing interval-valued belief structures, where the combination is based in operations on intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). The method proposed in [43] is taken to normalize the interval-valued belief structures. It will be shown that the generated interval for each focal element can be regarded as the subset of the so-called true interval obtained by Wang et al. [40,41].

Let’s take a further investigation on the normalized interval-valued Bayesian belief structure on Ω
                        ={A
                        1,
                        A
                        2,…,
                        A
                        
                           n
                        }, from the pattern recognition point of view. The belief structure can be regarded as the output of a classifier. The recognition result is an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) on discernment frame Ω rather than a crisp set. An intuitionistic fuzzy set representing the belief structure m can be defined on Ω as:

From the point of view of belief function, we can define a new operation on IFSs. Let’s closely examine the IFS M on Ω
                        ={A}. μ (A) and 1−
                        γ(A) constitute the interval of the membership degree of the element A to the set M, as has been mentioned previously. Dymova and Sevastjanov [44] have shown that in the framework of belief function the triplet μ(A), γ (A), π(A) represents the basic assignment function. From the view of pattern recognition, the triplet can be regarded as the answer of “Does the unknown object u belong to A?”. The hypotheses frame of the answer is {{Yes},{No},{Yes,
                        No}}. So, the membership degree μ(A) can be treated as the probability mass of u
                        ∈
                        A, i.e., as the focal element of the basic belief assignment function: m
                        
                           A
                        (Yes)=
                        μ(A). Similarly, we can assume that m
                        
                           A
                        (No)=
                        γ(A). Since π(A) is usually treated as the hesitation degree, a natural assumption is m
                        
                           A
                        (Yes,
                        No)=
                        π (A). Therefore, the IFS M can elicit a belief structure as:

The belief function m
                        1
                        ⊕
                        m
                        2 may not necessarily be normalized. So we need to normalize it according to Eqs. (8)–(11).

Apparently, this binary combination operator ⊕ can be also extended to combine N interval-valued belief functions, denoted by ⊕
                           i=1,…,N
                        
                        m
                        
                           i
                        . Since the combination operation on IFSs is commutative and associative, the combination rule of interval-valued belief functions complies with the requirements of commutativity and associativity as well. We can get the following equations effortlessly:

When combining several belief functions, we can combine them one by one. Moreover, the order under which the combination is performed is irrelevant. It has been proved that normalization in Dempster’s rule can be postponed to a later point without changing the result [47]. Similarly, to achieve the associativity, the normalization process in our combination rule should be postponed to end of the combination. For example, if we need to combine N interval-belief structures in the frame of discernment Ω, the result of combination is computed by first combining them, and then normalizing the final result. Let the letter N denote the normalization process, we have:

                        , called Markovian requirement [48]. Therefore, there is no need to store all belief functions and to recomputed combinations repeatedly when belief functions are collected sequentially and time is meaningful. Thus the threat of memory overflow and computational inefficiency can be overcome.

As a summary, Fig. 1
                         shows the flow chart of combining N interval-valued belief structures on Ω

First, we take the example in [24] to illustrate the implementation process of the proposed novel combination.

We can get the final combination result through the process as interpreted in Example 2. The combination results obtained by Lee and Zhu’s method [23], Denoeux’s method [24], Wang’s method [41], Yager’s method [26], Sevastianov’s method [42], and our novel method are presented in Table 2
                     .

According to the conditions in Definition 8, all the combined results except Lee and Zhu’s are normalized interval-valued belief structures. Here we take Wang’s global optimal solution as the true intervals. We can see that the intervals obtained by Lee and Zhu’s method are quite different from the so-called true intervals obtained by Wang. Lee and Zhu’s every interval but m(Ω) is on the left of the true interval, with some overlaps. Therefore, we can say Lee and Zhu’s result is irrational and unreliable.

Since both of Denoeux’s and Yager’s results are wide enough to include the true intervals, they are too uncertain to contain enough information for analysis. Compared to Wang’s method, these two combination approaches lead to suboptimal interval-valued belief structures.

If we transform Wang’s and Sevastianov’s belief structures to Bayesian belief structures by Definition 10, denoted as m
                     
                        W

                      respectively, we can get:

Fortunately, they are all normalized interval-valued Bayesian belief structures. There is no doubt that the global optimal solution of Eq. (44) constitutes the true interval of the combination result. Nevertheless, intuitively, the center of the true interval is more plausible than both lower and upper bounds. That’s because the bounds can be reached only in the worst case situation, named boundary condition, while the center value can come from many different pieces of evidence elicited by the interval evidence. So we can say that the interval concentrates nearer to the center is more probable. In such sense, Sevastianov’s method and our novel method provide more certain results enclosed in Wang’s intervals. Moreover, our result is a bit better than Sevastianov’s. Considering the drawback of Sevastianov’s normalization method mentioned previously, our novel combination approach is definitely more desirable.

In order to confirm that the novel combination approach comply the requirement of associativity, we come to Example 4 by adding another normalized interval-valued belief structure m
                     3 to Example 3.

The famous associativity facilitates the combination of multiple interval-valued belief structures, especially when these belief structures are collected one by one rather than simultaneously. Furthermore, it’s worth noting that the normalization should be implemented after the last belief structure is combined.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have mainly investigated the issues of combination of interval-valued belief structures. The normalization of interval-valued belief structure, as an inseparable part of our research, is carried out by the method proposed by Wang et al. [41]. The existing approaches for combining and normalizing interval evidence are reviewed and critically analyzed. The results obtained by these methods are either non-normalized, or irrational, or suboptimal. Wang et al. can provide true intervals of the combination result by the optimality approach. However, this approach does not satisfy the associative requirement. Our novel combination approach is based on the operation on IFS, elicited by D–S theory. The performance of our novel has been illustrated by numerical examples. Moreover, our novel combination approach complies associativity, which is crucially helpful for coping with the combination of multiple interval-valued belief structures obtained sequentially.

Finally, we must point out the issue of computational complexity of our combination approach. Since our defined novel combination operation of IFS comes from the Dempster’s combination rule, the computation-intensiveness confronted by Dempster’s rule can also cause computational inefficiency when a large amount of interval evidences are needed to be combined. However, our observations in Examples 3 and 4 show that our approach is less computationally complicated than Wang’s method. That’s because operations in our novel approach are arithmetic operations, which are much simpler than the nonlinear optimal operation. Therefore, computational complexity is not a problem for the novel approach.
