                  This work deals with pricing of “virtual” products, i.e., products that a retailer can supply after demand has been realized. Such products allow the retailer to avoid holding costs and ensure timely fulfillment of demand with no risk of shortage. Demand is commonly price-dependent and uncertain, and we seek to maximize each of three criteria: expected profit, the likelihood of achieving a profit target, and the profit for a given percentile. Simultaneous multiple criteria are also explored. Two forms of demand uncertainty are considered in the analysis: the multiplicative form, where, due to stochastic dominance, all the investigated profit criteria—and, in fact, any utility function of the profit—can be optimized simultaneously; and the additive form, where stochastic dominance cannot occur. Under the multiplicative form of demand, the property of stochastic dominance is shown to hold in a two-echelon supply chain (comprising both the supplier and the retailer) and in a centralized system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the market share and variety of intangible products. This increase is largely a result of the proliferation of digital platforms for content consumption, as well as the development of the internet as a direct channel for delivering goods and transferring payments (Waelbroeck, 2013). Sales of intangible products can generate substantial revenues: For example, a recent article in Time magazine noted that in a one-day national promotion, the website LivingSocial grossed more than 11million dollars from the sales of $20 Amazon.com gift cards, sold for $10 each (Tuttle, 2012). Yet it seems that the development of pricing models has not kept pace with that of the market. Traditional models, formulated primarily for the pricing of tangible products, fail to capture key properties of intangible products and are therefore of limited utility to the digital retailer. In particular, many of the parameters incorporated into traditional models are superfluous for products that are not held in inventory and can be produced (or delivered) in infinite quantities and in a negligible amount of time—after demand has been realized. We refer to such products as “virtual” products. Examples of virtual products include (1) smartphone applications that are sold online; (2) licenses to download and use software for a calendar year (e.g., SAS, Maple); (3) gift cards being sold at a discount online (e.g., http://www.groupon.com/ about); (4) electronic newspapers, books, music, TV programs and movies to be downloaded from the net for a fee; and (5) club/association memberships that are sold for a calendar year (e.g., professional societies).

Seeking to fill the gap in the literature, herein we construct a pricing model for virtual products. We assume that demand is influenced not only by retail price but by many other, more minor, factors and therefore is stochastic in nature. The uncertainty in demand is translated into uncertainty of profits, and the criterion for maximization is therefore a random variable. We suggest that in selecting a criterion for maximization, it is necessary to take into account the decision maker’s approach to risk. The most commonly used criterion of profit is the expectation (see, e.g., Dana, 2001; Gerchak, 2012; Granot & Yin, 2008; Van Mieghem & Dada, 1999); the selection of this criterion assumes that the decision maker is risk neutral, i.e., has a linear utility function. Only a non-linear utility function can capture risk considerations with regard to profit. In the absence of a utility function (as discussed later) other profit criteria that do consider risk can be used. Herein we consider three criteria: expectation, the probability of achieving a given target, and the profit for a given percentile.

In addition to proposing a model that is tailored to virtual products, this paper makes three primary contributions. First, we present methods for deriving prices that maximize each of the three profit-related criteria mentioned above. It is possible that none of these criteria, by itself, captures the preferences of the retailer. As a consequence, our second contribution is providing means for the decision maker to select wisely his or her preferred price when considering several profit criteria. This is done by constructing a set of profit criteria values that are not dominated, and identifying the prices that yield these values (referred to as the set of “efficient” prices). Third, this paper shows that under certain assumptions of demand uncertainty, one price optimizes all profit criteria.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the related literature. Section 3 introduces the problem formulation and presents different optimization criteria that may express the retailer’s profit preferences. In Section 4, we consider this problem assuming a multiplicative demand form and show that there is an optimal price whose profit is stochastically dominant. In Section 5, we analyze the additive demand form, for which we show that stochastic dominance of profits does not exist. We analyze the retailer’s pricing decision under various optimization criteria and perform a sensitivity analysis. Then we provide a means to establish a non-dominated set of criteria values that can aid the retailer in selecting a preferred price. We illustrate this technique using numerical examples. Section 6 provides two extensions of the multiplicative demand case: a two-echelon supply chain and limited capacity. We conclude in Section 7 with implications and directions for future work.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

We review three streams of related literature. The first is a well-established research stream comprising price-setting models under uncertain demand, whose objective is to maximize profits. An example for such a model is the “price-setting newsvendor problem” (see review in Petruzzi & Dada (1999), and recently in Xing, Wang, & Liu (2012), Xu & Lu (2013)), where both price and order quantity are to be determined simultaneously. However, this model is not well suited to virtual products, as it considers overage and underage costs, which are not relevant for these products. Additional models in this stream include peak-load pricing models in the field of economics (see review in Crew, Fernando, & Kleindorfer, 1995) and product postponement strategy models in field of operations research (see, for example, Cheng, Li, Wan, & Wang, 2010; Granot & Yin, 2008; Reimann, 2012; Van Mieghem & Dada, 1999). These two types of models share the following assumptions: (i) demand decreases in price; (ii) demand uncertainty has either a multiplicative or additive form; (iii) capacity cost is considered; and (iv) production capacity is limited. Assumptions (iii) and (iv) are superfluous for virtual products. In the model we develop for virtual products, we adopt assumptions (i) and (ii) and relax assumptions (iii) and (iv). In addition, whereas much of the literature in this stream assumes a specific price-dependent demand function and only one objective function (the profit expectation in most cases), our model enables a broader analysis, as it considers various decision criteria under a general demand function with uncertainty.

Managers and firms are often risk-sensitive (usually risk-averse). As a result, when demand is uncertain and the range of profits is not small, an approach of maximizing expected profit may not represent their preferences. An alternative approach is to rely on normative utility theory, which considers risk factors by assessing the subjective utility function of the firms and maximizing its expected value (see Leland, 1972). However, the utility theory approach is not without disadvantages: first, it is not easy to extract the utility function; second, the objective function of expected utility may not be easy to analyze. Furthermore, behavioral economists, beginning with Allais (1953) and including, most prominently, Tversky and Kahneman (1974), have questioned the assumptions underlying this theory. Non-expected utility models have been proposed to capture expected utility anomalies, yet these approaches have not mitigated the disadvantages associated with utility theory (for a review, see Starmer, 2000).

Therefore, we refer to a second stream of literature, comprising analytic studies in which the goal is to achieve “satisfactory” outcomes rather than maximum expected profit. Extensive research (e.g., Brown & Tang, 2006; Lanzillotti, 1958; Merchant & Manzoni, 1989; Morris & Fuller, 1989) suggests that firm managers indeed seek to achieve such objectives, termed “satisficing” by Simon (1959). Shi, Zhao, and Xia (2010) suggest that satisficing objectives have a major advantage over expected-profit maximization. The advantage is that they are “more practical for many individuals and firms. E.g., in the business world, it is common that individuals and firms are rewarded if they can meet or exceed some preset profit targets.” There are two main satisficing objectives, which are based, respectively, on probabilistic and percentile measures of risk (see Uryasev, 2000). The first seeks to maximize the probability to achieve a target profit (see Abbas & Matheson, 2005; Bordley & Kirkwood, 2004; Bordley & LiCalzi, 2000; He & Khouja, 2011; Lau, 1980; Parlar & Weng, 2003; Shi et al., 2010; Shi, Yan, Xi, & Zhao, 2011). The second seeks to maximize a percentile (i.e., quantile) criterion (see Delage & Mannor, 2010; Filar, Krass, & Ross, 1995; Henig, 1990). Each of these objectives actually replaces the utility function.

The third research stream relates to studies in multi-criteria decision analysis. According to Babalos, Philippas, Doumpos, and Zopounidis (2012), “multi-criteria decision making provides an arsenal of techniques for aggregating multiple criteria in performance evaluation problems in order to select, rank, classify, and describe a set of alternative options”. Belton and Stewart (2002), Gandibleux (2002) and Ehrgott (2005) review the main concepts, principles and techniques in this field, and recent advances and research trends are presented in Ehrgott, Figueira, and Greco (2010), Zopounidis and Pardalos (2010) and Zopounidis, Fabozzi, and Doumpos (2014). In our paper, given a group of criteria, we identify a set of non-dominated profit criteria values and the prices that yield these values (referred to as the set of “efficient” prices) and investigate their properties.

Consider a retailer who wishes to choose a unit retail price p for a product or a service (from now on, ‘product’ refers also to services). The retailer can pull any quantity of units he wishes from the product’s supplier at a wholesale price w per unit. The business process is composed of three sequential stages as illustrated in Fig. 1
                     . First, p is determined; then demand is revealed; and finally, the retailer orders the quantity demanded in the previous stage and delivers the units to the customers.

The demand for the product is a random variable, denoted by

                     , whose expected value D(p) is a decreasing function of the retail price, p. Let ε be a random variable that is price-independent, and let F

We analyze the two most common forms (see, for example, Petruzzi & Dada, 1999; Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, & Seref, 2011) of stochastic demand: (i) the multiplicative form:

If the retailer is risk-neutral then the first criterion is the only one that should interest him. The target and the percentile criteria, in contrast, are related to the distribution function of the profit, and, as such, they can be used to capture the retailer’s attitude towards risk. Some percentiles, such as the median, can replace the expectation criterion. A retailer may also express his preferences in terms of more than one target or percentile.

It is clear that the optimization criterion used to select the price must obey the following rule: never select a price whose associated profit function is stochastically dominated. By definition, the target and percentile criteria obey this rule. The expectation criterion clearly adheres to this rule, since X
                     ≻
                     1
                     Y if and only if E(u(X))⩾
                     E(u(Y)) for any increasing (utility) function u (see Whitmore & Findlay, 1978).

The literature suggests other criteria for representing risk preferences of the decision maker, which are not analyzed in this paper. One of them is variance, which is considered a prominent risk measure (Markowitz, 1952). However, use of a variance criterion does not ensure that the profit function associated with the selected price is not stochastically dominated, and, as concluded by Hanoch and Levy (1969), “the identification of riskiness with variance, or with any other single measure of dispersion, is clearly unsound.”

In this case the profit is

The stochastic order proved in Lemma 1 is due to the multiplication of the randomly drawn ε by the positive constant π(p) (see Hadar & Russell, 1971), so that the order of the constants is also the stochastic order of the distributions. On the basis of this lemma, the following clearly holds:
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           The price p
                           ∗ 
                           that maximizes the expected profit, π(p), provides a profit that stochastically dominates profits attained with other prices.
                        

First-order stochastic dominance of profits implies that p
                     ∗ maximizes any target or percentile criterion as well as the expected utility for any utility function. Note that the variance of the profit,

                           (
                           
                              
                                 π
                              
                              
                                 ̃
                              
                           
                           (
                           p
                           )
                           )
                        
                     , is equal to π(p)V(ε), so that maximizing the expected profit also maximizes the variance of the profit. Theorem 1 shows that in the case of multiplicative demand form, p
                     ∗ can be attained exactly as in deterministic models.

When the demand function is differentiable with derivative D′(p), p
                     ∗ satisfies the first-order condition (FOC),

                                    If D(p) is concave then π(p) is concave.
                                 


                                    If 1/D(p) is convex then π(p) is pseudo-concave.

                                 When D(p) is twice differentiable then the proof is straightforward since π″(p)=2D′(p)+(p

                                    w)D″(p)<0, as D′(p)<0 and D″(p)⩽0. For the general case, in which D(p) is not necessarily differentiable, see Appendix A.


                                    π(p) can be written as (p
                                    −
                                    w)/(1/D(p)). The numerator is a linear positive function for p

                                    w, and the denominator is a positive convex function, so following Theorem 3.5.2 of Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty (2006), it can be proved that this ratio is pseudo-concave. □

By Theorems 3.5.11 and 3.5.6 of Bazaraa et al. (2006), it can be proved that
                        Corollary 1
                        
                           If D(p) is concave or 1/D(p) is convex then p
                           ∗
                           , which satisfies 
                           
                              (4)
                           
                           , is optimal.
                        

The optimal prices and the properties of common D(p) functions are summarized in Table 1
                      (note that in the linear case, the result holds when w
                     <
                     a/b; otherwise, p
                     ∗

                     w and p

                     =
                     a/b are optimal, implying zero profits).

Note that in Table 1, p
                     ∗ increases in w. This can be generalized to any demand function if p
                     ∗ satisfies the SOC:

                           p
                           ∗ 
                           increases in w.
                        


                           p
                           ∗ satisfies (4): D(p

                           w)D′(p
                           ∗)=0. By implicit differentiation of this equation with respect to w, we obtain

By Lemma 4, if there is a price whose profit function second-order-dominates all other possible profit functions, then that price must be the minimal price, w, which implies zero profits. However, zero profits with probability one is dominated by profits obtained by prices higher than w, thus proving that second-order stochastic dominance does not exist.

Given the absence of stochastic dominance in the case of additive demand there is not necessarily a price p
                        ∗ that optimizes the expectation, target and percentile criteria simultaneously. Consequently, unless a specific utility function is given, then the decision maker must select the criterion that reflects his preferences with regard to risk. In what follows we provide methods for optimizing separately the expectation, target and percentile criteria, which will be denoted, respectively, by the subscripts E, T, and α. For simplicity of analysis, we assume that D(p) is twice differentiable.

According to Petruzzi and Dada (1999), the additive model is commonly analyzed with the linear price-dependent demand function. Let D(p)=
                        a
                        −
                        bp, a, b
                        >0, w
                        <
                        p
                        <
                        a/b. Table 2
                         presents expressions for the optimal prices and the corresponding optimal criteria values, obtained according to Theorem 2 and Corollary 3.

It is possible that none of the above criteria expresses, by itself, the preferences of the risk-sensitive retailer. Consequently, the retailer may wish to choose a price while considering its effect on two or more criteria. For example, the retailer may seek to maximize the expectation and some target or percentile; a target and some percentile; two different targets; or two different percentiles (with or without considering the profit expectation). As shown in Table 2, each criterion, except in rare conditions, yields a different optimal price, resulting in a multi-criteria problem. In what follows, we show how to construct the set of efficient prices, i.e., the prices that yield a non-dominated set of criteria values. The retailer can then choose his preferred price according to the criteria values. In this paper we do not discuss methods for selecting the preferred price among the non-dominated set, and the reader is referred to the literature that deals with multi-criteria decision making (see Section 2). In principle, we assume that the retailer is able to choose this price, given the set of non-dominated criteria values, defined as follows:

Let f
                        1(p),…, f
                        
                           m
                        (p) be m criteria values, which are functions of p, and let f(p)≡(f
                        1(p),…, f
                        
                           m

Clearly, the efficient set of prices does not include any interval of p in which all criteria values are increasing or decreasing simultaneously. By Theorem 2, if D(p) is concave then the profit expectation, target and percentile are all pseudo-concave functions of price, which proves the claim. □

As expected, Lemma 5 shows that the interval of efficient prices does not decrease in the number of criteria.

                           =900 (high target value), where ε is uniformly distributed over [−300,300]. We used Maple software to plot the non-dominated set of values for the two target criteria.

                        2(p), f
                        3(p)), is a curve in three dimensions, which is not necessarily captured in a plane. Fig. 6

In the previous sections, we showed that under the multiplicative form of demand, one price optimizes all utility functions of the profit, whereas under the additive form of demand, different prices optimize different profit criteria. In this section we examine two extensions of the multiplicative case and investigate whether its special property remains valid.

In this section we extend the price-setting problem to include the supplier in addition to the retailer, i.e., to represent a two-echelon supply chain. To account for intra-competition between the supply chain parties, we employ the game-theoretic approach (see Kogan & Tapiero, 2007). The game is sequential as follows: the supplier offers a product, whose marginal production cost is c, at unit wholesale price w to the retailer. The supplier has ample capacity and is able to deliver on time any quantity ordered by the retailer. The retailer responds by setting the unit retail price p. Once the demand is realized, the required quantity is delivered from the supplier via the retailer to the customers.

This is the Stackelberg model of a sequential game, in which the supplier is the leader and the retailer is the follower. Perfect information is assumed, and the Stackelberg equilibrium is obtained as follows: first, the retailer’s best response p(w) is identified, and then the supplier’s profit function

                        The profit function of the supplier, (19), is similar to that of the retailer, (1). Specifically, in both cases the randomly drawn ε is multiplied by a positive constant (the profit expectation). Let w

We now consider a centralized supply chain, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the “double marginalization effect” (see Kogan & Tapiero, 2007; Spengler, 1950) in a supply chain operating under intra-competition. In the centralized supply chain, the objective function is the supply chain’s overall profit,

                         summarizes the optimal/equilibrium retail prices and the expected overall profits for the centralized and decentralized two-echelon supply chains.

In the case of the additive demand form, no stochastic dominance exists, and the optimal price depends on the preferences of the retailer, which, are rarely known a priori to the supplier. This may lead to some process of negotiation between the supplier and the retailer. If they agree on maximizing the overall profit (and agree on some mechanism to split it between them), then their common profit function is

Although our model was developed primarily for virtual products, it can be adapted for products and services with limited capacity, such as catalog sales (e.g., online shopping, mail-order), club memberships that are sold for one period (e.g., country clubs, nightclubs) or tickets sold for shows and sport events. A closely related model is depicted as Strategy 2 in Van Mieghem and Dada (1999). Under Strategy 2, capacity and price are set before demand realization, but production, constrained by capacity, is determined after demand realization. The model of Van Mieghem and Dada (1999) is designated for a manufacturer who decides about the production capacity, which is associated with a capacity cost. In our model, in contrast, the focus is on a retailer, so that the capacity is exogenously determined. For example, in catalog sales the manufacturer determines the number of units that are available to the retailer; in a club, the constraint may be dictated by actual physical capacity.

Let the capacity be limited to Q units. In this case the profit is

By Lemma 6, under limited capacity the decision maker must select the criterion that reflects his preferences with regard to risk in order to set the optimal price. This result is in contrast to that obtained under unlimited capacity, where one price optimizes all profit criteria.

                              This result can be explained as follows: When the price is higher than p

                              , actual demand may not pass capacity Q, and therefore the profit may exceed the profit that the retailer obtains with p

The paper shows how optimal pricing policies for virtual products vary across different forms of demand. Our findings highlight the importance of an in-depth understanding of the uncertainty of demand. In particular, in the case of the multiplicative demand form, price optimization is straightforward, whereas in the case of additive demand, the optimal pricing approach depends on the retailer’s preferences with regard to risk. For the latter case, we suggest three profit optimization criteria: expectation, target and percentile. These meaningful criteria can replace the use of utility functions, which may be difficult to formulate and solve.

For cases in which a single criterion is not sufficient to express the retailer’s preferences, we have shown how to calculate a non-dominated set of criteria values that can aid the retailer in selecting his preferred price. For our problem, in contrast to many other multiple-criteria problems, it is easy to depict and analyze the set of efficient prices, which is a compact subset of R. We further investigated two extensions of the multiplicative demand case, seeking to determine whether they would also yield an optimal price with a stochastically dominant profit function for all three criteria. First, for a two-echelon supply chain we used a game-theoretic approach to account for intra-competition between the supplier and the retailer. This approach yielded a solution for the multiplicative demand form, where equilibrium was obtained in a stochastic Stackelberg game. Second, for the case of limited capacity, we showed that stochastic dominance does not hold, and that for any utility function of the retailer, the optimal retail price is equal to or greater than that obtained in the absence of the capacity limitation.

Future research can extend the current model to consider minimal capacity limitations of the retailer, such as minimal order size due to a contract with the supplier. Additional extensions may consider other factors that affect the demand and are controlled by the retailer, such as investment in marketing or in protecting the virtual product from being copied illegally. The most important extension is likely to be the analysis of demand functions that are not separable into deterministic and random components but in which the parameters of the demand distribution are price-dependent. In this case, it would be interesting to investigate whether separable demand models can approximate non-separable ones.
