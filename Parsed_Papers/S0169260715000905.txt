                  Patients use nurse call systems to signal nurses for medical help. Traditional push button-flashing lamp call systems are not integrated with other hospital automation systems. Therefore, nurse response time becomes a matter of personal discretion. The improvement obtained by integrating a pager system into the nurse call systems does not increase care efficiency, because unnecessary visits are still not eliminated. To obtain an immediate response and a purposeful visit by a nurse; regardless of the location of nurse in hospital, traditional systems have to be improved by intelligent telephone system integration. The results of the developed Nurse Call System Software (NCSS), the Wireless Phone System Software (WPSS), the Location System Software (LSS) and the communication protocol are provided, together with detailed XML message structures. The benefits of the proposed system are also discussed and the direction of future work is presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In hospitals, nurses must be easily reachable and must respond to the calling patient, as quickly as possible. In short, nurse availability affects the quality of a hospital's patient care. Most hospitals use push buttons, flashing lamps and paging systems to provide notification to nurses, in an ad hoc manner. However, when a paging call is received, present activity has to be stopped and an available phone has to be found. The prolonged delay until a response is given, degrades the quality of care and operational efficiency. In today's large hospitals, the need for the nurses to be at locations besides the nurse station, aggravates the availability problem. The nurses point to the need of carrying a wireless device during the mobile or “away” times [1], because such a device can:
                        
                           •
                           Show the room number, bed number, call priority, and the patient name who pressed the call button, Have an available call back feature that allows responding a patient for calls that come when the nurse is outside the nurse station.

The need for a mobile wireless device has been declared because the most important ramification of a nurse call system is effective communication with the patient, to decide the urgency for a visit. Most nurse call systems are arranged as wired communication systems, where a patient pushes a red button located next or above the bed. The action triggers an alarm by flashing a light outside the room, as well as creating an audible tone. The red buttons are connected to a central monitoring panel, located at the nurse station. When the call occurs, the priority of the call, the originating bed number and some other limited information are displayed. The alerts are expected to catch the immediate attention of the nurses. The light is turned off when the nurse visits the caller. If there is a delay to answer the call of the patient, then the frequency of flashing the light and the audible tone are increased, which are configurable through software. Nurses can also opt to pick up the phone and start a voice communication to help the patient remotely, while at the nurse station.

Participants of a work on patient–nurse interaction, described the nurse call system as a means to start an interaction and get the needed help, as quickly as possible [2]. Work [2] suggested that regular visits to patients would decrease resorting to nurse call systems. However, random visits done by doctors or nurses unavoidably increase the number of redundant patient visits, which is inevitably unaffordable in large hospitals. The shortcomings of the traditional nurse call systems can be overcome by investigating new technologies like the home Digital Enhanced Cordless Technology (DECT) phones. DECT telephone features are continually upgraded to catch up with the characteristics of mobile phones, due to the competition between the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and cable phone operators. DECT phones can be utilized, not only for receiving (similar to pocket pagers) and sending text messages, but also for providing full-duplex voice communication. Some proposals have indeed been made to integrate DECT phones into nurse call systems, in an effort to improve the nurse-patient communication and the functionality of the existing systems [3–5]. After all, DECT phone integration opens the way to calls to a specific nurse, in charge of a particular patient or bed [3]. A call to a DECT phone is accompanied by the calling patient's room number, bed number and the priority of the call on the state of the art phone display (liquid crystal or thin film transistor). However, the disadvantage of the unscreened call system in Ref. [3] is the possibility of calling a nurse who is already giving care to another patient. Another drawback of the system presented in Ref. [3] is that the patient name is missing on the phone display. But, replying a patient with his/her name would increase the satisfaction level toward the nurse.

In other work, the wireless nurse call system helps bedridden patients to communicate with the nurses, in the absence of their caretakers [4]. But, the nurse calls are generated automatically when the physiological parameters of the patient such as ECG, pulse rate, or respiration rate exceeds certain thresholds. However, the disadvantage of that system surfaces when the physiological parameters drop below the threshold in the presence of a caretaker. In this system, the patient has to depend on the caretaker, instead of a nurse. The nurse call system in Ref. [5] is adaptive and assesses the priority of the call, based on certain pre-defined conditions and delivers a call to the most appropriate nurse. The disadvantage of the system is the decision time taken until the right nurse is chosen, one of the causes of the delay in traditional nurse call systems. Various surveys completed by doctors and nurses in work [6] indicate that the participants are dissatisfied with one-way paging devices. And, the use of wireless phones has resulted in significantly reduced patient interruptions, longer patient visits and reduced waiting times for returned calls. Finally, the work of Ref. [1] shows the challenges faced by the wireless phone based systems, but proposes only partial solutions. As observed, the various works surveyed have limited success in increasing the effectiveness of nurse-patient communication and still fail to meet certain challenges such as
                        
                           •
                           Transferring a call to the secondary nurse, if the primary is on the phone with another patient,

Transferring the call to the secondary nurse, if the primary is currently on a visit in a patient's room,

Transferring the call to the secondary nurse, if the primary is outside the ward,

The communication protocol between the nurse and the patient is defined in detail.

For many years, nurse call systems were stand-alone and required the integration of pocket pagers to support the mobile nurses. Even though it was possible to transmit nurse calls through pocket pagers, the patient - nurse communication was still one-way. The one-way set-up required the nurses to make too many redundant visits [6]. In summary, an intelligent solution is needed to meet the above challenges by creating a nurse call system with wireless phones.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

The present work is an attempt to eliminate the redundant visits and prolonged call returns, by making the nurse–patient communication a two-way and intelligent system. In the literature, the details of the proposed two-way communication are not clear. This work deliberately presents details of the proposed communication protocol, in order to make it repeatable for interested researchers. The overall solution is summarized in a name that consists of the first letters of the modules, Nurse Wireless Location System (NWLS). Each module is described in detail in Section 3.

Nurse call systems can be inspired by the facilities available in mobile phones. To meet the expectations, today's overall nurse call applications need to make more intelligent decisions, based on additional information from the location and ADT (admit, discharge and transfer) systems. As a pre-requisite, all helpful information should be displayed not only on pagers or phones, but also on the desktop computers of nurse stations, administration and clinical engineering offices. This work assumes that such hardware (computers, network, DECT phones, switch boards, etc.) are already available at today's hospitals.

The proposed NWLS provides the following advantages to the patients and the nurses:

The patient can reach a nurse equipped with a DECT phone, quicker,
                           
                              •
                              The patient's call is guaranteed to be serviced by the hospital,

The nurse can be mobile and does not need to be in a nurse station or near to a cable phone to answer a call,

Both the nurse and the patient know that if the primary nurse is not available, the system will nominate the secondary nurse.

The benefits of implementing the components of NWLS are also significant for software developers [7–9]. Five contributions of this work are as follows:
                           
                              •
                              Increased reliability of the developed code which has passed engineering tests,

Decreased time in releasing the event subscriber, such as the Wireless Phone System Software (WPSS) and Location System Software (LSS), through reducing design, code and test efforts [10–12],

Promotion of software reuse, due to the common mechanism of shared nurse call events [13,14],

Detailed message structures given in XML format,

The provision of communication protocol details.

The proposed solution consists of three modules; Nurse Call System Software (NCSS), Wireless Phone System Software (WPSS), and Location System Software (LSS). Fig. 1
                      shows the state diagram for the proposed solution.

The arrival of a nurse call event sparks off state machine. If the patient presses the button, the nurse call hardware transfers this call to the NCSS. Then, the NCSS sends ALERT to the WPSS over TCP/IP. Upon receiving the ALERT, the WPSS rings the primary nurse's wireless phone. When the primary nurse presses the “ANS” key, the audio path will be established. When the nurse finishes talking with the patient, the primary nurse disconnects the audio path by pressing the “END” key. If the event is a nurse location change; because of a nurse movement from one room to another, the LSS delivers the event to the NCSS and the NCSS transfers the location change event to the WPSS, for further processing. The WPSS uses the new location information to make more intelligent decisions, which is explained in Section 3.3. Three software applications, NCSS, WPSS, and LSS were developed using the designed communication protocol described in Section 4.1. The Visual C# programming language was utilized for the development of the software and Microsoft's MS SQL Server 2008 (R2) was used for logging errors and recording communication protocol settings.

The first software application is called the Nurse Call System Software (NCSS), which provides a common, convenient, and reliable means of transferring nurse call system events, defined as Normal, Urgent and Code Blue events. The NCSS is also called the event publisher that generates Local Area Network (LAN) events for the WPSS. The NCSS receives the nurse call events as string messages through RS232 (Fig. 1) from the nurse call system hardware and transfers these messages to WPSS to alert the nurses. The NCSS is the source of the nurse call events and allows independent development of subscriber applications that share nurse call events through a common mechanism; but is not responsible of the content or the classification of the nurse call events. The NCSS provides the following services:
                           
                              •
                              Registration of WPSS and LSS,

Routing of asynchronous nurse call events to nurse call event subscribers such as WPSS,

A master timer periodically providing a time-stamp event to WPSS and LSS,

Authentication of event subscribers such as WPSS and LSS,

Transferring location change events from LSS to WPSS.

The second software application called the Wireless Phone System Software (WPSS), which can also be described as an event subscriber. WPSS uses the LAN events received from the event publisher NCSS. Based on a nurse call event, a subscriber application takes action, typically such as alerting a wireless handset. The WPSS must register (log on) with the NCSS to utilize its services. The WPSS receives the nurse call messages from the NCSS (Fig. 1) over TCP/IP; and the location messages from the location system, described in the next section. WPSS decides if the primary nurse is available, or not. If the nurse is unavailable, the WPSS sends an alert message until an available secondary nurse is found. (This communication is not shown to avoid complicating the figure further.) Otherwise, the WPSS simply alerts the primary nurse.

The third software application is called the Location System Software (LSS). The LSS is another event publisher which publishes the locations of nurses within the hospital using Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology. The nurse wears an active RFID badge which reports its unique ID to a reader device [15]. Since the location of the reader and the signal strength of the nurse's RFID signal are known, the location of the nurse is remotely identified [16]. The LSS sends location messages to WPSS, to help in the decision of primary nurse availability.

The location information of the nurses may not be sufficient to locate the best suited secondary nurse. The activity information; hence the determination of nurses’ busy period impacts the response time of the nurse call. The database can also have information about the activity of a nurse, apart from her location. If in the database, the location of a nurse is outside the ward (cafeteria, administrator building etc.), or in rooms pre-defined as off-duty; then the system can immediately decide to transfer the call to the secondary nurse. But, the occurrence of nurse unavailability is a low probability. The identification of the ward room is achieved by assigning specific numbers to the location reader hardware, mounted in each room. The remaining nurse unavailability occurrences can only be decided by identifying the activity of the nurse. Hence, the more data is entered into the database record of the nurse, the higher the probability of making a correct unavailability identification, for that specific nurse. This requires smart software algorithms and is the scope of another study. However, some recommendations are made in Section 5.

A custom communication protocol has been designed for the call, answer and disconnection procedures of NWLS. The sequence diagram of the process is given in Fig. 2
                     . The interface components of the proposed solution use regular TCP/IP sockets for communication. The NCSS, WPSS and LSS suite share a common software development platform and access the same communication core. The present study implements the following interface components:
                        
                           •
                           Client Control Dynamic-Link Library (DLL): Simplifies communication with the NCSS for communication, subscriptions, and publishing with a non-visual control,

Logging DLL: Simplifies recording of messaging into the database between NCSS and major events within WPSS and LSS, for debugging and diagnostic purposes [17–21].

The NWLS implements the following functions in order to get successfully interfaced with the wireless telephones:
                        
                           •
                           
                              Logon: Allows the NCSS to start communicating with the WPSS or the LSS (Appendix A).


                              Supervisor application: Allows the NCSS, the WPSS and the LSS to stay in synchronization with each other at the application level. The NCSS sends one heartbeat XML message
                                 1
                              
                              
                                 1
                                 The heartbeat XML message is a text message periodically sent to check if the client is still active and able to exchange messages with the NCSS.
                               for every minute of idle message activity. The heartbeat request allows the NCSS, the WPSS or the LSS to recognize a lost connection between the two and perform a login retry and cleanup (Appendix A).


                              Supervisor handset session: Allows the NCSS and the WPSS to stay in synchronization with each respect to each active phone session. The NCSS sends a heartbeat every 30s for each active phone session. The heartbeat request allows the system to recognize a lost wireless telephone session, based on the response from the system; and a lost nurse call system session, based on a heartbeat timeout (Appendix A).


                              Alert: Allows the NCSS to alert a wireless handset by messaging and ringing. The Alert request initiates a session with a wireless handset, displays a message, and activates the handset. The WPSS initiates the session and informs the NCSS of the handset alerted (Appendix A).


                              Display: Allows the NCSS to place menu options on the wireless handset soft keys, and to display text on the wireless handset display lines (Appendix A).


                              Dial: Allows the NCSS to initiate a voice call on the wireless handset (Appendix A).


                              Release: Allows the NCSS to initiate a disconnect sequence on the wireless handset (Appendix A).

The wireless telephone status can be polled at intervals by the WPSS, to detect whether the wireless telephone is ready for its next operation. Polling is used to avoid the current nurse call when the nurse is on the phone with a patient. If that's the case, then the current nurse call is transferred to the secondary nurse's wireless phone by the WPSS. The WPSS provides the following further asynchronous events to the nurse-call systems:
                        
                           •
                           
                              Session ended: This event notifies the NCSS that the session has ended (Appendix B).


                              Menu option/Key: This event notifies the NCSS immediately when the nurse selects an option from the MENU request list, or presses a key (Appendix B).


                        Fig. 2 shows the sequence diagram for the Call, Answer and Disconnect functional scenarios. In Appendix C, the XML messages for these functions are depicted.

The patient presses the nurse call button from the patient room to summon the nurse. WPSS decides if the primary responsible nurse is available or not. If not available, then the current call is transferred to the secondary nurse's wireless phone. As soon as the WPSS delivers the message to the wireless telephone, the telephone starts ringing and shows the display string on the handset (Display and Ring, Fig. 2). The alert is accepted when the nurse presses any button (Nurse Accepts Alert, Fig. 2). Next, the NCSS sends an XML request message to the wireless telephone system (Display (SessionID, “ANS”, “END”), Fig. 2). At this point, the nurse has the option to have an audio conversation with the patient. When the nurse selects the “ANS” on the handset (“ANS” selected, Fig. 2), an asynchronous XML event message is generated for the NCSS (Event (SessionID, “ANS”), Fig. 2).

In case of a failure to receive an acknowledgement, the WPSS will retry three times and finally end the active session. This message is not shown in Fig. 2 to prevent unnecessary image confusion. To allow the NCSS to initiate a voice call on the wireless handset, the XML message (Dial SessionID, DialStr) shown in Fig. 2 will be sent. At that time, the audio path between the nurse and the patient will be established. In the next subsection, an implementation of the NCSS is presented.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the wireless phone and NWLS integration. The LSS sends the location changes of the nurses to the WPSS, in real-time. Hence, the WPSS is informed about the current location of each nurse. Furthermore, the WPSS polls the status of each wireless phone to find out if the nurse is using the phone. As a session example, assume that the patient places a call from the patient room. The hardware receiving the signal transfers the information using RS232 to the NCSS. The NCSS sends the ALERT message to the WPSS using TCP/IP. The WPSS checks the responsible nurse's location and the status of her phone. If the nurse is not classified as unavailable, then the WPSS responds back with the unique SessionID for the ALERT message and starts ringing the handset. The NCSS in return sends the DISPLAY message string to the handset. The nurse presses the “ANS” key to initiate and the “END” key to close the audio connection. Information about the handset ID and nurse assignments for the wireless handsets are kept in the database server.

The NCSS is the software application that receives embedded messages from the nurse call system hardware (Fig. 3). The received messages are presented in Fig. 4
                         as XML messages. The WPSS is the software application which receives the NCSS requests and delivers them to the wireless phone hardware (Fig. 3). The two software applications form the bridge of connection between the stand-alone hardware such as nurse call system hardware, and the wireless phone hardware in a LAN environment. Fig. 4 shows the actual NCSS and WPSS software application windows. “1021 Normal” message is received from the nurse call system hardware. The NCSS generates the ALERT message to ring the wireless handset with the display message “1021 Normal”. The WPSS sends back the SessionID, as a response. The NCSS sends the MENU selection options, “ANS” and “END”. At this moment, the NCSS waits for the nurse to choose either the ANS or the END key. In Fig. 4, the WPSS sends ANS key as the selection to the wireless phone event. The NCSS sends the DIAL string to allow the audio connection to be established. At the end of conversation with the patient, the nurse presses the END key which generates the MenuSelect event. Subsequently, the NCSS sends the RELEASE request to the WPSS, which releases the handset by acknowledging the request.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The traditional one-way pager communication systems used in hospitals; which allowed the nurses to receive text messages only, did not succeed in eliminating unnecessary patient visits. Therefore, the NWLS was designed to overcome such issues and to incorporate facilities in order to provide advantages over the previous systems.

As shown in Section 4, the first advantage of the proposed NWLS is the two-way nurse-patient communication facility provided. With the support of DECT phones, the nurse can call back the patient to decide on the severity of the call. The option of a nurse inquiry can indeed help to eliminate redundant visits to patient rooms.

The WPSS module of NWLS uses the phone network of the hospital's telephony service provider. To reduce the costs of the phone calls, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones can be integrated. VoIP routes the phone calls over the hospital's LAN, eliminating the need for a telephony service provider. Therefore, using the VoIP phones is the second benefit obtained in the long run. Moreover, VoIP phone systems are easily scalable, as they do not require physical phone ports. If and when the hospital grows, the current VoIP phone system can be easily enlarged.

Patient satisfaction starts with the response time of the nurse. Response time is the overall latency of the nurse call system and is defined as the time that passes between the instant the patient initiates a call and the instant the primary or secondary nurse answers the call. In reality, call latency consists of a sequence of delays, adding up to a final sum:
                        
                           d1: The network time it takes for the patient's call to reach the server,

d2: The computer time it takes to find the corresponding nurse in the database,

d3: The network time it takes for the server to dispatch the call to the primary nurse,

d4: The time it takes for the nurse to answer the call,

d5: The network time it takes for the server to dispatch the call to the secondary nurse,

d6: The time it takes for the secondary nurse to answer the call.

Hardware delay times d1, d2, d3, d5 are in the range of milliseconds, because of today's high processing power, computers and active network devices. For example, the link delay in a wired local area network (LAN); such as a hospital LAN, is fixed at 20ms [22]. Even the VoIP delays over the Internet are in the range of milliseconds. But, considerably long delays can occur especially during the ringing of the phones, until the assigned nurse answers the call. The longest latency takes place when the primary nurse fails to take the call and the secondary nurse picks up her phone at the last ring. The number of rings, duration of each ring and each ringing interval can be decided by the administrators. For example, limiting the number of maximum rings to 6 (each ring lasting half a second) and the time interval between each ring to half a second, d4 becomes at most 6s. If the primary nurse fails to take the call and the secondary nurse waits for the 6th ring before taking the call, d6 also becomes 6s. Then, the latency becomes 12seconds and few milliseconds (12s+d1
                     +d2
                     +d3
                     +d5). In the worst case, the patients always receive a reply within 13s. The server identifies the secondary nurse while the phone of the primary nurse rings, therefore, there is no delay time involved in deciding the secondary nurse.

In order to help the system make good assignment decisions, it is required to increase the number of RFID tagged objects inside the ward. For example, consider a ward where the patient room, patient bed, the patient, the medication cart, the drugs are all tagged [23]. In such an environment, the system has the capability to determine that the nurse is in a specific patient room, on a medication round, administering drugs to one of her high priority patients (room–bed–patient–nurse tag match+patient–patient's drug tag match+cart–nurse–room tag match). The system is now in a position to decide that the nurse is busy and unavailable. As observed, in addition to the number of tagged objects, smart software algorithms are also necessary. The intelligence of such a system is the scope of our next research, as engineers.

Effective nurse-patient communication in hospitals is essential for greater health care efficiency. For many years, the traditional standalone applications have been the only nurse call systems. The increasing mobility of nurses within a hospital requires a method of contact, independent of their hospital location. In this paper, an innovative solution based on a custom developed communication protocol has been presented. The presented solution NWLS allows two-way nurse-patient communication, regardless of the nurse's location, which consists of three software application modules NCSS, LSS and WPSS that has the following distinct advantages over existing traditional systems:
                     
                        
                           •
                           Establishes two-way communication between the nurse and the patient,

Makes intelligent decisions while placing a call to a nurse,

Speeds up nurse response time,

Eliminates redundant patient visits,

Is Health Level 7 (HL7) ready,

The communication protocol of the system is well-defined.

Future work will focus on a function called User Session Request, which notifies the nurse call system that the nurse wishes to establish a wireless handset data session. The NWLS does not currently support HL7 to achieve the integration of health-care information exchange and interoperability; it can provide just the name of the patient on the display of the phone. Therefore, future work on integrating NWLS with Hospital Information Systems using HL7 is important; because it will allow notification of the nurses about patient's sensitive HL7 acuity level.
