                  Optical properties of seven regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene) with different alkyl side chain lengths which are poly(3-butylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3BT), poly(3-pentylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3PT), poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), poly(3-heptylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3hept), poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3OT), poly(3-decylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3DT), and poly(3-dodecylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3DDT) have been studied in the mid-infrared (IR) spectral region by means of Fourier Transformation Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and IR spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE). Absorbance spectra obtained in this fingerprint region are potential to characterize the structures formed by organic molecules in thin films due to molecular vibrations in detail. In consequence, the vibrational absorption bands of these seven samples demonstrated that P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept exhibited very similar band profiles, in contrast, the stretching vibration of thiophene rings (≈1465cm−1: CC) underwent a blue shift in P3BT, P3OT, P3DT and P3DDT. The highest value of the real part (ɛ
                     1) of the complex dielectric constant was obtained from P3HT on both indium thin oxide (ITO) and silicon (Si) substrates whereas the imaginary part (ε
                     2) was directly affected by increasing in the alkyl side chain lengths in a frequency range around 3000cm−1. The optical properties of P3PT in the mid-IR region developed an affinity with those of P3HT. Thus, P3PT is particularly a suitable polymer active material candidate for high-performance devices.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Thiophene-based conjugated semiconducting polymers such as regioregular P3ATs (P3BT, P3PT, P3HT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT) have been extensively studied for applications in optoelectronics such as organic field-effect transistors (OFET), organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and organic solar cells. One of the most well-known examples is P3HT as a p-type semiconductor material that has reached a charge carrier mobility of 0.1cm2/Vs [1,2]. In order to improve the mobility of P3HT, investigations on molecular orientations [3,4], crystallization processes [5], various sorts of solvents for a wet process sample preparation [6], and the characteristic effects of doping [7] have been carried out so far. Furthermore, after different alkyl side chain lengths of P3ATs have been developed, correlation of physical and optical properties with the alkyl side chain (C

                     +1) length was analyzed in detail. P3AT/PCBM blend investigations revealed that as the alkyl side chain increased, solubility increased as well as photocurrents in general [8]. Conversely, absorption coefficient reduced as the alkyl side chain length increased due to less interspace between molecules [8]. The hole mobility of P3ATs was determined by output characteristics [9]. In this study, P3HT indicated the highest hole mobility value (1×10−2
                     cm2/Vs) followed by P3BT (1.2×10−3
                     cm2/Vs), P3OT (2.0×10−4
                     cm2/Vs), P3DT (6.6×10−5
                     cm2/Vs), and P3DDT (2.4×10−4
                     cm2/Vs) in virtue of the superlative self-assembling ability. An even–odd effect in number of monomers has been confirmed in poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) and poly(phenylene-vinylene) systems [10], rigid-flexible polymers [11], and alkane thiol monolayers on gold [12]. These investigations revealed that the even–odd effect exceedingly influenced the transition temperatures, the molecular orientation angles, and the chain packing arrangements. Electrical properties of P3PT have been examined in UV and visible regions [13,14]. As a result, P3PT was presumed to be a possible candidate as a p-type semiconductor material since P3PT thin films exhibited a high degree of crystallinity with a π–π stacking distance, d
                     010 of 3.74Å [14] which was very close to that of P3HT (3.8Å) [15].

In this paper, we examined the optical properties of seven regioregular P3ATs with alkyl side chain of C
                        n
                     H2

                     =4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 (P3BT, P3PT, P3HT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT), respectively, by means of FTIR spectroscopy in a frequency range between 800 and 3300cm−1. FTIR spectroscopy provides detailed information of each molecular bonding since absorption/transmission spectra represent the fingerprint of a material along with absorption peaks that are generated by vibrational transitions of atomic bonds. In addition, the dielectric properties of odd-numbered P3hept and P3PT on Si and ITO substrates in the fingerprint region have been derived by the use of IRSE which is a technique that measures the variations in the polarization state of an incident light before and after reflection on a surface of a target material. Hereby accurate film thicknesses of thin films and their complex dielectric functions can be determined. The dielectric function of P3HT (even-numbered) has been derived as well in order to make a comparative study to odd-numbered materials. Moreover the surface roughness of all seven P3AT films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

FTIR spectrometers (Bruker IFS 66 v/S & Vertex 80V) with a Deuterated Triglycine Sulfate (DTGS) detector were used for the measurements of IR spectra (absorbance) in a frequency range between 450 and 5500cm−1. All the absorbance measurements were carried out with a resolution of 4cm−1 and a sample scan time of 1000 scans under a vacuum pressure between 2 and 5mbar.


                        ψ and Δ spectrum measurements were performed in a frequency range between 333 and 6000cm−1 with an angle of incidence of 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70° under normal pressure by a rotating compensator IR ellipsometer from J. A. Woollam Co., Inc. (IR-VASE). In order to obtain the dielectric functions and the precise thickness of a thin film, ψ and Δ measured spectra were fitted based on an optical model by the use of WVASE32 software [37]. Fundamentally, these parameters are related to the Fresnel reflection coefficient rp
                         (p-polarized) and rs
                         (s-polarized) which determines the complex reflectance ratio ρ. Thus the complex reflectance ratio ρ can be described as:

Oscillations of atomic bonds are usually observed in the IR range due to a change in the dipole moment. The optical properties of an isotropic layer can then be expressed as a summation of Lorentzian oscillators

We have acquired commercially available regioregular P3BT, P3PT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT from Rieke Metals Inc. [18], and P3HT (Lisicon SP001; molecular weight (MW) 43600 and regioregularity (RR≈95.9)) from Merck KGaA. It has been reported that solubility and field-effect mobilities of P3HT films were improved by dint of high boiling point (BT) solvents such as 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (BP: 213.5°) and 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (BP: 180°) due to progress of self-assembly [6,19]. Thus we selected 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (Merck KGaA) as a solvent for this investigation. Weight ratio percentage concentration of all the solutions was fixed to 2%. The solutions were placed on a hot plate with a temperature between 60 and 70°C for 30min so as to dissolve them thoroughly. All samples were prepared by spin coating process (SPS Europe: SPIN150-NPP) at rotation speed of 4000rpm on Si wafers and ITO coated glass substrates (SiO2 barrier coating was applied on polished soda lime float glass, and the ITO, resistance 7Ω/sq, was deposited on it, VisionTek Systems Ltd. for both FTIR and IRSE measurements. As additional information, Drude metal modeling was employed for fitting the optical data of the ITO coated glass substrates.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

Absorbance spectra of P3BT, P3PT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT in the frequency range between 800 and 3300cm−1 are shown in Fig. 1
                        . Strong molecular absorption bands can be seen in the frequency range between 800 and 1600cm−1 and 2800 and 3100cm−1. The films were fabricated nearly equivalent in thickness (≈66±2nm) so as to compare the absorption strength of each sample. Table 1
                         summarizes the characteristic mid-IR bands of 7 materials, and the film thickness of each film is described in Table 2
                        . The film thickness was determined by use of a Dektak (Veeco Dektak 150) and IRSE for Si and ITO substrates, respectively. The stretching vibrations of the thiophene rings were detected in the frequency range between 819 and 834cm−1 
                        [28]. The absorption peak around 1378cm−1 was contributed by the methyl deformation [29]. The symmetric CC stretching vibration bands of the thiophene rings were shown in the range between 1456 and 1467cm−1 
                        [28]. On the other hand, the antisymmetric CC stretching vibration bands of the rings appeared around 1510cm−1 
                        [28]. These four absorption bands were related to the stretching vibration modes of the thiophene rings, and the symmetric CC vibration band around 1465cm−1 underwent a blue shift in P3BT, P3OT, P3DT and P3DDT compared with the P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept. In addition, P3PT was the one to show the strongest absorption peaks at 819 and 1456cm−1 among all those 7 materials. Absorption peaks located between 2800 and 3000cm−1 were contributed from the alkyl side chains. Absorptions around 2855 and 2925cm−1 were caused by the symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 stretching vibrations, respectively [30]. The antisymmetric CH3 stretching vibration band took place around 2956cm−1 
                        [30] whereas the absorption peak around 3056cm−1 was associated with the CH stretching vibration band of the thiophene rings [28]. Systematic and unsystematic changes in the vibrational modes corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 as well as the antisymmetric CH3 were observed as the alkyl side chain length was varied as shown in Fig. 1. A systematic red

                         shift of both symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 stretching vibration bands was observed as the alkyl side chain length increased. Unlike the systematic peak shifts, unsystematic tendencies have emerged from this frequency region with respect to the absorption strength. P3BT<P3hept<P3HT<P3PT<P3DT<P3OT<P3DDT is designated in order of increasing the absorption strength of both symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 stretching vibration bands as well as P3BT<P3PT<P3HT<P3OT<P3hept<P3DT<P3DDT for the antisymmetric CH3 stretching ones. Both symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 stretching bands of P3DDT were approximately a factor of 3 stronger than those of P3BT. In any cases, P3BT indicated the lowest absorption strength whereas the strongest one was obtained from P3DDT. Additionally, a clear shoulder was able to be seen at slightly higher wavenumbers (around 2869cm−1) in contrast to the symmetric CH2 stretching vibration band. This shoulder correlated with the antisymmetric CH3 stretching vibration and diminishes as the alkyl side chain length increased. Thus it directly reflected to the absorption strength around 2955cm−1. The absorption strength was not influenced by the alkyl side chain length systematically in the chain length between n
                        =5 (P3PT) and n
                        =10 (P3DDT).

The degree of crystallinity strongly depends on the spin speed. Higher crystallinity as well as low defects in its crystal system can be achieved with a slower evaporation rate in general [31,32]. Yazawa et al. reported that the CH out-of-plane vibration mode located in the frequency region between 850cm−1 and 800cm−1 is delicately influenced by the crystalline structure [33]. As shown in Fig. 1, the absorption peak contributed by the CH out-of-plane vibration of P3PT in particular is rather prominent compared with that of other P3AT samples. Although the high spin speed (4000rpm) was applied for the film fabrication, the evaporation rate was not so high due to the use of high BT solvent. Thus some P3AT samples in the remaining solvent could have enough time to extent local crystallinity. Especially, a net shear force (the centrifugal forces (outward) and the surface tension (inward)) with regard to the polymer chain is strong enough to stretch the chains from tangled condition [34]. Therefore, P3AT samples with relatively shorter side chain lengths might show the slightly higher absorption peaks.

We performed density functional theory (DFT) monomer calculations for these seven samples by making use of Gaussian 09W with the B3LYP functional and a 6-31G basis set as well. The peak positions of the thiophene ring vibration bands were reproduced well by the DFT calculations compared to those of the alkyl side chain vibration bands which underwent a blue shift in the DFT simulations. The difference between the DFT and the measured spectra might be caused by a disparity in the number of molecules constituting a thin layer together with molecular orientation. The molecular orientation in the experiments is influenced by many factors such as type of solvent [19], surface roughness of substrate [20,21], and substrate surface treatment e.g. metal deposition [22] which directly reflect IR band profiles. In addition, the morphology of each molecule is closely related to interactions and molecular structures. In the visible region, an average tilt angle of the electronic transition dipole moment with respect to the substrate surface normal can be inspected. For example, the absorption peak from the CC π
                        * transition shows a clear systematic change with the incident angle which governs the average conjugated plane orientation. The π
                        * orbital extends orthogonally to the π-conjugated plane of P3HT, for instance; therefore, the P3HT takes an “edge-on” orientation [30]. On the other hand, the degree of molecular orientation of each segment by the use of polarized light can be investigated with vibrational spectroscopy in mid-IR spectral region as shown in Fig. 1. Applying the ratio of the absorbance peaks (Ap
                        /As
                        ) measured by both p- and s-polarized light at Brewster angle of substrate, the molecular orientation of each fragment can be determined [30]. The tilt angles of P3HT films fabricated by spin-casting with different sorts of solvents were between 57° and 60° as well as 59° by drop-cast P3HT film [32]. Likewise, Hao et al. took the thiophene ring orientation into account, and the measured average tilt angles of P3HT films were reported as 62°, 72°, and 70° for a spin coating process with high rotating speed, low speed, and dip coating, respectively [35,36]. Detailed analysis of molecular orientations of each P3AT samples should be a next task for further investigations.

Throughout the whole frequency range, we perceived that P3PT, P3HT, and P3hep resembled each other closely in mid-IR band profiles, particularly, the absorption peak positions due to the thiophene ring stretching vibrations.

By the FTIR spectroscopic absorbance measurements of P3AT samples, we have detected a great similarity among the mid-IR band profiles of P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept. Thus a further study of these three samples has been performed for revealing the optical properties in detail by means of IRSE. Variable angle measurements did not reveal any anisotropic behavior. An isotropic complex dielectric function was derived from measured ψ and Δ spectra for the real and imaginary parts of P3PT, P3HT and P3hept on Si and ITO substrates, see Fig. 2
                        . The real part of the dielectric function (ε
                        1) of every layer on ITO substrates was approximately 10–17% higher than in the case of Si substrates. Additionally, the real part of the highest dielectric constant was obtained from P3HT with both Si (3.46) and ITO (3.79) substrates. Maximum values ε
                        1 are reached for maximum in oscillator strength as well as ε
                        ∞. On the other hand, the CH2 antisymmetric stretching absorption (around 2925cm−1) was enhanced as the alkyl side chain length increased; thus the imaginary part (ε
                        2) of the dielectric constant of P3hept appeared stronger than in the case of P3PT and P3HT on ITO substrate. However, this tendency could not be applied to the Si substrate case. The imaginary part of the dielectric function of P3hept was the weakest among them. The cause of this discrepancy may come from the substrate material type and surface roughness of the substrate which controls the molecular orientation (e.g. molecular angles) of the samples. The relative peak heights or strengths (Figs. 1 and 2) indicate the disparity in molecular orientation on ITO and Si substrates. In comparison to the absorption strengths due to methyl deformation of P3hept on Si (Fig. 1) and ITO (Fig. 2f) substrates, it is clearly seen that this vibration dipole is more perpendicular to ITO substrate. In order to improve the strength of absorption, a degree of self-assembly is one of important factors [23]. Particularly solution-processed thin layers strongly depend on the kind of molecule used and solvents as well as that compatibility with substrates [24,25].

There is a correlation among the film thickness, surface roughness, and crystallinity which directly reflects dielectric properties. A study of thin polymer films (parylene C(C8H7Cl)
                           n
                        ) demonstrated that the film roughness was decreased in a semicrystalline material as the film crystallinity diminished [26] whereas the X-ray and electron diffraction patterns clarified the higher degree of edge-on orientation of the P3AT polymer crystal formation with a reduction in the alkyl side chain length which provided higher mobility than in the case of plane-on orientation [27]. This disparity in the orientation affects the surface roughness. If the longer alkyl side chains are oriented perpendicular to a substrate, the surface roughness should increase more than the shorter chains. Our AFM (Newport Multimode™ Model 401) topography analysis shown in Fig. 3
                         revealed that the surface roughness was decreased with increasing in the alkyl side chain length except the shortest (P3BT) and longest (P3DDT) alkyl side chain cases. The surface roughness (the root mean square average, Rq
                        ) value of P3AT films on ITO substrates was higher than that of the films on Si substrates (Table 2). Rq
                         values of P3PT on Si substrate (5.77nm) and P3HT on ITO substrate (9.47nm) indicated the highest values compared to other P3AT samples which had the surface roughness of less than 2.2nm. A principle cause is related to the solubility which controls the undissolved residuals of the polymer samples in solvent. In fact, the solubility of polymers was enhanced with increasing in the alkyl side chain length [8]. The topography images exhibited some high spots which could be associated with the undissolved remnants in the solvent.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have investigated the optical properties of P3AT thin films with various alkyl side chain lengths (C
                        n
                     H2
                     
                        n

                     =4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12) by dint of FTIR spectroscopy and IRSE in a frequency range between 450 and 5500cm−1. This experimental approaches revealed that a blue shift of the stretching vibration of the thiophene ring (≈1465cm−1: CC) was observed in P3BT, P3OT, P3DT and P3DDT compared to P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept whereas P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept thin layers exhibited very similar band profiles. A systematic red shift of both symmetric and antisymmetric CH2 stretching vibration bands in the frequency range between 2920 and 2955cm−1 was detected and unsystematic tendencies appeared concerning the absorption strength with increasing in the alkyl side chain length. With respect to the surface roughness of each sample, it decreased sharply from the alkyl side chain n
                     =4 (P3hept) up to n
                     =12 (P3DDT). via the IRSE measurements, the highest value of the real part of the dielectric function (ε
                     1) was derived by ψ and Δ spectra of P3HT on both Si and ITO substrate cases. On the other hand, the imaginary part (ε
                     2) of the complex dielectric function in frequency around 3000cm−1 augmented with increasing in alkyl side chain length. The dielectric properties of P3PT in the mid-IR region developed a resemblance with those of P3HT. P3PT can be a promising candidate material in order to improve the performance of organic electronic devices.
