                  A directed network game of imperfect strategic substitutes with heterogeneous players is analyzed. We consider concave additive separable utility functions that encompass the quasi-linear ones. It is found that pure strategy Nash equilibria verify a non-linear complementarity problem. By requiring appropriate concavity in the utility functions, the existence of an equilibrium point is shown and equilibrium uniqueness is established with a P-matrix. For this reason, it appears that previous findings on network structure and sparsity hold for many more games.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It has been found that the linear complementarity problem (henceforth LCP) is a fundamental mathematical problem associated with major economic problems such as linear and quadratic programming problems, bimatrix game problems, as well as more general equilibrium problems (Cottle et al., 1992). In the present paper, we are interested in a new application of a complementarity problem: finding a Nash equilibrium in network game problems. A particularity of this class of games is that an action of a player affects the marginal payoff of her neighbors, i.e., a player’s payoff depends on personal effort as well as on the efforts exerted by her neighbors (Jackson, 2008).

Specifically, we concentrate on network games where efforts are strategic substitutes, in other words, where an increase in one player’s strategy makes the best response of her neighbors decrease.

                        This outcome may arise in local public goods games (i.e., games with positive externalities), when the players in a neighborhood have an incentive to “free-ride” (Allouch, 2012; Ballester and Calvó-Armengol, 2010; Bramoullé and Kranton, 2007; Bramoullé et al., 2011; Bloch and Zenginobuz, 2007; Corbo et al., 2007; Galeotti et al., 2010), or in games of common property resources (i.e., games with negative externalities), when the players have an incentive to consume more resource than the efficient level (Ilkiliç, 2010; Johari and Tsitsiklis, 2004; Rébillé and Richefort, 2012).

                      The literature in this area has focused on games where preferences are quasi-linear and Nash equilibria in pure strategies (henceforth PSNE) exist. The analysis of equilibrium uniqueness is then achieved by studying the following LCP (Ballester and Calvó-Armengol, 2010; Corbo et al., 2007).

                     where the symbol ⩾ (resp. ≫) means that each component is greater than or equal (resp. greater), the superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix or a vector, and I stands for the identity matrix. The first inequality checks whether the sum between a player’s own effort and the effort exerted by her predecessors is not less than her peak. The second equality states that a player exerts no effort if the total effort exerted by her predecessors is equal or higher than her peak.

In such games, sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of PSNE have been established with I
                     +
                     Λ belonging to particular classes of matrices, and have then be related to certain eigenvalues of Λ: the largest eigenvalue (or spectral radius) (Ballester and Calvó-Armengol, 2010; Ballester et al., 2006; Corbo et al., 2007) and the lowest eigenvalue (Allouch, 2012; Bramoullé et al., 2011). The eigenvalues of a network adjacency matrix carry details about local structural properties of networks (Cvetković et al., 1997). There are two main results. First, using the Perron-Frobenius theory of non-negative matrices, it has been found that equilibrium uniqueness is guaranteed for all e
                     ∗
                     ≫
                     0 whenever the spectral radius of Λ is sufficiently low (Ballester and Calvó-Armengol, 2010). This condition derives from contraction of the best response functions and holds for directed and undirected networks. It states that there exists a unique equilibrium point whenever the density of the link structure is sufficiently low.

Second, using the theory of potential games and spectral graph theory, a sharper condition has been found: the LCP specified by (1) admits a unique solution for all e
                     ∗
                     ≫
                     0 if the lowest eigenvalue of Λ is sufficiently high (Bramoullé et al., 2011). This result provides the best known sufficient condition for the uniqueness of PSNE in these games (when the spectral radius is sufficiently low, the lowest eigenvalue is sufficiently high, but not vice versa). It implies that there exists a unique equilibrium point whenever the sparsity of the link structure is sufficiently high. This result is, however, based on two important assumptions: (i) the network is undirected, i.e., Λ is symmetric, and (ii) best response functions are piece-wise linear. In fact, there have been few attempts to establish uniqueness when best response functions are non-linear, and all of them have considered the case of undirected networks, a special case of directed networks (Allouch, 2012; Bramoullé et al., 2011).

The present paper tackles the problem of equilibrium uniqueness in directed network games of imperfect strategic substitutes with non-linear best response functions. The focus here is on concave additive separable utility functions that encompass the quasi-linear ones. Firstly, we find that PSNE are characterized by a complementarity problem that extends the problem specified by (1). Secondly, by requiring appropriate concavity in the utility functions, the existence of a PSNE is shown. Then, using the methodology introduced by Rosen (1965) for concave games, we establish the uniqueness of PSNE with a P-matrix
                        3
                        A formal definition of P-matrix is given in Section 4.
                     
                     
                        3
                      (Fiedler and Pták, 1962). As a corollary, it appears that previous findings related to network structure and sparsity (see Bramoullé et al., 2011) are true for more general preferences, and therefore for many more games.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the game. Sections 3 and 4 establish equilibrium existence and equilibrium uniqueness, respectively. Section 5 describes the relationship between uniqueness and network sparsity. Section 6 presents two main applications of the model and extends the analysis in two directions. Section 7 sets out the conclusions. Note that all vectors considered in this paper are column vectors, and are denoted by lowercase bold letters. We reserve the use of uppercase bold letters for matrices.

                     ∈[0, ∞) denotes the intensity of the link from player k to player l. We may interpret it as the rate of substitution from player k’s effort to player l’s effort (by convention, λ

Henceforth, we shall consider preferences that admit an additive separable utility representation with respect to individual effort and collective effort.

Assumption A1 implies that under autarky (i.e., if the network is empty) the agent will provide some effort, otherwise in any network she will free-ride (we do not assume, however, that preferences are monotonic). Assumption A2 implies that the preferences are single-peaked w.r.t. individual effort for any given level of collective effort and allows a trade-off between individual and collective effort. Assumption A3 reflects the convexity of preferences.

We assume that the strategy of utility-maximizing individual effort involves a simultaneous-move game

The next section presents sufficient conditions pertaining to the existence of a solution to the problem specified by (2).

In games where PSNE are characterized by the LCP specified by (1), the proof of equilibrium existence is straightforward in that the set of individual best responses defines a piece-wise linear mapping from a convex compact subset of a Euclidean space into itself, and the existence of an equilibrium point is guaranteed. Establishing the existence of a solution to the complementarity problem specified by (2) is less immediate. To achieve this objective, we follow an analytic approach to check whether the best response of each agent satisfies the hypothesis of Brouwer’s Fix Point Theorem. We obtain the following result.

                            are continuous for all l. According to Brouwer’s Fix Point Theorem, B admits a fix point e and e is a PSNE of the network game 
                              
                                 G
                              
                            by construction.

The next section focuses on the special case of a unique PSNE to the game 
                        
                           G
                        
                     . Following Cottle et al. (1992)’s terminology, we describe a global uniqueness result
                        6
                        By contrast, Bramoullé et al. (2011) present a local uniqueness result since their proof, based on Taylor approximation of best responses, provides conditions under which a given equilibrium is the only equilibrium in one of its neighborhoods.
                     
                     
                        6
                      as we provide conditions under which the solvable complementarity problem specified by (2) provides only one solution. Henceforth, we assume that A1, A2 and A3 are satisfied.

It is well known that matrix classes play a paramount role in the theory of the LCP. One of the most fundamental classes is that consisting of P-matrices.
                        7
                        
                           Cottle et al. (1992) defines the traditional LCP as follows. Given

                           It is well known that the above LCP provides a unique solution for all vectors q if and only if M is a P-matrix (Samelson et al., 1958). See also Theorem 3.3.7 in Cottle et al. (1992, p. 148).

                      In this section, we establish the uniqueness of solutions to the complementarity problem specified by (2) with such a matrix. Let us introduce the class of P-matrices.

                        Let M be a real matrix. Then, M is said to be a P-matrix if all its principal minors are positive.

An essential feature of P-matrix is that it does not reverse the sign of any non-zero vector, i.e.,

To establish equilibrium uniqueness, we follow the analytic approach introduced by Rosen (1965) for proving uniqueness in concave games. We obtain the following result.

It is worth noting that our uniqueness result carries over one change in the technical assumptions.

When best response functions are piece-wise linear, the uniqueness of PSNE is traditionally related to the largest and the lowest eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrix in order to obtain information on the typical link structures that yield a unique equilibrium (Allouch, 2012; Ballester and Calvó-Armengol, 2010; Ballester et al., 2006; Bramoullé et al., 2011).
                        9
                        There is an extensive literature in algebraic graph theory that studies the properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of adjacency matrices associated with a graph. One fundamental result implies that any graph is completely determined by its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. See Chapter 2 in Cvetović et al. (1997).

When the network is directed, the adjacency matrix is asymmetric and its eigenvalues are generally complex numbers. By Theorem (3,3) of Fiedler and Pták (1962), the uniqueness condition we established with a P-matrix may be related to the lowest real eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix and its principal submatrices. This means the game 
                        
                           G
                        
                      admits a unique PSNE if the lowest real eigenvalue of Λ and its principal submatrices is sufficiently high. To our knowledge, however, there is no result that establishes a relationship between structural properties of directed networks and the lowest real eigenvalue of their associated adjacency matrix. Previous works on the spectra of directed network adjacency matrices have essentially focused on the spectral radius of adjacency matrices (Brualdi, 2010).

When the network is undirected or acyclic, there are substantial improvements. We provide two results related to these particular link structures. The first concerns undirected networks and extends Bramoullé et al.’s (2011) result to the case of additive separable preferences. A network is undirected if and only if its adjacency matrix is symmetric. Since real symmetric matrices are Hermitian, they do not admit complex eigenvalues. Let μ
                     
                        min
                     (Λ) be the lowest eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix. We obtain the following result.

                            is a P-matrix. So, by Theorem 2, 
                              
                                 G
                              
                            admits a unique PSNE. □

The lowest eigenvalue of a symmetric and non-negative adjacency matrix is a standard measure of the sparsity of the network (see, e.g., Bell et al., 2008). The higher the lowest eigenvalue, the sparser the network. Then, Corollary 1 states that the game 
                        
                           G
                        
                      admits a unique PSNE whenever the network is sufficiently sparse.

The next result concerns acyclic networks. A typical example is a river network where links represent flows of water (Ambec and Sprumont, 2002). It is well known that a triangular matrix is a P-matrix if and only if all its diagonal entries are strictly positive.
                        10
                        This is due to the fact that every principal minor of a triangular matrix equals a product of diagonal elements.

                      Since a network adjacency matrix is similar to a triangular matrix if and only if the network is acyclic, we obtain the following result.

Let Λ be an acyclic network adjacency matrix. Therefore, Λ is similar to a triangular matrix with diagonal entries equal to zero and all of its eigenvalues are zero. Thus, all the eigenvalues of

Simultaneous-move games have many applications in management sciences, ranging from production and inventory management to finance (Wang and Parlar, 1989). The model developped in this paper belongs to a particular class of games: social dilemma games.

                      a concave benefit function. This particular benefit function underpins the idea that players enjoy a benefit from the contribution of their neighbors, and that the value of the public good has a physical restriction; while convex costs lend credence to the idea that players allocate their income between their contribution to the local public good and their private good consumption (see, e.g., Bergstrom et al., 1986).

Then, it would be pertinent to derive a structural solution to the above system of equalities. This is another open issue.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have explored a wide class of network games with additive separable preferences that yield non-linear best response functions. This class of games encompasses various well known games including the voluntary contribution of local public goods (Bramoullé and Kranton, 2007; Bramoullé et al., 2011; Bloch and Zenginobuz, 2007) and the non-cooperative allocation of common property resources (Ilkiliç, 2010; Johari and Tsitsiklis, 2004; Rébillé and Richefort, 2012). Our findings further develop certain known existence and uniqueness results for a wider class of preferences and for more general network structures.

Our analysis can assist certain research areas. Firstly, it can serve as a basis for building applied models that would be less general, e.g., with quadratic concave and convex functions, but in which the existence of a unique PSNE would be guaranteed and could be more easily characterized. Secondly, certain experimental investigations could be performed in order to construct a utility function for each player based on behavior in the game, to make predictions from the utility curves about individual behavior towards different social structures, and to test the predictions by examining subsequent behavior towards different social structures. Finally, given that we know sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique PSNE, it would also be pertinent to study an endogenous network formation game of strategic substitutes, based on comparative statics.
