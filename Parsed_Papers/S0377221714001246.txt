                  A key issue in applying multi-attribute project portfolio models is specifying the baseline value – a parameter which defines how valuable not implementing a project is relative to the range of possible project values. In this paper we present novel baseline value specification techniques which admit incomplete preference statements and, unlike existing techniques, make it possible to model problems where the decision maker would prefer to implement a project with the least preferred performance level in each attribute. Furthermore, we develop computational methods for identifying the optimal portfolios and the value-to-cost -based project rankings for all baseline values. We also show how these results can be used to (i) analyze how sensitive project and portfolio decision recommendations are to variations in the baseline value and (ii) provide project decision recommendations in a situation where only incomplete information about the baseline value is available.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Organizations recurrently need to decide which of the available project proposals are implemented with the limited resources available. Plenty of methodological and applied research on how mathematical modeling and optimization can be used to support such decisions has been carried out under titles such as project portfolio selection, resource allocation and, most recently, portfolio decision analysis (for surveys see Kleinmuntz, 2007; Salo, Keisler, & Morton, 2011). Perhaps the most widely used approach for capturing multiple objectives is the linear-additive portfolio value model (Golabi, Kirkwood, & Sicherman, 1981), in which an additive value function aggregates the projects’ attribute-specific performances into an overall project value, and the portfolio value is the sum of those projects’ overall values that are included in the portfolio. This portfolio value can then be maximized subject to resource constraints using standard integer linear programming (ILP) techniques. Indeed, a lot of high impact applications of the linear-additive model have been reported in the literature (see, e.g., Ewing, Tarantino, & Parnell, 2006; Brown, Dell, & Newman, 2004; Kleinmuntz, 2007; Könnölä, Brummer, & Salo, 2007; Montibeller, Franco, Lord, & Inglesias, 2009).

Recently, Clemen and Smith (2009) highlighted that the results given by the linear-additive model depend on the baseline value, i.e., a model parameter that defines the value associated with the alternative that a project is not implemented (see also Morton, 2010). Although this issue was discussed already in the seminal paper of Golabi et al. (1981), Clemen and Smith (2009) found several applications in which the linear-additive portfolio value function has been used without the term that captures the value difference between implementing a project with the least preferred performance in each attribute and not implementing any project at all. Furthermore, they demonstrated how such a practice can lead to a value model in which implementing a very risky project with a negative cash flow and a poor fit to the company’s strategy would be preferred to the alternative of not implementing it. Even if such a project candidate did not exist, the baseline value can affect the decision recommendations for projects which are worth implementing, i.e., whose values are greater than the baseline value.

While the existing literature has recognized the importance of the baseline value in applications of linear-additive portfolio value model, the tools available for specification and analysis of the baseline value are limited. First, existing approaches for specifying the baseline value assume not implementing a project to be at least as preferred as implementing a project with the least preferred performance level on each attribute (Golabi et al., 1981; Clemen & Smith, 2009). Second, these methods require the decision-maker (DM) to precisely specify a hypothetical project such that he is indifferent between implementing and not implementing it. Hence, these approaches cannot harness ordinal preference, although giving ordinal preference statements can be more easy for DMs (see Weber, 1987; Moshkovich, Mechitov, & Olson, 2002; Punkka & Salo, 2013). Finally, the current literature offers no computational tools for conducting sensitivity analysis with regard to the baseline value even though methods for analysing sensitivity with regard to other parameters (e.g., Liesiö, Mild, & Salo, 2007, 2008; Lourenço, Morton, & Bana e Costa, 2012; Greco, Matarazzo, & Slowiński, 2013) have found use in applications (Lindstedt, Liesiö, & Salo, 2008; Grushka-Cockayne, De Reyck, & Degraeve, 2008; Toppila, Liesiö, & Salo, 2011; Liesiö & Salo, 2012).

Motivated by these observations, this paper develops (i) baseline value specification techniques which are based on ordinal comparisons of project portfolios and (ii) computational tools for analyzing how sensitive the decision recommendations given by the linear-additive portfolio value model are to the baseline value. The developed specification techniques produce an interval or a point estimate for the baseline value, depending on how precisely the DM can or is willing to answer questions about her preferences between project portfolios. Unlike the methods proposed in the literature (Golabi et al., 1981; Clemen & Smith, 2009), these methods are applicable also in situations where implementing a project with least preferred performance level in each attribute is preferred to the alternative of not implementing it. The developed computational tools identify portfolios that are optimal for some interval of baseline values and the projects’ possible value-to-cost ratio rankings. In cases where the baseline value is precisely specified, these tools make it possible to conduct sensitivity analysis on the baseline value. Furthermore, the paper reports a simulation experiment, in which the decision recommendations are computed for randomly generated problem instances to get insights on how sensitive the results of a linear-additive portfolio value model are to baseline value specification in general.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section ‘Linear-Additive Portfolio Value’ introduces the linear-additive portfolio model and reviews the role of the baseline value in this model. Section ‘General Methods for Baseline Value Specification’ develops general techniques for baseline value specification. Sections ‘Potentially Optimal Portfolios and Projects’ Value-to-Cost Rankings’ develop the computational tools for identifying the potentially optimal portfolios and possible project value-to-cost rankings, respectively. Section ‘Discussion’ discusses the implications of the developed methods to portfolio decision analysis practice, and Section ‘Conclusions’ presents some concluding remarks.

                      is the cost of the jth project. In general, there can be multiple linear constraints in (3) which make it possible to model, for instance, alternative implementation modes of projects, cost synergies, several resource types or scheduling projects over multiple time periods (see, e.g., Stummer & Heidenberger, 2003; Liesiö, Mild, & Salo, 2008). To maintain the generality of the results, we use

                         and as a result the optimal portfolio that maximizes (3) includes projects B, C, D, E and H. However, it seems counter-intuitive that not implementing a project is equally preferred to implementing a risky project with negative financial contribution that does not even fit the company strategy.

In their application, Golabi et al. (1981) recognized this problem and asked the DM to define the project performance

Existing techniques for specifying the baseline value require that the DM chooses a vector of performance levels such that she is indifferent between implementing and not implementing a project with such performance. However, if the DM would prefer to implement any project with performances in

This can happen, for example, in applications where the project proposals are pre-screened and only proposals with at least satisfactory quality are evaluated with the multi-attribute value model. Hence, the measurement scales used in the model do not necessarily include levels that would capture the performance of a low quality project which the DM would not implement. As an example, consider selecting projects to improve the water quality in a river by considering two attributes: the number of riverside houses whose recreational use of the river is improved by the project (

The methods developed here can be applied in settings, in which the DM would prefer to implement any project with performance in

                     . Furthermore, these methods allow the DM to give ordinal statements, i.e., one alternative is preferred to another, rather than forcing her to adjust the alternatives until she is indifferent between the two. Such ordinal statements are transformed to constraints on the baseline value 
                        
                           
                              
                                 v

                     .

The first step is to determine whether the DM would implement a project with performance

                     , i.e., the least preferred performance in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 1

                           …

                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                     . If she prefers not to implement 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        
                     , then she can be presented with a list of better project performance vectors such that each vector dominates the next one. She is then asked to go through the list and find the last project on the list that she would implement. In the CBAA example, the DM could be presented with the three project performance vectors

                     ), a more precise estimate for the baseline value can also be obtained by comparing preferences between implementing a project and a change in the project’s performance (Morton, 2010). This approach avoids the need to compare portfolios consisting of multiple projects, but in turn requires that the DM answers questions concerning the strength of preference (see Dyer & Sarin, 1979 for formal axiomatization). First, the DM is asked to consider the value increase associated with implementing a project with performance

                      contain equally many projects, then the left-hand side of the inequality becomes zero and hence the comparison does not restrict the baseline value.

In this section we develop methods to analyze how the optimal portfolio changes as a function of the baseline value. Rather than focusing on some interval of baseline values established with the techniques of Section ‘General Methods for Baseline Value Specification’, we analyze the entire range of possible baseline values 
                        
                           (
                           -
                           ∞
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                        
                     . Based on this analysis, identifying portfolios that are optimal on some specific interval is then straightforward. Furthermore, such analysis can even be carried before the baseline specification and its results used in designing the baseline specification questions. These alternative modes of using the developed methods in decision support will be discussed in more detail in Section ‘Discussion’.

Specifically, the aim is to identify for each baseline value

Our approach for solving the potentially optimal portfolios and their optimality ranges is based on the observation that the number of projects a portfolio contains determines the relative location of its optimality range (assuming it is nonempty). For instance, in Fig. 1 the number of projects included in the potentially optimal portfolio decreases as the baseline value 
                        
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        
                      increases. Furthermore, if two portfolios are optimal for some baseline value(s) and contain the same number of projects, then the values of these portfolios are equal for all baseline values and hence their optimality ranges are identical. These properties are formalized in the following lemma, where

The value difference of two portfolios of the same size does not depend on the baseline value. Hence, any potentially optimal portfolio must have the highest value among all feasible portfolios that contain equally many projects.

                     Lemmas 1 and 2 imply that if the number of projects to be included in the portfolio is fixed, then the baseline value does not affect the decision recommendations. This result is in line with the existing literature; in their seminal paper Golabi et al. (1981) motivate the need for baseline value specification with the observation that the number of projects may vary across the feasible portfolios. This result has also practical implications: in some applications the size of the portfolio is constrained only by the number of projects included in the portfolio and hence specification of the baseline value is not required. For example, when selecting a portfolio of ‘less tangible’ project ideas or topics for further development, the projects’ costs are often unknown and the portfolio size serves as a proxy for the number of ideas the organization can refine into concrete project proposals (see, e.g., Könnölä et al., 2007; Punkka & Salo, 2014).


                     Lemmas 1 and 2 suggest the following algorithm for identifying the potentially optimal portfolios and their optimality ranges. In the first phase, the algorithm considers feasible portfolios of each size k and solves those that have maximal value (denoted by 
                        
                           Z

                           k
                           )
                        
                     ) for some chosen baseline, say 
                        
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . Although Lemma 2 shows that no potentially optimal portfolio will be missed by this technique, often there is no need to consider all portfolio sizes between 0 and m. First, portfolios containing a large number of projects are usually infeasible due to, for example, budget constraints. Hence, the maximum number of projects a feasible portfolio can contain (denoted by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 k

                     ) – which can be solved from a simple ILP problem – implies an upper bound for the size of a potentially optimal portfolio. Second, Lemma 1 suggests that the smallest potentially optimal portfolio will have an optimality range that includes the baseline value

                     , wherefore the algorithm solves the feasible portfolios that maximize

                     . According to Lemma 1 only the largest one of these will have an optimality range that contains baseline values

In this section we seek to identify circumstances in which a ‘small’ change in the baseline value is ‘likely’ to change the decision recommendations given by the linear-additive portfolio value model. For this purpose we solve the potentially optimal portfolios for a large number of randomly generated instances of problem (3) with varying number of projects, budget and correlation between the projects’ values and costs.

More specifically, we consider problem instances with 
                           
                              m

                         projects. Both the projects’ values and the costs have uniform marginal distributions and the joint (cumulative) distribution is a Gaussian copula (see, e.g., McNeil, Rudiger, & Embrechts, 2005) with the correlation coefficient

                         illustrates random samples of projects’ values and costs for different values of the correlation coefficient. The budget B is set equal to 25%, 50% or 75% of the sum of the projects’ costs

                        . Altogether there are thus 27 different combinations of parameters

                        . For each combination, the potentially optimal portfolios are solved for 100 randomly generated problem instances.

The simulation results are presented in Table 2
                         where each of the 27 rows contains average results for one parameter combination. The results include the average solution time

                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                         whose value depends on the baseline value). The algorithm seems to have a reasonable running time, with longest computation times recorded in instances with a high number of projects and high correlation between the projects’ costs and values. This is not surprising, as solving the ILP problems takes some 98% of the total solution time and it is well known that ILP problems become more difficult to solve as the number of decision variables grows and the correlation between the objective function and the constraint coefficients increases (e.g., Martello & Toth, 1990).

The results indicate that the number of potentially optimal portfolios increases when the number of projects and the budget increase, or the correlation between the projects’ values and cost decreases. The number of projects is the main determinant of the number of potentially optimal portfolios. This is possibly because the number of feasible portfolios increases exponentially in the number of projects. Of the three budgets considered, the number of potentially optimal portfolios is the greatest when the budget is sufficient to fund some 75% of the projects. This can be explained by the fact that the number of potentially optimal portfolios is bounded from above by the maximum number of projects that can be afforded with the budget (see Lemmas 1 and 2). Out of the three parameters, the correlation between the projects’ values and costs seems to have the smallest effect on the number of potentially optimal portfolios. Overall these observations are in line with the theoretical results and thus lend support to the correctness of the simulation experiment.

                         illustrates how the optimality ranges of the potentially optimal portfolios are located. More specifically, the figure shows the share of potentially optimal portfolios that have an optimality range intersecting each baseline value interval

                        . These shares are averages over all the 2700 random instances. Clearly, portfolios that are optimal for low baseline values have wider optimality ranges than those that are optimal for high baseline values.

These findings support to the main argument of Clemen and Smith (2009), that the choice of the baseline value should be carefully considered as it virtually always affects the decision recommendations. The decision recommendations are most sensitive when the baseline value is between zero and one; in such cases however, specifying a relatively narrow interval for the baseline value is quite straightforward, because it is derived from statements on whether a project in

                         is worth implementing (see Section ‘General Methods for Baseline Value Specification’). On average there are also multiple potentially optimal portfolios whose optimality ranges are subsets of the interval

                        . However, in this case the DM can specify the baseline value by comparing the strength of preference between implementing a project and improving its performance, or by making ordinal comparisons of portfolios containing at most two projects. Finally, if the baseline value is below 
                           
                              -

                        , the DM needs to compare portfolios with more than two projects. However, determining a narrow baseline value interval is often unnecessary for reaching a single optimal portfolio, because in this case the optimality ranges of the potentially optimal portfolios are relatively wide.

                      (e.g., Kirkwood, 1997; Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007). Intuitively, a project with a high value-to-cost ratio uses resources more efficiently than a project with a lower ratio. Such prioritization can be particularly useful, because it does not require precise specification of the available budget B and hence the budget can be treated as a ‘soft constraint’, or as one of the decision variables (e.g., Kleinmuntz & Kleinmuntz, 1999; Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007; Liesiö et al., 2008; Punkka & Salo, 2014).

As such, this approach implicitly assumes that the value of not implementing a project is zero. The non-zero baseline value can be taken into account by subtracting it from the numerator. However, negative ratios do not serve as basis for prioritisation since implementing a project with a negative ratio would reduce the portfolio value. Hence, we use here a modified value-to-cost ratio, defined for project

                     Value-to-cost ratio (5) works as a project prioritization rule, because selecting projects into a portfolio in a descending order of positive VCRs always results in a portfolio that makes optimal use of the consumed resources. This property is formalized by the following lemma.

Different baseline values usually lead to different prioritization of the projects. For instance, in the CBAA example Project B has the highest VCR for a wide range of baseline values, but projects C and D have a higher VCR when

                     ). Since the VCR of any project is zero when the baseline value exceeds the project’s value, the relative order of two projects

unequal for all baseline values in S, in which case one project has a strictly higher VCR than the other for all baseline values in S (cf. projects A and F in Fig. 4), or

Property (ii) implies that VCR is consistent with dominance: if one of two projects is less expensive and has a higher value, then it has a strictly higher VCR for any baseline value in S. This is illustrated also in the CBAA example in Fig. 4: project B is the least expensive one, but its value is the third highest after projects C and D. Hence, project B has a higher VCR than projects A, E, F, G and H for any baseline value in S.

To extend the analysis from two to m projects we define the concept of a ranking.

According to Definition 2, a project has ranking r on an interval of baseline values, if the number of projects with strictly higher VCR is 
                        
                           r
                           -
                           1
                        
                      in every interior point of this interval. For example, project E in Fig. 4 has the ranking 
                        
                           r
                           =
                           2
                        
                      on the baseline value interval 
                        
                           (
                           -
                           ∞
                           ,
                           0.0386
                           ]
                        
                     , because with baseline values below 0.0386 only project B has a higher VCR. Project E then has ranking 
                        
                           r
                           =
                           3
                        
                      on the baseline value interval 
                        
                           [
                           0.0386
                           ,
                           0.0627
                           ]
                        
                     . By definition, those baseline values that lead to a zero VCR for a project do not affect its ranking; for example, project H cannot attain ranking 
                        
                           r
                           =
                           1
                        
                      on any interval, although no project has a higher VCR for baseline values above 0.701.

Our algorithm for solving all possible rankings is based on the fact that a ranking can only change at baseline value points

                      are marked on the horizontal axis. For instance, if the baseline value is between 0.2777 and 0.3479, the projects’ ranking would be B, D, C, A, E, G and F. In this interval, the value of project H is below the baseline value, wherefore it does not have a ranking.

One of the key advantages of the baseline value specification methods of Section ‘General Methods for Baseline Value Specification’ is that they can be applied even if the attributes’ measurement scales do not enable defining a project such that the DM is indifferent between implementing and not implementing it. Furthermore, these methods make it possible to elicit the project value function (i.e., weights

                        ) without the need to consider the baseline value, which can be specified after the project-level preference elicitation. This is particularly useful in applications where the client organization has a set of project performance indexes in use and the value model is built on the measurement scales of these indexes. Extending the existing measurement scales to include an outcome which is equally preferred to not implementing a project may require considerable effort compared to the relatively straightforward baseline specification methods develop in this paper.

Once the project value functions have been established, there are two alternative modes to utilize the computational methods developed in Sections ‘Potentially Optimal Portfolios and Projects’ Value-to-Cost Rankings’. The first alternative is to use the techniques of Section ‘General Methods for Baseline Value Specification’ to obtain an interval for the baseline value. Then, the algorithm in Section ‘Potentially Optimal Portfolios’ can be used to identify the potentially optimal portfolios, whereafter the DM can be presented with visualizations – such as those in Fig. 1 – for the specified interval of baseline values. If there are several potentially optimal portfolios, the DM can try to tighten the bounds for the baseline value by providing additional comparisons of portfolios, or use holistic judgement to select one of the potentially optimal portfolios. If the budget is not fixed, the algorithm in Section ‘Projects’ Value-to-Cost Rankings’ can be used to compute projects’ possible value-to-cost rankings in the specified baseline value interval (see Fig. 5).

The second alternative is that all potentially optimal portfolios (or projects’ value-to-cost rankings) are first computed without restricting the baseline value. These results are then used to structure the baseline specification questions so that a single optimal portfolio (or a value-to-cost ranking) is reached with as few questions as possible. For instance, in the CBAA example, computation of all potentially optimal portfolios directly indicates that the important question is whether the baseline value is above or below 0.0424 (see Fig. 1). Hence, a single question asking the DM whether she would prefer to implement a project with performance

                         could determine the optimal portfolio. Answering this question is can be easier for the DM than specifying a project such that the he is indifferent between implementing and not implementing it.

Throughout this paper we have assumed a standard scaling for the project value function v, in which (i) a project with the least preferred performance level on all attributes receives a zero value

                         and (ii) a project with the most preferred performance level on each attribute has a value equal to one

                        . In the portfolio setting, such a scaling can be misleading when interpreting the model results, because the value of an empty portfolio is negative if

A more intuitive approach could be to scale the project value function v so that (i) the value of not implementing a project is equal to zero and (ii) the value of a project with most preferred performance

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we have developed general methods (i) for specifying the baseline value (i.e., the value of not implementing a project) for the linear-additive portfolio value function and (ii) for analyzing how sensitive the optimal portfolio and the projects’ value-to-cost rankings are to the baseline value. The identification of potentially optimal portfolios is based on solving ILP problems, while analysis of the value-to-cost rankings requires pairwise checks between the projects. Hence, both analyses are relatively straightforward to use and implement. The tests carried out with random problem instances confirm that potentially optimal portfolios can be solved in a reasonable time for problem sizes often encountered in applications.

The results presented in this paper can be applied also with more general portfolio value functions. Although the developed methods are based on the assumption that the portfolio value is the sum of the project values, they do not require that these values are obtained through an additive aggregation of attribute-specific values. Hence, the sensitivity analysis tools of Sections ‘Potentially Optimal Portfolios and Projects’ Value-to-Cost Rankings’ can be used even in cases were the project values are obtained with, for example, a multiplicative value function (Golabi et al., 1981). However, if the portfolio value is not additive across projects (cf. Liesiö, 2014), then the identification of the potentially optimal portfolios cannot be based on the algorithm presented in Section ‘Potentially Optimal Portfolios’. Furthermore, in this case the value-to-cost ratio does not offer a justifiable prioritization rule for the projects.

There are several interesting avenues for future research. First, the methods developed for specifying the baseline value should be tested in real-life applications to identify best practices on how to use them in different types of multi-attribute portfolio problems. Second, a logical path would be to develop computational models that identify the potentially optimal portfolios in situations where – in addition to the baseline value – also other parameters of the linear-additive portfolio value function (e.g., attribute weights) are defined through set inclusion (see, e.g., Liesiö et al., 2007; Liesiö et al., 2008). Finally, techniques for specifying the baseline value and for carrying out sensitivity analysis could be developed for non-additive portfolio value functions (Liesiö, 2014).

                            is potentially optimal and that their optimality ranges span to negative infinity. The third part shows that if the loop on lines 5–10 starts with a potentially optimal portfolio then it identifies only potentially optimal portfolios.
