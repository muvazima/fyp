                  We study a strategic, two-player, sequential game between an attacker and defender. The defender must allocate resources amongst possible countermeasures and across possible targets. The attacker then chooses a type of threat and a target to attack. This paper proposes a model for determining optimal resource allocation by combining game theory with a simple multi-attribute utility model. Given a set of possible attributes representing goals or preferences, we allow each player to choose a weight for each attribute, where the subset of attributes with nonzero weights represents that player’s preferences. Every countermeasure is given a score for its effectiveness at both mitigating the effects of an attack in terms of each attribute and reducing the probability of the success of an attack. Furthermore, the consequences of each possible attack are scored in terms of each attribute. The multi-attribute utility aspect of this model uses these scores, along with the players’ weights, to form the basis of the utility (or disutility) for each player. We find that (i) the zero-sum game where the attacker’s and defender’s weights are identical results in the worst losses for the defender, (ii) in general cases the defender’s equilibrium strategy has the result of making the attacker indifferent between multiple attacks and (iii) the use of target-independent countermeasures (i.e. countermeasures which operate at national levels as opposed to operating at differing levels for each target) can increase the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the events of 9/11/2001, the study of game-theoretic models in the context of national security has been growing rapidly. Intentional attacks are fundamentally different than natural disasters and hazards in that the attacker can adopt different strategies in order to obtain his/her desired result. Golany, Kaplan, Marmur, and Rothblum (2009) give a clear distinction between probabilistic risk and strategic risk. Whereas many hazards including those due to nature can be modeled through probabilistic decision analysis, threats by intentional attackers lend themselves well to game theory. Game theory has been applied in security settings in order to assess the effectiveness of deterring possible attacks (Keohane & Zeckhauser, 2003), and recently game theory has been used to help determine which targets to protect against intentional attacks, which is the topic of this paper. A simple heuristic which has been previously proposed and deemed sub-optimal is to protect only the targets which could suffer the most damages. However, this extreme tends to be ineffective since attackers are adaptive, and thus it is not frequently used on a global scale (Arce & Sandler, 2001). Recent game theoretic models take into account factors such as the likelihood of the success of an attack in order to determine optimal defense budget allocation, and some of these models have produced more realistic results where the resulting strategy is to spread the budget allocation across many targets–hedging our bets between targets (Major, 2002; Woo, 2003). A general Nash Equilibrium approach to resource allocation across defended assets was proposed by Powell (2007). Each game-theoretic model has different features depending on the assumptions that are made.

The most current papers consider a sequential game between a defender and attacker developed by Bier, Oliveros, and Samuelson (2007). In this model, the defender (she) moves first and allocates her resources among potential targets. The attacker (he) moves second, using his best response function to choose a target to attack. One of the key elements for the defender is being able to predict the attacker’s best response function, which stems from his utility function. The most recent work adds complexities to this base model in order to better represent real-world scenarios. Some research focuses on optimizing the defender’s strategy when she is uncertain about the attacker’s preferences (Wang & Bier, 2012; 2011), determining robust allocations when information is unknown (Nikoofal & Zhuang, 2012), and more effectively eliciting attacker preferences based on subject-matter experts’ opinions and rankings (Wang & Bier, 2013). Models for defender and attacker learning also provide more realistic scenarios for analysis, as proposed by Xu and Zhuang (2014). In addition, adversarial risk analysis notes that the attacker’s utility function itself may be a variable in the defender’s calculations (Rios & Rios-Insua, 2012).

Other complexities include allowing for secrecy and deception in the game where one can consider the attacker to be either strategic or non-strategic (Zhuang & Shan, 2013). Zhuang, Bier, and Alagoz (2010) discuss possible reasons for secrecy and deception and present situations in which it is preferable for the defender to keep some resource allocations hidden, for instance when the defender has private information. Strategies involving secrecy and deception have been found to occur in equilibrium when the scenario is modeled as a sequential game and the attacker can choose between presenting correct information, incorrect information, or no information (Zhuang & Bier, 2011). A recent paper by Nikoofal and Zhuang explores the value of exposing defenses by comparing sequential and simultaneous games (Nikoofal & Zhuang, 2015), and finds that moving first in a sequential game is only valuable when the attacker and defender share similar target valuations. In this paper, we do not focus on strategies involving secrecy and deception and thus the defender’s resource allocation is fully visible to the attacker.

Most current models, while becoming more complex in certain aspects, only provide optimal budget allocations to varying targets. That is, they can help us decide how much money to send to a certain target, but not what to do with that money. It is important to expand our toolbox on resource allocation to not only tell us where to put our resources, but also tell us how we should allocate our resources to minimize losses across all the attributes of concern. Using richer assumptions in order to explore the position of utility functions to such games, we allow the attacker and defender to have any number of attributes, and use a linear multi-attribute utility function in order to elicit more realistic results. We use a target-threat-countermeasure formulation similar to Linkov, Tkachuk, Canis, Mohan, and Keisler (2012), however we formulate the scores for each scenario differently.


                     Mo, Xie, and Levitin (2015) and Wang, Ren, Korel, Kwiat, and Salerno (2014) also consider multiple types of countermeasures in a very general setting, categorizing defenses into two groups: increasing protection, and increasing construction of redundant parts in the network. Golany, Goldberg, and Rothblum (2015), formulate a model to address allocating multiple scare resources across multiple targets. This formulation differs in that they consider a zero-sum, simultaneous game where the defender’s goal is to minimize the cost of an attack, and the attacker’s goal is to maximize. This paper considers a sequential game in which each player can choose their own preferences to formulate a goal. This game in general is non-zero sum, but as a special case if both player’s choose the same preferences it could be zero-sum. Haphuriwat and Bier (2011) also consider resource allocation between two fundamentally different types of countermeasures. They consider difference between target hardening and overarching protection, but do not differentiate between specific countermeasures within these categories. Furthermore, they assume that the attacker and defender have the same valuations for each target.

Drawing from the model developed by Bier et al. for defense resource allocation, we consider a one-period sequential game between an attacker and defender. The defender first allocates her resources amongst all combinations of countermeasures and targets, and then the attacker strikes with his best response to this allocation. There is extensive work considering situations in which the attacker receives imperfect information such as false targets and misinformation (see Hausken & Levitin, 2009; Ma, Yau, Lou, & Rao, 2013; Zhang & Ramirez-Marquez, 2013; Zhuang et al., 2010). Incorporation of secrecy and deception in such defensive strategies has been studied as well. These have often been found to be counterproductive (Board, 2002; Oliveros, 2005; Zhuang, 2008) and are beyond the scope of our effort. Allowing for secrecy and deception is a possible extension of our model, however it has often found to be counterproductive (Bier et al., 2007; Levy, 2007; Sandler & Arce, 2003) and we do not focus on this possibility.

Given a set of possible attributes representing the preferences of each player, we allow each attribute to be weighted, where the subset of attributes with nonzero weights represents that player’s preferences. Note that the players may have different weights for the same attribute. Every countermeasure is given a score for its effectiveness at both mitigating the effects of an attack and reducing the probability of the success of an attack in terms of each attribute. The consequences of each possible attack are also scored in terms of each attribute. These scores, along with the players’ weights are used to calculate the payoff (utility or disutility) for each player. The multi-attribute game formulation not only allows optimal allocation of the defender’s budget across targets, as previous research has done, but also allows allocation among different types of countermeasures. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-attribute model allows us to explore how different sets of preferences for the attacker and defender affects the optimal strategy and payoff.

In Section 2 we describe basic model: the variables, inputs, and the calculations for the payoff of each player. Section 3 presents the definition and conditions for an equilibrium solution. Section 4 presents the main theoretical findings. Section 5 presents a number of illustrative examples to show how the model works and demonstrate some interesting results. Section 6 extends the model by allowing for target-independent countermeasures. Section 7 discusses areas for future research.

As do Bier et al., we consider a sequential, two player game, between an attacker (he) and defender (she). The defender has a number of targets to defend, and can defend them using a number of countermeasures. The attacker can choose any one of these targets to strike with a number of possible threats. The defender moves first and must decide how to allocate her resources amongst all possible countermeasures and targets. The attacker moves second, choosing the combination of threat and target which maximizes his utility. The goal of the defender is to allocate her resources (this can be thought of as budget) amongst countermeasures and targets such that, given the attacker’s best response to her allocation, she minimizes her disutility from the attack. An extensive form of the game is shown in Fig. 1
                      for a scenario with three countermeasures (CM1, CM2, CM3), two targets (T1, T2), and two threats (TH1, TH2).

We will formulate the payoff for each player as a linear multi-attribute utility function, where the user may choose a set of attributes, and each player is given a weight for each attribute between zero and one, where the sum over all attributes is one. Thus for each player there is a subset of attributes with nonzero weight corresponding to that player’s preferences. We assume that, for each attribute, the defender is seeking minimization whereas the attacker is seeking maximization. For example, if the attribute is “infrastructure damage,” the defender would be attempting minimization whereas the attacker would be seeking maximization.

Each attack is scored with respect to each attribute, and these scores drive the payoffs for each player. However, the countermeasures that the defender chooses to employ also play a role in the payoffs, as they can reduce the consequences of the attack or reduce the likelihood of the success of an attack. Thus, each countermeasure receives a score for how much it reduces the probability of success of each threat, and for how much it mitigates the effect of each type of attack in terms of each attribute. In practice, the scores for each attack and each countermeasure would be elicited via judgement from subject matter experts and data.

Our model characterizes the impact of various threats and countermeasures for differing targets across the given attributes. We associate the following indices with the elements of the model.

                            where λ represents the cost-effectiveness of the overall investment to that target. For this paper, we use a similar idea, but prefer a more general approach. Instead of specifying a family of functions to be used, we allow for arbitrary specification of a return-on-investment function which best fits each particular countermeasure. In addition, we define the function in terms of the failure probability of an attack, rather than the success probability. We make this change so that the external parameter, Π
                           
                              h, j
                           , can be used as a generalization of λ that can be applied to whichever function has been selected. Π
                           
                              h, j
                            stipulates the failure probability of an attack at h assuming that all resources are allocated to j.
                     
                     
                        Definition 1
                        We define an attack Ω as a pairing of threat and target, so that 
                              
                                 Ω
                                 =
                                 {
                                 h
                                 ,
                                 i
                                 }
                              
                           .

Once an attack is carried out, the resulting payoffs to defender and attacker depend on whether the attack is a success, and if so, the degree to which the attack has been mitigated. In particular, a successful attack has consequences ranging from none to some maximal level on each attribute for each target, and the payoffs for each player are weighted sums of the consequences in each attribute.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In this section we present the methodology for calculating the loss L for the defender and the gain U for the attacker which consist of three tiers: the probability of the success of an attack, p, the mitigating levels, M, based on the resource distribution, and finally the overall consequence scores, Q, which are based on p, M, and λ.

Assumptions:

                           
                              1.
                              With no countermeasures in place, an attack is certain to succeed.
                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                    This assumption has no bearing on the results, but simplifies the notation. This is also assumed by Bier et al. (2007). In order to eliminate this assumption, one could simply multiply p
                                       
                                          h, i
                                        by the underlying probability of success of attack h at target i with no countermeasures in place. This changes p by a linear factor. For simplicity, we assume this factor to be 1 throughout the paper.
                                 
                              

All countermeasures are independent of one another.

                                    3
                                    If there is linear dependence between countermeasures, we can utilize the statistical tool called principal component analysis to establish a set of independent “pseudo-countermeasures,” which are linear combinations of the original countermeasures. The parameters can also be transformed in terms of this new set of pseudo-countermeasures. The same model can be used on the independent set of countermeasures, and the allocations can be transformed back to correspond to the original countermeasures at the end. See Jolliffe (2002) for a detailed explanation of principal component analysis.

                        . Each countermeasure has an effectiveness at reducing the probability of threat h succeeding, given by the entries in Π. For a single countermeasure, the probability of stopping threat h at location i is

We can also measure the extent to which the countermeasures can mitigate the effects of an attack, assuming that the attack is carried through. For a given threat, target, and criteria, M
                        
                           h, i, k
                         measures the mitigating effects of the attack. For instance, suppose “increased first responders” is a countermeasure. Since first responders would not help to prevent a threat, Π
                        
                           h, j
                         might be zero. However, μ
                        
                           h, j, k
                         would be nonzero, since first responds would help to mitigate the consequences of an attack in terms of a possible criterion of “loss of life.” The calculation of M

As an explanation of Eq. (2), suppose we have three countermeasures: A, B, and C, and that h, i, and k are already given. Suppose that

                        . These values can be thought of as the percentage by which each of the countermeasures can reduce the consequences of the threat. For instance, if we only had countermeasure A in place, then the consequences of the threat would be mitigated by 70%, i.e. the consequences would only be 30% as damaging as they could have been. Now suppose we add countermeasure B; then the consequences of the threat are only 18%

                        30%*60% as damaging as they could have been. Finally, we add countermeasure C, and now the consequences of the threat are only 14.4%

                        30%*60%*80% as damaging as they could have been. Thus, the mitigating levels are simply 100%

First, we calculate the probability of the success of threat h at target i using Eq. (1).

The first condition states that in an equilibrium the attacker chooses his best response given the resource allocation b
                     *, and second condition states that the defender’s losses are minimized given the attacker’s best response. We give pseudo-code for finding the equilibrium solution in Algorithm 1
                     . This algorithm returns threat and target (the attack carried through by the attacker) as well as loss (the defender’s disutility). For each combination of threat and target, {h, i}, Algorithm 1 computes the optimal budget allocation for the defender, with the constraint that the current combination of threat and target is the optimal choice for the defender (i.e. that

                     ). Through the cycle, the algorithm keeps track of the treat and target that resulted in the smallest losses so far. The final output of the algorithm is the threat/target combination, along with the budget allocation, that produced the smallest loss to the defender amongst all possible target/threat combinations.

A pure strategy for the defender is a resource allocation b ∈ [0, 1]
                        H × I
                      and a pure strategy for the defender is an attack Ω.

                        Lemma 3
                        
                           There exists a pure equilibrium {b
                           *, Ω
                           *}

Because the defender has complete knowledge of the attacker’s preferences, given a resource allocation b, the defender can predict the attacker’s response, Ω
                           *, and thus also predict

                           . Therefore, because b is a compact set and L is bounded, there exists a minimum. The fact that the attacker has a pure strategy is clear from the first condition of Lemma 1. This is analogous to Proposition 1 of Bier et al. (2007).□

                           . That is, the defender has allocated resources in such a way that the attacker is indifferent towards multiple attacks.

In the presence of tied attacks, it is not clear how we should determine the loss to the defender. Intuitively, we may think to average over all of the losses in the set of tied attacks, since the attacker could theoretically choose any of those attacks with equal probability. However, in the case of tied attacks, we will actually consider the defender’s loss to be the minimal loss over the set of all tied attacks. The reason for doing this will be made clear by Corollary 4.3. First, we prove a result related to the behavior of equilibrium solutions.

For the proof of this theorem, it will be simpler to only consider targets, rather than combinations of targets and threats. For that reason, we will use the notation Ui

                            (the target which yields the highest payoff to the attacker).

First we consider the case when only one target has a non-zero budget allocation. It is clear that if the equations 
                              
                                 {
                                 
                                    b
                                    
                                       i
                                       ,
                                       .
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 B
                                 ,
                                 i
                                 =
                                 
                                    i
                                    *
                                 
                                 }
                              
                            can be satisfied for some i, then we have an equilibrium solution. Since L
                           
                              h, i
                           (b) is decreasing in b
                           
                              i, ., any other budget allocation would yield higher losses to the defender. Furthermore, since U
                           
                              h, i
                           (b) is also decreasing in b
                           
                              i, ., any other budget allocation would result in higher utility to the defender at target i, so i would still be chosen as the attack target. Thus, allocating the entire budget to target i is optimal in this case.

Now we consider the case with tied attacks. Suppose there is an equilibrium solution with a target with non-zero budget allocation which is also not a tied attack. Let the set of targets with tied attacks be denoted by I
                           *. Let

                     Theorem 4.1 gives us an understanding of the appearance of an equilibrium solution. In the most general cases (i.e. cases where either Condition i or ii hold, and more than one target has non-zero budget allocation) an equilibrium solution results in the attacker being indifferent towards multiple attacks.

Following the proof of Theorem 4.1, the result is clear in the case when

                           . That is, the attack {α, β} is the only attack in the set of tied attacks at target β. In this case, we can simply follow the proof of Theorem 4.1, and allocate a small amount of budget away from every countermeasure at target β, so that

When there are multiple attacks at target β in the set of tied attacks, i.e. U
                           {
                           β}(b*) contains more than one element, the budget allocation must be defined with greater specificity in order to achieve the desired result. In this case, we can choose a countermeasure j which satisfies either Condition (i) or Condition (ii) and allocate budget away from countermeasure j at target β. Then, even if there are multiple threats which are tied at target β, we still have that U

                      the set of corresponding losses to the defender. A natural question is how can we determine what the loss to the defender is? It is tempting to take the average over across all losses corresponding to the tied attacks. However, the following corollary tells us that for practical purposes we can consider the defender’s loss to be the minimal loss over all of the tied attacks. That is,

This follows directly from Theorem 4.2, letting {α, β} be the attack which produces the minimal loss to the defender.□


                     Corollary 4.3 tells us that, in the case of tied attacks, it is reasonable to consider the defender’s loss to be the minimal loss over the set of tied attacks. The defender can slightly alter her resource allocation such that the attack which yields the minimal loss to the defender is chosen. Therefore, in real game play, the defender can slightly bias the attacker towards the tied attack that is in the defender’s best interest. This slight alteration in the resource allocation can be made arbitrarily small, so that the loss to the defender and the utility to the attacker also only change by an arbitrarily small amount by continuity.

We now develop a number of examples to show how different weights and criteria affect the optimal defender strategy and the payoff to both players. Our examples are based in generic counterterrorism scenarios, although this model can be applied to any attacker versus defender scenario. Note that all scores are for illustrative purposes only and determined by author judgement. The threats, targets, countermeasures, and criteria were also chosen by the authors solely for illustrative purposes. Table 2 shows the hypothetical scenario that we consider throughout this section.

We characterize each city numerically based on the scores in λ, but for intuitive purposes we will qualitatively characterize them as well. Consider Metropolis to be a large city with a very high population density, lots of important infrastructure such as airports and train stations, and high economic activity. It is a valuable target to protect in virtually every category. Consider Gotham to be a capital city. It has a lower population density than Metropolis, less infrastructure, and far less economic activity. However, an attack on Gotham would yield a very large reaction and have widespread political consequences. Consider Smallville to have a medium population density, mid-level economic activity, but very important infrastructure. It is not more valuable than Metropolis or Gotham in any category, but would still be a likely target if the other two cities were too difficult to attack.

The values used for Π, μ, λ, and b can be found in the Appendix in Tables 7, 8, 9 and 10. Each of the following sections considers a different set of criteria and weights. We also assume that g is a scaled arctan function for each countermeasure. This is a concave function, so each countermeasure exhibits diminishing marginal returns.

For each scenario, we run the model twice–once assuming that the defender has a relatively unconstrained budget, and once assuming that the defender has a constrained budget. The unconstrained budget is four times larger than the constrained budget. This is done in order to emphasize the importance of cost-effectiveness, and to see how the allocations might vary depending on how many resources we are willing to distribute.

In order to more easily discuss the differences between scenarios, we introduce the notion of strictly preferred scenarios and preferred scenarios in the following definitions.

This section considers what the authors deem a “realistic” set of attributes and weights. This set of weights and attributes is used as a basis of comparison for each succeeding example.

Using this set of weights, the model produces the following optimal resource allocation, payoff tables, and consequence scores for each of the defender’s attributes.


                        Fig. 2 shows the proportional amount of resources allocated to each city, categorized by the type of countermeasure. We see that Metropolis has the highest levels of resource allocation because, unprotected, it would be the most valuable target to the attacker and defender. By allocating almost half of the defender’s resources to Metropolis, she can deter the attacker from attacking Metropolis and he instead attacks Gotham.

We also see that in the constrained budget case, most of the resources are going towards transportation security, building security, and target hardening. These are all average cost according to Table 7. This combination of countermeasures has preventative abilities for all three types of possible attacks, according to Table 8. However, this set of countermeasures does not have any mitigating abilities. In the unconstrained budget case, each city has a more diverse set of countermeasures. Notably, each city invests in intelligence gathering, and Metropolis invests in first responders and some employee preparedness. Intelligence gathering was made to be an expensive but effective countermeasure at preventing all types of threats (see Tables 7 and 8). Metropolis invests in some countermeasures which have very little preventative abilities, but some mitigating abilities.

From the Payoff Tables in Fig. 2, we see that the attacker chooses an attack on a government building in Gotham. The numbers in the table indicate utilities, and have no absolute meaning (because they are determined by the relative scores from Tables 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the Appendix). However, they have meaning when compared relative to other scenarios using the same scores. For instance, we can say that the attacker’s disutility is three times larger in the constrained budget case than in the unconstrained budget case. The constrained budget is actually four times less than the unconstrained budget, but the attacker is only three times better with the unconstrained budget. This is because we assume diminishing marginal returns for all of the countermeasures.

Although
                         the attacker is actually indifferent between seven different attacks which all yield the same utility to the attacker, we know from Corollary 4.3 that we can assume the attacker chooses the attack which yields the smallest disutility to the defender. Intuitively, the defender can slightly alter her budget allocation to sway the attacker towards an attack on a government building in Gotham, since the parameters of our model satisfy condition (i) for Corollary 4.3 (see Appendix for parameters).


                        Fig. 3 shows the defender’s disutility in each of her categories from the chosen attack. As expected, the unconstrained budget scenario is strictly preferred to the constrained budget scenario, meaning that the disutility is lower in every category when the defender can use an unconstrained budget. The ripple effect and reaction have the largest disutility score because of the political importance of Gotham.

Now suppose that the defender and attacker have strictly competing criteria and identical weights. This is a zero-sum game, where any loss of the defender is a gain for the attacker. From Theorem 4.4, we know that this scenario will yield the highest possible losses to the defender.

From Fig. 4 we can see that in the constrained budget case, resources are allocated to transportation security, target-hardening, and intelligence gathering, and hardly any resources are allocated to Gotham. This is different from the Base Scenario. Now that the attacker does not care about reaction, less resources are allocated to Gotham and more focus is put on Metropolis. Furthermore, now there is greater concern with an attack on mass transit than an attack on a government building, so more money is allocated towards transportation security, target-hardening, and intelligence gathering, which all help to prevent mst attacks. The unconstrained budget case looks extremely similar, with slightly more diversification.

In the constrained budget case, both the attacker and defender are indifferent between four different attacks. In Fig. 4, the tied attacks are shown by the shaded cells in the payoff tables. Each of the four attacks yields the same disutility to the defender, so the defender has no incentive to alter her resource allocation. Usually, in the case of tied attacks, we can choose the attack which yields the smallest losses to the defender by Corollary 4.3. However, in this case, there are multiple attacks which all yield the smallest loss to the defender. No matter which of the four tied attacks the attacker chooses, the defender’s disutility is 0.22. The payoff for each player is constant no matter what the attacker chooses, including any mixed strategy.

For the unconstrained budget case, the defender and attacker are both indifferent between six attacks, each yielding a defender disutilty (and attacker utility) of 0.10. For a constrained budget, the defender is about 3.6 times worse off in this scenario than in the Base Scenario, and 5 times worse off for the unconstrained budget.


                        Fig. 5 shows the defender’s disutility for each of the tied attacks in comparison to the disutility from the Base Scenario. In this scenario, the overall disutility to the defender is higher than in the Base Scenario for both the constrained and unconstrained budget, however the disutility in each category may vary depending on which of the tied attacks is
                        
                         chosen.

For instance, looking at the constrained budget case, the Base Scenario is strictly preferred to the Attack 4 because the consequence score in terms of each criteria is less for the Base Scenario than it is for Attack 4. However, the Base Scenario is only weakly preferred to the other three attacks, because there are some criteria for which the consequence score in the Base Scenario is less than that of the tied attack. However, all four tied attacks are still weakly preferred to the Base Scenario since the overall loss is less. The same is true in the unconstrained case–only some of the tied attacks are strictly preferred, but all are weakly preferred.

In this section we consider the case when the attacker and defender have no competing attributes. That is, the set of the attributes for which the two players have non-zero weights have no elements in common.

From Fig. 6 we see that most resources are allocated to Gotham. This makes sense intuitively because the attacker only cares about reaction, and Gotham has the highest scores for reaction. The defender, being aware of the attacker’s preferences, takes advantage of this knowledge and allocates over half of her budget to Gotham. In the constrained budget case, she allocates resources to transportation security, building security, target-hardening, and intelligence gathering. About forty percent of her budget is allocated towards countermeasures at Gotham which help to prevent attacks on government buildings (build, tar, and intel). This makes sense because a government building attack would yield the highest reaction scores. The unconstrained budget case looks very similar except the defender diversifies countermeasures more for Metropolis and Smallville by allocating more money to intel and first responders.

From Fig. 7
                        
                        , we can see that this scenario is strictly preferred to the base case by the defender, but only very slightly. In fact, the disutility difference is too small to appear in the Payoff tables of Fig. 6. For both budgets, the defender is about 15% better off in this scenario than in the Base Scenario. This is intuitively clear because now the two players are not directly competing in each criteria, however we still know from 
                           Remark 1
                         that this is not necessarily the scenario which minimizes the defender’s losses. We see an example of this in the following section.

In this section we present an example which illustrates 
                           Remark 1
                        . We compare the consequences scores in this scenario to that of the preceding section to illustrate the point (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8).

This scenario is meant to look very similar to the Different Weights Scenario. The budget allocation and payoff are similar. However, this scenario is in fact strictly preferred to the preceding scenario, even though the attacker and defender now have slightly overlapping weights (Table 6). The same attack was chosen in this scenario as in the preceding scenario (an attack on a government building in Gotham), however the defender now has fewer losses than before (Fig. 9).

Looking at the λ parameters (see Table 10 in the Appendix) gives some intuition for this outcome. When the attacker only cared about reaction, it was unclear which type of attack on Gotham would have the greatest impact. Both a hijacking and an attack on a government building have high scores for reaction. This made it necessary for the defender to disperse her resources to protect against both of these attacks. However, when the attacker cares equally about reaction and ripple effect, it is clear that an attack on a government building would be more attractive for the attacker, since it has a high score in both reaction and ripple effect. Thus, this scenario actually better enabled the defender to anticipate the attacker’s strategy, and thus better allocate resources accordingly (Fig. 8).

This is an example of a case where it actually benefits the defender to have some shared attributes with the attacker. In this case, it gives the defender more information about the attacker’s probable strategy. There may be other cases such that when the attacker’s weights change, it might lead to choice of an attack strategy that increases the consequences in terms of the attacker’s most important attribute(s), but actually lessens the consequences in terms of an attribute that the defender cares more about. Thus, it is not necessarily true that the defender’s best case scenario is when she shares no attributes in common with the attacker.

This section explains an add-on to the model which makes it more realistic and yields interesting results. As an extension to the basic model, we allow for some target-independent countermeasures. These are countermeasures which are not target-specific. For example, it might make more sense for “intel” to be target-independent, rather than having its budget specified individually for each target. In this extension we can specify which countermeasures we would like to be target-independent, and the model will output a single value for those countermeasures across all targets. As an example, we now consider “intel” to be target-independent. Using the weights from the Base Scenario and a constrained budget, we can see how this affects the optimal resource allocation.

The overall shape of the resource allocation here (Fig. 10) looks very similar to that of the Base Scenario (Fig. 2). That is, the majority of the budget is allocated to Metropolis, slightly less to Gotham, and even less to Smallville. Note that for this resource allocation, the percentages on the vertical axis do not add to one because intelligence gathering is taken to be a target-independent countermeasure. In the Base Scenario with a constrained budget, no money is allocated to intelligence gathering because it is too expensive. Making intelligence gathering a target-independent countermeasure effectively makes it more cost-effective and worthwhile to invest in. As seen in Fig. 11
                     , this scenario is strictly preferred to the Base Scenario. The defender is about 8% better off intelligence gathering is target-independent. This is less of a difference than we might have expected, however the results depend heavily on our parameters. Currently, as seen in Table 8 of the Appendix, intelligence gathering is not much better than target-hardening at preventing attacks. We suspect that if intelligence gathering was substantially better, then the defender would be much better off with it as a target-independent countermeasure. (Tables 9 and 10)

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Our results show that incorporating countermeasure effectiveness into the standard sequential attacker versus defender game in addition to multi-attribute utility functions can result in more detailed and realistic resource allocation. Adding this new level of detail could further help with policy-making decisions and budgeting. Our numerical results indicate that resource allocation among countermeasures is very sensitive to each countermeasure’s score and cost. We also find that the defender is worse off in a zero-sum game, i.e. one in which she and the attacker share the same attributes. However, she is not necessarily best off when she shares no attributes in common with the attacker. In some cases, it can benefit the defender for the attacker to share an attribute. Additionally, our model supports the intuitive idea that the use of nationwide countermeasures, as opposed to target-specific countermeasures, can increase cost effectiveness and thereby reduce the loss to the defender.

In order to accurately use this model, we must have detailed knowledge on the behavior and effectiveness of various countermeasures. The model is quite sensitive to the parameter values chosen for cost, return on investment (the function g), preventative abilities, and mitigating abilities. The cost and return on investment shouldn’t be very burdensome to estimate using established techniques from accounting and finance. Scores for preventive and mitigating utilities could be estimated using standard subject matter expert elicitation techniques, possibly along with robust techniques such as ordinal rankings, used in current research to predict attacker preferences (Wang & Bier, 2013).

There are numerous possible extensions and refinements to the model that could be implemented in future research. Most notably, our model assumes that the attacker can fully observe the defender’s resource allocation. In reality, the defender may well have some countermeasures that she would like to keep hidden. It would be interesting to explore whether or not secret countermeasures actually aid the defender, or hurt the defender by detracting from deterrence. In addition, the defender should also have the option of trying to deceive the attacker by pretending to allocate resources to a certain location, or by distracting the attacker while allocating a secret amount of resources somewhere.

The model might be extended to include uncertainty in attacker preferences as well as uncertainty in the countermeasure scores. Uncertainty in attacker preferences is already widely used in the literature, and it should not be difficult to incorporate into this new model. Uncertainty in countermeasure scores can be incorporated easily by considering each score to be a probability distribution. The sensitivity of our results to the countermeasure scores indicate that such uncertainty could be valuable and that we should solve for robust resource allocations.

By allowing for richer assumptions and strategies for each of the players, our model is able to provide insight and guidance for previously unaddressed levels of decision-making. Future research can continue in this direction by further enriching the description of the counterterrorism decision problems to yield even richer guidance.
