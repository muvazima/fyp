@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Many methods to elicit preference models in multi-attribute decision making rely on evaluations of a set of sample alternatives by decision makers. Using orthogonal design methods to create this set of alternatives might require respondents to evaluate unrealistic alternatives. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze whether the presence of such implausible alternatives has an effect on the quality of utility elicitation. Using a new approach to measure consistency, we find that implausible alternatives in fact, have a positive effect on consistency of intra-attribute preference information and consistency with dominance, but do not affect inter-attribute preference information.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many approaches to multi-attribute decision making attempt to infer a decision maker’s preferences from the direct evaluations of a set of sample alternatives presented to him or her. Several approaches of this type have been developed independently in different literature streams. Some methods use statistical regression techniques (Schoemaker & Waid, 1982) to estimate weights of additive multi-attribute utility functions from cardinal scores assigned to the sample alternatives. Most approaches, however, are based on pairwise comparisons or a ranking of alternatives. Such approaches are widely considered to be even less demanding in terms of cognitive effort than providing scores. A very early reference to such a method is Srinivasan and Shocker (1973). One of the best known techniques using this concept is the UTA method of Jacquet-Lagreze and Siskos (1982), which is the basis of several similar methods collectively known as preference disaggregation methods (Jacquet-Lagreze & Siskos, 2001). The Linmap method (Horsky & Rao, 1984) is also based on holistic comparisons of alternatives and uses a linear programming model to estimate attribute weights. Similarly, case-based methods, which infer preferences from a set of examples, have become popular in multi-attribute sorting (Chen, Hipel, & Kilgour, 2007; Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2004). Recently developed methods to calculate a representative value function (Greco, Kadzinski, & Slowinski, 2011) for decision models under incomplete information (Greco, Mousseau, & Slowinski, 2008) also follow a similar approach. In marketing, the method of Conjoint Analysis was developed to model consumer preferences (Green & Srinivasan, 1978). Conjoint Analysis is based on an additive utility model, and some approaches also use holistic comparisons between alternatives to infer preference parameters. Over the last decades, Conjoint Analysis has evolved into one of the most widely used techniques to investigate consumer preferences (Eggers & Sattler, 2011; Green, Krieger, & Wind, 2001).

All these techniques rely on the responses of decision makers on a set of alternatives (stimuli). Often, the fact that respondents holistically evaluate entire alternatives, rather than having to specify detailed information on single parameters, is described as a major advantage of such methods. Given the central role of sample alternatives in these methods, it is surprising that the question which alternatives to present to the decision maker is rarely addressed in literature. Usually, the selection of those alternatives is only described in rather general terms, e.g. as alternatives used in previous decisions, or even more general as “fictitious alternatives … which can easily be judged by the decision maker” (Jacquet-Lagreze & Siskos, 2001, p. 235/236).

While the decision making literature thus rarely has investigated the question which alternatives to present in decompositional preference elicitation methods, similar questions have received more attention in the literature on Conjoint Analysis. Given the strong statistical focus of marketing methods, the optimal design of stimuli sets is an important topic in that literature (e.g., DeSarbo, Mahajan, & Steckel, 1985; Green & Helsen, 1989).

Based on statistical considerations concerning the efficiency of parameter estimation, orthogonal designs are often recommended. Since orthogonal designs require the evaluation of a large number of alternatives, methods to reduce the required number of comparisons have been developed. These methods minimize the total number of questions to be asked (Holloway & White, 2003) or formulate comparisons which allow to “cut off” particularly large subsets of the remaining parameter space (Toubia, Hauser, & Simester, 2004). However, these methods usually assume that attributes are not correlated and determine the questions to be asked from a technical perspective, while the perspective of the decision maker is rarely addressed.

In real-world decision problems, alternatives often exhibit a correlation of attributes, which is caused by the trade-offs inherent to existing alternatives. For example, when selecting a car, higher speed or a stronger engine usually are accompanied by a higher fuel consumption. Any other attribute combination would be implausible. Another example for an implausible alternative would be a low-priced laptop computer with the fastest processor on the market. However, orthogonal designs (or fractional designs created by an optimization approach) usually ignore such real world correlations, and thus might require the subject to evaluate alternatives which are unlikely to exist in reality (Moore & Holbrook, 1990).

This problem was also recognized in the literature on Conjoint Analysis (e.g., Green, Helsen, & Shandler, 1988). Methods were developed to create optimal designs which avoid such alternatives (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010), and some empirical studies were conducted to investigate whether or not the presence of implausible alternatives has a negative impact on the preference models estimated. While these contributions offer only limited insights into the role of implausible alternatives in Conjoint measurement, they nevertheless highlight the importance of the topic.

Conjoint Analysis and multi-attribute decision models differ in the goals of preference elicitation. In Conjoint Analysis, preferences are elicited in order to predict consumer behavior in future purchases, and thus the predictive abilities of the model over an extended time span are a major concern. In contrast, multi-attribute decision models elicit preferences in order to support decision makers to make complex decisions in a way that is consistent with their preferences. Therefore, consistency is a major concern when preferences are elicited for this purpose.

Due to the focus on the models’ predictive ability, most existing studies on the effects of implausible alternatives in Conjoint Analysis use a two-stage design, in which choices predicted by the elicited model are compared to later choices (of similar complexity) made by consumers. Since the model is used for prediction of consumer behavior, respondents are not aware of the elicited model when they make their choice in the second stage.

In contrast, preference elicitation for multi-attribute decision models is mainly concerned with obtaining a consistent representation of the decision maker’s preference at the time the elicitation is performed. This representation is then used by decision makers themselves to solve more complex problems. Inconsistencies in responses, although they can be corrected by statistical means, are seen as an indicator that the decision maker is not sure about his or her preferences, or is confused by the questions being asked. This could impede the reliability of the elicitation. Therefore, consistency of the responses is a major concern, while the ability of the model to predict choices a considerable time later is not relevant for this application. Therefore, we focus on immediate results rather than on choices in a later stage.

Analyzing the consistency of responses requires to develop a method to determine compatibility of subjects’ choices with plausible assumptions about preference parameters. We introduce a new approach, and apply it in an experimental setting to study the impact of implausible alternatives on the elicitation process. More specifically, in our research we want to identify negative effects of implausible stimuli directly on the elicitation process and the estimated parameters.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review, based mainly on literature in Conjoint Analysis, on possible effects of implausible alternatives in preference elicitation. In Section 3, we use these results to formulate research questions for our empirical study, which is described in Section 4. Section 5 describes the model we use to test compatibility of parameters with plausible assumptions, and Section 6 presents the empirical results. Section 7 concludes the paper by summarizing its main results and providing an outlook on future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Since its development in the 1970s, Conjoint Analysis has become one of the most widely applicable techniques for identifying consumers’ preferences (Green & Srinivasan, 1990). A considerable amount of literature has been devoted to algorithms and applications of this approach (e.g., Johnson, 1974; Srinivasan & Shocker, 1973). However, the perspective of respondents is less prominent in existing literature.

The most widely used method for eliciting preference parameters is the “full-profile” procedure, which utilizes the complete set of attributes as stimulus material. However, a full design involving all possible combinations of attributes levels would require subjects to evaluate a large number of alternatives. To overcome this problem, Green (1974) introduced the use of fractional factorial designs, which use fewer alternatives and still maintain the assumption of attribute orthogonality (i.e., factors are uncorrelated).

However, in many real-world decision problems, some relationships between two or more attributes of the decision objects are present (Hair et al., 2010). In such situations, an orthogonal design may contain stimuli which are highly implausible. Green and Srinivasan (1978) note that in presence of inter-attribute correlation, orthogonalizing inherently non-orthogonal attributes is likely to produce stimuli that are not representative of the environment familiar to the subjects (Steckel, DeSarbo, & Mahajan, 1991). Negative inter-attribute correlations can arise because products which are dominated by other products are very unlikely to exist in the real market (Green & Srinivasan, 1990). If product A is better than product B on one specific attribute, it is likely to be worse on some other attributes. It can be assumed that respondents who face non-representative stimuli or unbelievable attribute combinations respond unnaturally to these profiles, which may distort the conjoint design (Hair et al., 2010).

High correlations between attributes do not violate any assumption of Conjoint Analysis per se. However, if reasonable correlations among the attributes in a choice set exist, the predictive validity in the non-compensatory environment may be poor, which is mirrored in an error in estimating preference parameters (Green & Srinivasan, 1990; Johnson, Meyer, & Ghose, 1989). One of the more problematic effects is the inability to obtain reliable estimates due to the lack of uniqueness for each level (Hair et al., 2010). Therefore, as Conjoint Analysis is regarded as rather sensitive to correlation structure, the current notion is that whenever possible, inter-attribute correlations should be kept to a minimum.

While the effect of attribute correlations has sometimes been considered to be negligible (e.g., Johnson et al., 1989), literature also regularly raises concerns and suggests different ways to overcome the problem. For example, Green and Srinivasan (1978, 1990) advocate to construct “super-attributes” by combining all highly correlated attributes into a single composite factor. However, this quite popular approach does not allow separating the effects of the sub-factors and hence limits applicability as well as expressiveness. Literature also recommends to delete or modify unrealistic profiles (Green & Srinivasan, 1978, 1990) to make problems less confusing to subjects. However, such plausible designs are no longer totally orthogonal; hence, it is questionable if the gain from better responses outweighs the loss due to statistical disadvantages.

While inter-attribute correlations are often cited as a potential problem for Conjoint Analysis, only a few studies have examined this issue empirically. Hence, little is known about the consequences and magnitudes of effects of unlikely attribute combinations. Furthermore, the results of the contributions so far are quite mixed. For example, Huber and McCann (1982) find no evidence that inferences among correlated attributes (e.g., price and quality) have a significant impact on calculated importance weights.

In various applications of Conjoint Analysis (non-price) attributes may be monotonic, meaning that most individuals order the attribute levels in the same way. Under such a condition, an orthogonal design could contain dominated profiles. Similar to the work of Johnson et al. (1989) and Huber and Hansen (1987), Green et al. (1988) raise the question whether profiles should only contain alternatives which are Pareto optimal with respect to non-price attributes and whether price should covary with the other attributes. However, they were unable to identify any response differences between the orthogonal and the covarying price/Pareto designed stimuli; Pareto optimal designs did not lead to significantly better predictions of holdout profiles. This finding is also supported by Green and Helsen (1989), who find no differences in the predictive accuracy between an orthogonal and a plausible design. Moore and Holbrook (1990), in a similar vein, discuss the impact of consumer inferences among correlated attributes on overall alternative evaluations and derived importance weights. They argue that individuals may simplify the decision process by disregarding some attributes or utilizing correlations to infer attribute levels. In a similar manner, respondents are hypothesized to discount or distort implausible attribute combinations. However, Moore and Holbrook (1990) are unable to find any evidence that respondents actually discount unlikely combinations of price and quality. So far, the weight of empirical evidence suggests that orthogonal designs seem to be quite robust even when they contain implausible alternatives.

However, there exist also contrary voices: For instance, early research by DeSarbo et al. (1985) indicates that a representative (plausible) design leads to higher predictive validity when compared to its orthogonal (implausible) counterpart. A similar conclusion is provided by Steckel et al. (1991). The latter advance a new methodology for creating fractional factorial designs that are as orthogonal as possible and do not contain non-representative stimulus profiles. Huber and Hansen (1987) also report empirical results on the question whether Pareto-optimally designed choice sets provide greater predictive validity than standard orthogonal designs. By using paired comparison preference judgments, the authors conclude that Pareto optimal choice sets provide a better basis for preference elicitation.

As our literature review has indicated, there still exists only limited evidence on whether considering plausible designs leads to a better elicitation of preferences. More than 20years ago, Moore and Holbrook (1990) have noted that a large number of applications of Conjoint Analysis have ignored reliability and validity issues. Green and Srinivasan (1990) also ask for more research on the topic of robustness of orthogonal designs in correlated attribute environments. This call remained widely unanswered until today.

Therefore, in our research, we want to evaluate potentially negative effects of implausible alternatives on estimated parameters in multi-attribute value functions. Given our focus on consistency rather than predictive accuracy, we look for “unreasonable” results of parameter elicitations, and ask whether such unreasonable results occur more often when implausible alternatives are presented to subjects.

Consequently we have to define when we would consider results to be “unreasonable”. One very fundamental requirement in any decision involving multiple attributes is to avoid dominated alternatives. We can consider a subject’s response to be “unreasonable” whenever a subject indicates a preference for a dominated alternative over the alternative dominating it. Consequently, we formulate our first research question as:


                     RQ1: 
                     Do subjects who are confronted with implausible alternatives more often indicate a preference for a dominated alternative over the alternative dominating it, than subjects who are confronted only with plausible alternatives? (Consistency with dominance)
                  

In many real word situations, an a priori ordering of different levels of an attribute (i.e., intra-attribute preferences) can be assumed to hold for all respondents (Srinivasan, Jain, & Malhotra, 1983). For instance, it seems reasonable to generally assume that a consumer would prefer a retail store that is “open 24-h-a-day and 7-days-a-week” to a store that is “open 8a.m. to 6p.m. on weekdays only”. This should be reflected in the part-worths for that attribute. In its basic form, Conjoint Analysis does not automatically lead to parameters fulfilling such assumptions.

In our research, we are concerned with the elicitation of individual utility functions, rather than functions for the entire population. We therefore cannot only refer to generally plausible rankings of attribute levels, but also to rankings which are provided by individual subjects. Thus we consider utility functions, which contradict either generally plausible or individually specified rankings of attribute levels as “unreasonable”. For instance, if a consumer indicates a certain preference concerning supermarket size (e.g., large≻middle≻small) when directly questioned about this attribute, the same ranking should be reflected in the elicited multi-attribute value function. Likewise, intra-attribute values should be consistent with general preferences for attributes (e.g., high quality is preferred to low quality), if such preferences can plausibly be formulated.

The question of consistency between intra-attribute values and stated or plausible intra-attribute preferences has also been addressed in the literature on Conjoint Analysis, although from a quite different perspective. Various scholars have suggested to impose a priori constraints on the parameters to improve predictive validity (e.g., Van der Lans, Wittink, Huber, & Vriens, 1992). Srinivasan et al. (1983) were able to demonstrate empirically that the predictive power of a full-profile Conjoint Analysis can be improved by including constraints on the ordering of part-worths. A similar approach was developed by Van der Lans et al. (1992), who used self-explicated attribute level desirability ratings and self-explicated attribute importance ratings in order to develop constraints for their prediction model. This concept is also applied in Adaptive Conjoint Analysis and Hybrid Conjoint Analysis, where information on the ordinal structure of attribute-levels and relative importance of attributes are individually identified and incorporated into the estimation procedure (Allenby, Arora, & Ginter, 1995).

If explicit consideration of such constraints in the estimation improves predictive validity, this also means that an estimation procedure which does not include such constraints will at least sometime produce results which contradict these preferences, and is therefore less reliable. Similarly to RQ1, we can assume that the presence of implausible alternatives will increase this inconsistency. Therefore we formulate:


                     RQ2: 
                     Do utility functions estimated using implausible alternatives exhibit more contradictions with stated or generally plausible rankings of attribute values than utility functions estimated using only plausible alternatives? (Consistency with intra-attribute preferences)
                  

The part-worths assigned to different levels within each attribute represent intra-attribute preferences. In a similar way, the part-worths assigned to the best value in each attribute correspond to the implicit attribute weights, and therefore represent inter-attribute preferences. Trade-offs between attributes are inherently subjective, and there is usually no universally accepted ranking of the importance of attributes. However, such a ranking can also be directly obtained from subjects. Answers to such questions on the importance of attributes can provide at least a rough indication of the ordering of weights that should be present in the utility function. For instance, when a consumer makes a direct statement that he/she values store size more than product quality, the same preference should be mirrored in his/her elicited value function. Consequently, any contradiction between stated inter-attribute preferences and implicit weights could also be seen as an inconsistency in the elicitation process, and we again consider such inconsistencies to be more likely if subjects are confronted with implausible alternatives. We therefore formulate our third research question as:


                     RQ3: 
                     Do utility functions estimated using implausible alternatives exhibit more contradictions with stated rankings of the importance of attributes than utility functions estimated using only plausible alternatives? (Consistency with inter-attribute preferences)
                  

@&#METHOD@&#

To answer our research questions, we performed an empirical study in a typical application area of Conjoint Analysis. Following recent research streams in marketing (e.g., Darian, Wiman, & Tucci, 2005), we used a store choice problem as an application example. An essential step is the identification of the relevant attributes that are responsible for forming the consumers’ preferences and therefore have to be included in the stimulus set.

In recent years, a comprehensive body of literature was devoted to identify those attributes that consumers typically evaluate while making their food store choice decision. For example, Seiders, Simonides, and Tigert (2000) identified location convenience, product and service quality, price level, and assortment (i.e., store size) as those attributes which consumers most often consider. More recently, a similar result is provided by Solgaard and Hansen (2003). By estimating a model of consumers’ preferences for alternative store formats, the authors were able to identify price level, assortment, and distance as the most important drivers of store choice. Further studies have examined the role of product assortment (Grewal, Levy, Mehrotra, & Sharma, 1999), price format (Bell, Ho, & Lattin, 1998; Colla, 2003; Darian et al., 2005), customer service, product quality (Darian et al., 2005), and other situational factors (e.g., Mattson, 1982). In accordance with the above mentioned literature, and a recent literature review of Pan and Zinkhan (2006), who analyzed major determinants of retail choice, we have selected (1) the size of the store, (2) the walking distance to the store from home, (3) the product quality, and (4) overall price level to model store choice (see Table 1
                      for a description of the attributes and their levels). As discussed above, the two attributes product quality and price level are negatively correlated for most of the consumers. Even though both attributes are quite valid and important for store choice when considered separately, many combinations of their attribute levels derived with an orthogonal design are not believable for consumers.

For our research question, this set of attributes has the advantage that it contains both attributes for which a plausible, objective ranking of values exists, and one attribute for which this is not the case. It is quite reasonable to assume that consumers would prefer shorter distances over longer distances, lower prices over higher prices and high quality over low quality. For store size, no such universal ranking exists. A large supermarket may be desirable for one consumer because it furnishes him/her with a great product variety. At the same time another consumer dislikes large stores as they do not give him/her the opportunity for fast shopping. We therefore included an explicit question about the ranking of values in this attribute in the questionnaire.

The experiment was performed as part of an undergraduate course in business administration at the University of Vienna and subjects participated for course credits. Subjects were recruited from an introductory course not related to marketing and were not familiar with Conjoint Analysis or the subject of this study. Respondents had to download a standardized questionnaire from an online platform, complete it and hand it in within five days. This procedure leads to a high response rate and ensured a large sample size with minimum time and effort. As our research questions were methodological and not substantive, a convenience sample (student sample) was appropriate. A total of 223 respondents (41% male, 59% female; average age 23) were recruited for participation and subjects were randomly assigned to two comparison groups for the plausible (n
                        =112; 39% male, 61% female; average age 23) and the implausible (n
                        =111; 42% male, 58% female; average age 23) design.

Participants of our study were exposed to one out of two different standardized questionnaires. These questionnaires consisted of the following three parts:
                           
                              (a)
                              Respondents first had to express their shopping behavior (i.e., how many times a week they attend a supermarket). Then, respondents had to perform a direct ranking of the four attributes store size, walking distance to the store from home, product quality and overall price level. This first part of the questionnaire was identical for both groups. The preference statements are later used as basis for analyzing consistency between indicated inter-attribute preferences and estimated utility functions.

The main part of the survey was an implicit ranking task. Respondents were asked to rank nine alternatives (hypothetical stores) contained in the respective stimuli set. This part of the questionnaire was different for the two comparison groups. The “Implausible” group was confronted with the original fractional factorial design generated by SPSS (nine different profiles to estimate the main effects). The “Plausible” group had to rank the plausible stimulus material, in which unrealistic profiles of the implausible material were modified to increase credibility (see Tables 2 and 3
                                 
                                  for the two different stimuli sets).

After the ranking task, respondents had to state their intra-attribute preference for store sizes (small, medium, and large supermarket). Finally, respondents were asked several demographic questions (gender, age, size of household, amount spent for food per week, occupation). Again, this part of the questionnaire was identical for both groups.

Research question RQ1 refers to dominance between the alternatives presented to subjects. Dominance can only be established if the ranking of outcomes within each attribute is known. While a plausible ranking can be assumed for the attributes distance, price, and quality, this is not the case for store size. However, both stimuli sets contain dominating alternatives for different preferences with regard to store size. If a subject prefers small over large stores, then alternative number 4 in the implausible stimulus set would dominate alternative number 1. If a subject prefers large over small stores, then alternative 1 would dominate alternative number 7. Thus, all subjects are confronted with one instance of dominance. Similarly, in the plausible stimulus set, if a subject prefers larger over smaller stores, alternative 2 would dominate alternative 8, otherwise, alternative 4 would dominate alternative 6.

To answer research question RQ2, we need to determine whether the elicited utility functions of respondents are compatible with plausible or specified rankings of attribute values. A straightforward approach to test for consistency would be to first estimate the part-worths, and then check whether they reflect the presumed ordering. However, this approach is not suitable for our problem. Since subjects had to rank only nine stimuli, preference statements provided by subjects in many cases do not define an utility function uniquely. Several utility functions compatible with a subject’s preference statements might exist. The fact that one estimated set of parameters does not exhibit certain properties does not mean that preferences implied in these choices are necessarily incompatible with those properties.

Therefore, we take a different approach and try to find utility functions, which are at the same time compatible with the subject’s preference statements and exhibit the desired properties. If such a function cannot be found, the subject has definitely violated the requirements. Our approach is formally related to methods of decision making under incomplete information like the UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      method of Greco et al. (2008), but operates at a different level: While UTA
                     
                        GMS
                      considers possible or necessary outrankings between alternatives (depending on whether a preference is established for all or at least for one vector of preference parameters), we consider whether a certain preference within one attribute, or a certain ranking of attributes, is compatible with at least one parameter vector that is also compatible with the subject’s responses.

Denote the part-worth assigned to outcome j in attribute k by v
                     
                        j,k
                     , and the index of the outcome of alternative A in attribute k by j
                     
                        k

To check consistency of stated preferences with the assumption of an additive utility function, finding any solution to system (2) would be sufficient. However, one can gain additional information by selecting one particular solution, which maximizes the minimum slack to the constraints defined by (2). Adding explicit slack variables to (2), we obtain the following model:

Since s could be arbitrarily increased in model (3), scaling of the utilities has to be taken into account. We scale the utility function so that the ideal alternative having the best outcome in all attributes is assigned an utility of one, and the anti-ideal alternative receives an utility of zero. By adding these constraints and substituting s into the constraints, we obtain:

                     . By allowing s to take on negative values, model (4) covers both the case that the subject’s stated preferences are compatible with an additive utility function and the case of incompatibility. If s
                     >0 in the optimum, then the preferences are compatible and the resulting utility function corresponds to a central point in the polyhedron in parameter space defined by the constraints of (4). If s
                     <0, the subject’s preferences are incompatible with the additive model. A similar approach is used to select a “representative” utility function in some variants of the UTA method (Beuthe & Scannella, 2001; Greco et al., 2011). If the objective value is positive, it can be considered as a measure of the size of the polyhedron. It can therefore be used to measure the amount of information that can be obtained from the subject’s preference statements in a similar way as the volume of the polyhedron in Vetschera (2009).

Inter-attribute consistency (RQ3) requires that the weights reflect the importance of attributes as indicated by the subject. Assuming that attributes are numbered by decreasing importance, this can be represented in the model by adding the constraints

                      explains how these models are used to check consistency of stated preferences with the various characteristics we analyze. Solving a model which contains only constraints derived from the preference statements (but which neither restricts weights to a particular ranking of attributes nor the part-worths within an attribute to a certain ordering) tests compatibility of stated preferences with the additive model in general. If this model has a feasible solution, preferences are compatible with the additive model. Then specific constraints relating to either a ranking of weights, or a ranking of part-worths within some or all attributes, or both, are added to the model. If the model remains feasible, stated preferences are compatible with the considered property, otherwise, they are not.

To test consistency with the dominance condition (RQ1), we examined whether the preferences indicated by subjects violated the dominance relations indicated in Section 5, depending on the subjects’ stated preferences for store sizes. We then applied a χ
                        2 test to verify the significance of results. The outcomes of this analysis are presented in Table 4
                        .

In contrast to our assumptions, the implausible group shows a lower level of dominance violation (9.0%) compared to the plausible group (17.9%). This result is significant at an alpha level of 10% at p
                        =0.053. One explanation for this result could be that implausible alternatives caused subjects to examine the alternatives in more detail, which then also led them to discover dominance. Since this phenomenon was also found in our analysis of the other research questions, we will offer alternative explanations later.

To test the consistency of the ranking provided by subjects with pre-specified preferences (RQ2 and RQ3), we used six variants of model (4). We tested three levels of consistency with respect to intra-attribute preferences. In the first level (M1), no intra-attribute constraints were specified. In the second level (M2), we added constraints of type (7) for the attributes price, distance, and quality. Part-worths in these attributes were required to indicate that subjects prefer lower prices, shorter distance and higher quality. In the last level (M3), we added the preferences for different store sizes indicated by the subjects in the third part of the questionnaire. Concerning inter-attribute preferences, we used one variant without constraints on attribute weights, and one variant using constraints (8) to represent the ordering of attributes provided in the first part of the questionnaire. Models containing inter-attribute constraints are labeled M1R, M2R, and M3R, respectively.

Results are shown in Table 5
                        . A subject is classified as consistent if the objective value in the solution of the model is non-negative. Table 5 reveals two interesting effects. In models which do not constrain inter-attribute preferences, there is a clear difference between the two comparison groups. Contrary to our expectations, subjects who had to rank implausible alternatives responded more consistently than subjects facing plausible alternatives. This tendency is strongest in the first model. All subjects given implausible alternatives responded in a way compatible with an additive model, while about a third of the subjects facing plausible alternatives were not consistent. The difference between the two groups slightly decreases as the requirements on intra-attribute preferences become more complex, but they remain significant for all models. These effects are reflected in the optimal objective values also shown in Table 5.

Adding constraints for inter-attribute preferences led to a considerable decline in consistency for both groups. This result is consistent with existing literature on the relationship between stated “importance” of attributes and attribute weights elicited by other methods, which has shown only a weak relationship between the two concepts (Grigoroudis & Spyridaki, 2003; von Nitzsch & Weber, 1993; Weber & Borcherding, 1993). There are no significant differences between comparison groups for these models.

As Table 5 already has shown, there are also considerable differences between the models, which indicate that maintaining consistency is more difficult for some problem characteristics than for others. Table 6
                         compares the different levels of intra-attribute consistency. Comparing model M1 to model M2, and model M1R to model M2R, shows that requiring plausible ranking of part-worths in the attributes price, distance, and quality significantly reduced the number of consistent subjects. Thus, responses from a significant number of subjects are compatible with the additive model only when assigning implausible part-worths in at least one of these attributes. This result holds for models with and without inter-attribute constraints, and for both experimental groups. In contrast, requiring intra-attribute consistency in store size had only one weakly significant effect (in the implausible group without inter-attribute preferences). However, we tested this attribute only in model M3, which also contained the constraints for all the other attributes. Thus, it seems that subjects who behaved consistently with respect to plausible preferences in the attributes distance, price, and quality also had no problems in maintaining consistency with their stated preferences for store size.


                        Table 7
                         performs a similar analysis for inter-attribute preferences. Requiring consistency of estimated weights with the stated importance of attributes significantly reduced the number of consistent subjects in almost all cases, the single exception being the first model in the plausible group. This confirms the result already observed in Table 5, that maintaining consistency with the stated importance of attributes is difficult.

Subjects were more consistent in ranking the set of implausible alternatives than in ranking the plausible alternatives. There are several possible explanations for this surprising result. If subjects perform better in one task than in another task, this might be due to different levels of effort by the subjects, or due to different levels of difficulty of the tasks. The first explanation would imply that implausible stimuli caused the subjects to think harder about how to rank those alternatives. Therefore, they made fewer mistakes and behaved more consistently.

The second explanation would imply that it is easier to rank implausible alternatives than to rank plausible alternatives. Plausible alternatives represent trade-offs and are good in some attributes, and bad in other attributes. Implausible alternatives might have very good or very bad outcomes in all attributes, and are thus easy to rank exactly because they are implausible. Therefore, plausible alternatives should have utility values close to each other, while utility values of implausible alternatives are more different.

To test this explanation, we need utility values. Although we do not know the true utility functions of subjects, each model generated one possible utility function for each subject. Using these utility functions, we calculated both the minimum utility differences between two neighboring alternatives in the subjects’ rankings, as well as the utility difference between the best and worst alternatives. Table 8
                         shows these values for the utility functions obtained from model M1 (which did not impose any constraints), and model M3R (which imposed all intra- and inter-attribute constraints). We applied the utility functions of each subject to both sets of stimuli. Median utility differences are given for all subjects and for consistent subjects.


                        Table 8 shows that the explanation that the ranking problem involving implausible alternatives is easier to solve than the problem involving plausible alternatives cannot be ruled out. The utility differences between the best and worst alternatives are significantly larger in the implausible set of stimuli for both utility functions. The minimum difference between two neighboring alternatives is significantly larger for the utility functions from model M1, but not for M3R. However, it should be kept in mind that these utility functions are to a certain degree arbitrary. They correspond to the center of the polyhedron defined by the constraints of model (4), but the polyhedron contains other solutions, too. Since model M3R is more restricted than model M1, one could argue that the parameter vector estimated using model M3R is likely to be closer to the subject’s true utility function than the parameters estimated using model M1. This argument, however, is only valid for consistent subjects. If a subject’s responses are not consistent with the model, the polyhedron is empty, indicating that there is no clear information about the location of the true parameter vector (if it exists at all; the subject’s preferences might also be incompatible with the additive model).

Taking this argument one step further, one can consider the size of the polyhedron defined by (4) as an indicator of how difficult it is to solve the ranking problem. An obvious ranking between two alternatives (like stating that the ideal alternative is better than some other alternative) does not provide any information and thus does not reduce the polyhedron. The smaller the polyhedron becomes, the more information is obtained, and probably the more difficult the ranking statements were for the decision maker. Of course, this is again only an approximation. Even an “obvious” choice might lead to a constraint which cuts the polyhedron close to the subject’s true parameters and thus involve a tight comparison between two alternatives. Nevertheless, the size of the polyhedron as indicated by the objective value s could be an useful approximation of the difficulty of the problem.

We therefore compared the objective values of both groups of stimuli in all models. The distributions of these objective values are shown in Fig. 2
                        . A Wilcoxon test indicates that differences in objective values are significant for all models which do not impose inter-attribute preferences, but are insignificant for the models involving inter-attribute preferences. These models constrain the feasible set so strongly that differences resulting from the set of stimuli are obliterated.

In our experiment, we tested the effect of presenting implausible alternatives to subjects on three types of consistency of responses and the elicited utility functions: Consistency with the principle of dominance, consistency with (stated or reasonable) intra-attribute preferences, and consistency with stated inter-attribute preferences. By considering three different types of consistency, we were able to draw a more differentiated picture of the impact of implausible alternatives on utility elicitation than previous studies, who only considered the impact on consistency with later choices in a holdout sample.

As our results show, this more differentiated picture indeed offers additional insight: The effects of implausible alternatives are different for inter-attribute and intra-attribute preferences. While consistency with intra-attribute preferences was significantly different between comparison groups, we did not find an effect on consistency with inter-attribute preferences. Our differentiated view thus can offer an explanation of the inconsistent finding in previous studies, where sometimes an effect was found and sometimes not. Of course, the question why the presence of implausible alternatives in a sample has more impact on intra-attribute preferences than on inter-attribute preferences warrants further investigation. A tentative explanation could be the discrepancy between elicited attribute weights and stated importance of attributes that has been found in other studies (Grigoroudis & Spyridaki, 2003). If attribute weights do rarely correspond to stated importance in general, this will hold independently of whether weights are elicited using plausible or implausible alternatives. Following a similar argument, trade-offs between different attributes are more difficult to evaluate than a ranking of outcomes within one attribute. This problem might be so difficult that other problem characteristics like the presence or absence of implausible alternatives do not have a strong impact on how the problem is solved, while they make a difference in the easier within-attribute problem.

Another major and unexpected result of our experiment is the fact that subjects confronted with implausible alternatives provided more consistent answers than those evaluating only plausible alternatives. We have discussed several possible explanations in Section 6. Our explanations are of course only tentative and require further work. Ideally, a comparison between plausible and implausible alternatives should be performed in a setting where utility differences among alternatives are the same in the two comparison groups. Unfortunately, constructing stimuli sets with identical utility differences would require a priori knowledge of the subjects’ utility functions, which are elicited during the experiment. Therefore, a design which contains exactly equal utility differences seems to be hardly possible, but in some way this problem should be addressed in future experiments.

In interpreting our results, one should also keep in mind that we defined “consistency” exclusively within the framework of an additive utility model. Although our results indicate that preferences of a large fraction of our subjects can be represented by an additive model, this does not imply that the additive model accurately reflects the true preferences of our subjects. Indeed, one could interpret the fact that parameters estimated for our subjects did not reflect plausible or stated intra- or inter-attribute preferences as an indicator that the additive model is not the correct one to represent our subject’s preferences. We cannot rule out the possibility that consistency defined in terms of an entirely different preference model would also lead to different results. However, given the widespread use of additive models both for modeling consumer behavior and for decision support, studying factors that impact the elicitation of parameters for this model is of importance.

Additional experiments could also help to overcome other limitations of the current study. We used only one decision problem of a given size and complexity, thus the question remains open whether the same effects would be observable in considerably more or less complex problems. Furthermore, although the problem we were using was definitely familiar to our subjects, and reflected their everyday lives, selecting a store for shopping is probably not a very important decision for them. Thus, the level of involvement in filling out our questionnaires might have been low, and subjects could have exhibited a higher level of consistency in problems which are more important to them. Extending our research in these directions could lead to more insights on the effects of implausible alternatives, and to better tools for generating stimulus sets in preference elicitation and Conjoint Analysis.
