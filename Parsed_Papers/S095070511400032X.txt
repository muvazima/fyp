                  Purpose
                  This paper aims to develop and compare several elicitation criterions for decision making of incomplete soft sets which are generated by restricted intersection.
               
               
                  Design/methodology/approach
                  One time elicitation process is divided into two steps. Using the greedy idea four criterions for elicitation of objects are built based on maximax, maximin, minimax regret and combination of expected choice values and elicitation times. Then these initial unknown values which produce incomplete values together with known information are in priority.
               
               
                  Findings
                  Fast methods for computing possibly and necessarily optimal solutions before or in the elicitation process are invented. As far as the sizes of soft sets used in the simulation experiments, it is found statistically that we should choose the criterion based on the combination of expected choice value and expected elicitation times in the first step of one time elicitation.
               
               
                  Practical implications
                  The developed methods can be used for decision making of incomplete 0–1 information systems, which are generated by the conjunction of two experts’ incomplete 0–1 evaluation results. Whenever the available information is not enough for choosing a necessarily optimal solution, the elicitation algorithms can help elicitate as few unknown values as possible until an optimal result is found. An elicitation system is made to show that our elicitation methods can potentially be embedded in recommender or decision support systems.
               
               
                  Originality/value
                  The elicitation problems are proposed for decision making of operation-generated soft sets by extracting from some practical problems. The concept of expected elicitation times of objects is defined and used for developing one type of elicitation strategy.
               
            

This section mainly focuses on the motivations of this paper’s subject. Firstly two cases in practice are given. Then we make an introduction to soft sets. At last by describing the problems in the two cases with soft set model, we propose the elicitation problems to be dealt with in this paper.

                         is the set of parameters describing conditions such as air humidity, traffic facilities, price of land, labor price. There are two investigators Alice and Bob. They have made their incomplete evaluations which are shown in Table 1
                        , where.

                              in each bracket:

the first value refers to the opinion of Alice and the second value refers to that of Bob.

1 means appropriate (positive) and 0 means a negative answer.

0.5 means incomplete evaluation.

the value outside each bracket is equal to the minimum of the two values inside the bracket. This means that a certain choice is appropriate with respect to a certain condition if and only if the two investigators are both satisfied with that. In the situation when Alice is satisfied with certain condition of one choice and Bob has not given his opinion on this, the integration of their evaluations should be incomplete. Obviously, once Alice says no for a certain condition of one choice, the final integration must be negative no matter what the opinion of Bob is.

                         is equal to 2. However, the real decision values of the other objects are unavailable due to the incomplete information. In this example all of these 4 choices are possible to one of the optimal solutions under usual additive model and no one of them must be an optimal solution of the real situation. If we want to make approximate reasoning, which one should be an approximate solution? If we want to make exact reasoning, which investigator should give evaluation on which unknown value?

The evaluation results of the two interviewers can be given by two 0–1 valued tables, where the rows correspond to the job hunters, the columns correspond to the above four abilities. 1 means good, 0 means not good. The final evaluation matrix is got by 
                           
                              min

                         mean four graduates. In this situation the job interviewers have to make efforts to know some of these unknown values. So who should do elicitation work? And about which unknown value? We need an elicitation algorithm for guiding this work.

Soft set theory was initiated as a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness by Molodtsov [27]. The theory of soft sets [24,26] has potential wide applications in fields like game theory, operations research, decision making and so on. Many researchers have studied soft set based decision making [4,11,14,15,19–23,25,30,32,34]. For instances, soft sets theory have been used to evaluate business competitive capacity [37] and make combined forecasting approach [38].

However, soft set may be incomplete. Take the soft set in Table 2 for example, the businessman in real estate may cheat customer or refuse to show the required certificates. Thus people have to make some efforts to consult relative government departments. Similarly whether there will be subway built nearby, for some houses it is hard to say. We have to consult the municipal construction planning.

By comparing Tables 1 and 2, it is easy to see that the tabular representations of evaluation matrixes of Alice and Bob in Case 1 can be regarded as incomplete soft sets. A complete evaluation from Alice or Bob can both be regarded as complete soft sets. Similarly for Case 2. What is more, the integration method can actually be modeled by the restricted intersection operation of two soft sets.

As an abstraction of the questions in Case 1 nd Case 2 in the context of soft set theory, we assume such a situation in which the unknown information of incomplete soft sets can be accessed under certain conditions. For example, we can pay for that. We are to find at least one solution which must be an optimal solution of the real soft set no matter what the missing values are. So we need an elicitation algorithm. Simply speaking, we need to answer which unknown value to elicitate first. Such algorithm should be better in the sense that we need to elicitate as few unknown values as possible. Elicitation strategies for soft constraint problems with missing preferences have been studied by Gelain et al. [17] and Pini et al. [29]. The difference is that we are dealing with elicitation problems of incomplete 0–1 information systems [28] which are generated by another two ones.

Why we choose soft set model? The reasons are as follows.
                           
                              •
                              In real practice, Alice and Bob may evaluate different set of parameters. And the integration method may have some other models rather than the min operator (conjunction). In soft set theory these situations have already been studied in soft set theory [26,3]. Researchers always discuss operation models whenever they have proposed a new generalized soft set model [24]. Generally speaking, these usual binary operation models of soft sets are extended union, restricted union, extended intersection, restricted intersection, AND product operation and OR product operation [13]. Every kind of operation model can characterize one of people’s decision making schemes. For instances, decision making methods have been proposed by using the product operation model of soft sets [12,16,18].

The study of incomplete soft sets have also been studied to some extent. It was initiated by Zou and Xiao [39], where for incomplete soft set, the decision value of an object with incomplete information is calculated by weight-average of all possible choice values of the object. Qin et al. [31] proposed a data filling approach for incomplete soft set in which missing data is filled in terms of the association degree between the parameters. This method is good when objects in U are related with each other.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 makes a formal introduction to basic concepts needed in this paper. Section 3 brings in several elicitation methods. Section 4 shows results of simulation experiments. In Section 5 a system which can implement our elicitation algorithms is built. Finally, we come to a conclusion of this article and outlook for potential future work.

The operation models of complete soft sets can be easily adapted for incomplete soft sets with min and max operators.

The evaluation matrixes of Alice and Bob in Case 1 can be seen as incomplete sets S (the fist values inside the brackets) and T (the fist values inside the brackets), then Table 1 (values outside the brackets) shows 
                              
                                 S

                            are two incomplete soft sets over U. We assume that the unknown values of S and T are known by others. And we know nothing about the probabilities of those unknown values being 0 or 1.

What kind of elicitation methods should we use?

If for certain reason the elicitation process of P cannot be continued before we find a necessarily optimal solution, how can we make approximate reasoning (i.e., find an approximate solution)?

                         whose corresponding unknown values we should elicitate first. Then we decide the parameter 
                           
                              e
                           
                         and choose one element of 
                           
                              Orig
                              .
                              
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              (
                              H
                              (
                              e
                              )
                              (
                              u
                              )
                              )
                           
                         to elicitate.

For the first step, we try to use greedy algorithm, but we need to propose several quantitative indicators before that.

It is assumed that we know nothing about the probabilities of these unknown values being 0 or 1, so it is supposed that each unknown value of S or T has equal probability 0.5 being 0 or 1. This dates back to Pierre Laplace and Jacob Bernoulli, who maintained that complete lack of knowledge about the likelihood of world states should be equivalent to all states having equal probability (quoted from [9], Page 46).

As we have explained above, the expected choice values and expected elicitation times of objects are closely related with the initial unknown values from S or T.

The idea of maximin was proposed by Ward [36]. Wald’s maximin model is a non-probabilistic decision-making method according to which decisions are ranked on the basis of their worst-case outcomes. That is, the best (optimal) decision is one whose worst outcome is at least as good as the worst outcome of any other decisions (quoted from Wikipedia). Maximax criterion is the optimistic counterpart to maximin.

The minimax regret criterion [2,5] minimizes the maximum regret, i.e., minimizes the worst-case loss with respect to all possible realizations of the choice value function. Savage [33] described Minimax regret criterion first in the situation of uncertainty over world states. Recently it has been proposed for accounting for a DSS’s uncertainty regarding DM’s utility [35,6–8]).

In the elicitation process of P, after each time we have elicitated an unknown value, we should refresh the incomplete soft set P. However, we need not to compute choice value function of P repeatedly. In this subsection we give an efficient algorithm for computing

                                 Approximate decision making methods
                              

If for certain reason the elicitation process of P cannot be continued before we find a necessarily optimal solution. Then we need to choose one object as an approximate solution. According to the above quantitative indicators, we give the following approximate decision making methods.

                         We used Matlab (R2013a) to generate a complete soft set

                        , we generated a new matrix by changing some entries of the initial 0–1 matrix as

In this section we will introduce the potential applications of our theory. We have also constructed a simple system to show that our methods can simply be implemented.

In general, our theory developed in this article can be applied in a kind of problems which can be described by a multi-tuple

                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         are the corresponding sets of parameters. So these two incomplete evaluation matrixes can be combined together by different kinds of operations defined in soft set theory. As to the question of which operation to choose, it is up to the real problem being dealt with.

Once the final evaluation matrix is generated, we use the additive decision making criterion by Definition 2.5. However, the final evaluation matrix may be incomplete. We can compute the set of possibly optimal solutions and the set of necessarily optimal solutions in an efficient way. If the set of necessarily optimal solutions is empty and further elicitation is permitted (which means we can ask the experts to evaluate the incomplete values again on certain conditions), our elicitation algorithm can help us elicit as less unknown values as possible.
                           Example 5.1
                           Alice and Bob are the hostess and host of a family. They have a robot. The robot need to do things for the family members. So the robot must be able to make the right decision. When the robot is making a decision, the robot need to consider the favorites of the host and the hostess.

The family need a mobile phone. They want their robot to buy one for them. When the robot is in the mobile phone market, the robot has a list of favorite types to choose from. Each types of mobile phone should be valuated on the following aspects: running speed, price, material, appearance color, memory, camera function. The robot may have some knowledge or experiences about the host and the hostess. For example, the robot may knows that his host likes the color of blue and his hostess likes the color of red. That is to say, the robot evaluates according to the way of this owners, respectively. Then the robot integrates his evaluation matrixes in the way of restricted intersection. For certain reasons, the robot may not know some information for certain aspects. So robot my need to ask some information from the host or hostess. But the host and the hostess may not want to be bothered so much. So in this time the robot may need an efficient elicitation algorithm to decide whom to ask and which information to ask. See the sketch map in Fig. 6
                        .

Our theory can be implemented over software systems so that the decision making criterions in this article can be applied conveniently in real practice. We have built a system constructed with a function written in matlab language. After running this function, we get a system whose user interface is shown in Fig. 7
                        :
                           
                              1.
                              We can see that it is generated in Matlab environment.

This system is named an elicitation system for operation-generated incomplete soft sets.

They are two buttons where we can input the unknown evaluation matrixes by expert1 and expert2.

The string “result” will become “matrix1” or “matrix2” depending on whose unknown value to elicit. If there is no need to elicit, the string result will remain the same.

A place where we can see the total number of elicitation times done since the beginning of eliciting process on the left of symbol “/ ”. The number appearing on the right of the symbol “/ ” equals to 
                                    
                                       E
                                       (
                                       S
                                       
                                       ⋒
                                       
                                       T
                                       )
                                    
                                  (here S and T mean the incomplete soft sets represented by matrix1 and matrix2).

A place where we show the matrix and the unknown value our elicitation algorithm suggests to elicit.

These two buttons correspond to the extended and restricted intersection operations. To be more explicit, for instance, extended union means the two initial matrixes are combined by extended union operation.

We can start solving a new problem after pressing this button.

For example, We input two incomplete matrixes shown and chose the extended intersection operation. Then the user interface is shown by Fig. 8
                                 :

Our elicitation algorithm suggested to elicit the unknown value (bold, italic and enlarged) in matrix1.

The total number of unknown values in the initial matrixes is equal to 11.

The part of parameters (Written by Pset for short) expert2 can evaluate (i.e., that is what 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             E
                                          
                                          
                                             2
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  means in this section).

After we clicked the number 0.5 shown by “9” in Fig. 8, the user interface changed, see a local part of it in Fig. 9
                                 :

A new window where we can input the elicited value.

After we have input the elicited value (here the elicited values were given randomly just for the show of our system), we pressed the same operation button. We repeated this process until there existed at least one necessarily optimal solution, see Fig. 10
                                 :

We can see the total number of elicitation times on the left of the symbol “/ ” when there existed at least one necessarily optimal solution.

It told us that the elicitation process was terminated and the set of all necessarily optimal solutions were listed.

0–1 Information systems are used to describe objects with respect to different attributes or parameters. They are simple but actually very popular and useful. Sometimes decision makers (including people, intelligent robots, e-commercial recommending systems or something else) need to combine different 0–1 information systems from different resources of data. A decision should be made by integrating or combining these different information systems. At the same time, information systems may be incomplete and some information may be costly to find out what on health they are. Our decision making criterions both in approximate and elicitation problems can help solving this kind of things. So it will be interesting to apply our theory to electronic commerce recommendation systems [1,10] and intelligent robot systems.

The main innovative points of this paper consist of the following aspects:

                               and 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          σ

                                                1
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               of an incomplete soft set S over U are already known, we can figure out the sets of possibly optimal solutions and necessarily optimal solutions in linear time with respect to the cardinality of U. What is more, in the elicitation process we have developed an algorithm for computing 
                                 
                                    NOS
                                    (
                                    S
                                    )
                                 
                               by avoiding repeated computation.

By using the greedy idea we explore four criterions for elicitation of objects based on maximax, maximin, minimax regret and the combination of expected choice values and elicitation times. As far as the certain sizes of soft sets used in the simulation experiments, it is found statistically that in the first step of one time elicitation the criterion based on the combination of expected choice value and expected elicitation times is better.

We have built a system which can implement our decision making algorithms. This can enable the applications of soft sets theory in real practice.

For further study, here are some potential work:


                     Cost-based elicitation model: in this paper we do not discuss about the cost of money or time for elicitation process. In fact it is practical that different unknown values may cost different money and time to elicitate. That is one of directions in which our work can be extended.


                     Top-
                     N-decision making method: in practice, we may need more than 1 solution. We may want to find the top N objects with respect to the choice value functions. In this situation obviously we will have to elicitate less unknown values. Because once 
                        
                           |
                           POS
                           (
                           P
                           )
                           |
                        
                      becomes smaller than N, we can stop the elicitation process for the elements of 
                        
                           POS
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                     . We will deal with its details in future work.
