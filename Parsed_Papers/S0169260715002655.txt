                  It is desirable to reduce the excessive radiation exposure to patients in repeated medical CT applications. One of the most effective ways is to reduce the X-ray tube current (mAs) or tube voltage (kVp). However, it is difficult to achieve accurate reconstruction from the noisy measurements. Compared with the conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm leading to the excessive noise in the reconstructed images, the approaches using statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) with low mAs show greater image quality. To eliminate the undesired artifacts and improve reconstruction quality, we proposed, in this work, an improved SIR algorithm for low-dose CT reconstruction, constrained by a modified Markov random field (MRF) regularization. Specifically, the edge-preserving total generalized variation (TGV), which is a generalization of total variation (TV) and can measure image characteristics up to a certain degree of differentiation, was introduced to modify the MRF regularization. In addition, a modified alternating iterative algorithm was utilized to optimize the cost function. Experimental results demonstrated that images reconstructed by the proposed method could not only generate high accuracy and resolution properties, but also ensure a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in comparison with those using existing methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

X-ray computed tomography (CT) is used in a rapidly increasing host of imaging applications, especially for applications in image-guided intervention where repeated scans are required and the subsequent accumulated radiation dose could be substantial [1–3]. However, excessive X-ray radiation dose exposure to patients caused by repeated CT scans could result in significant risk to get genetic and cancerous diseases [4,5]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to study the low-dose CT imaging, which can be achieved through lowering the X-ray tube current (mAs) or tube voltage (kVp) and simultaneously reducing the total number of X-ray views per rotation around the body [6–9]. Generally, for a given set of noisy and sparse-view projection data, the associated image quality of results reconstructed by the conventional analytical reconstruction methods is degraded [10]. To reconstruct high-quality CT images from undesirable projection data, various reconstruction methods with varying degrees of success have been proposed in recent years [11–19]. Among these, SIR algorithms show superiority over the conventional FBP method due to the statistical modeling of projections and imaging geometry. Specifically, the cost function for SIR methods comprises two major parts. One part is the data-fidelity term which can be used to model the statistics of measurements. The other part is the regularization term which may be utilized to regularize the solution and reflect the prior information at the same time.

Many advanced SIR methods achieve satisfactory reconstructed images by introducing different regularizations, which mostly include smooth regularizations [20–23] and edge-preserving regularizations [24–28]. More broadly, the academic attention to regularizations covered the entropy prior, Gamma prior, MRF-based priors, TV-based regularizations, nonlocal-means (NLM)-based priors, dictionary learning (DL)-based regularizations, and patch-based roughness regularizations, etc. In general, the Gaussian and Gamma priors enable the pixel values to approach the mean value of the image. For this reason, the pixel values could be kept from “blowing up”, but image smoothness cannot be well implemented [21,22]. By adjusting weighting coefficients, Wang et al. [23,24] proposed an improved MRF prior, which utilized the anisotropic weighting coefficients while retaining the quadratic-form potential function. Recently, many NLM-based SIR methods [25–28] were proposed and worked well. Inspired by the study on sparse and redundant representations over dictionary learning, Xu et al. [29] proposed to utilize the DL-based sparsification as the regularization for CT reconstruction. In addition, to improve the image quality of reconstructed results, Lu et al. [30] proposed a modified DL-based regularization which combine a transitional dictionary for atom matching and a global dictionary for image updating. Moreover, through training a multi-scale dictionary, Bai et al. [31] proposed a multi-scale DL-based regularization for SIR method which perform well on details extracting and resolution maintaining. For edge-preserving regularizations, a typical example is the TV-based regularization. Tian et al. [32] proposed to preserve the edges by the EPTV term which can preferentially perform smoothing only on the non-edge part of the image. Alternatively, Liu et al. [33] proposed the adaptive-weighted TV(AwTV) regularization for SIR methods which outperforms TV-based and EPTV-based methods due to the consideration of the anisotropic edge property. However, these methods often lead to “staircase effects” and the appearance of noticeable blocky or patchy artifacts in the reconstructed images. Other attempts have been carried out on the research of high-order TV [34], TV-strokes [35] and CT reconstruction methods via TGV [36,37], which aimed to reduce the staircase artifacts without sacrificing edge sharpness.

In this paper, a novel regularization scheme was proposed by modifying the conventional MRF regularization with the edge-preserving TGV, in order to eliminate the undesired artifacts and preserve the edges and details. Specifically, the TGV, which is a generalization of TV and capable to measure directional features and image high-order characteristics, was introduced into the novel MMRF regularization, aiming to incorporate smoothness up to a certain differential order, while still accounting for edges. Subsequently, a modified alternating iterative algorithm was adopted to optimize the associative objective function and to help design new algorithms. In summary, we proposed a modified-MRF (MMRF) regularization for the SIR algorithm via the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria, which was defined as “SIR-MMRF”, to suppress over-smoothing and eliminate the undesired patchy artifacts that appeared in low-dose CT reconstructed images. Experiments on different phantoms were designed to validate the validity of the approach.

                           jk
                         denotes the interaction degree between the central pixel j and its neighboring pixel k, and is usually considered to be inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between the two pixels. Through calculating the weighted sum of the potential function on the different neighboring pixels, the quadratic regularization provides the smoothed prior information. Due to the lack of global connectivity, however, over-smoothing often appear in the edges or fine structures of the reconstructed images.

The concept of TGV was first proposed by Bredies [38]. Unlike TV, which only considers first-order derivatives, TGV utilizes high-order derivatives. TGV is a widely used regularizer to measure image characteristics up to a certain order of differentiation in image processing. Mathematically, TGV for a given image

                        . Previous work [22] showed that a stable convergence solution could be obtained only if the corresponding objective function in Eq. (2) were concave, which indicates that the regularization term R(
                           f
                        ) in Eq. (2) should be convex. This convexity is proved in the following step. Like the method described in Ref. [40], suppose ψ(Δ) is convex, we easily get

                        we can solve the data-fidelity term constrained problem (P1) by iterative operation, but the obtained virtual solution may yield a noisy result. Then with the virtual solution of (P1) as initial value, we solved (P2) and (P3) and obtain a more precise solution, in which the noise-induced artifacts can be remarkably suppressed. In the implementation, we used the separable paraboloidal surrogates method [16,22,42,43] to solve (P1)

To evaluate the performance of the proposed SIR-MMRF method, in this work, different simulation experiments were carried out by using the novel SIR-MMRF, the classical FBP algorithm, the quadratic-MRF regularization constrained SIR method (denoted by SIR-QMRF), and the TV regularization constrained SIR method (denoted by SIR-TV). The experiments were based on both numerical and clinical datasets. Fig. 1
                     (a) shows the computer simulated Shepp–Logan phantom, and Table 1
                      shows the detailed parameters of the ellipsoids in the Shepp–Logan head phantom.

Where 
                        A
                      is the additive intensity value of the ellipse, 
                        a
                      and 
                        b
                      are the lengths of the horizontal and the vertical semi-axis of the ellipse, respectively. Moreover, 
                        x0
                      and 
                        y0
                      are the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the center of the ellipse. And 
                        phi
                      is the angle (in degrees) between the horizontal semi-axis of the ellipse and the x-axis of the image. Fig. 1(b) shows the pelvic phantom image obtained originally from the clinical actual sinogram data and then reconstructed by the FBP method with an optimized Hamming filter. The sinogram data was obtained using a Siemens CT machine with a tube current of 100mAs and tube voltage of 120kVp. Fig. 1(c) shows actual head CT phantom image obtained by the same method to obtain the pelvic phantom image. The actual projections were acquired at a configuration of 160mAs and 120kVp. All the reconstructed images were composed of 256×256 pixels with size of 1.0mm×1.0mm. Through sampling, we obtained the insufficient measurements for the head CT phantom from different sparse-views (30-, 60- and 120-view), and there were 256 detectors at each view. Due to the parallel beam scanning of scanning mode, this work, we can easily calculate the system matrix 
                        h
                      and the noise-free projections for the three models by Eq. (1). Specifically, the sparse-view projections for 30-, 60- and 120-view were sampled evenly over 180 degrees. Through adding non-stationary Gaussian noise into the ideal projections, the low-dose CT sinogram for the Shepp–Logan head phantom (shown in Fig. 2(b)) could be simulated, using Eq. (3) where ς
                     
                        i
                     
                     =200, η
                     =22000 (See Ref. [44] for the noise characteristic of low-dose CT projections and parameters setting). All experiments were performed using Matlab R2008b under the environment that OS: 32-bit; Windows 7; CPU: Intel Core (TM) 2 Duo, 4G RAM HD 4600.

The hype-parameter β
                        1 controls the regularization intensity between the data-fidelity term and the regularization term of the objective function in Eq. (16), and it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution. Large β
                        1 value lead to low-noise and low-resolution reconstructed images which were over smoothed. Small β
                        1 value lead to reconstructed images with relatively high-noise and high-resolution. In this work, we evaluated the selection of β
                        1 by visual observation and quality evaluation. To yield a desirable result, we use the solution obtained in (P1) as the initial value of (P3), so that we could soon get a stable convergence solution for (P3). The iterative procedure would lead to an unsteady solution when the two step-size determinants δ and τ were large, whereas a significant steady solution can be easily obtained when their values were small. In this current study, mesh-size k

                         were selected by the method described in Ref. [38].

Furthermore, three quantitative assessment criteria were utilized to evaluate the performance for different reconstructed images. The universal quality index (UQI), which measures the similarity between two images. Note that a great similarity to the ideal phantom image can be expressed by a closer to one UQI, of which the values range from 0 to 1. UQI can be calculated by

RMSE describes how close a reconstructed image is to the original phantom. A smaller RMSE value indicates a better quality of the reconstructed images. The optimal β
                        1 value was the parameter that offered the lowest RMSE and the highest PSNR.

In this paper, we selected RMSE and the iteration number as the stop criterion for iterative procedure. As seen in Fig. 3(a) the RMSE curves of the iteration for SIR-QMRF, SIR-TV and the proposed SIR-MMRF methods, we found that SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF could obtain steady solutions after some iteration and the iteration number could be chosen according to the convergence rate. The iteration number is 200 for all experiments in our study. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed method could also be explained by the objective function value curve of SIR-MMRF (shown in Fig. 3(b)).

                           Fig. 4
                            shows the Shepp–Logan images reconstructed by the FBP, SIR-QMRF, SIR-TV, and SIR-MMRF methods, as well as the difference images between different reconstruction results and the original image, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a1) and (a3), serious noise-induced streak artifacts appear in the FBP reconstruction image. Owing to the statistical modeling of the obtained noisy measurements, the image reconstructed by SIR-QMRF (Fig. 4(a2)) performs better than that by FBP, but the performance in noise-reduction is really bad. It is easily observed from the first two columns of Fig. 4 that images reconstructed by the other three regularization-based SIR algorithms outperform image by the FBP method in both noise-reduction and artifacts-suppression. Compared the first row with the last three rows of Fig. 4, significant improvements for images reconstructed by the SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF methods can be seen. Different regularization-based SIR algorithms result in reconstructions with different performances in image quality. So, it is very necessary to study regularizations for the SIR algorithms. Considering that parameter-setting significantly affects the quality of the images reconstructed by different methods, we performed experiments in different cases as a fair comparison. Through parameter adjustment, SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions with the same UQI could be obtained. Specifically, the second row of Fig. 4 shows SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions, which were not enough-smoothed. Visually, the SIR-MMRF reconstruction (Fig. 4(b2)) has less patchy artifacts than the SIR-TV reconstruction (Fig. 4(b1)) and many patchy artifacts appear in the difference image of SIR-TV (Fig. 4(b3)). The third row of Fig. 4 shows SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions, which were enough-smoothed. Both the SIR-TV reconstruction (Fig. 4(c1)) and SIR-MMRF reconstruction (Fig. 4(c2)) have good noise-reduction performance, but there are still some patchy artifacts indicated by arrow appear in the results by SIR-TV (Fig. 4(c1) and (c3)). It is seen in both the reconstructed images and the difference images that the results by SIR-MMRF (Fig. 4(c2) and (c4)) perform better in edge- and detail-preserving. The last row of Fig. 4 shows SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions, which were over-smoothed. Even though the reconstructions were over-smoothed, SIR-MMRF reconstruction (Fig. 4(d2)) has better edge- and detail-performance compared with the SIR-TV reconstruction (Fig. 4(d1)). As indicated by the arrow, the ellipses in the third row of image reconstructed by SIR-TV are over-smoothed and difficult to separate.

To further evaluate the performance of the SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstruction images, Fig. 5
                            shows the zoomed Shepp–Logan region-of-interest (ROI, as indicated in Fig. 1(a)) images for images (shown in Fig. 4(b1), (c1), (d1), (b2), (c2) and (d2)) reconstructed by SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF, respectively. As seen from the SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions in the first column of Fig. 5, many blocky artifacts appear in the middle of the two spheres, as indicated by the arrows. Obviously, the reconstruction of SIR-MMRF performs better in artifacts-suppression than that of SIR-TV. In other cases, it is found that the SIR-MMRF reconstructions have better performance in edge- and detail-preserving. For example, comparing the over-smoothed results of SIR-MMRF to those of SIR-TV, the edges of the sphere or the details in the SIR-TV reconstruction are to some extent deformed, while those in the SIR-MMRF reconstruction are well preserved as indicated in the third and the last columns of Fig. 5.


                           Table 2
                            shows the PSNR, RMSE and UQI values of images reconstructed by SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF (shown in Fig. 4(b1), (c1), (d1), (b2), (c2) and (d2)) using the Shepp–Logan head phantom. When the UQI values of SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF reconstructions are the same, it can be found that the PSNR and RMSE values have different performances in different cases. The PSNR values of SIR-MMRF reconstructions are higher than those of SIR-TV reconstructions in all cases, which means that the SIR-MMRF reconstructions perform better in noise-reduction. Secondly, the RMSE values of SIR-MMRF reconstructions are smaller than those of SIR-TV reconstructions. As mentioned earlier, a smaller RMSE value indicates a better quality of the reconstructed images. Obviously, the SIR-MMRF reconstructions perform better than the SIR-TV reconstructions in all cases.

In the following part, numbers of experiments were performed to explore the performance of results reconstructed with different parameters. β
                           1 is the common parameter of SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF. To search the optimal β
                           1 for SIR-MMRF, first we fixed α
                           0, α
                           1 and other parameters and searched step by step to find the optimal β
                           1 which offered the lowest RMSE and the highest PSNR. Similarly, the optimal β
                           1 for SIR-TV could be found. Fig. 6
                            shows the PSNR and RMSE curves for SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF results reconstructed with different β
                           1. In addition, it is found in the experiments that the solution of (P1) were slightly affected by the value of β
                           1, when 0.001≤
                           β
                           1
                           ≤0.01. Although the parameters only for SIR-MMRF consist of α
                           0, α
                           1, δ and τ, the performance of reconstructions was mostly affected by α
                           0 and α
                           1. As mentioned earlier, large δ and τ would lead to unsteady solution, while a significant steady solution could be easily obtained with small δ and τ. The two step-size determinants δ and τ were selected by the method described in Ref. [38] i.e., mesh-size k
                           =1, 
                              
                                 δ
                                 =
                                 τ
                                 =
                                 1
                                 /
                                 
                                    
                                       12
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . To search the optimal α
                           0 and α
                           1, we fixed β
                           1 in the range that solutions of (P1) were less sensitive to the value of β
                           1 and studied the solution of (P3) with different α. Suppose α
                           0
                           =3*
                           α, α
                           1
                           =
                           α, Fig. 7
                            shows the PSNR and RMSE curves for SIR-MMRF results reconstructed with different α, when β
                           1
                           =0.005. It was found that small α and large α both lead to bad results.

Another assessment parameter is the modulation transfer function (MTF) [18,36] which indicates the spatial resolution characteristics of images. It can be divided into three steps for the MTF computation: firstly, we should obtain the edge spread function (ESF) along the profile as indicated by the short line in Fig. 1(a); secondly, we need obtain the line spread function (LSF) which can be calculated by the derivation of ESF; finally, we should apply the Fourier transformation to the LSF, then we could obtain the MTF. In order to make sure that MTF(0)=1, we normalized the MTF in this work. Fig. 8
                            shows the MTFs obtained by different methods. It can be observed that the SIR-MMRF results yield a relatively good image resolution.


                           Fig. 9
                            shows the results of the actual pelvic phantom reconstructed by the FBP, SIR-QMRF, SIR-TV, and SIR-MMRF methods, as well as the difference images between different reconstruction results and the original image, respectively. As in the experiments of the Shepp–Logan head phantom, the same conclusion that images reconstructed by the other three regularization-based SIR algorithms outperform those by the FBP method in both noise-reduction and artifacts-suppression could be drawn. Serious noise-induced streak artifacts appear in the results of FBP (Fig. 9(a) and (e)). The SIR-QMRF results (Fig. 9(b) and (f)) outperform the FBP results in strip artifacts-suppression, but the performance in noise-reduction is really bad. Significant improvements for images reconstructed by SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF can be seen in Fig. 9(c) and (d). It is obvious that there are patchy artifacts appear in SIR-TV result, seeing the area indicated by arrows (Fig. 9(g)). Seen from the ROIs (as indicated in Fig. 1(b)) of Fig. 9(d), the reconstruction of SIR-MMRF perform well.


                           Table 3
                            shows the PSNR, RMSE and UQI values of images reconstructed by the FBP, SIR-QMRF, SIR-TV, and SIR-MMRF methods (Fig. 9(a)–(d)) using the pelvic phantom. Firstly, by taking the PSNR values into consideration, it can be found that the PSNR value of the image reconstructed by the SIR-MMRF method is the highest compared with those of images reconstructed by other three methods. Secondly, good structural similarity of the reconstructed results can lead to a relatively high UQI value. The image reconstructed by the SIR-MMRF method obtains the highest UQI value. Furthermore, the RMSE value of the result of SIR-MMRF is the smallest compared with those of images reconstructed by other methods. As mentioned above, a higher UQI value indicates a better similarity to the ideal phantom image, and a higher PSNR value indicates a better noise-reduction characteristic.

The first and second columns of Fig. 10
                            show the head CT images reconstructed by the SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF methods from noisy projections in cases of 30-, 60- and 120-view, respectively. It is found that the fewer the projection views are, the more severe the images are polluted. For example, obvious artifacts, serious structural-damage and detail-loss can be observed in the 30-view results. In terms of noise-reduction and artifact-suppression, the image quality improves as the view numbers increase. It illustrates directly that the under-sampling degree of the measurement data affect the quality of reconstructed images. To further visualize the differences between the images reconstructed by SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF, The third and fourth columns of Fig. 10 show the difference-image between the original head CT image (shown in Fig. 1(c)) and the images reconstructed by different methods. We can observe the superiority of the proposed SIR-MMRF method not only in the reconstructed images, but also in the difference images. Obviously, images reconstructed by SIR-MMRF outperform images reconstructed by SIR-TV and show the least difference value with the original phantom in all cases (30-, 60-, and 120-view).

For further comparison, we used PSNR and RMSE to illustrate the quantitative performance of the head CT images reconstructed by the SIR-TV and SIR-MMRF methods from sparse-view projections. It can be seen from Table 4
                            that, under the same case (30-, 60-, or 120-view), the PSNR value of SIR-MMRF reconstruction is higher than that of SIR-TV reconstruction. It means that the SIR-MMRF results have better ability of noise-reduction. In parallel, the RMSE values of SIR-MMRF results are lower under each case (30-, 60-, or 120-view), compared with RMSE values of images reconstructed by SIR-TV. It illustrated that the reconstructed images by SIR-JR are much closer to the original image.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

The regularization term plays an important role for SIR-based X-ray CT accurate image reconstruction methods, which accounts for the ability of artifacts-suppression and noise-reduction. Recently, many regularization terms have been proposed to improve the reconstruction efficiency. Among them, TV-based SIR methods (SIR-TV), which allow for a discontinuity function space that usually occurs on image edges, can obtain reconstructed images without the accompanied noticeable artifacts, compared with traditional quadratic regularization-based SIR methods. However, due to the assumption of piecewise constancy in TV, SIR-TV results always suffer from undesired patchy artifacts. Inspired by the well-behaved TGV algorithm, by which the intensity variations in smooth regions can be more precisely expressed and sharp edges can also be well preserved at the same time, we presented a modified Markov random field (MRF) regularization based on SIR algorithm (SIR-MMRF) for low-dose CT reconstruction in this work.

Experimental results of different models show that SIR-MMRF reconstructed images are superior in both noise reduction and edge-preserving. Simulation experiments among SIR-QMRF, SIR-TV, and SIR-MMRF also indicated that reconstructed images by SIR-MMRF show better quality in visual analysis and quantitative analysis than those by other methods. As described in Section 3, the MTF, UQI, PSNR and RMSE results without exception demonstrated that our method yielded satisfactory reconstructed images in which the patchy artifacts at the smooth regions were eliminated and the details around the edges were well preserved. As to the proposed SIR-MMRF algorithm, we should discuss the following six related parameters, that is, β
                     1, κ, δ, τ, α
                     0, α
                     1. In this work, the regularization intensity is controlled by β
                     1, which was manually selected through visual observation for good-quality results and further determined by two assessment criteria (PSNR and RMSE) simultaneously. In the TGV iterative procedure, we use the same method utilized in optimizing β
                     1 to determine κ, which is a balancing parameter related to noise level and gradients. Moreover, we obtained the optimal δ, τ, α
                     0, α
                     1 by the method described in Ref. [38].

In this study, through investigating CT reconstruction methods that could suppress over-smoothing and eliminate the undesired patchy artifacts, we proposed an modified-MRF (MMRF) regularization constrained SIR algorithm via the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria, which is defined as “SIR-MMRF”. This new method overcomes the shortcomings of patchy artifacts in results reconstructed by TV-based SIR algorithm. The reconstructed images by SIR-MMRF algorithm show excellent performance in terms of visual evaluation and quantitative evaluation. Further research is necessary to present superior methods that have broader applications.
