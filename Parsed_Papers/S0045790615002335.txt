                  In this paper, we address the problem of broadcast routing and scheduling of video streaming for delay-sensitive applications in backbone wireless mesh networks. Given a source node and a set of destinations, we aim to build a broadcast tree and compute an optimal schedule such that the throughput for the source to broadcast streaming data to all the destinations is maximized. We divide the whole period for video broadcast into identical time frames and prove that maximizing the throughput can be converted into minimizing the length of a time frame. We propose a three-step method as a solution. Firstly, we build the broadcast tree by defining a new routing metric to select relay nodes. Then we use local search method to adjust the tree structure. Last, we propose a greedy method to schedule concurrent transmissions. Simulations have demonstrated that our method can improve the performance significantly compared with existing methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless mesh network (WMN) is a promising key technology for next generation wireless communications and has recently attracted much attention from both the academic and industrial communities. A wide range of applications for broadband multimedia in WMNs, such as electronic classrooms and webcast, are time-critical [1]. These applications are bandwidth hungry and they impose a stringent requirement on communication delay. Broadcast operation is regarded as a key requirement for such kind of services by simultaneously delivering the same video content to all the receivers. In WMNs, the gateway node usually acts as the source of the broadcast and send packets to all the mesh routers that are connected to it [2]. Thus, to enhance the broadcast efficiency for video streaming in such networks is an important task. In this paper, we study the problem of rate-adaptive broadcast routing and scheduling for video streaming to improve the throughput of delay-sensitive applications in backbone WMNs.

Supporting high-quality broadcast for video streaming over wireless networks is nontrivial. Since we consider rate-adaptation in our system, this is a difficult issue in data broadcasting. On one hand, if we use low data rate to broadcast the packet, more nodes will be covered at the expense of transmission delay. On the other hand, if we include less nodes in a broadcast, the transmission can be done in a much shorter time due to high data rate but it needs more relay nodes for forwarding the packets. The problem is further complicated by inter/intra-flow interference caused by video streaming. For the sake of smooth video playing at the receiver, the source node usually generates a new packet and broadcasts it to the network at regular intervals. Hence, many different packets will be transmitted in the network simultaneously. The interferences come from not only the transmissions of the same packet on different routing paths but also the transmissions of the different packets along the same routing path. Based on the difficulties mentioned above, it is necessary to design efficient broadcast routing and scheduling method for avoiding inter/intra-flow interference to improve the network performance.

The problem of our concern is as follows. Given the gateway node as the source node and a set of mesh routers as destinations in backbone WMNs, our task is to build a broadcast routing tree and compute an optimal transmission schedule such that the throughput for the source to broadcast streaming data to all the destinations is maximized. We divide the whole period for video broadcast into identical time frames. In each time frame, all the non-leaf nodes in the tree can broadcast a packet to its child nodes successfully without causing interference. With the same transmission scheduling in each time frame, the broadcast of video streaming is of pipelined production. Then the objective of maximizing the total throughput can be converted into minimizing the length of a time frame.

We formulate the problem of minimizing the length of a time frame as a mixed integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) and show its NP-hardness. A three-step heuristic method is proposed to tackle this problem. We first define a new routing metric called per receiver delay to build the broadcast routing tree. Then, we do fine adjustment of the tree structure to reduce the interference. Last, we propose a scheduling method by computing the maximum weighted independent set of the conflict graph constructed based on the obtained routing tree in the first step. Even though extensive research has been done on the issue of video broadcast [3–5], to our best knowledge, this is the first work that considers broadcast routing and scheduling for video streaming in the context of rate adaptation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related work is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the system model and problem formulation. The proposed broadcast routing and scheduling method is given in Section 4 and simulation results are shown in Section 5. Finally we conclude this paper in Section 6.

Broadcast scheduling is a fundamental problem in multi-hop wireless networks. The objective of a broadcast schedule is to deliver a message from a given source to all the other nodes in the network in a minimum amount of time with the constraint that parallel transmissions cannot interfere with each other [6]. So, far, there have been a growing class of works done to solve the problem of minimum latency broadcast scheduling (MLBS). Gandhi et al. [7] proved the MLBS problem to be NP-complete and then presented an approximation algorithm for one-to-all broadcasting. Their algorithm simultaneously achieves a constant approximation ratio both for the latency as well as the number of transmissions. In [8], the authors studied the problem of minimum latency gossiping (i.e., all-to-all broadcast) in the unit-size message model and the unit disk graph model. They proposed a heuristic algorithm with approximation ratio of 27. In [9], the authors studied the broadcast scheduling in 2D and 3D wireless sensor networks. They devised efficient coloring methods for coloring a hexagonal tiling in 2D plane and a truncated octahedron tiling in 3D space. A latency-efficient broadcast schedule is proposed in [10] by using special geometric properties of independent sets of a broadcast tree to reduce the number of transmissions and the possibility of collision in duty-cycled wireless networks. However, all above works only focus on one packet broadcast scheduling without considering the routing issue.

Rate adaptation is one of the important techniques to improve system performance in wireless networks. The authors in [11] proposed a collision-aware rate adaption scheme, called CARA, to maximize the throughput in wireless local area networks. The main idea of CARA is that the transmitter station can adaptively differentiate frame collisions from frame transmission failures caused by channel errors. In [12], Wong et al. suggested that each sender should select the best data rate and adapt to the channel quality at different time in different locations without explicit information feedback from the receiver. The study of [13] describes the design and implementation of a new routing metric based not only on expected cooperative transmission time but accounts for queueing and backoff delays in the path selection process, with the aim of selecting a minimum end-to-end delay path for multi-rate WMNs. The work in [14] studies the tradeoff between maximizing the average rate utility per user and minimizing the temporal rate variability by considering both rate adaptation and admission control for wireless video streaming. The authors in [15] formulated a generic cross-layer flow-based framework to obtain the achievable throughput rates by jointly optimizing the parameters for multi-path routing, scheduling, rates, transmit powers, and selection of cooperative nodes. They solved the problem optimally to obtain the max–min throughput for the case when cooperation is based on the distributed Alamouti code and networks have a mesh-like topology. Different from above works on unicast transmissions, our work discusses routing, scheduling and rate adaptation for minimizing broadcast latency.

With regard to routing and scheduling, there have several studies done in recent years. Chou et al. studied the problem of realizing low-latency network-wide broadcast in WMNs where a node can dynamically adjust its link-layer multicast rates to its neighbors and proposed efficient routing, multicast grouping and scheduling algorithms to solve the problem [16]. In [17], aiming to minimize both the total transmission delay and the number of transmissions, the authors constructed a breadth-first-search (BFS) tree and presented a distributed scheduling algorithm without taking rate-adaptation into consideration. They also extended the problem to the case of multi-radio, multi-channel and multi-rate WMNs [18]. The study of [19] formulates joint routing and scheduling problem for multi-radio multi-channel mesh and finds concurrent transmission pattern which is transmission rates associated with links that can be scheduled simultaneously. The authors in [20] proposed a joint traffic-oblivious routing and scheduling algorithm which can accept any or even no traffic estimation and can still provide efficient routing paths and schedules. However, all the above works only focus on the broadcast of one packet and the proposed method cannot directly used to handle inter-flow and intra-flow interference caused by video streaming.

Video streaming over wireless networks has become an active research topic recently. The authors in [3] proposed a distributed media-aware rate allocation scheme for multi-user video streaming with the objective of minimizing the total video distortion of all participating streams. In [4], the authors formulated the scheduling as a convex optimization problem, and propose a distributed solution by jointly considering channel assignment, rate allocation, and routing. The method is a media-aware distortion-fairness strategy and ensures max–min distortion-fairness sharing among multiple video streams. Zhang et al. in [5] studied how to use hybrid MAC protocols to support video streaming in wireless networks. In [21], the authors proposed an efficient rate control scheme to support content-aware video transmission mechanism with buffer underflow avoidance at the receiver. Supratim et al. considered a combination of approaches using multicast, layer encoded video and adaptive modulation of transmissions to improve the performance [22]. Moreover, since part of the work about video broadcast in WMN has been done in our earlier work [23], in this paper, we address this problem by proposing a more accurate model and an effective way to solve it.

In our system model, we consider the most conservative case that two interfering nodes cannot transmit data simultaneously in order to guarantee successful transmissions.

Since the source node continuously generates packets and broadcasts them to the network, it will take a long time to broadcast a video. For the sake of modeling, we divide the whole period into identical time frames. In each time frame, all the non-leaf nodes can broadcast one packet to its child nodes successfully without causing interference. That is to say, all the nodes except the source can receive a packet in a time frame. The length of a time frame, say 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    T
                                 
                                 
                                    f
                                 
                              
                           
                        , is the total delay that all the non-leaf nodes complete their transmissions. With the same transmission sequences in each time frame, the video broadcast is of pipelined production. Thus, we can only focus on routing and scheduling within a time frame.

The traditional scheduling method for one packet broadcast must satisfy the constraint that a node can only start its transmission after it receives the packet and therefore the parent node is always scheduled before its child nodes. However, in video streaming, this constraint can be removed to improve the throughput without increasing the packet loss ratio. Let us see an example. Fig. 1

                              Maximizing the network throughput is equal to minimizing the length of the time frame.
                           

Since we divide the whole period into identical time frames, with the same transmission schedule in each time frame, the video broadcast can be of pipelined production. The three steps for pipeline work are usually loading, saturating and emptying. Let

Constraint (8) is the interference relationship between two transmissions. If two transmitting nodes interfere with each other, they cannot be active simultaneously. Constraint (9) shows that a node cannot transmit and receive packet simultaneously.

Our problem is a mixed integer quadratically constrained program, which is well-known to be NP-hard. Although there are few relaxation techniques for such kind of problems to get the approximate solution, the computing complexity is very high, which is not practical for the gateway to bear enormous calculations due to limited resources. In the following section, we propose a heuristic method with low complexity to solve this problem.

In this section, we present a three-step method to minimize the length of the time frame

                     . We first define the a routing metric called per receiver delay to build the broadcast routing tree. Then, we do fine adjustment of the tree structure to reduce the interference. Last, we propose a scheduling method by computing the maximum weighted independent set of the conflict graph constructed based on the obtained routing tree in the first step.

The goal of tree construction is to select a set of relay nodes and determine their receivers. In order to minimize the length of a time frame, we shall reduce the number of transmissions and increase the data rate of each transmission as far as possible. We hope that one relay node can broadcast packets to more nodes with higher data rate at a time, that is to say, it is better to select the nodes that can cover more nodes with less transmission delay as the relay nodes. To identify these nodes, we introduce the following definition.

                         available in wireless networks, for each relay node, there are at most K different sets of receivers. Based on the definition of PRD, we propose a method for tree construction and show it in Algorithm 1.

The routing algorithm follows a greedy strategy. Let T denote the set of nodes that are already added in the tree and U denote the set of remaining nodes. Initially, T contains only the source node

                        . For each node in T, we try every data rate in R and compute its corresponding PRD value by Eq. (10). Then we select the node that can produce the minimum PRD value as the relay node, add its receivers in T and delete them from U. Repeat the above operation until U is empty, where all nodes in U are added in T. The algorithm finally produces a broadcast routing tree T.

Interference is another important factor that affects the system performance. Enabling more nodes that transmit data simultaneously will lead to the increase of the throughput. To reduce the interference of the nodes in the tree, we first give the following definition.

Based on the above definition, we adjust the tree structure to reduce the node interference. We use local search method to tackle this problem. The whole process is shown in Algorithm 2. For each node in the broadcast tree, change its parent node while keeping the relationship with its child nodes, if the changed broadcast tree meet three specific constraints, we use this new tree instead of the old tree. The three constraints during adjustment are: (1) the total interference is strictly decreased; (2) The network is connected; (3) The sum of PRD value of all the relay node will not increase. Since Algorithm 1 has chosen more effective nodes as the relay nodes, these three constraints can keep the relay nodes as much as possible with fine adjustment of tree structure.

In this section, we aim to schedule concurrent transmissions to minimize the length of the time frame

                        . Although there is no need to follow the constraint that the parent node is always scheduled before its child nodes, the other two constraints must be satisfied during the scheduling: (1) Two nodes interfering with each other cannot transmit at the same time; (2) A node cannot receive and transmit packets simultaneously. Moreover, the second constraint can be combined into the first one according to the definition of interference mentioned in Section 3.1. Similar to the conflict graph constructed in unicast transmission scheduling, we then give the definition of broadcast conflict graph which will be used in scheduling.

Based on Definition 3, we show the scheduling method in Algorithm 3. Let F contains all the non-leaf nodes in the tree

                         and A denote the set of nodes that are transmitting. The whole schedule starts from 0. Initially, all the non-leaf nodes are candidate nodes and ready to be assigned with a start time. We then select the nodes from F that can transmit concurrently with the nodes in A and construct a broadcast conflict graph

                        . These nodes are deleted from F and added into A. Since the data rate of transmitting nodes are different from each other, the ending time of these transmission is also different. Thus, we need to make a new schedule when each relay node completes its transmission. Repeat above operation until every non-leaf node is assigned with a transmission time. The algorithm finally produces a schedule for all nodes in

                        Algorithms 1–4 give a complete solution to do routing and scheduling for video broadcast. The routing tree is first defined and then we do fine adjustment of the tree structure to reduce the interference. Last, an efficient scheduling method is proposed to minimize the total transmission delay. Once we get the routing and transmission schedule of nodes in one time frame, the video broadcast can be pipelined without causing inter-flow and intra-flow interference.

In the simulation, we assume 802.11g protocol is used in the network and the size of transmit packet is set to 1Kb. The wireless nodes are randomly distributed in a 300m

                        300m square region and the source node is randomly picked from the wireless nodes. The number of the nodes varies from 50 to 120. The table of transmission range and interference range by transmission power and data rate is shown in Table 1
                        , which is obtained by Huawei Technologies Co. through outdoor experiments in real environment. For example,

The simulations run on the platform that is implemented in Java and developed by ourselves. In the simulation, the gateway is a central entity to know information of the whole network. The algorithms are executed on the gateway node. The computed schedule is then sent to all the nodes in the routing tree. Based on this schedule, each node knows how long it can start its transmission after it receives the packet. Thus, once the broadcast operation begins, there is no need for relay nodes to coordinate with each other. This method is applicable to the backbone WMN since such kind of network is usually static.

The data input includes the distribution and the number of the nodes, the size of the packet, the transmission power and the defined interference range (Table 1). All the simulations were performed on connected graphs, even in the case that all the nodes are equipped with the minimum transmission power. All the results reported in the following are averaged over 100 network instances.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

We first evaluate the effectiveness of the two routing metrics defined in Section 4, PRD and node interference. The transmission power is fixed as 20dBm. We compare the system performance of the methods with and without tree adjustment. From Fig. 3
                        , we can see that the methods with tree adjustment performs better when the number of nodes increases. The reason that the gap become small when the number of nodes decreases is that the three constraints in Algorithm 2 can keep the relay nodes obtained from Algorithm 1 as much as possible with fine adjustment of tree structure. When the number of nodes is small, there is little space for tree adjustment.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the comparison between two routing metrics by the number of transmissions. Then number of transmissions is also the number of the relay nodes in the broadcast routing tree. From the result, we can see that the tree structure adjustment can reduce the number of transmissions significantly with the increase of the nodes in the network. Less transmissions can lead to less transmission delay, thus, by using both PRD and node interference can produce greater reduction on the length of a time frame.

We then evaluate the performance of our routing by comparing our method with existing broadcast routing methods, such as MCDS (Minimum Connected Dominating Set) in [24] and BFS tree, which are widely used approaches during tree construction. Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         show the results with the increase of number of destination nodes and the transmission power of the node. From the results, we make the following observations:
                           
                              (1)
                              Our proposed method outperforms the other two methods. In addition, MCDS performs better than BFS tree with the increase of the number of destination nodes and the transmission power. The reason is that based on the routing metrics we propose, the nodes that causes few interferences and contribute less transmission delay are prone to be chosen as the relay node. This will speed up the broadcast with more concurrent transmissions. On the other hand, MCDS only focus on the number of receivers that a node can cover without considering the transmission delay and interference.

When the transmission power is large enough, there is nearly no gap between MCDS and our method. This is because by using high transmission power, almost all the nodes can use the highest data rate for transmission, then the metric of PRD is almost equal to the metric in MCDS, that is, the nodes which can cover more receivers have priority to be chosen as the relay nodes.

Last, we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheduling by comparing our method with existing broadcast scheduling method [16,17]. We call the scheduling method in [16,17] 
                        S11 and S12 respectively. The two methods are of one-packet scheduling method for avoiding interference. The transmission power is fixed as 20dBm. Fig. 7
                         shows the results. From the figure, we can see that our method outperforms the other two methods and that S11 performs better than S12 with the increase of the number of destination nodes. The reasons are described as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              Different from the other two broadcast scheduling methods, our scheduling method does not follow the constraint that a node can only start its transmission after it receives the packet and then the parent node is not always scheduled before its child nodes. With relaxation of the constraint, more transmissions can be scheduled concurrently to improve the network performance.

The method in S11 performs better than S12. This is because in S11, the authors introduce a metric to identify the bottleneck node and give the priority for transmission to those bottleneck nodes to improve the network performance.

In this paper, we have studied the issue of rate-adaptive routing and scheduling of video broadcast for delay-sensitive applications in backbone WMNs. Our task is to maximize the total throughput of broadcast for video streaming. The problem is challenged by both rate-adaptive broadcast and inter/intra-flow interference caused by video streaming. We divide the whole time period for video broadcast into identical time frames and in each time frame all the non-leaf nodes can broadcast one packet to its child nodes successfully without causing interference. Thus the problem of maximizing network throughput can be converted into minimizing the length of a time frame. We formulate the problem of minimizing the length of a time frame as a mixed integer quadratically constrained program and show its NP-hardness. We propose a three-step method as a solution. Firstly, we define a new routing metric to select the relay nodes and built the broadcast tree. Then, we do fine adjustment of the tree structure to reduce the node interference. Last, we propose a scheduling method by computing the maximum weighted independent set of the conflict graph constructed based on the obtained routing tree. Extensive simulations have demonstrated that our method can improve the performance significantly compared with existing routing and scheduling methods. In addition, the results also show the effectiveness of the two routing metrics defined in our method.

In the future work, we aim to investigate efficient distributed routing and scheduling methods to solve this problem since it is difficult to perform tight alignment and scheduling across multiple wireless nodes. Moreover, the centralized method also incurs high overhead in trying to achieve the synchronization. We will focus on how a node identifies the time when it can start its transmission only based on its local information.
