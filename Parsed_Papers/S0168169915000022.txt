                  Optimal design and operation of a planned full-scale UASB reactor at a dairy farm are determined using optimization algorithms based on steady state simulations of a dynamic AD process model combined with models of the reactor temperature and heat exchanger temperatures based on energy balances. Available feedstock is 6m3/d dairy manure produced by the herd. Three alternative optimization problems are solved: Maximization of produced methane gas flow, minimization of reactor volume, and maximization of power surplus. Constraints of the optimization problems are an upper limit of the VFA concentration, and an upper limit of the feed rate corresponding to a normal animal waste production at the farm. The most proper optimization problem appears to be minimization of the reactor volume, assuming that the feed rate is fixed at its upper limit and that the VFA concentration is at its upper limit. The optimal result is a power surplus of 49.8MWh/y, a hydraulic retention time of 6.1d, and a reactor temperature of 35.9°C, assuming heat recovery with an heat exchanger, and perfect reactor heat transfer insulation. In general, the optimal solutions are improved if the ratio of the solids (biomass) retention time to the hydraulic retention time is increased.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The aim of this paper is to optimize the design and steady-state operation of a planned full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor fed with dairy cattle waste with 6m3/d available feedstock. The optimization is based on a mathematical model of the reactor comprising a dynamic AD process model combined with models of the reactor temperature and the heat exchanger temperatures based on energy balances. The biological parameters of the AD process model was estimated from experiments on a real pilot reactor using the same feedstock as the planned full-scale reactor.

Three sets of optimization problems are studied: Maximization of the produced methane gas flow, minimization of the reactor volume, and maximization of the power surplus. The biological product considered in the optimization problems is the produced methane gas.

Actually, the real pilot plant in Foss Biolab includes a nitrification reactor used to enhance the quality of the effluent as a biological fertilizer. The planned full-scale plant also includes a nitrification reactor. However, the present study focuses at the energy production – not fertilizer production. Therefore, the AD effluent is taken into account in the present study only through its contribution to the energy balance, and not as a fertilizer.

An early attempt to use a dynamic AD model for optimization of anaerobic digestion (AD) reactors was made by Hill (1983a). In that study, a series of simulations based on the model presented by Hill (1983b) were used to detect the optimum hydraulic retention time (HRT) that maximized the volumetric methane productivity defined as steady-state volumetric methane gas flow divided by reactor volume. The solids retention time (SRT) was assumed equal to the HRT, as in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR).

In the present study, the reactor is a UASB type reactor (Lettinga et al., 1980), having SRT larger than HRT. In UASB type reactors, the dense granulated sludge bed retains the microorganisms, and prevents them from being washed out of the reactor with the effluent. The formation of the granulated sludge is due to flocculation and gravity. Since the SRT is larger than the HRT for UASB reactors, their reactor volume can be made smaller, or, alternatively, their loading (feeding) rate can be higher compared with CSTRs.


                     Poels et al. (1983) reported experiences from AD processing of swine waste on a farm of typical size for Belgium. They emphasized the importance of insulation and preheating the (cold) influent by the (warm) effluent.


                     Bozinis et al. (1996) showed in a simulation study of a hypothetical centralized wastewater treatment plant based on co-digestion of a number of wastewater streams how optimization methods, namely nonlinear programming (NLP), can be used to identify the optimal number of CSTR AD reactors and their volumes that minimize costs. They also showed how to identify the optimal mixing of the wastewater streams that maximize the total COD (chemical oxygen demand) conversion of the plant. Simple steady-state AD process models based on Monod kinetics were assumed.

The methods of formulation and solution of optimization problems for technical systems and industrial plants presented in Edgar et al. (2001) have been useful for the present paper as they are applicable also to biological plants.

The outline of this paper is as follows. A description of the planned AD reactor and the optimization method used are described in Section 2. Optimization results are presented in Section 3. A discussion is given in Section 4, and conclusions are given in Section 5. Mathematical models are presented in Appendix A.

Unless otherwise stated, the numerical values of variables presented in this paper are steady-state values.

MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) is used for numerical computations.

The AD reactor is a part of a (planned) full-scale biological plant for nutrient and energy recovery, named Foss Biolab, situated at Foss Farm, Skien, Norway. A small-scale pilot plant has been in operation for about two years. A description of the pilot plant, including its monitoring and control system, is in Haugen et al. (2013a).

The feed to the pilot reactor, which has 250L liquid volume, is dairy waste diluted with approximately 25% water and filtered with a home-made rotary sieve with mesh-size 1.4mm. The sieve, or separator, removes larger particles to avoid technical problems (the dry-matter from the sieve is used for vermicomposting). The wet-fraction is used as feed to the AD reactor. Feed characteristics from laboratory analysis are presented in Table 1
                        .

The produced biogas consists of approximately 70% methane.


                        Fig. 1
                         depicts the planned full-scale reactor. The figure includes a heat exchanger (however, the pilot reactor has no heat exchanger).

The mathematical model used for optimization of the planned full-scale reactor comprises the following sub-models:
                           
                              1.
                              The modified Hill model of the AD processes adapted to the pilot reactor (Haugen et al., 2013a). For easy reference, the model is summarized in Appendix A.1.

A model of the reactor liquid temperature based on energy balance (Haugen et al., 2013a). The model is summarized in Appendix A.2.

A model of the temperatures of heat exchanger based on energy balances. The model is derived in Appendix A.3.

The modified Hill model is a relatively simple AD process model, however it has been successfully adapted to the real pilot reactor (Haugen et al., 2013a). The modified Hill model is selected in the present study since it is assumed sufficient for model-based optimization of the full-scale AD reactor. The most interesting alternative model is probably the comprehensive ADM1 model (Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1) (Batstone et al., 2002), which, after adaptation to the real pilot reactor, may be used in future model-based studies.

In the following, the optimization variables are characterized as either operational or design optimization variables. The former can be changed while the reactor is being operated, while design optimization variables can be changed in the design or constructional phase.

The various optimization variables shown in Fig. 2, and their constraints, are described in the following.

According to Tchobanoglous et al. (2003), most AD reactors are operated in the mesophilic temperature range which is 30–38°C. For the planned reactor, it is of interest to also investigate temperatures below this range mainly because of the relatively cold climate in Norway. The modified Hill model is applicable for

Above, it is defined as an optimization objective, but it is also used as an optimization design variable in some of the optimization problems.

We think that it makes sense to allow V to become virtually unlimited in the optimization problems. However, a well-defined upper limit is necessary by computational reasons, and to this end we select 700m3, but another very large value might have been chosen.

                                     to b is relatively small for b above 20.

In the majority of the optimization problems studied in the article, b is set to 2.9, the estimated value for the real pilot reactor. The upper limit of b of 20 is questionable, and we do not have real data supporting this limit. However, the main purpose of setting such a specific upper limit is to allow for qualitative results, i.e. demonstrating the importance of attempting to design the reactor so that b becomes as large as possible.


                                    b is a design optimization variable, but may be changed after the reactor has been set into operation. As shown in Section 3, it is beneficial in the optimization scenarios that b is as large as possible. A large b is obtained with a relatively large SRT. Khanal (2008) presents different techniques to increase the SRT for AD reactors, e.g. settling and filtering. For the existing real pilot reactor, granules have been added in an attempt to increase the SRT, however, the effect of adding granules has not been analyzed.

For the pilot reactor, b is estimated from time-series as 2.9 (Haugen et al., 2013a). It is interesting to compare this value with the parameter α estimated in Bernard et al. (2001) where a dynamical AD model which resembles the modified Hill model in important aspects, is adapted to a 0.95m3 real fixed-bed reactor with recycling using wine distillery vinasses as substrate. α is denoted “proportion of dilution rate for bacteria”. It can be shown that

                                    . From real data, α was estimated as 0.5, corresponding to 
                                       
                                          b

                                     which is relatively close to 2.9 which is estimated for our reactor. Although these two reactors differs in many aspects, the resemblance between b and α is reassuring.

the specific heat transfer coefficient of the reactor, is calculated from the value of the real pilot reactor as explained in Appendix A. In optimization problems where perfect thermal insulation of the reactor walls is assumed, U is set to zero. U is a design optimization variable.

                              In an online system for optimal reactor operation, online temperature measurements may be used as inputs to the optimizer.

                            The rationale for this is as follows. It is assumed that the reactor is indoor in a barn or similar. It is assumed that the filtered feed is stored for so long time “inhouse” that

                            are approximately equal. Furthermore, the value of 10°C is a rough estimate of the average for the real pilot plant.

In general, precise solutions are desired. To obtain more precise solutions, the following alternative approaches were tested on some of the optimizations problems: (1) Reducing the range. (2) Improving the resolution by increasing number of grid intervals. (3) Applying a local optimizer (Edgar et al., 2001) with the global optimal solution found with the BF method as the initial (guessed) optimal solution. The fmincon function in MATLAB was used as local optimizer. It was found that the differences between approach No. (3) – using a local optimizer – and the other two alternative approaches were negligible. The computer program implementation of the BF method is considerably simpler and more flexible (scalable) than an implementation using fmincon. Therefore, the BF method, without any local optimizer, is the selected method in this paper.

Due to inevitable disturbances, it may be necessary to retain the optimal solutions using feedback control. Control of the pilot reactor, which is the basis of the planned full-scale reactor, is studied in Haugen et al. (2013b) and Haugen et al. (2014).

The implementation of feedback control may not be trivial. For example, in the optimization problems

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The optimization results in this paper are based on three mathematical models – the AD process model, the model of the reactor temperature, and model of the heat exchanger temperatures. The first two models have been adapted quite successfully to the real pilot reactor (Haugen et al., 2013a). The latter has not been adapted to a physical heat exchanger, and therefore its accuracy can not be stated. However, the underlying modeling principles are assumed reasonable. It is important to recognize that possible limited reliability of the models limits the practical use of the models for the full-scale dimensioning. This limitation applies to model-based design in general.

The modified Hill model, presented in Appendix A.1, is a relatively simple AD process model. In this model,

                      is the only variable which can be used to define the conditions for safe reactor operation, and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S

                                 max

                      has been used as a constraint in the optimization problems discussed in this paper. In other applications, e.g. AD reactors fed with swine waste, it may be important to take other constraints taken into account, e.g. maximum ammonia concentration, minimum pH, maximum propionic to acetic acid ratio, and maximum ratio of intermediate alkalinity over total alkalinity. To these ends, more comprehensive AD models are needed. Overviews of various AD models are given by e.g. (Gavala et al., 2003; Lyberatos and Skiadas, 1999; and Strömberg, 2010). Of particular interest is the comprehensive ADM1 model (Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1) (Batstone et al., 2002), which we may use in future studies. A short discussion of AD models regarded as candidate models for the AD reactor at Foss Biolab, including the ADM1 model, are also given by Haugen et al. (2013a). Although the modified Hill model used in the present paper is relatively simple, we think that the approach to optimization used, is applicable to alternative AD models.

The Brute Force optimization method used in this article is simplistic. However, for the optimization problems studied in this article, this method is sufficiently effective and reliable. For more comprehensive problems with a larger number of optimization variables or a more comprehensive model, alternative global optimization methods may be required (Edgar et al., 2001).

The present study does not address economical optimization, which, in general, involves constructional, capital, and operational cost. The models and results of the present paper may, however, constitute a part of the total model used in economical optimization.

As already stated in Section 1, (Hill, 1983a) seems to be one of the first attempts to optimization of operation of AD reactors. However, optimal design was not covered, and the optimization objective was limited to maximizing the volumetric methane productivity. Our literature search has actually not lead to more recent comparable approaches to model-based optimization of AD reactor operation and design.

It is of interest to compare optimization results of the present article with design parameters of real UASB reactors fed with cattle manure, although these real reactors may not be optimally designed. The HRT is here assumed the most interesting parameter. 
                     Table 4
                      gives a comparison of a few cases. In Maranon et al. (2006), the HRT of 14d was used merely because it worked well in previous similar experiments. In Maranon et al. (2001), a number of different HRT are used, and no reports of reactor failure is reported at HRT=5.3d (the lowest HRT applied). Furthermore, in Maranon et al. (2001), the reactor temperature is not presented, but the feed enters the reactor with temperature of 37°C. The comparison indicates that the theoretical optimization result of HRT=6.1d of the present article is a realistic value. Literature on HRT of other UASB reactors fed with cattle manure has not been found.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Optimal design and operation of a planned full-scale UASB reactor at a dairy farm have been determined using optimization algorithms based on steady state simulations of a dynamic AD process model combined with models of the reactor temperature and the heat exchanger temperatures based on energy balances. Available feedstock is 6m3/d dairy waste.

The optimization solutions have been found using the straightforward “brute force” (BF) method which is based on a scan for the global optimal solution over a grid of the optimization variables. The grid resolution is typically selected as 1/100 of the range of the pertinent variable, giving a sufficient precision of the optimal solution.

For the given AD reactor and its mathematical model, alternative optimization objectives are maximizing

The mathematical model of the AD processes in the reactor is a modification of the model in Hill (1983b), adapted to the pilot reactor (Haugen et al., 2013a). The model is based on material balances of biodegradable volatile solids, volatile fatty acids, acidogens and methanogens, and a calculation of the produced methane gas flow. The model is summarized below.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the heat conduction takes place at all sides of the cylinder. The area-specific heat transfer conductivity, U, is assumed equal to that of the pilot reactor (Haugen et al., 2013a).

The mathematical modeling of the heat exchanger shown in Fig. 1 assumes that the liquid flows are equal to the feed flow,

It is assumed that the heat exchanger consists of two homogeneous volumes: the product volume and the heating medium volume, respectively. The energy balances are:
