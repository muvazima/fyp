                  In this paper we consider characterizations of the robust uncertainty sets associated with coherent and distortion risk measures. In this context we show that if we are willing to enforce the coherent or distortion axioms only on random variables that are affine or linear functions of the vector of random parameters, we may consider some new variants of the uncertainty sets determined by the classical characterizations. We also show that in the finite probability case these variants are simple transformations of the classical sets. Finally we present results of computational experiments that suggest that the risk measures associated with these new uncertainty sets can help mitigate estimation errors of the Conditional Value-at-Risk.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coherent risk measures and their relation to robust optimization have received significant attention in the literature (Artzner et al., 1999; Bertsimas and Brown, 2009; Natarajan et al., 2009; Shapiro et al., 2009; Ben-Tal et al., 2009; Wächter and Mazzoni, 2013). It is known that every coherent risk measure is associated with a precisely determined convex uncertainty set with properties that are strongly tied to the axioms characterizing coherent risk measures (e.g. Bertsimas and Brown (2009); Natarajan et al. (2009)). Similar results have also been given for a special class of coherent risk measures known as distortion risk measures, which include the widely used Conditional Value-at-Risk (Bertsimas and Brown, 2009; Pichler and Shapiro, 2013; Shapiro, 2013). All these characterizations are based on the restrictions imposed by the coherence or distortion axioms on the actions of the coherent risk measure over all possible random variables. However, in many settings, the random variables considered are either an affine or linear function of a, potentially correlated, vector of random parameters. A classical example is portfolio optimization (see for example Markowitz (1952); Konno and Yamazaki (1991); Black and Litterman (1992); Cvitanić and Karatzas (1992); Krokhmal et al. (2002); Zymler et al. (2011); Lim et al. (2011); Kawas and Thiele (2011); Fertis et al. (2012); Kolm et al. (2014)) where the random return of a portfolio is usually modeled as a weighted linear combination of the random returns of individual assets (with weights equal to the fraction invested in a given asset) plus a possibly null constant representing investment in a riskless asset. In this paper we show that imposing the coherence and distortion axioms only on random variables that are a linear, or affine linear function of a vector of random variables allows the inclusion of uncertainty sets that are deemed invalid by the classical characterizations. In particular, we show that in the finite probability case these additional sets at least include certain expansions of the classical sets. We also show that such expansions are in turn related to the common practice of taking the convex combination of a risk measure with the expected value. More specifically, we show that risk measures associated to these expansions are affine combinations of a risk measure with the expected value.

Finally we present computational experiments that suggest that the risk measures associated with these uncertainty sets can help mitigate estimation errors of the Conditional Value-at-Risk.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give some notation and background on risk measures and robust optimization. In Section 3 we show the existence of uncertainty sets that do not fall in the classical characterizations, but do yield distortion risk measures on the subspace of random variables that are either affine or linear functions of a fixed random vector. In Section 4 we show that the risk measures associated to these uncertainty sets are affine combinations of a risk measure with the expected value. Then, in Section 5 we present some results of computational experiments showing that these uncertainty sets could be useful to mitigate estimation errors. Finally, in Section 6 we present some final remarks.

While some characterizations of distortion risk measures are given for more general probability distributions (e.g. see Shapiro 2013 and Pichler and Shapiro, 2013), we now concentrate on the uniform probability distribution with finite support. Results in this section can be found in, or are direct corollaries of results in Bertsimas and Brown (2009).

                            is a permutation matrix; conditions (10e), (10f) and (10i) ensure that

                            while condition (10b) just says that each 
                              v

                            are zero, and thus ensuring that each

Note that in the previous result, (10) having optimal value 0 is not a sufficient condition for Π

                     . However, we show that for a particular 
                        q
                     , problem (10) has non-zero optimal value.

                           . Furthermore, using the exact MIP solvers developed in Espinoza (2006); Cook et al. (2011), we were able to computationally prove that the optimal objective value of (10), for this data, is greater than or equal to 1000.

Note that the exact MIP solvers from  Espinoza (2006); Cook et al. (2011) can only solve linear MIP problems and problem (10) is a nonlinear MIP problem. However, (10) can easily be transformed into a linear MIP as follows. The first step is to linearize the products between Pk
                            and 
                              r
                            in (10b) using a standard technique (e.g. Adams and Sherali (1986)). For this we introduce matrix variables

                     Corollary 3.5 and Lemma 3.7 show that there are indeed reasonable uncertainty sets (distortion risk measures) for random variables in 
                        V
                      and

For this reason, in the next section we present a more practical representation of the uncertainty sets Π

From Lemma 3.7 we know that there exists risk measures represented by 
                        
                           q

                                 Δ
                                 ^
                              
                              N
                           
                        
                      whose uncertainty sets do not coincide with any risk measure in 
                        
                           
                              Δ
                              ^
                           
                           +
                           N
                        
                     . However, it is possible to give a different characterization of these uncertainty sets, providing a natural geometrical interpretation of these measures.

Consider for example the finite uniform probability over the N = 5 points in

In this section we present a computational example that shows that epsilon scalings seem to be less susceptible to estimation errors when approximated using samples. The need for such estimations is common in applications (e.g. Lagos et al. (2011); Vielma et al. (2009)) and, unfortunately, risk measures such as the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure have been shown to be highly susceptible to estimation errors in this setting (Lim et al., 2011). For this reason we study how using the epsilon scaling of CVaR could help alleviate these estimation errors. Following an approach similar to that in Lim et al. (2011) we consider a simple portfolio optimization problem, in which we have d possible assets we want to invest over a single time period, and we have to decide what proportion of our capital we will invest in each of the assets. Every asset i has a return ri
                      ∈ [ − 1, ∞), such that if we initially invested Ci
                      on i then at the end of the period we will have Ci
                     (1 + ri
                     ). When the vector 
                        r
                      ≔ (r
                     1, …, rd
                     )′ of returns is known this problem is formulated as max {
                        x
                     ′
                        r
                      : 
                        x
                     ′

                        x
                      ≥ 0}. Naturally the vector of returns 
                        r
                      is subject to uncertainty, hence it is necessary to adopt some decision scheme that considers the risk inherent to the problem. Let

                      is known, then (11) is a well defined convex optimization problem which can be solved in theory. However, evaluating CVaR requires multidimensional integration and hence solving (11) is, in general, intractable. Furthermore, more often than not, the distribution of 
                        
                           r

                      can only be accessed through a finite number of samples. A common data-driven approach for this issue is to use this finite number of samples to approximate the integrals in the definition of CVaR with the sample mean. This approximation technique is known as Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming and its convergence is assured under very broad settings, see e.g. Shapiro et al. (2009, Section 5.1.1). Assume then that we have a finite i.i.d. sample

Our motivation for this construction can be best illustrated if we consider elliptical distributions, which have the following convenient characterization of

                      that we prove in Appendices  A and  B. The use of this characterization will come from the equivalence between approximating CVaRδ

While the equivalence between (11) and (15) no longer holds for general distributions, (16) might still provide a better approximation than (12)/(13). In particular, it is still reasonable to expect that

We end this section with two observations. The first one concerns the calculation of the scaling factor ɛ for non-elliptical distributions. While Corollary 5.2 no longer provides a precise formula we could still follow its general idea and choose

We begin our experiments with a Gaussian distribution as it satisfies the conditions of Corollary 5.2 and it also allows for the exact solution of (11). To generate the data for our experiments we utilize the same historical data for 200 stocks listed in SP-500 used in Vielma et al. (2008) to estimate the mean vector μ and covariance matrix Σ of these assets. We then assume that the real distribution of the assets is Gaussian with this mean and covariance. Hence, by Lemma 5.1, we have that (11) is equivalent to the second-order conic problem given by

                         as computed by (19), and the diagonal blue line corresponds to equal values for the real and sampled CVaR. As expected (e.g. Shapiro et al. (2009, Proposition 5.6)), the sampled CVaR consistently underestimates the real CVaR and this effect is more significant for δ = 0.01. However, the epsilon scaling tends to reduce this downward bias. More importantly, the epsilon scaling reduces variability of both the sampled and real CVaR of the optimal solutions and tends to provide better solutions to the original problem.

The increased concentration along the real CVaR axis of the epsilon scalings solutions can be particularly advantageous when considering hard-to-solve optimization problems. Estimating the real CVaR of a particular solution can be significantly easier than approximating the whole CVaR function. Hence, if we can generate a relatively large number
                           *

                           Large enough to have variety, but still significantly smaller than all feasible solutions.
                         of potentially good solutions, it is reasonable to estimate the real CVaR and pick the best one. For instance, if we look at the best among the traditional solutions (the blue x further to the left) we can see that it is a relatively good solution. However, generating enough solutions to guarantee we find such best solution may not always be computationally feasible. For example, if we consider portfolio optimization problems with limited diversification or cardinality constraints problem (11) becomes a mixed integer problem that can be very hard to solve (Vielma et al., 2008). Hence, in some cases, a more realistic comparison may be to simulate the effect of solving a single instance of the appropriate optimization problem by randomly selecting one of the traditional solutions (blue x’s) and one of the epsilon scaling solutions (green circles). We explore this evaluation in Table 1
                        where we also study the effect on the results of the number of samples and the number stocks.

                         over the 100 repetitions. This is intended to illustrate the case in which the optimization problem is hard to solve and only one or very few solutions can be generated (i.e. we expect this average to be representative of a typical single solution). Finally, column 
                           
                              z
                              δ
                              *
                           
                         shows the exact optimal value obtained through (19). We can see that the epsilon scaling yields better solutions for all parameters and metrics. This advantage is particularly strong for the metric of average solution and small number of samples and δ. In Appendix  B we show how this advantage is increased further when we allow short-selling in the portfolio problem (i.e. when we remove the non-negativity constraint on x variables).

To study a case in which the conditions of Corollary 5.2 do not hold we repeat the previous experiment assuming that returns follow a uniform and a normal-inverse gaussian distribution. In the first case, each stock has a return

On both cases, even evaluating CVaRδ

We again see that the epsilon scaling provides an advantage, particularly for small number of samples and δ. Furthermore, while the gap between the traditional CVaR and the epsilon scaling is virtually eliminated for very large number of samples (N = 10, 000), the epsilon scaling still provides better solutions in both metrics. Again, results for problems where we allow short-selling are included in Figs. B.1–B.3

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have shown that, at least for finite uniform distributions, the family of uncertainty sets associated with distortion risk measures over affine or linear random variables is strictly larger that those associated with distortion risk measures over arbitrary random variables. In particular, we have shown that certain expansions of uncertainty sets associated with distortion risk measures also yield distortion risk measures over affine or linear random variables. This effectively expands the family of uncertainty sets with favorable theoretical properties. To study the potential advantage of these additional uncertainty sets we have included some preliminary experiments that suggest that these expansions could be useful to mitigate estimation errors.

We finally note that the additional uncertainty sets we have considered still do not give a precise characterization of the family of uncertainty sets associated with distortion risk measures over affine or linear random variables. In particular, it is easy to find examples where the law invariance property is also moot for linear random variables. For example, consider Ω = { − 1, 0, 2} with the uniform probability. In this space a linear random variable is represented by a scalar x and its realizations are given by { − x, 0, 2x}. It is easy to see that the random variables associated with x and y have the same distribution only if − x = 2y and − y = 2x. The only solution to this system is x = y = 0 and hence there are no non-trivial linear random variables with the same distribution. More general settings might not completely eliminate the possibility of non-trivial linear random variables with the same distribution. However, a significant limitation of such random variables could validate the use of additional uncertainty sets. Still, it is likely that any characterization of these yet additional sets will be highly dependent on the specific structure of Ω.
