                  We present a novel approach to feature-aware mesh deformation. Previous mesh editing methods are based on an elastic deformation model and thus tend to uniformly distribute the distortion in a least-squares sense over the entire deformation region. Recent results from image resizing, however, show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels in regions with low saliency lead to far superior preservation of local features compared to uniform scaling — the image retargeting analog to least-squares mesh deformation. Hence, we propose a discrete mesh editing scheme that combines elastic as well as plastic deformation (in regions with little geometric detail) by transferring the concept of seam carving from image retargeting to the mesh deformation scenario. A geometry seam consists of a connected strip of triangles within the mesh’s deformation region. By collapsing or splitting the interior edges of this strip, we perform a deletion or insertion operation that is equivalent to image seam carving and can be interpreted as a local plastic deformation. We use a feature measure to rate the geometric saliency of each triangle in the mesh and a well-adjusted distortion measure to determine where the current mesh distortion asks for plastic deformations, i.e., for deletion or insertion of geometry seams. Precomputing a fixed set of low-saliency seams in the deformation region allows us to perform fast seam deletion and insertion operations in a predetermined order such that the local mesh modifications are properly restored when a mesh editing operation is (partially) undone. Geometry seam carving hence enables the deformation of a given mesh in a way that causes stronger distortion in homogeneous mesh regions while salient features are preserved much better.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The deformation of three-dimensional (3D) models has a wide range of applications in artistic as well as industrial design. Nowadays, the predominant representations of surfaces are triangle meshes which come at high resolution, often acquired using 3D laser scanning, and exhibiting geometric details at various scales. For a deformation technique to be considered useful for editing of such meshes, it is hence crucial that it meets certain requirements: apart from providing visual feedback for interactive application, it should provide easy to control modeling metaphors. Most importantly, it should generate intuitive and predictable deformation results that are physically plausible and aesthetically pleasing. In order to meet these quality requirements, a deformation method has to preserve local characteristics of a surface, i.e., geometric detail or features, under deformation.

This paper presents a novel mesh deformation technique that puts special emphasis on the aspect of feature preservation. Previous mesh editing approaches are mostly based on an elastic deformation model and usually distribute the distortion over the entire deformation region in a least-squares sense. Recent research on image resizing, however, demonstrated that discrete modifications produce results that are far superior to those obtained by applying uniform scaling, which can be considered as the analog in the image processing world to a least-squares deformation in the mesh editing world.

In their work on image seam carving, Avidan and Shamir  [1] insert or delete a connected seam of image pixels in regions with low energy, yielding realistically looking and visually pleasing resizing results. In our work, we transfer the concept of discrete modifications from the image retargeting to the mesh deformation scenario. Our definition of a seam is closely related to the image setting: a geometry seam is a closed and connected path of low-energy triangles and runs through the modeling region of a mesh. Depending on the characteristics of the deformation, geometry seams can be removed from the mesh by collapsing their interior edges and they can be inserted by splitting these edges, which resembles the delete or insert operations in image seam carving. By precomputing a set of low-saliency seams, we can perform deletion and insertion operations at interactive rates. Furthermore, applying the operations in a predetermined order allows us to properly undo previous editing operations and hence to restore the original model. We use a well-established elastic mesh deformation method which we significantly adapt such that it jointly works with this novel plastic and discrete modification scheme which intervenes when the surface distortion exceeds certain thresholds and calls for additional remeshing. This enables editing of a 3D model, thereby distributing the distortion non-homogeneously over the model, and hence causing stronger deformations in low-saliency mesh regions, while features are preserved much better compared to purely elastic mesh editing methods.

There exists a wide variety of surface deformation techniques in the literature which, in order to position our work, we roughly classify into two categories. First, there are general deformation techniques that allow for general editing operations and that distribute the deformation error over the entire object. Second, there exist structure-aware techniques that perform a structure analysis in a preprocessing phase and then restrict the allowed modifications to application-dependent editing operations that preserve the structure-defining mesh features. The first class of methods comprises purely geometric general deformation techniques ranging from surface-based methods (linear as well as non-linear (e.g. Botsch et al.  [2])) over physically based techniques (e.g. Nealen et al.  [3]) to space- or free-form deformation methods (e.g. Bechmann  [4]). Due to their fast, efficient, and robust nature, linear surface-based techniques (see Botsch and Sorkine  [5] for an excellent survey) have been an intensively investigated field in Computer Graphics and object modeling. They usually formulate the surface deformation as a global quadratic variational optimization problem whose solution can be obtained by solving a sparse linear system of equations subject to a set of modeling constraints that are inferred from the user interaction. The deformation error is thereby distributed over the modeling region in a least-squares sense, and the mesh topology remains unchanged. We characterize these methods as elastic deformation techniques, since the deformed models are always elastically distorted versions of the original input geometry. While these approaches generate very intuitive and aesthetically pleasing results for organic objects such as animals, faces, body parts, and so on, they often fail in providing intuitive deformations of man-made objects such as mechanical parts, furniture, architectural models, etc. The latter type of objects usually exhibits flat regions and sharp characteristic features that define the shape of the entire object. When these surface characteristics are distorted, the model’ s defining structure is seriously disturbed. Masuda et al.  [6] proposed a surface-based mesh editing framework that introduces hard constraints into the deformation and hence allows one to rigidly preserve sharp features or hole boundaries under deformation. However, these hard constraints need to be manually selected by the user in a preprocessing step.

The shortcomings of general deformation methods in preserving certain inherent structures of an object gave rise to a research field that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. This second class of deformation techniques focuses on structure-aware shape deformation. They usually analyze the input shape and detect regular patterns (e.g. Pauly et al.  [7], Bokeloh et al.  [8]) or extract a set of characteristic curves that define the surface (e.g. Singh and Fiume  [9], Gal et al.  [10]) in a preprocessing step. The models are then edited by either adding and removing local pattern elements or by manipulating the characteristic curves. However, these techniques are usually targeted at man-made objects, as this class of models typically exhibits the required feature structures. Decomposing a model into its structural elements and replicating or scaling these structures is often applied in architectural applications (e.g. Lin et al.  [11]), as buildings usually exhibit strong regularity. Restricting the type of possible editing operations to these characteristic entities preserves the defining surface structure under editing operations. We characterize the techniques comprised in this second class of methods as plastic deformation methods, since the deformed models are generated by adding or removing certain structures or “surface material” from the original input geometry.

Related to these approaches is the work on non-homogeneous resizing of complex models by Kraevoy et al.  [12]. They detect mesh regions that are likely to suffer from distortion artifacts and embed the model into a protective grid. During resizing, the grid is scaled non-homogeneously while respecting the varying vulnerability, and hence the method distributes the scaling throughout less vulnerable regions of the model. However, the types of supported deformations are again restricted, this time to scaling or stretching along orthogonal directions. General deformations introduced by affine transformations cannot be applied, as the vulnerability map depends on the axis along which the model is scaled. In material-aware deformations by Popa et al.  [13], the deformation error is also distributed non-homogeneously over the model in a way that respects predefined material properties in order to introduce varying stiffness into the deformation.

The observation we share with the second class of editing techniques is that visual artifacts are caused by distorted features, and hence are localized in surface regions exhibiting high saliency, while other regions are less vulnerable to shape distortions. Hence, the deformation should be distributed non-homogeneously over the model, thereby protecting feature parts while others are deformed more excessively. However, instead of using regular patterns or curves as modeling metaphors, or restricting the supported editing operations to certain directions or special transformations, our method uses the well-established handle metaphor that enables the user to apply arbitrary affine transformations to the model. Hence, our approach combines the efficient and very intuitive control offered by the first class of methods, the unrestricted linear surface deformation techniques, with a content-respecting distribution of the distortion as provided by the second class of restricted methods. We combine the advantages of both approaches by augmenting a widely used general and elastic Laplacian-based deformation technique with a novel discrete and plastic mesh modification scheme that adopts the mesh tessellation to the varying degree of surface distortion.

Although we propose a new method for 3D surface deformation, the technique that is most closely related to our work concentrates on 2D image retargeting. In their paper on image seam carving, Avidan and Shamir  [1] present a method for resizing images that respects the image content. A seam is a connected path of low-energy pixels crossing the image from top to bottom or from left to right. By successively removing or inserting seams, the image can be resized in both dimensions. Storing the order of all removing and insertion operations enables multi-size images that can change their size dynamically while their content is preserved as well as possible.

Our novel mesh editing scheme emulates a physical surface deformation process that supports elastic deformation, i.e., compression and stretching of the material, as well as plastic deformation, which we model as addition and removal of material from the model. We model the elastic deformation using a well-known Laplacian surface editing technique which we significantly augment in order to enable it to jointly work with our new plastic deformation scheme. This scheme adopts the mesh tessellation to the varying degree of surface distortion under deformation: our technique adds and removes triangles in low-saliency regions of the model, and hence emulates the process of adding and erasing material in a physical modeling setting.

The input to our mesh editing method is a manifold triangle mesh. An editing operation on this mesh consist of the following steps. 
                        
                           (i)
                           Selection of a region of interest (ROI) (Section  3.1).

Preprocessing phase (Section  3.2): harmonic field on the ROI, evaluation of vertex and edge quality measures, and precomputation of geometry seams.

Mesh editing (Section  3.3): weighted Laplace deformation and plastic seam carving.

A widely used paradigm to edit the shape of a surface is to let the user define a region of interest (ROI) and to edit this region by moving, rotating, or scaling a handle. We follow the approach of Kobbelt et al.  [14], and let the user select the ROI, in the following referred to as the modeling region 
                        
                           M
                        , as well as a handle region by directly painting on the triangles of the input model. The remaining triangles define the fixed region. A typical modeling region is topologically equivalent to a  disk (see  Fig. 1
                        ) where the handle region (green) is enclosed by the modeling region (blue), which itself is enclosed by the fixed region (gray). Hence, the modeling region has two boundary polygons: 
                           
                              
                                 B
                              
                              
                                 
                                    handle
                                 
                              
                           
                         consist of all vertices that lie on the boundary of the handle and the modeling region, while 
                           
                              
                                 B
                              
                              
                                 
                                    fixed
                                 
                              
                           
                         consists of all vertices that lie on the boundary of the modeling and the fixed region. The handle vertices impose boundary conditions on the calculation of the edited surface and change every time the user manipulates the handle. Additional boundary constraints are defined by the fixed vertices, as they remain unchanged during mesh editing.

To transfer the user’s manipulation of the handle to the modeling region, we use the well-known Laplacian surface editing technique of Sorkine et al.  [15]. This technique has to be significantly augmented, since we combine it with our new plastic mesh modification scheme, which then enables a geometry-driven adaptation of the mesh tessellation to the current degree of surface deformation.

In this phase, we precompute a set of closed triangle strips, or geometry seams, that run through low-saliency regions of the mesh’s modeling area 
                           M
                        . The preprocessing comprises three steps. First, a homogeneous field is computed on 
                           M
                        . Second, we evaluate a set of well-adjusted vertex and edge quality measures which are finally used for extracting a set of geometry seams that can be collapsed or split during interactive mesh editing later on (see Section  3.3).

In the first preprocessing step, we compute a harmonic field 
                              H
                            on the modeling region 
                              M
                            and then trace a set of contours along and across 
                              H
                           . The harmonic field

We precompute a set of connected and closed triangle strips, so-called geometry seams, within the modeling region of the input mesh (see Section  3.2.3). These rings enable us to locally adapt the mesh tessellation in the case that the elastic deformation exceeds a certain distortion threshold and hence additional plastic deformation has to be performed. Geometry seams should run through low-saliency regions of the mesh in order to minimize the distortion they create when their inner edges are split or collapsed during mesh editing (see Section  3.3). Since we will formulate the computation of the rings as a graph cut problem, we have to encode all quality measures for the vertices and edges in the graph’s edge costs.

                            serves as a normalization factor for the possibly large variance in the lengths of the ring seams. Consider the exemplary modeling region depicted in Fig. 1. Rings within this disk-shaped modeling area that are closer to the fixed region are significantly longer than rings closer to the handle region. Thus, the graph cut will always compute rings of the latter type as they are short and hence are the result of a cheaper cut than longer rings. However, we would like the rings to be invariant to the user-defined shape of the modeling region. Reliable indicators for the length variance are provided by the iso-contours computed in Section  3.2.1 as, by definition, they are rings themselves.

                            is a sufficiently small regularization term. Edges connecting vertices with similar harmonic values are assigned a higher cost than edges with strongly different harmonic values at their vertices. This formulation has two useful properties. First, it promotes cuts of circular shape, as cutting radial edges usually results in lower costs than cutting edges of circumferential orientation. Second, and more importantly, the value of the harmonic field actually encodes the distribution of the deformation distortion, since the motion of the handle is essentially scaled by this value. Areas with high changes in the harmonic field will undergo a strong deformation and are likely to suffer from serious distortions. The difference in the harmonic values at the vertices of an edge 
                              e
                            hence indicates how much 
                              e
                            will be stretched or compressed during deformation. Highly different harmonic values at the edge’s vertices result in a small value for 
                              h
                              
                                 (
                                 e
                                 )
                              
                           , meaning that cutting the edge is cheap. The term 
                              h
                              
                                 (
                                 e
                                 )
                              
                            hence promotes rings that run through edges with highly different harmonic values, leading to a concentration of rings in regions with a potentially strong distortion where plastic deformation is more likely to occur.

In image seam carving, Rubinstein et al.  [17] replace the dynamic programming approach to compute optimal pixel seams of Avidan and Shamir  [1] with a graph cut optimization. We formulate the computation of geometry seams also as a graph cut problem.

After each manipulation that the user applies to the modeling handle, we have to decide if we stick to the elastic deformation resulting from the Laplace editing or if the current mesh distortion calls for additional plastic deformation. This decision is made on a per-sector basis (see Section  3.3.1). In the following,

The two questions that remain to be answered are which seams to execute in a sector and when to execute them. As for the former question, the rings have been generated in order of increasing distortion that will be introduced when their inner edges are split or collapsed during mesh editing. This ordering has been established in a global fashion by considering the distortion caused by an entire ring. However, it may occur that, although ring

                            is established in increasing order with respect to the distortion measure in Eq. (6). Our experiments showed that globally precomputing the rings and executing the ring segments in a per-sector order yields a good compromise between mesh quality and distortion compensation.

Having individually established the order in which the rings have to be executed in each sector, we determine the index of the next ring to be executed in a sector

                           . This way, collapsing a seam eliminates all triangles within an area of roughly the same size by which the sector area decreased during the elastic deformation, while splitting the seam creates new triangles within an area of roughly the same size as that by which the area increased. A seam collapse is executed by collapsing every second inner edge, thereby eliminating its two adjacent triangles. A seam split is executed by splitting every inner edge, thereby adding two new triangles.

The number of sectors is a parameter for a smooth transition of the mesh resolution from regions where seams have been split to regions where seams have been collapsed.

We use the well-established Laplace editing approach for elastic mesh deformation which, in its original form, solves the optimization problem

                            subject to constraints introduced by the boundary vertices of the modeling region. Here,

                            is the Laplace matrix and

Since our main goal is to preserve mesh features as well as possible, we slightly modify the linear Laplace system as follows: as row

                            of

                           , we can control the vertex’s stiffness during deformation by multiplying the entries in row

                            being a scaling factor that controls the impact of the stiffness, and 
                              ϵ
                            being a regularization term to avoid that a row in 
                              L
                            is scaled by 0 in the case that all normals are nearly parallel. This stiffness factor allows us to distribute the deformation distortion over the mesh in a way that the one-ring of a non-feature vertex undergoes a heavier distortion than the one-ring of a feature vertex.

A plastic deformation, i.e., a collapse or a split of a seam of triangles, changes the mesh’s topology and stretches or compresses the edges adjacent to the vertices involved. To compensate for these length changes, we have to adapt some edge weights in the Laplace matrix: if, on the one hand, an edge is collapsed and is subsequently eliminated from the Laplace system, the edges in its vicinity should overtake the function of the eliminated one. Hence, their “tension” has to be increased by adequately updating their corresponding edge weights in the Laplace matrix. If, on the contrary, a new edge is introduced into the system by a split operation, the tensions of the edges in its vicinity have to be decreased. This way, the metric of the original rest pose is preserved as well as possible while topology and length changes are incorporated into the optimization.

For the weighted Laplace deformation, we hence have to rebuild the following linear system after every seam execution:

                            is a Laplace operator with positive weights (see Wardetzky et al.  [19]) which, together with the positions 
                              x
                            of all vertices in 
                              M
                           , defines the Laplace vectors. The Laplace matrix

                           , but, each time it has to be rebuilt in order to account for  topology changes, the weights of all edges affected by the splits and collapses are scaled by factors that depend on the updated geometry.


                           Fig. 5
                            illustrates the topological and geometrical modifications resulting from (a) a collapse operation and (b) a split operation together with their inverse operations that restore the previous setting. Split or collapse operations not only delete or insert edges but also change the lengths of other edges. Interpreting the Laplace matrix as a mass–spring model, we can apply Hooke’s law of elasticity, 
                              F
                              =
                              D

                              Δ
                              l
                           , which relates the force 
                              F
                            exerted by a spring to the distance 
                              Δ
                              l
                            it is stretched by a spring constant 
                              D
                           . To account for the changes in edge lengths, we hence have to scale the spring constants by the length change, which is equivalent to scaling the edge weights in the Laplace matrix

                           . Hence, the updated weight

In the following, we briefly describe the weight updates for all edges affected by split and collapse operations. In the case of an edge collapse (see  Fig. 5(a)), the weights of all green edges adjacent to the new vertex

A typical problem arising in the context of mesh simplification is that reversing an earlier operation may be impossible due to a modified vertex neighborhood resulting from other mesh modifications. Such situations can occur near sector boundaries in our system (see Section  3.3.1). We follow the approach of El-Sana and Varshney  [21] in order to detect and resolve them.

To illustrate the quality of the surface meshes under deformation, we compare our results with the results obtained by the following base-line reference solution: as our technique combines elastic with a plastic deformation, the reference solution should provide both properties as well. Hence, we obtain our reference solution by using weighted Laplacian editing, but we recompute the Laplace matrix after every frame. We therefore reset the edge weights as

We tested our method on a variety of input models. In the following images, the red line marks the boundary of the modeling region and the fixed region. Please also refer to the accompanying video (see http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cad.2013.08.024) for the entire editing sessions in which the presented results have been generated. Fig. 6
                      shows some results for five different input models: the top row depicts the model together with the precomputed set of geometry seams, the middle row shows a result generated with the reference solution, and in the bottom row the result obtained with our technique is shown.

We edited the back armor of the Armadillo (a) by moving the center plate towards the model’s lower back. The reference solution generates self-intersections in the compressed areas. Our approach, however, avoids these artifacts by collapsing enough seams in areas with low saliency, thereby protecting the features from self-intersecting. As parameters for the edge costs (Eq. (3)), we chose 
                        α
                        =

                     , while no additional stiffness (Eq. (7)) was introduced.

We shortened one arm of the Octopus (b) by moving the handle closer to the animal’s head. Since, in the Laplace approach, the mesh distortion decreases with increasing distance to the handle (see our argument on the harmonic field in Section  3.2.1), the suction cups close to the handle are significantly distorted. Furthermore, the result exhibits a sharper bend of the arm. Applying our technique instead (with

                     ), most of the distortion was absorbed by the low-saliency regions, and hence the suction cups maintained their circular shape. Furthermore, the bend of the arm has not increased in order to accommodate the distortion.

We curled up the tail of the Seahorse as depicted in Fig. 6(c). As for the Octopus, the distortion introduced by the reference solution is mostly located in regions close to the handle, causing an undesired strong bend. The split and collapse operations executed in this area by our approach, however, accommodated the distortion, and hence significantly reduced the strong notch close to the handle. For the edge costs, we chose

                        =
                        0.5
                        ,
                        β
                        =
                        0.25
                        ,
                        γ
                        =
                        10
                     , while the scaling factor in Eq. (7) was set to 
                        s
                        =
                        10

The Knot with Stars (Fig. 6(d)) presents a special case with respect to the configuration of the modeling region and the handle area, as the latter divides the modeling region into two components. Hence, a single seam runs through only one of these components. Precomputing the seams for both components separately (with 
                        α
                        =
                        0.5
                        ,
                        β
                        =
                        0.25
                        ,
                        γ
                        =
                        5
                     ), however, allows us to properly handle this kind of configurations. During editing (without additional stiffness), we pulled one arc of the knot upwards. Splitting the precomputed seams in the area close to the fixed mesh region (yellow, orange, and red seams) introduced additional degrees of freedom, and thus enabled our approach to expand the modeling region not only upwards, i.e., in the direction of the handle movement, but also in the directions of the split edges, namely to the sides. After deformation, the arc hence has a nice circular shape with a uniform curvature distribution, while the shape of the stars has been preserved. The reference solution, however, yields a more elliptical arc with a corresponding non-uniform curvature distribution, since it expanded the modeling region only upwards. Furthermore, the shape of some stars is visibly distorted.

We further spread one wing of the Welsh Dragon model (Fig. 6(e)). In the result obtained with the reference solution, the slender bones spanning the wing are broadened, since the distortion is distributed homogeneously over the modeling region. In contrast, our method (with 
                        α
                        =
                        0.25
                        ,
                        β
                        =
                        γ
                        =
                        1
                     , no additional stiffness) distributes the distortion mostly in the low-saliency regions in between these bones, and hence preserves their slender shape much better. Furthermore, the length of the bones in the reference solution has decreased, whereas, in our result, their length has been preserved due to the additional degrees of freedom that have been introduced by splitting the seam edges.

Note that other configurations of the modeling region and the handle area can be supported by providing a reasonable harmonic field (Section  3.2.1) and a respective graph cut setup (Section  3.2.3). On the plane model (Fig. 1), for example, one could select everything but a few rows of triangles on the left boundary as the modeling region, with some rows of triangles on the right boundary constituting the handle. The graph cut then computes a cut running from the top to the bottom boundary. In this setting, the precomputed seams would be open instead of closed triangle strips.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We presented a mesh deformation technique that combines elastic Laplacian-based mesh deformation with plastic mesh modifications. A precomputed set of geometry seams is split or collapsed in those areas of the mesh that undergo strong distortion. Since, per construction, the seams run through low-saliency regions of the mesh, these regions absorb most of the deformation energy, which hence lightens the distortion in regions that exhibit many features. The topological modification resulting from splitting or collapsing the seams are integrated into the elastic Laplace deformation in a physically plausible way following Hooke’s law.

Implementing a plastic deformation scheme using only Laplacian editing would require recomputing the edge weights after every deformation step (as in our base-line reference solution). Resetting the edge weights is equivalent to resetting the spring constants in the underlying physical mass–spring model, and hence emulates a plastic deformation as the rest pose is redefined. However, this also requires rebuilding and refactorizing the Laplace matrix. Hence, while in both approaches the plastic deformation comes at these additional costs, our plastic deformation adopts the mesh tessellation to the extent of the surface deformation, and hence provides a better mesh quality.

As future work, we would like to align the quad grid spanned by the iso and sector contours to the model’s principal curvature directions. We expect that such a grid outlines sectors that cover the modeling region in a way that the ring segments falling within the sectors are even better positioned with respect to the overall shape of the model. Furthermore, we would like to investigate other criteria to measure the distortion of a sector, since the area difference does not necessarily capture all possible distortions that sector triangles can suffer from (e.g., shearing may not be captured) and that would require seam execution in order to better accommodate the distortion.
