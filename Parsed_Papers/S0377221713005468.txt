                  In distribution problems, and specifically in bankruptcy issues, the Proportional (P) and the Egalitarian (EA) divisions are two of the most popular ways to resolve the conflict. Nonetheless, when using the egalitarian division, agents may receive more than her claim. We propose a compromise between the proportional and the egalitarian approaches by considering the restriction that no one receives more than her claim. We show that the most egalitarian compromise fulfilling this restriction ensures a minimum amount to each agent. We also show that this compromise can be interpreted as a process that works in two steps as follows: first, all agents receive an equal share up to the smallest claim if possible (egalitarian distribution), and then, the remaining estate (if any) is allocated proportionally to the remaining claims (proportional distribution). Finally, we obtain that the recursive application of this process finishes at the Constrained Equal Awards solution (CEA).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A claims problem is a particular case of distribution problem, in which the amount to be distributed, the estate E, is not enough to cover the agents’ claims on it. This model describes the situation faced by a court that has to distribute the net worth of a bankrupt firm among its creditors. But, it also corresponds with cost-sharing, taxation, or rationing problems. How should the scarce resources be allocated among its claimants? The formal analysis of situations like these, which originates in a seminal paper by O’Neill (1982), shows that a vast number of well-behaved solutions
                        1
                        The reader is referred to Moulin (2002) and Thomson (2003) as surveys of this literature.
                     
                     
                        1
                      have been defined for solving claims problems, being the Proportional and the Equal Awards (egalitarian) the two prominent concepts used in real world. The term well-behaved reflects the idea that the considered solutions might fulfill some principles of fairness, or appealing properties. A way of comparing solutions is given by the equity condition of Lorenz-dominance (see Dutta & Ray, 1989). A recent paper (Bosmans & Lauwers, 2011) compares the most usual bankruptcy rules in terms of Lorenz-dominance and analyzes those solutions that favor to smaller claimants relative to larger ones.

An illustrative example of claims problems is the fishing quotas reduction, in which the agent’s claim can be understood as the previous captures, and the estate is the new (lower) level of joint captures. A similar example is given by milk quotas among the EU members.
                        2
                        Quotas were introduced in 1984. Each member state was given a reference quantity which was then allocated to individual producers. The initial quotas were not sufficiently restrictive as to remedy the surplus situation and so the quotas were cut in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Quotas will end on April 1, 2015.
                     
                     
                        2
                      In both examples, proportionality is the main principle used. Nevertheless, a minimal (survival) amount, guaranteed to each producer, should be fixed in order to ensure the profitability of fishing (milk) industries. That is, some part of the estate should be allocated in an egalitarian way. This idea is somewhat related to the axiom of Sustainability (see Herrero & Villar, 2002). As they mention,
                        “Sustainability is a protective criterion for those agents with small claims. To illustrate this, consider the interpretation of a bankruptcy situation as a reduction in the fishing quotas. Here agent i’s claim corresponds to her actual level of captures and the estate to be distributed to the new aggregate level of captures. Sustainable claims correspond to those levels of captures such that, if nobody else had a larger level, the aggregate new level of captures would not impose any rationing. Sustainability says that agents with sustainable claims should not be rationed after the change in the aggregate level of captures.”
                     
                  

A similar situation can be found when a university distributes the budget to Departments. In this case, the resources are distributed proportionally to the number of Professors, students, subjects, etc., but a minimal (fixed) amount is allocated to each regardless of size.

An alternative example of using the proportional approach is the way in which seats in the Spanish Parliament are allocated to each electoral district (province).
                        3
                        This example involves indivisibilities, which is not a trivial issue (see, for instance, Moulin (2000)).
                     
                     
                        3
                      This is made proportionally to the population in each province, but a minimal number of seats (2) is guaranteed to each.
                        4
                        In the case of Spanish Parliament, the allocation mechanism is as follows (Spanish LOREG, 2011, art. 162): (1) Congress is composed of three hundred and fifty Deputies. (2) Each province has a corresponding initial minimum of two deputies. (3) The remaining two hundred and forty-eight deputies are distributed among the provinces in proportion to its population, according to the following procedure: (a) Obtain a distribution fee obtained by dividing by two hundred forty-eight the total number of the legal population of peninsular and island provinces. (b) Allocate to each province as many deputies as resulting, in whole numbers, dividing the population of provincial law by the quota allocation. (c) The remaining deputies are distributed by assigning one to each of the provinces whose quotient obtained under paragraph before, have a higher decimal fraction.
                     
                     
                        4
                      A similar situation is found in the US case: based on data from the decennial census, each state is allocated a proportion of the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, although each state is guaranteed a minimum of one seat, regardless of population.
                        5
                        “Each State shall have at Least one Representative” (U.S. Const., art. I, 2, cl. 3.).
                     
                     
                        5
                      The remaining seats are allocated one at a time, to the state with the highest priority number. This apportionment is based on the proportion of each state’s population to that of the Fifty States together. We shall return to these examples later.

Although proportionality is the most used criterion,
                        6
                        “In western society, for example, the customary solution would be to split the asset in proportion to the claims”, see Young (1994, p. 123).
                     
                     
                        6
                      whenever the smallest claim is very small compared with the largest one, a proportional division provides nearly nothing for this (these) small claimant(s). In this sense, the previous comments and examples show that real world, when applying proportional distributions, try to ensure an egalitarian (minimal) amount to each agent.

In this paper we will define a new solution concept that captures this behavior. This solution can be understood as a compromise between the proportional and the egalitarian distributions. In choosing this compromise, if we wanted to use the same weight on the proportional and the egalitarian distributions for each problem, the largest weight one could assign to the egalitarian distribution would be zero (otherwise for some problems an agent would receive an amount larger than her claim). So, we propose that the weight of each of the two distributions depends on the particular claims problem we are analyzing. In so doing, we define the weight used on the egalitarian distribution to be the highest weight such that the resulting vector satisfies the claims boundedness restriction.

Under an alternative view, we can differentiate between two different class of problems: the first class consists of problems where the per-capita estate is small relative to the smallest claim, c
                     1
                     ⩾
                     E (a condition called in the literature as an unsustainable claim), whereas in the problems of the second class the smallest claim is sustainable. Then, if the claims problem is in the first category, the egalitarian distribution satisfies claims boundedness and all agents receive equal awards; if the claims problem falls in the second category, we first assign to each agent the smallest claim (egalitarian distribution), revise claims and estate accordingly, and then distribute the remaining estate proportionally to the revised claims (proportional solution). By this way, we define a new solution. Our main result, Proposition 3, shows that both approaches coincide in the same solution which we call α
                     
                        min
                     
                     −
                     Egalitarian solution.
                        7
                        An interesting question that has been addressed to us is if we can do the same for any claims rule ψ instead of the Proportional one. We will see that it is not possible, in general, to extend our results.
                     
                     
                        7
                     
                  

In short, our compromise solution:
                        
                           •
                           modifies the Equal Awards division, so that the proposal satisfies the claim-boundedness condition;

modifies the Proportional division and considers a minimal amount that each agent should receive, which is endogenously determined in each particular problem (E,
                              c);
                                 8
                                 We will see that our proposal satisfies a lower bound on awards property.
                              
                              
                                 8
                              
                           

provides a result that coincides with the one we would obtain if we assign to each agent this minimal amount, and distribute the remaining estate (if any) in a proportional way.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the preliminaries. Section 3 presents our solution concept. Sections 4 and 5 provide the axiomatic analysis, and in Section 6 we present some final comments. The appendix gathers the proofs.

Throughout the paper we will consider a set of agents N
                     ={1,2,…,
                     n}. Each agent is identified by her claim, c

Many solution concepts have been defined in the literature aboutclaims problems (see for instance Thomson (2003) and Bosmans & Lauwers (2011)). The two most important criteria are the Proportional and the Egalitarian ones.

As we have already mentioned, when α
                     =0 the equal division may not satisfy the conditions of a solution (claim boundedness fails). In order to avoid this problem, we can obtain for each problem (E,
                     c) the minimum value of α
                     ∈[0,1] such that φ

                        It is important to mention that, as in Remark 2, the result in Proposition 3 is not true if we use a solution ψ different from the Proportional one. See Section 6.

                     Composition up shows the opposite situation to composition down.

                           The α

Note that there is a property our solution fulfills that is not satisfied by the Proportional solution: Reasonable lower bounds on awards. This is the part that the EA division brings to our solution. The drawback is that some properties P fulfills are lost. Next we show some of them.
                              13
                              It must be noticed that the main reason for not satisfying these properties is that EA, taken as a function, does not satisfy them.

                     Self-Duality implies that a solution recommends the same allocation when dividing awards and losses. Given a claims problem (E,
                     c), losses are defined by the difference among the estate and the claims,

For instance, the Self-composition of degree 2 for some solution, φ
                     2, is obtained in the following way: first, agent 1 receives the amount recommended for her by φ(E,
                     c); then we solve the new problem in which the estate is reduced in the amount given to agent 1, and this agent has no claim anymore. That is,

It is immediate to observe that if a solution is Self-consistent, then the Self-composition of any degree coincides with the own function (in some sense, it is idempotent); i.e., if φ satisfies Self-consistency, then for each

Next result, which can be straightforwardly obtained from Proposition 3, shows that if we compute the Self-composition of degree n
                     −1 of the α
                     
                        min

                           -Egalitarian solution retrieves the CEA solution, where n is the number of agents.
                        

The result in the above Proposition may be understood as a recursive process (for a solution φ) which can be described as follows. Assume the agents are ordered so that c
                     1
                     ⩽
                     c
                     2
                     ⩽…⩽
                     c
                     
                        n
                     . The solution φ applied to the original problem (E,
                     c) only determines the share of agent 1, who in turn leaves with this share. The estate is reduced accordingly and the updated problem, say (E
                     2,
                     c
                     2) for agents 2, 3, …, n is now used only to determine the share of agent 2. Agent 2 then leaves with this share and the estate is again reduced to construct (E
                     3,
                     c
                     3) for agents 3, 4,…, n. This recursive process is used to determine the share of every agent. The result shows that this recursive process, when applied to φ
                     
                        min
                     , produces the CEA allocation.

The α

                     -Egalitarian solution does not satisfy self-consistency (otherwise, self-composition could not retrieve the CEA solution). But it satisfies a weaker version that we call backwards consistency. This condition requires that if the agent with largest claim leaves with his part, none of the other agents takes advantage.

                        Definition 8
                        Given two solutions φ and ψ it is said that φ Lorenz dominates ψ, φ

                           c) the vector φ(E,
                           c) Lorenz dominates ψ(E,
                           c).

Lorenz domination is a criterion used to check whether a solution is more favorable to smaller claimants relative to larger claimants. So, in some sense, a Lorenz dominant solution can be understood as more equitable. In a recent paper, Bosmans and Lauwers (2011) obtain a Lorenz dominance comparison among several solutions and they obtain that CEA is the more equitable solution, in the sense that it Lorenz dominates any other solution. More precisely, the dominance relation they obtain is as follows:

Then, the Proportional solution only dominates CEL, which is the most favorable solution for larger claimants relative to smaller ones (so, the less equitable one).

In this paper we have proposed a compromise between the two most important and well-known ways of solving distribution problems: the Proportional and the Egalitarian. Moreover, we have analyzed the properties of this new solution and defined a recursive process, Self-composition, which allows us to recover the Constrained Equal Awards solution, by using our solution.

A natural question arises at this point: if we consider an alternative solution concept (e.g. Talmud solution, T) and we define in an analogous way

Finally, we want to point out a possible way of extending our results by considering a more general class of problems, with claims and constraints simultaneously (see Bergantiños & Lorenzo (2008)).
