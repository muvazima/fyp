                  We provide explicit representations of three moving planes that form a μ-basis for a standard Dupin cyclide. We also show how to compute μ-bases for Dupin cyclides in general position and orientation from their implicit equations. In addition, we describe the role of moving planes and moving spheres in bridging between the implicit and rational parametric representations of these cyclides.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cyclides, originally introduced by Dupin (1822) hence since called ‘Dupin cyclides’, have been under intensive research for almost two centuries in both classical differential geometry and algebraic geometry (Maxwell, 1868; Casey, 1871; Cayley, 1873). Dupin cyclides are simultaneously enveloped by two families of spheres; each sphere from any of the two families envelopes the cyclide along a circle; and these two families of circles are orthogonal and form the curvature lines of the cyclide. Dupin cyclides are algebraic surfaces of degree up to four, and also admit a biquadratic rational parametrization. Special cases of Dupin cyclides include tori, spheres, cylinders and cones. Dupin cyclides of degree four have the isotropic circle at infinity as their double curve, and thus were subsequently extended to a wider class of quartic surfaces having the circle at infinity as a double curve by Casey (1871) and Darboux (Maxwell, 1868). These extensions are called ‘generalized cyclides’. In the present paper our cyclides will always refer to Dupin cyclides unless otherwise specified.

Cyclides were rediscovered by the CAGD community for geometric modeling, due to their advantages in: 1) having low algebraic degree; 2) possessing trigonometric parametrizations and low degree rational parametrizations; 3) containing two families of orthogonal circles as main curvature lines; 4) being closed under offset; 5) being characterized by four constants that have clear geometric meaning (Pratt, 1990, 1995; Johnstone, 1993; Foufou et al., 2005). Cyclides are frequently used as blending surfaces as well as in boundary representations in solid modeling (Pratt, 1990, 1995), and have recently shown their power in architecture geometry (Pottmann et al., 2012; Bo et al., 2011).

The technique of moving curves and moving surfaces was first introduced to CAGD by Sederberg and Chen (1995) for fast implicitization of rational curves and rational surfaces. Compared with traditional elimination methods using Gröbner bases or resultant computations, the method of moving curves and moving surfaces is much more efficient, produces no extraneous factors and also works well in the presence of base points. The simplest representatives for moving curves and moving surfaces are moving lines and moving planes. Moving lines are used for the study of rational planar curves, while moving planes are for rational space curves and rational surfaces.

                     . All the moving lines that follow a rational planar curve form a module, called the moving line module of the curve. The analogue of the moving line module is the moving plane module for rational space curves in arbitrary dimensions and for rational surfaces.

The moving line module and moving plane module are also called syzygy module. The syzygy module of a rational curve in an arbitrary dimension n is a free module of rank n. A μ-basis for a rational curve is a basis of lowest degree for the syzygy module. However, the syzygy module of a rational surface is free only in affine settings, that is, the parametrization of the surface as well as the moving planes are characterized by polynomials in affine parameters. The homogenized syzygy module of a rational surface is generally not free, in contrast to the homogenized syzygy module of a rational curve which is always free. Hence different definitions of μ-bases for rational surfaces have been proposed; see Cox et al. (1998), Chen et al. (2005). In this paper, we adopt the definition of μ-bases for rational surfaces in Chen et al. (2005), that is, a μ-basis for a rational surface is an arbitrary basis for the dehomogenized syzygy module of the surface.


                     μ-bases inherit all the geometric and algebraic intrinsic properties of rational curves and surfaces, so μ-bases provide a bridge between the parametric and implicit representations. Once μ-bases are available, the problems of implicitization, singularity computation, inversion formula computation can all be solved symbolically and efficiently. After a long period of investigation, the theory of μ-bases for rational curves, including algorithms for computing μ-bases and applications to practical problems, is relatively complete compared with that for rational surfaces. Please refer to Chen and Wang (2003a) and Song and Goldman (2012) for algorithms and properties of μ-bases for rational planar curves and rational space curves in arbitrary dimensions. About applications of μ-bases, please see Chen and Sederberg (2002), Chen et al. (2008), Jia and Goldman (2009, 2012) for singularity computations of rational planar curves, Wang et al. (2009), Shi et al. (2012a) for singularity computations of rational space curves, and Jia et al. (2010) for the implicitization problem of rational space curves. For surfaces, Chen et al. (2005) have proved that a μ-basis for a rational surface under affine settings always exists. Nevertheless, a pervasive algorithm of μ-bases for rational surfaces is still lacking. Exploration on μ-bases theory and applications for some very special surfaces has been made, such as rational ruled surfaces (Chen et al., 2001; Chen and Wang, 2003b; Chen, 2003; Jia et al., 2009), some low degree parametric surfaces (Chen et al., 2007), surfaces of revolution (Shi and Goldman, 2012) as well as surfaces with a pair of orthogonal directrices (Shi et al., 2012b).

The goal of this paper is to explore the role of moving planes and moving spheres played in Dupin Cyclides. We provide explicit representations, rather than an algorithm, of μ-bases for standard cyclides (i.e., cyclides in standard position and orientation). Moreover, given the implicit equation of an arbitrary cyclide, we show how to extract the center position, orientation, as well as the four characteristic values of the cyclide; and then write down a μ-basis for the cyclide from a μ-basis for the corresponding standard cyclide. Two reasons for this slight difference from most of the previous literature on μ-bases that start from a rational parametrization of the surface: 1) in practice such as surface blending or modeling, a cyclide is usually characterized by its center position, orientation and the four constant characteristic values that have explicit geometric meanings. We show a direct μ-basis for the cyclide when this information is readily available. 2) Even if this information is hidden for a cyclide that is not in standard position and orientation, this information can be retrieved more easily from the implicit equation than from a rational parametrization. Besides, we reveal the role of moving planes and moving spheres in connecting the rational parametric equation and implicit equation of a cyclide, and show an easy inversion formula for getting the parameters for points on the cyclide via μ-bases.

The paper is organized as follows. We first present in Section 2 and Section 3 some basics on Dupin cyclides and μ-bases. Then in Section 4 we derive three moving planes that follow the parametrization of the cyclide, from which in Section 5 we obtain the explicit representations of μ-bases for standard cyclides, and show the role of μ-bases in connecting the parametric and implicit equations. In Section 6 we explain how to extract the center position, orientation as well as the four characteristic values from the implicit equation of a cyclide in general position and orientation, and show how to compute their μ-bases from that for a standard cyclide. We show an example to illustrate the whole process in Section 7. An easy application of μ-basis for inversion formulas is shown in Section 8 and conclusions are drawn in Section 9.

A cyclide is a surface whose lines of curvatures are all circles. A cyclide is the envelope of a moving sphere whose center varies along a conic curve and has a quadratic radius function. Readers are referred to Chandru et al. (1989) for all the equivalent definitions for cyclides. Forsyth (1912) develops the implicit equation of a cyclide in standard position and orientation:

                        . We call the cyclide with implicit equation (1) a standard cyclide. Standard cyclides are centered at the origin and have two planes of symmetry

                        . The cross-section of a cyclide by either of its two symmetric planes is a pair of circles. A cyclide in general position and orientation can be transformed to a standard cyclide via Euclidean transformations.

With one sphere fixed and the other sphere moving through its family, the contact point of the two spheres generates the corresponding curvature line. We summarize the basic properties of cyclides below.

                              Strictly speaking, a μ-basis is essentially defined for a parametrization. For an algebraic surface that has rational parametrizations, if we adopt another parametrization of the surface, we shall get different μ-bases for the new parametrization. However, in later context, sometimes when we say “a μ-basis for a cyclide”, we are referring to a μ-basis for a certain parametrization of the cyclide.

                        Note 1
                        A minimal μ-basis (either in total degree or in bidegree) does not always exist for an arbitrarily given rational surface. Please see Chen et al. (2005) for detailed discussions.

From Theorem 5.2, one can see that unlike the case for curves, a direct resultant of μ-bases does not generate the implicit equation of a surface without extraneous factors. Please refer to Chen et al. (2005) for the same observation, where they have a deeper analysis and point out that the extraneous factor y might arise because the μ-bases fail to form a basis for the homogeneous syzygy module.

Nevertheless, we can achieve a clean implicitization by the technique of moving surfaces shown in Sederberg and Chen (1995). Since torus is a special case for general cyclide, we show only the technique for general cyclides and parabolic cyclides.

Till now, our discussion is all about standard cyclides. Since a cyclide in general position and orientation can always be transformed to a standard cyclide via Euclidean transformations, all those properties of μ-bases for standard cyclides also apply to μ-bases for cyclides in general position and orientation. Next we show how to compute a μ-basis for a cyclide in general position and orientation from a given implicit equation. Note that in this general given implicit equation, the center position, orientation, as well as all the characteristic values of the cyclide are hidden. Our first goal is to extract all this information from the given degree four algebraic equation.

                        Remark 6.1
                        The approach shown in this section can also decide whether a given quartic algebraic equation represents a cyclide. By extracting the center position, orientation, as well as the characteristic values of the cyclide, one can then write out the parametric equation of the cyclide. A μ-basis for this parametrization can also be obtained through computing a basis of the syzygy module of this parametrization. However, this last parametrization step is unnecessary, since once we get all the geometric information from the implicit equation, a μ-basis can be directly written out.

We now illustrate by example the whole process of computing a μ-basis for a cyclide in general position and orientation from its implicit equation.

Rational surfaces in three dimension always have μ-bases (Chen et al., 2005). Dupin cyclides are rational surfaces of bidegree 
                        (
                        2
                        ,

                        )
                      that are enveloped by two families of spheres. From these two families of spheres we get two moving planes that follow the rational parametrization of the cyclide. We show that the implicit equation of the cyclide is just the GCD of two resultants constructed from the two families of moving spheres and their corresponding moving planes. Starting from these two moving planes, together with an obvious syzygy of the parametrization, we derive three explicit moving planes that form a μ-basis for the standard cyclides that are centered at the origin and have 
                        y
                        =
                        0
                      and 
                        z
                        =
                        0
                      as the two planes of symmetry. The implicit equation of the cyclide can be represented by μ-bases without producing any extraneous factors. For cyclides in general position and orientation, we show how to extract their center position, orientation, as well as the four characteristic values, so that we can obtain their μ-bases from the explicit μ-bases for the corresponding standard cyclides. At the end we also present an application of μ-bases for easy inversion formula computation for cyclides.

In the future, we hope to extract the geometric invariants of a cyclide from its rational parametric representation, and also to develop an algorithm for computing μ-bases for cyclides directly from the rational parametrizations of the cyclides. Another possible extension of this work is computing μ-bases for canal surfaces. Canal surfaces with rational spine curves and rational radius functions are known to be rational. Hence by Chen et al. (2005) 
                     μ-bases for canal surfaces always exist. However, even an explicit representation for the parametrization is lacking, hence a μ-basis computation might be even harder. One possible moving surface to look at is the moving sphere that envelopes the canal surface, but we need more. Cyclides are at this point very special, since they are enveloped simultaneously by two moving spheres.
