                      are linearly independent, then the image curve C has degree n and does not lie in a plane, i.e., C is a genuine space curve.

For a parametrized planar curve of degree n, Cox et al. (1998) introduced the idea of a μ-basis. Since then, μ-bases have proved useful in the study of the singularities of rational plane curves, as evidenced by Chen et al. (2008), Song et al. (2007) in the geometric modeling literature and by Cox et al. (2013) in the commutative algebra literature.

The groundwork for the space curve case appears in Cox et al. (1998, Sec. 5), and the connection with singularities has been studied in several papers, including Jia et al. (2010), Shi and Chen (2010), Shi et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2009). For references to the (fairly extensive) algebraic geometry literature on rational space curves, we direct the reader to the bibliography of Iarrobino (2014).

An idea introduced in Cox et al. (1998) was to study the μ-stratum consisting of all parametrizations of plane rational curves with given degree and μ-type. In this paper, we will extend this idea to rational space curves and more generally to define the 
                        μ
                     -strata of rational curves in projective d-space, based on the papers by Iarrobino (1977, 2004). A terse version of the results presented in Sections 3 and 4.2, written for commutative algebraists, can be found in Iarrobino (2014). The results concerning properness in Section 4.1 are new to this paper and this topic is not mentioned in Iarrobino (1977, 2004). Results concerning the decomposition of the smallest 
                        μ
                     -stratum are geometric consequences of Iarrobino (2004), but were not developed there.

We will review the planar case in Section 2 and then discuss 
                        μ
                     -strata in higher dimensions in Section 3. We will give examples to illustrate the unexpected behaviors that can arise. Section 4 will study non-proper parametrizations and explain how parametrizations in the smallest 
                        μ
                     -stratum relate to two-dimensional rational normal scrolls in

                     . Proofs will be given in Appendix A.

For the rest of the paper, we will work over an arbitrary infinite field 
                        k
                     , which in practice is usually

                        R
                      or 
                        C
                     . Set 
                        R
                        =

                      This was proved by D'Andrea (2004). This result also is a consequence of the memoir by Iarrobino (1977) or the article by Iarrobino (2004), though these are written from a very different viewpoint. It was eight years after D'Andrea (2004) appeared before a connection was made between these papers.

Here is the intuition behind (2.4) and (2.5):
                        
                           •
                           
                              (2.4) says that the smaller the μ, the more special the parametrization.


                              (2.5) says that if we are moving around in 
                                 
                                    
                                       P
                                    
                                    
                                       n
                                    
                                    
                                       μ
                                    
                                 
                               and reach its boundary, then with high probability, we hit a point of

                                       n
                                    
                                    
                                       μ
                                       −
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                              , i.e., μ drops by one unless we are really unlucky.

Curves in the plane and 3-dimensional space are the most important to geometric modeling. Since the results of Iarrobino (1977, 2004) apply to curves in projective d-space for all 
                        d
                        ≥
                        1
                     , we will work in this greater generality. One way to think of our approach is that it gives a unified treatment of rational plane and space curves, as well as rational curves in higher dimensions.

We therefore start with 
                        d

                        1

In Section 2, we made two assumptions beyond linear independence:
                        
                           •
                           The parametrization is proper, i.e., generically one-to-one, and

the polynomials in the parametrization are relatively prime.

Before stating our results, we need to define 
                           μ
                        -types and 
                           μ
                        -bases.

We say that the parametrization has generic degree k. It is well-known that if the

In the above example, recall from Wang et al. (2009, Cor. 6.8) that the curves corresponding to 
                           (
                           2
                           ,
                           2
                           )
                         are smooth while those for 
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           3
                           )

                           n

We conclude by noting that all ideals coming from parametrizations, not just those in the smallest stratum, have ancestor ideals that determine rational normal scrolls (possibly of high dimension) containing the curve. More precisely, suppose we have

                        , we get τ points, one on each of the τ curves. These points determine a subspace of dimension

@&#ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS@&#

We would like to thank the referees for their comments and careful reading of the paper. The second author is grateful to Claudia Polini and others for conversations at the ALGA conference at IMPA in 2012. These conversations led to Iarrobino (2014) and, serendipitously, to this paper.

Most proofs omitted in Section 3 of the paper can be found in Iarrobino (2004). However, Iarrobino (2004) is written in the language of Grassmannians, ancestor ideals, and Hilbert functions, so some translation is needed to the situation of this paper. Appendix A.2 is for experts who want to make sure that nothing has been lost in translation. Appendix A.3 proves the results of Section 4.1; Appendix A.4 proves the results of Section 4.2 and gives some extensions of those results to non-minimal 
                        μ
                     -strata.

The irreducibility assertion of Theorem 3.13 follows from Theorem A.5 and Lemma A.1, and the same results imply that

                               is divisible by k.

To complete the proof, we next assume that

                                     stated in (1) of the theorem. Furthermore,

                                     since

                                    . It follows that the codimension is always positive, completing the proof of (1).

For (2), we consider all 
                                       k
                                       >

                                     that divide

                                    . For any such k, the locus of generic degree k parametrizations has positive codimension. Since there are only finitely many such k's, the same is true for the non-proper locus. Hence

                                     contains a nonempty Zariski open subset consisting of proper parametrizations. This subset is dense since

                                     is irreducible, and (2) follows.

                                    , we have 
                                       S
                                       =

                                     and the codimension formula readily follows from (A.5) and (A.6).  □

Ancestor ideals, not mentioned so far in this appendix, play a central role in Iarrobino (2004). As in Section 4.2, an ideal 
                           I
                           ⊆
                           R
                         generated by elements of degree n has an ancestor ideal, which is the largest homogeneous ideal of R that agrees with I in degrees

                        , we will follow Iarrobino (2004) and denote its ancestor ideal by

It follows that V gives two partitions, 
                           μ
                         and 
                           A
                        . These partitions have a strong relation to the Hilbert function of the ancestor ideal as follows.
