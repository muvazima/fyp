                  In this paper, given two real space algebraic curves, not necessarily bounded, whose Hausdorff distance is finite, we provide bounds of their distance. These bounds are related to the distance between the projections of the space curves onto a plane (say, 
                        z
                        =
                        0
                     ), and the distance between the z-coordinates of points in the original curves. Therefore, we provide a theoretical result that reduces the estimation and bounding of the Hausdorff distance of algebraic curves from the spatial to the planar case. Using these results we provide an estimation method for bounding the Hausdorff distance between two space curves and we check in applications that the method is accurate and fast.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Hausdorff distance has proven to be an appropriate tool for measuring the resemblance between two geometric objects, becoming in consequence a widely used tool in computer aided design, pattern matching and pattern recognition (see for instance Bai et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010 and Patrikalakis and Maekawa, 2001). Several variants of the Hausdorff distance have been developed to match specific patterns of objects, in this paper, we study the computation of the Hausdorff distance between two real space algebraic curves

The problem of computing the Hausdorff distance has proven not to be an easy one. We should note in the first place that there is no effective algorithm for the exact computation of the Hausdorff distance between algebraic varieties. Some recent works that approach special cases are Chen et al. (2010), Jüttler (2000) and Patrikalakis and Maekawa (2001). There exist theoretical results, as Lojasiewicz inequality for the compact case (see Ji et al., 1992), that relate by means of a constant the Hausdorff distance to the evaluation of the implicit equation(s) of one of the varieties at a parametrization of the other variety. However, this constant is hard to compute. Furthermore, if both varieties are given in implicit form, the computation of the Hausdorff distance is even harder. Also, for the compact case, there are techniques to approximate the distance into a fixed size frame (see Belogay et al., 1997), or by using biarcs (see Kim et al., 2010), or polylines (see Bai et al., 2011) as well as under the phenomenon where the point sets are given imprecisely (see Knauer et al., 2011). Additionally, for plane curves, in Jüttler (2000) it is shown how to bound the Hausdorff distance using foot-point distance. Altogether shows that bounding and estimating the Hausdorff distance is an active research area.

Among all these different variants of the problem we, here, deal with the algebraic global case for space curves. That is, we are given two real space algebraic curves and we want to provide bounds of the distance of the two algebraic sets and not of certain parts (subsets) included within a bounded frame. Afterwards, these bounds can be used to obtain estimations of the Hausdorff distance in a chosen bounded frame. Having such bounds would be useful for measuring the performance of approximate parametrization and approximate implicitization methods, see Emiris et al. (2012), Pérez-Díaz et al.

                      is a fundamental tool (see e.g. Cox et al., 1997 for further details on Gröbner bases). The relation between bounds of the space curves and bounds of the plane curves is the main contribution of this paper; see Theorem 3.5 and its corollaries. It allows the use of every method developed so far to estimate the Hausdorff distance between plane curves to achieve estimations of the distance for space curves. In this sense, more profit is obtained from existing techniques for estimating the Hausdorff distance in the plane, since they can be use for the same goal with space curves.

In Section 2, we present a situation in which the Hausdorff distance between the real part of two algebraic curves is finite. Bounds for the distances

Examples of application of such method are provided in Section 5 and conclusions are derived in Section 6.

                      by means of estimating the bound given by the results developed in Section 3. Of course, the methods described below, at some step, need to use numerical approximations, and hence they provide approximations of the bound. For this purpose, we take a sample of points P on

                      and for each of them, we compute an upper bound of 
                        d
                        (
                        P

                        )
                     . Then, by taking the maximum of these bounds we estimate

In Section 5, we consider both techniques to run the experiments and one can check that similar results on speed and accuracy are achieved with both methodologies. See Section 5 for further details.

Alternatively to our bounding strategy, one may use direct techniques, as for instance, given

Nevertheless, using these strategies also requires at some point the numerical approximation of the solution of algebraic systems, and hence they also provide estimations. We would like to emphasize that the bounding strategy we present can be used with curves given in both parametric and implicit form.

In the following section, we illustrate these comments.

In this section, we illustrate and discuss our ideas by means of some examples. The goal of this section is to analyze in practice how fast (to compute) and how accurate are the bounds given in Theorem 3.5. For this purpose, we will compare our estimation to those provided by alternative strategies given by the optimization techniques commented at the end of Section 4. We do not intend to compare the bounding strategy developed in Section 4 with other existing methods, and we observe that the bounds in Theorem 3.5, more than an alternative method, are a way of exploiting further the existing techniques for analyzing the Hausdorff distance in the plane.

More precisely, throughout three examples we show the computation times as well as the estimation of the Hausdorff distance provided by each strategy. In the examples we are given real space algebraic curves

In Section 4 we have seen how to compute the points

                      depending on whether the curve is rational or not. Now, we describe how we proceed when the points are taken deterministically or randomly.


                     Deterministic sample (rational case): We take parameter values of the form 
                        
                           
                              (
                              −
                              2
                              )
                           
                           
                              j
                           
                        
                      as well as parameter values of the form 
                        α
                        +
                        
                           1
                           
                              
                                 (
                                 −
                                 2
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                        
                      where α are the real poles (if any) of the rational functions in the parametrization. In this way, we study the parametrization when the real parameter tends to ±∞ and when the parameter tends to the poles, and hence the points on the curve tend to infinity. In this manner we obtain a sample

                     Random sample (rational case): We take parameter values of the form

                           b

                        ]
                      and b is a random integer in 
                        [
                        1
                        ,

                     , with 
                        ℓ

                     . Each sample has ℓ points and we allow ℓ to go to infinity. The parameter values are randomly distributed over the interval 
                        [
                        −
                        ℓ

                        ]
                     . When substituting t in the parametrization by those values, we obtain a sample

                      of points over the curve, although we cannot control their distribution over the curve.

                      with more than 2p points. Although the same notation is used for random samples obtained in parametric or implicit form, they will be distinguished from the context or it will be specified.

As far as possible we will take random samples of points to let the estimation freely find estimations close to the true distance. We also give priority to samples taken using a parametrization, since these are exact points over the curve, while the ones taken from an implicit representation are subject to numeric approximations. As we will see in Examples 5.2 and 5.3, to obtain samples using the parametrization, one is forced to use the deterministic approach, to make sure that the points taken are distributed over the whole curve and not concentrated around one single point. For these reasons we did not see the need to consider deterministic samples in the non-rational case.

Configuration of the hardware and software environments: computations were carried out with Maple 17; in the optimization strategy 1 and to implement strategy 2, the basic Maple command realroot has been used, to compute the real roots of the univariate polynomials; this command provides symbolically separating intervals for the real roots with the length fixed by the user, then the real roots are taken as the central point of the isolating intervals. In strategy 3, the Maple command LagrangeMultipliers has been used to optimize the appropriate multivariate function. Actual computing times, running on a PC Intel Core i5-2467M CPU, 1.60 GHz and 4 GB of RAM, are given in seconds of CPU.

                           . The remaining 20 points are spread over the curve

                            and correspond to values of the parameter approaching the poles of the parametrization. The estimation returned by strategy 3 is extremely large. Fig. 6
                            shows the computation time comparison, with strategy 2 being much faster.

Given two real algebraic space curves

                      and

                      such that the Hausdorff distance between their real parts is guaranteed to be finite, in this paper we provide upper bounds of the distance from a point of

                     , using the distance between the projection of this objects into the plane 
                        z
                        =
                        0
                      and the distance between their z-coordinates. Therefore the bounding of the Hausdorff distance between space curves is reduced to the bounding of the distance between planar curves, and any method developed to estimate the distance between planar curves can be used now to estimate distances between space curves.

Based on the given bound we propose a method to estimate

                     , which can be used with curves being given in implicit or parametric representation. We apply this method to pairs of curves given in different representations and we compare the results with optimization methods. Experiments are made taking samples of points evenly or randomly, as appropriate depending of the curve being rational or not, and if rational having poles or not. The answers provided by our method were similar of significantly better, specially in the cases where samples of points are taken from a parametrization with the need of approaching the poles to take a representative sample.
