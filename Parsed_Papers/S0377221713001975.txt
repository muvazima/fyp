                  This study proposes an efficient exact algorithm for the precedence-constrained single-machine scheduling problem to minimize total job completion cost where machine idle time is forbidden. The proposed algorithm is based on the SSDP (Successive Sublimation Dynamic Programming) method and is an extension of the authors’ previous algorithms for the problem without precedence constraints. In this method, a lower bound is computed by solving a Lagrangian relaxation of the original problem via dynamic programming and then it is improved successively by adding constraints to the relaxation until the gap between the lower and upper bounds vanishes. Numerical experiments will show that the algorithm can solve all instances with up to 50 jobs of the precedence-constrained total weighted tardiness and total weighted earliness–tardiness problems, and most instances with 100 jobs of the former problem.

                      problem were solved by the dynamic programming algorithm. However, these instances were of the ordinary problems without precedence constraints, and job dominance properties in [16] were used as the precedence constraints. In other words, the purpose of the numerical experiment was to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dominance properties for improving the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the ordinary total tardiness problem without precedence constraints. It is true that they are applicable to the problem with precedence constraints that do not originate in dominance properties, but it cannot be expected that they work well especially when precedence constraints are not so restrictive and the number of feasible solutions (job sequences) is still very large. As is a well-known fact, strong dominance properties hold for

                     . The more recent study [18] follows this line of research. In [18], Tang et al. proposed a method to treat precedence constraints in a Lagrangian relaxation-based lower bound of the single-machine total weighted tardiness problem. Then, the effect of taking into account the precedence constraints derived from the dominance properties was examined by a numerical experiment.

This paper is on an exact algorithm for the precedence-constrained single-machine scheduling problem to minimize general additive costs. The precedence constraints considered in this paper are not those derived from the dominance properties that appear in [15,18], but more general ones as in [3]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no study on exact algorithms that consider such general precedence constraints directly for objective functions other than total weighted completion time, although the DP in [15] is applicable as already explained. For the single-machine problem without precedence constraints to minimize general additive objective functions, the first author and his colleagues have already proposed efficient exact algorithms that can solve instances with up to 300 jobs when machine idle time is forbidden [19] and with up to 200 jobs when it is permitted [20]. These results indicate that our algorithms outperform the other exact algorithms proposed so far for these classes of problems without precedence constraints. Therefore, it is expected that our framework is also effective for the precedence-constrained problem. Hence this study will extend these algorithms to the precedence-constrained problem, but only the case when machine idle time is forbidden is considered. Numerical experiments will show that the proposed algorithm can solve all 50 jobs instances of the precedence-constrained total weighted tardiness problem

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2, the problem considered in this study is formulated as a constrained shortest path problem. Next, in Section 3, our previous algorithms in [19,20] are reviewed and how to extend them to the problem with precedence constraints are shortly stated. Then, in Section 4, Lagrangian relaxations necessary for constructing the proposed algorithm are given and then how to solve them by dynamic programming is explained. In Section 5, the proposed algorithm is summarized. Section 6 shows some numerical results, and finally, Section 7 concludes this study.

In this section the precedence-constrained single-machine scheduling problem treated in this study is described formally and it is formulated as a constrained shortest path problem.

We treat this problem as a constrained shortest path problem on an acyclic weighted directed graph G
                     =(V, A, W). Let us introduce a dummy job n
                     +1 with p
                     
                        n+1
                     =1, f
                     
                        n+1(t)≡0 that should be completed twice at time 0 and T
                     +1 to denote the source node v
                     
                        n+1,0 and the sink node v
                     
                        n+1,T+1.
                        1
                        In [19], another dummy job 0 is introduced and the source node is denoted by v
                           00. However, only one dummy node is introduced here according to the newer notation in [20]. In [20], job 0 denotes a unit idle time.

                      Next, define a node set V by
                        
                           (1)

The proposed algorithm is based on the SSDP (Successive Sublimation Dynamic Programming) method [21,22] as our previous algorithms [19,20]. This algorithm is similar to the cutting plane algorithm: It first computes a lower bound by a simple relaxation of the original problem and then improves it successively by adding constraints (cuts) to the relaxation until the gap between the lower and upper bounds vanishes. Since all the relaxations are solved by dynamic programming, it is inevitable that the number of dynamic programming states increases as the number of added constraints increases. To cope with it, unnecessary states are eliminated in the course of the algorithm, which is the key point of the SSDP method. In our previous studies [19,20], several improvements for the original algorithm in [22] were proposed not only to reduce unnecessary states, but also to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. These improvements made the algorithm outperform the existing algorithms and instances even with 300 jobs could be solved optimally. This section gives a brief sketch of our previous algorithms. Then, how to extend it to our problem and where its difficulty lies will be explained shortly.

The following Lagrangian relaxations are employed in [19,20]. First, the constraints on the number of job occurrences (6) are relaxed by penalizing their violations. Next, the constraints on successive jobs [24] are added to the relaxation. These constraints forbid such a sub-path in the network representation that nodes representing the same job are visited twice or more. Therefore, they correspond to the cycle elimination constraints that often appear in routing problems (e.g. [23]). Then, the constraints based on the dominance of adjacent pairs of jobs [25,19] are added. These constraints forbid such a processing order of two adjacent jobs that interchanging their order can improve the solution. Finally, the relaxed constraints (6) are gradually recovered until the gap between the lower and upper bounds vanishes. An upper bound is computed in the course of the algorithms by first converting a solution of a relaxation to a feasible solution of the original problem and then by applying the dynasearch [29,30].

All these relaxations are solvable by dynamic programming algorithms. However, the number of the dynamic programming states, which corresponds to the size of the underlying network, increases exponentially as the constraints (6) are recovered. Therefore, unnecessary dynamic programming states are eliminated in the course of the SSDP method. In the original algorithm [22], a lower bound to pass through each state is computed by applying dynamic programming in both forward and backward directions, and the state is eliminated when the lower bound is not smaller than the current upper bound. This corresponds to the elimination of a node or an arc in the network representation. In addition to this, the network reduction based on the dominance of more than two successive jobs, the constraint propagation technique, and the compressed network representation were introduced in [20] to reduce the network more.

In this paper, we will extend the algorithm in [19] improved by integrating the techniques in [20] to the problem with precedence constraints. Roughly speaking, the following are necessary for this purpose:
                        
                           (a)
                           Relaxations for the problem with precedence constraints that are efficiently solvable by dynamic programming.

Extension of the network reduction techniques.

Extension of the upper bound computation method.

In the next section, we will give the relaxations in the proposed algorithm and show how to solve them by dynamic programming. Then, in Section 5, the proposed algorithm will be summarized together with (c).

This section gives the relaxations used in the proposed algorithm. The primary difference from those in the previous algorithms [19,20] is, as already explained in the preceding section, that the violation of all or part of the precedence constraints is penalized by the Lagrangian relaxation technique. However, it does not follow that the original dynamic programming algorithm is applicable to the relaxations considered here. In the following, the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the relaxations will be stated.

                        The relaxation (LR0) is the same as that of the problem without precedence constraints except the weights of the arcs, and hence can be solved by dynamic programming in O(nT) time (see [24]).

To improve the lower bound obtained by (LR0), the following constraints are imposed on (LR0) as in the previous algorithms [22,19,20]:

                        we introduce a reduced network G
                        S
                        =(V, A
                        S, W′). Then, (LR1) becomes equivalent to the unconstrained shortest path problem on G
                        S. On the other hand, (LR2) remains the constrained shortest path problem even on G
                        S. Since the precedence constraints are relaxed, the time complexities of (LR1) and (LR2) by dynamic programming do not differ from those in [19] and are given by O(nT) and O(n
                        2
                        T), respectively. It is worth noting that the time complexity of (LR2) is the same as the number of arcs ∣A
                        S∣ in G
                        S because each arc is evaluated once in the dynamic programming algorithm. For the detailed recursive equations, please refer to [19].

The second constraints are derived from the dominance theorem of dynamic programming [26] for adjacent pairs of jobs [25,19,20]. For the problem without precedence constraints, they restrict processing orders of adjacent pairs of jobs by checking their total costs. Here, we should slightly modify them to ensure the consistency with the precedence constraints.

If the two costs are identical, either (but not arbitrary) processing order can be forbidden without loss of optimality. To summarize, the processing orders of any adjacent pairs of jobs can be restricted and these restrictions are imposed on (LR2) as constraints.

                        n. Hence, the lower bound obtained by solving the relaxation improves as the relaxed constraints are recovered, and the gap between the lower and upper bounds vanishes in a finite number of iterations. To solve the relaxation in each iteration, it takes O(n

Elimination of unnecessary dynamic programming states in the SSDP method is performed in the course of the algorithm by the network reduction techniques in [20], which were explained in Section 3. These are applicable to our problem with minor modifications. An upper bound is computed also in a similar way to that in [20]: a solution of a relaxation is converted to a feasible solution of (P), and then the enhanced dynasearch [29,30] is applied to improve it. To convert to a feasible solution, we first remove all the jobs that break the precedence constraints or that occur more than once. Then, the jobs that do not appear in the partial schedule are inserted into it optimally or greedily so as not to break the precedence constraints. To insert the absent jobs optimally, the dynamic programming algorithm in [22] is applied with a modification to satisfy the precedence constraints. However, the time complexity of the algorithm depends exponentially on the number of absent jobs n′ and is given by

                                 2

                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . Therefore, a heuristic algorithm is employed instead to insert the absent jobs one by one according to the SPT (shortest processing time) order, when the number of such jobs is large. It takes only O(n′log n′) for ordering the absent jobs and O((2n
                     −
                     n′+1)n′) for inserting them one by one (the number of candidate positions for the i-th absent job is n
                     −
                     n′+
                     i). The obtained solution is improved by the enhanced dynasearch extended to our problem by forbidding moves in the neighborhood that break the precedence constraints. The dynasearch is a local search algorithm that employs a neighborhood called dynasearch neighborhood. It is defined by solutions obtained via any number of pairwise interchanges (PIs) that do not intersect with each other. In addition to PIs, extraction and forward shifted re-insertions (EFSRs), and extraction and backward shifted re-insertions (EFSRs) are considered in the enhanced dynasearch neighborhood. The primary advantage of these neighborhoods is that the best solution in the neighborhoods is obtainable in polynomial time by dynamic programming although they are composed of an exponential number of solutions. To extend them to the problem with precedence constraints, we simply forbid such PIs, EFSRs and EFSRs that break the precedence constraints, and this does not increase the time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm. The initial upper bound is computed in the same manner, except that the length of the partial schedule is zero and all the jobs are inserted greedily.

                      in Stage 3. It is because the duality gap of our problem is larger than that of the problem without precedence constraints and hence it is necessary to improve the lower bound as much as possible. Another reason is that if jobs i and j appear in 
                        
                           M

                      is set to zero to remove the corresponding penalty term from the objective function because the corresponding precedence constraint i
                     →
                     j is always satisfied. This affects the optimal Lagrangian multipliers much and thus justifies the re-adjustment.

The computation is performed on a desktop computer with Core i7 960 (3.2gigahertz) CPU and 12gigabytes RAM. The maximum memory size for storing the network structure is set to 3gigabytes and the time limit is set to 10,000seconds. For comparison, the dynamic programming algorithm in [15] is implemented and applied to these instances. Since this algorithm was originally proposed for employing dominance properties, the precedence relations derived from the dominance properties summarized in [31] are used for

On the other hand, the dynamic programming algorithm in [15] failed to solve instances only due to the memory limit. The latter algorithm could not solve some instances with 40 jobs. In particular, it could not solve even a single instance of

                     =0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 because dominance properties cannot be exploited for this type of problem. However, the precedence constraints are so restrictive when P
                     =0.2 and the algorithm worked better than the proposed algorithm. Nevertheless, it could not solve some of the instances with n
                     =100 and P
                     =0.2. For both the algorithms, the hardest instances seems those with P
                     =0.02 or P
                     =0.05.

Next, the lower bounds obtained in Stage 2 of the proposed algorithm and those by the method in [18] are compared for the instances with n
                     =40. The method in [18] is to exploit precedence constraints in the Lagrangian relaxation based-lower bound obtained by relaxing the machine availability constraint. To apply it, precedence relations derived from the dominance properties in [31] are also used as precedence constraints and put into the precedence graph G
                     P. Since the method in [18] cannot treat the precedence constraints that form an undirected cycle in G
                     P, such cycles are broken randomly.

The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4
                     
                     , where the average (ave) and maximum (max) relative gaps are given in percent. Here, the relative gap is computed by 100((optimal value)−(lower bound))/(optimal value), and when the absolute gap (optimal value)−(lower bound) is less than one, it is regarded as zero. From Table 3, we can see that much better lower bounds are obtained by our algorithm than the method in [18] for

It is direct to show that the best lower bound obtained by (LR0) and that by the Lagrangian relaxation of the machine availability constraint in [18] are identical when precedence constraints do not exist. Therefore, the advantages of our lower bound are the constraints in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, and the improvement by the method in [4], while the advantage of the method in [18] is that precedence constraints are not relaxed. Therefore, it was expected that the method in [18] yields better lower bounds as P increases, but the results were not so. One reason might be that the method in [18] cannot be applied to the problem with the precedence constraints including cycles and hence such precedence constraints are broken randomly. It follows that precedence constraints that are actually taken into account do not increase much even if P becomes large. On the other hand, all the precedence constraints are penalized in our method and, moreover, exactly considered for every pair of jobs in an adjacent position. This advantage seems to dominate over the advantage of the method in [18]. Nevertheless, the difference between the lower bounds in Stage 2 of our algorithm and those in [18] is not large and it might be difficult to solve the instances of

                     Tables 3 and 4 also suggest difficulties in obtaining good lower bounds for this type of problem. The gaps are large and widely distributed when P
                     ≠0 compared to those when P
                     =0. If a precedence constraint i
                     →
                     j is imposed on two jobs i and j that are processed in this order in an optimal solution for the problem without precedence constraints, it has no effect on the gap (when the corresponding Lagrangian multiplier is appropriately adjusted and is set to zero). Since the precedence constraints in the benchmark instances are generated randomly, the number of such precedence constraints also varies randomly. Nevertheless, it will not affect the gap much if the precedence constraints are handled successfully when computing the lower bounds. However, in practice, the gap is widely distributed and totally affected by the randomness of the precedence constraints, which together with the large gap implies the difficulties in obtaining good lower bounds.

This study constructed an efficient exact algorithm for the precedence-constrained single-machine scheduling problem by extending our previous algorithms for the problem without precedence constraints. Numerical experiments showed that it can solve all the instances with 50 jobs of

                     , although CPU time is not so impressive for larger instances. To improve the algorithm, it seems necessary to reduce the size of the network more by improving the lower bound via imposing some new constraints on the relaxations. It will also be necessary to extend the algorithm for the problem with machine idle time permitted. These are left for future research.

Another direction of research will be to construct a branch-and-bound algorithm. Although the SSDP framework is much more efficient than branch-and-bound algorithms [26,32] for the problem without precedence constraints, a branch-and-bound scheme may work better when the number of imposed precedence constraints is large because the search space is restricted. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to compare a branch-and-bound algorithm with the proposed algorithm.
