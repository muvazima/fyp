                  Whole-body vibration has been identified as a stressor to supine patients during medical transportation. The transmissibility between the input platform acceleration and the output acceleration of the head, sternum, pelvis, head-sternum, and pelvis-sternum of eight supine subjects were investigated. Vibration files were utilized in the fore-aft, lateral, and vertical directions. The power spectral density across the bandwidth of 0.5–20 Hz was approximately flat for each file. A comparison between a baseline rigid-support and a support with a long spinal board strapped to a litter has shown that the latter has considerable effects on the transmitted motion in all directions with a double magnification in the vertical direction around 5 Hz. The results also showed that the neck-collar has increased the relative head-sternum flexion–extension because of the input fore-aft vibration, but reduced the head-sternum extension–compression due to the input vertical vibration.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the U.S., there are an estimated 12,000–20,000 new spinal cord injuries each year (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001; Bernhard et al., 2005), with approximately 20% of deaths and 25% of cases exacerbated prior to arrival at the hospital (Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001; Thurman et al., 1994; Bernhard et al., 2005). The estimated cost of spinal cord injuries exceeds $7 billion (DeVivo, 1997). It is apparent that pre-hospital transportation is a critical period for patients of both civilian and military medical teams, yet healthcare on the battlefield presents some of the most dangerous and controversial methods of providing aid for combat casualties. Advancements in armor and current war tactics have changed the pattern of injury; current research has revealed that a larger proportion of head and neck injuries are emerging, with most due to an explosive mechanism (Owens et al., 2008). Within this harsh environment, pre-hospital transportation has become a topic of growing interest in recent years.

The phases of medical evacuation can be characterized by ground, vehicle, and aerial transport (Kang and Lehman, 2011), and whole-body vibration (Demic and Lukic, 2009; Johanning, 2011) exists in all of these modes. A study (Alberti et al., 2006) on off-road ambulance and hand transportation showed the largest un-weighted average accelerations—1.87 and 1.46 m/s2, respectively. In addition, helicopter and ambulance accelerations have been recorded in medical transportation (Silbergleit et al., 1991). Due to the lack of safety standards pertaining to supine vibration, whole-body vibration exposure has been studied using International Organization for Standardization (ISO-2631-1) standards for hand transport, ground vehicle transport, and aerial methods relating to a mountain rescue operation, even though these standards apply to seated vibration.


                     Huang and Griffin (2008a) observed the apparent mass for the semi-supine human body during vertical and longitudinal dual-axis vibration, the apparent mass during longitudinal and horizontal vibration (Huang and Griffin, 2008b), and the apparent mass and transmissibility during vertical vibration for the semi-supine, full supine, and constrained supine postures (Huang and Griffin, 2009). Specific to spinal immobilization, Perry et al. (1999) reported relative neck motions associated with horizontal vibration; the neck motion was deemed clinically significant by a neuroscientist for a potential contribution to spinal cord injury. In civilian applications, the use of a cervical collar is recommended during spinal immobilization (Shade et al., 2002; National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (US), 2005).

While the transmissibility for seated and standing positions can give valuable information to vibration suppression designers about the relationship between the input ground motion and the output motion at different points on the body, it has difficulties providing them with the same level of information for supine positions. In the supine position, the input energy enters the body from different locations (head, torso, pelvis, and legs), and while it looks like each segment is vibrating independently due to the input motion, it is also clear that the motion of each segment is affected by the motion of the neighboring segments. The relative transmissibility is introduced in this work to capture the effect of the input ground motion on the motion of the cervical spine (relative motion between the head and sternum) and on the motion of the lower back (relative motion between the sternum and pelvis).

The objective of the current work is to quantify the effect of a long spinal board strapped to a standard military litter and neck-collar conditions on the transmitted motion to the head, sternum, pelvis, cervical spine, and lower back during whole-body vibration. By understanding the supine human response under these conditions, future developments and designs may be incorporated to reduce the transmitted vibration to the supine patients during transportation.

@&#METHODS@&#

Eight healthy male participants with mean age of 23 years (SD 3.16), mean weight of 81 kg (SD 14.98), and mean height of 182 cm (SD 8.36) voluntarily took part in this study. The participants had no history of musculoskeletal disorders or injury. The study was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board for human subject studies, and informed consent was obtained for each participant prior to the study.

Each participant was placed upon a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vibration platform (Moog-FCS 628 electrical system, Ann Arbor, MI) capable of generating frequencies up to 25 Hz; accelerations up to 15 m/s2; strokes up to ±40 cm in the longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions; and angular motion up to ±15° in the roll, pitch, and yaw directions. Three conditions were used to attach the spinal immobilized, supine subjects. These include: (a) the baseline rigid platform covered by a thin rubber sheet (rigid platform, Fig. 1
                        a); (b) a long spinal board strapped to a standard military litter, secured to the rigid platform (board-litter, Fig. 1b); and (c) a long spinal board-litter with the addition of a cervical collar (board-litter-collar, Fig. 1c).

The cervical collar was fitted properly for each participant so that a neutral head position was maintained. In all cases, a 10-point harness was used to constrain the subjects to the long spinal board or rigid platform. Methods used during spinal immobilization were taken into consideration from commonly used pre-hospital emergency references (Shade et al., 2002; National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (US), 2005) as well as the local Emergency Medical Services (EMS) department (Johnson County Ambulance Service, IA), which provides emergency pre-hospital care and transportation. Inertial sensors (DeShaw and Rahmatalla, 2012) described in Section 2.3 were placed at five locations on the supine human: head, sternum, right pelvis, left pelvis, and right thigh (Fig. 1a). For the sternum and pelvis, a thin layer of medical tape was placed on the location where the inertial sensor was fixed using double-sided tape. Then, an adjustable strap was fitted to the participant in the supine position and fixed securely while considering each participant's comfort. Considering the local tissue-accelerometer motion, the strapping method used was similar to that used by Huang and Griffin (2009), and no correction was applied. One sensor was placed upon the participant's forehead and was fastened with foam wrap. During head immobilization (Fig. 1c), the head strap was placed over the head sensor. For the sternum and pelvis, the 10-point harness was not placed directly over the sensor locations (Fig. 1a). Foam pre-wrap was placed on the right thigh above the knee to reduce soft tissue movement. The inertial sensor was then secured with foam wrap. Inertial sensors were also secured to the back of the long spinal board approximately below the head, sternum, and pelvis, as well as the rigid platform.

Accelerometers are traditionally considered the main measuring tool in whole-body vibration experimentation. However, several new technologies have emerged during the last decade, and one of them will be used in this study. An inertial-based system (MTx inertial tracker, Xsens Technologies, Enschede, Netherlands) was used in this work. The system is comprised of – 18 g to + 18 g accelerometers, – 1200 deg/s to 1200 deg/s gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Each sensor has a 3D orientation accuracy of <0.5°, a dynamic accuracy of 2°, a resolution of 0.05°, a weight of 30 g, and a sampling rate up to 120 frames per second. The lab test showed that the sensor has a resonance frequency around 25 Hz; therefore, it is expected to cause minimal problems for the frequency range under consideration. The inertial system recorded linear acceleration and calculated orientation are represented in quaternion form.

Continuous random vibration files using white noise were used in the fore-aft, lateral, and vertical directions. The power spectral density across the bandwidth of 0.5–20 Hz was approximately flat for each file. A vibration magnitude of 1.0 m/s2 was used for each direction, and a vibration magnitude of 0.5 m/s2 was also used for the vertical input conditions. All files represented a different random vibration time history of 60 s in length. In comparison, Huang and Griffin (2009) used Gaussian random vibration from 0.0313 m/s2 to 1.0 m/s2 for 90 s. Due to the discomfort associated with longer spinal immobilization, the file length in the current study was reduced to 60 s. Such file length has been commonly used in transmissibility, apparent mass, and absorbed power studies for seated applications (Mansfield and Griffin, 2000; Nawayseh and Griffin, 2010; Wang et al., 2008; Abdul Jalil and Griffin, 2008).

Both linear acceleration and sensor orientation data were recorded by the inertial system. For application in the study, the local (xyz) linear acceleration was transformed into the global (XYZ) reference system using a rotation matrix (DeShaw and Rahmatalla, 2012). The rotation matrix is found from the quaternion output for each sensor as seen in the following equation (Xsens, 2009).

While the platform-to-head and platform-to-sternum transmissibilities are good measures of how the segments are moving relative to the platform, the relative transmissibility checks the severity of the motion between adjacent segments as a result of the input motion. One example is the relative motion between the head and the sternum, which gives an indication of what is occurring in the neck region. In other words, the higher the relative transmissibility, the worse the motion in the cervical area.

The paired-Wilcoxon signed rank method was implemented in this work using the transmissibility values at each frequency to investigate the significant differences (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon) between different conditions (rigid platform vs. board-litter) and neck constraint condition (board-litter vs. board-litter-collar). For example, the difference in transmissibility (rigid platform – board-litter) at a specified frequency was found for each participant (n = 8). Following, the hypothesis that the median of these differences is equal to zero was tested (Pagano et al., 2000). A paired-Wilcoxon was used by other researchers for transmissibility of the supine human (Huang and Griffin, 2009). Although there may be inter-subject variability, paired methods test the difference in the value for each pair of observations. In addition, the Wilcoxon test does not need to assume a normal distribution of the paired differences (Pagano et al., 2000).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The rigid-platform condition is used in this work as a baseline condition for the investigation of the supine-human transmissibility response to vibration under no back-support condition. In Figs. 2–4
                        
                        
                        , the column on the left represents the input in the X direction (fore-aft), the column in the middle represents the input in the Y direction (lateral), and the column on the right represents the input in the Z direction (vertical). The output components on the human body are represented by the lowercase letters x, y, and z as shown in Figs. 2–4.

For the baseline rigid-platform condition, the Zz component has indicated a 10 Hz natural frequency at the sternum (Fig. 2) and a 17 Hz at the head (Fig. 3). For the Xx component, the head showed a natural frequency around 3 Hz (Fig. 3), which is very close to that of the sternum (Fig. 2). For the Yy component, the head showed a natural frequency around 7 Hz (Fig. 3), while the sternum showed a peak around 2.5 Hz (Fig. 2).

The platform-to-sternum transmissibility (Fig. 2) for the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions have shown clear magnifications for the Xx, Zz, and Zx components, with the remaining components of the transmissibility showing marginable contribution. The Xx components for the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed a resonance around 3.5 Hz. The Zz component for the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed a transmissibility of magnitude around 3 and peaks around 5 Hz. For the Zx component, the board-litter and board-litter-collar conditions showed a peak around 6 Hz, with the board-litter-collar condition having a relatively higher magnitude than the board-litter condition.

When statistically comparing the board-litter with the rigid-platform condition, significant differences were seen in the Zz component, with the board-litter causing a magnification at 0–6.7 Hz and attenuation at 8.1–20 Hz. For the Xx component, significant magnification occurred in the frequency range of 0–7.6 Hz, and attenuation occurred from 11.8 to 20 Hz. The Zx component showed significant magnification from 0.7 to 7.9 Hz with some attenuation from 9.4 to 20 Hz.

As shown in Fig. 3, the Xx component for all conditions showed a resonance around 3 Hz. The Yy component for the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed two resonances around 2 Hz and 8 Hz. In the Zz component, the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed two resonances around 5 and 11 Hz. The Zx component was sensitive to the support conditions and showed peaks around 11 Hz for the board-litter condition and around 10 Hz for the board-litter-collar condition.

The comparison between the head transmissibility under the rigid platform and the board-litter condition (Fig. 3) showed that the Zz component of the board-litter condition had significant magnification at 0–7 Hz and attenuation at 12.8–20 Hz. In addition, the Zx component showed significant amplification from 0 to 10 Hz and attenuation from 12.6 to 20 Hz. The Yy component had a small magnification from 0 to 2.1 Hz, and larger attenuation over the range of 3.9–8.7 Hz. In the Xx component, following the peak at 3 Hz, there was an increase in transmissibility at 11 Hz; significant differences were found from 8.25 to 15.5 Hz as well. Finally, for the Xz component, the board-litter system showed significant amplification from 1.9 to 13.6 Hz and minimal attenuation from 16.5 to 20 Hz.


                        Fig. 4 shows the results of the relative sternum-head transmissibility under the three single-direction input (X, Y, and Z) motion of the platform. The Xx and Yy components of the board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed the lowest relative transmissibility around 5 Hz; however, they showed the largest relative transmissibility around 7 Hz for the Zz component. The board-litter condition showed a higher relative transmissibility for the Zx condition, but less magnification for the Xz condition.

Differences were observed during the statistical comparison between the rigid-platform and board-litter conditions in the Zz, Yy, Xx, Zx, and Xz components. For the Zz component, significant magnification was shown in the board-litter conditions over 0–11.3 Hz and attenuation from 13.2 to 20 Hz. The peak Yy magnification was also significant from 3.5 to 6.7 Hz. Relative transmissibility was significantly lower in the Xx direction for the board-litter system over the range 0–11.2 Hz. Zx had significant amplification from 1.7 to 8.6 Hz and attenuation from 13.0 to 20 Hz. Also, the Xz component showed significant amplification from 8.8 to 14.1 Hz.


                        Fig. 5
                        a shows the median platform-to-pelvis transmissibility under vertical input vibration (Z). For the Zz component, the baseline transmissibility showed a resonance around 8 Hz. The board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed a similar trend, with a peak frequency around 5 Hz; the transmissibility showed lower magnitudes for the Zx and Zy components, with both cases showing relatively smaller peaks around 5 Hz.

Significant differences between the rigid-platform and board-litter conditions were found for the Zx and Zz components. For the Zx component, the board-litter system showed significant attenuation from 9.1 to 20 Hz, while the Zz component showed significant amplification from 0 to 7.6 Hz and attenuation from 8.9 to 20 Hz.

The rigid platform relative transmissibility of the Zz component of the sternum-pelvis ascended steadily for the frequency under consideration but reached a steady state around 19 Hz (Fig. 5b). The board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed a peak around 7 Hz but descended after that. While the Zy component showed transmissibility below 0.4, the Zx component depicted two peaks for the baseline rigid platform around 10 and 15 Hz. The board-litter and the board-litter-collar conditions showed similar trends and peaked around 6 Hz, with the board-litter-collar condition showing a relatively higher transmissibility at that peak.

The comparison between the rigid-platform and board-litter conditions showed differences in the Zx and Zz components. The Zx of the board-litter conditions showed significant magnification from 0.6 to 7.5 Hz and attenuation from 9.3 to 20 Hz. In Zz, there was significant attenuation from 12.3 to 20 Hz.

Comparing the board-litter condition with the board-litter-collar condition (Fig. 3), there were no meaningfully significant differences in the Zz, Yy, and Xx components for head transmissibility. Zx displayed significant attenuation with the cervical collar from 2.3 to 13.3 Hz; however, Xz showed amplification with significant differences in 0–20 Hz.

For the head sternum relative transmissibility (Fig. 4), the effects of the cervical collar were seen in the Zx and Xz components. For the Zx component, significant attenuation was presented from 6.7 to 14.1 Hz. Significant magnification was seen for the Xz condition from 0 to 20 Hz. These findings were similar to the effect of the cervical collar on the head transmissibility.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The concept of the relative transmissibility of a supine human may present important parameters toward better litter system designs. For example, the platform-to-sternum transmissibility (Zz in Fig. 2) and platform-to-pelvis transmissibly (Zz in Fig. 5a) have shown similar characteristics to some degree, especially up to 7 Hz, with both of them resonating around 5 Hz; thus, their relative transmissibility (Zz in Fig. 5b) in this range is small, meaning that the segments are moving together and the relative motion between them is minimal. However, the transmissibility Zz component in Fig. 5a showed the pelvis resonating around 7 Hz, but the Zz component of the relative transmissibility in Fig. 5b indicates no significant motion at the lower back area at 7 Hz. The latter would indicate that the pelvis and the sternum are moving together as a result of the ground motion. Therefore, it would be unwise to design a vibration suppression system with the goal of targeting the 7 Hz of the pelvis as that may increase the relative motion at the lower back.

The sternum and the head have shown different baseline resonances in different directions, which can be attributed to the differences in their mass, stiffness, and constraint conditions; however, most of these frequencies are still greater than 10 Hz and therefore are expected to be attenuated by the litter-board system. Clear examples are shown in the Zz and Zx cases of Figs. 2 and 3. Below 10 Hz, the sternum motion is affected directly by the board-litter system at 5 Hz as shown in Zz in Fig. 2; however, it appears that the head is affected by the litter-board system at 5 Hz as well as by the sternum and the pad underneath the head at 10 Hz (Fig. 3).

The effect of the board-litter system on the motion during fore-aft and lateral vibrations is not as prominent as that in the vertical Z direction. While it looks like the board-litter system is moderately magnifying the motion of the sternum around 3 Hz in Xx, the relative transmissibility between the sternum and the head was attenuated in the Xx direction.

Most transportation systems are expected to generate some frequencies below 10 Hz in the vertical direction, and that can generate large motion and possibly large relative motion between the body segments of supine patients in the board-litter condition. Still, the results of this work have indicated that the human motion is mostly magnified in the vertical Zz direction, and therefore it would be more effective to implement vibration suppression systems in that direction rather than the other directions. The results have also shown that supine patients with neck collar support should be transported with care, as the collar may magnify the flexion–extension motion of the neck due to the input fore-aft acceleration that may result from frequent acceleration–deceleration of the transport system. Furthermore, the results have demonstrated the unique characteristics of supine transport, where the input motion and the interconnectivity between the body segments may affect the relative motion between the segments, and that may cause harm to supine patients with cervical and lumbar spine injuries.

The effect of vibration magnitude in the vertical direction on the natural frequencies of the human sternum and head showed softening characteristics for the four support conditions (Fig. 6
                     ) similar to those observed by Huang and Griffin (2009) for the sternum. The resonance frequency was shifted by 1–2 Hz when the input vibration magnitude was increased from 0.5 m/s2 to 1 m/s2.

The results have, in general, shown insignificant changes in the transmissibility magnitude when sinusoidal input signals were used instead of random input signals (Fig. 7
                     ). The Zz component of the sternum showed a less than 5% difference in the peak for the human response during random and sine sweep signals, while the board-litter system showed an approximately 15–25% higher peak value for random vibration. These differences were not seen in peak head transmissibility.

With the current spinal board dimensions and material type, it was expected that the board would show some flexibility, especially along its longitudinal axis. The transmissibility between the rigid platform and the output motion at three locations on the board (under the head, under the sternum, and under the pelvis) was investigated. The results showed similar characteristics at these three locations in terms of the resulting peaks; however, the one under the pelvis showed a magnitude that is slightly higher than the one under the sternum. The one under the head showed a smaller peak (around 5 Hz) in comparison to the other two points.

The data collection was associated with some difficulties. The usage of the inertial system for a supine human facilitated to a certain degree the transformation of the acceleration components from the local to the global reference frames; however, the system was sensitive to the metal interface, which could affect the z rotation angle. In this work, the local to global z rotation was approximated as zero, as the sensors were approximately aligned on the participant's body. It should be mentioned that full 6-DOF motion can be measured using the inertial systems by carefully placing sensors at locations where minimum magnetic interference exists. There were also some difficulties associated with strapping the sensor to the subject's head using the head immobilization. Other researchers noted this as well (Alberti et al., 2006). One limitation of the current work is in the subject population, where mostly young males participated in the testing. These young males may represent military personnel but not the general population; therefore, further investigations are required before generalizing the results of this work for different populations.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The board-litter system has significantly magnified the transmissibility in the vertical direction for frequencies below 10 Hz, but it significantly attenuates the motion after that. Therefore, when using the board-litter system, it would be more cost effective to use vibration suppression systems mainly in the Zz direction. The neck collar has significantly magnified the flexion–extension motion of the head-sternum during the input fore-aft whole-body vibration, but has significantly attenuated the extension–compression motion in the neck during the input vertical vibration. Thus, the neck collar should be used carefully when the transportation system encounters frequent fore-aft vibration resulting from frequent braking and/or speeding.
