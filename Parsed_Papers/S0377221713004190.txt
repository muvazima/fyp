In Korhonen et al. (2011), we proved that, if case (i) (respectively case (ii)) occurs, then DRS (respectively IRS) prevail at (x

                     o
                   in case of (iii) or (iv). In Theorem 1 we prove that CRS prevail when case (iii) occurs, however, all three situations CRS, IRS or DRS are possible in case (iv). DMU

Case (a) is an overlap of cases (iii) and (iv), and in this case CRS prevail as proved in Theorem 1. The following theorems clarify the RTS situation when case (b) or (c) occurs (NIRS≡CRS or DRS. Also, NDRS≡CRS or IRS). The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to that of Theorems 1 and 2.
