                  Interpenetrated polymer networks (IPNs), composed by two independent polymeric networks that spatially interpenetrate, are considered as valuable systems to control permeability and mechanical properties of hydrogels for biomedical applications. Specifically, poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA)–poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) IPNs have been explored as good hydrogels for mimicking articular cartilage. These lattices are proposed as matrix implants in cartilage damaged areas to avoid the discontinuity in flow uptake preventing its deterioration. The permeability of these implants is a key parameter that influences their success, by affecting oxygen and nutrient transport and removing cellular waste products to healthy cartilage. Experimental try-and-error approaches are mostly used to optimize the composition of such structures. However, computational simulation may offer a more exhaustive tool to test and screen out biomaterials mimicking cartilage, avoiding expensive and time-consuming experimental tests. An accurate and efficient prediction of material's permeability and internal directionality and magnitude of the fluid flow could be highly useful when optimizing biomaterials design processes. Here we present a 3D computational model based on Sussman–Bathe hyperelastic material behaviour. A fluid structure analysis is performed with ADINA software, considering these materials as two phases composites where the solid part is saturated by the fluid. The model is able to simulate the behaviour of three non-biodegradable hydrogel compositions, where percentages of PEA and PHEA are varied. Specifically, the aim of this study is (i) to verify the validity of the Sussman–Bathe material model to simulate the response of the PEA–PHEA biomaterials; (ii) to predict the fluid flux and the permeability of the proposed IPN hydrogels and (iii) to study the material domains where the passage of nutrients and cellular waste products is reduced leading to an inadequate flux distribution in healthy cartilage tissue. The obtained results show how the model predicts the permeability of the PEA–PHEA hydrogels and simulates the internal behaviour of the samples and shows the distribution and quantification of fluid flux.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Articular cartilage defects are a common type of injury in aged population [1]. Most common treatments consist of removing the diseased and undermined cartilage to stop inflammation and pain, including chondrectomy and debridement [2]. In both cases, the empty area is covered with a fibrous self-regenerated tissue with similar structure to healthy tissue but with poor mechanical properties [3]. Fibered matrix implants are explored as a substitution of damaged tissue providing good mechanical properties, mimicking cartilage microstructure [4], avoiding discontinuity in flow uptake with healthy tissue (host tissue) which prevent its deterioration (Fig. 1
                     ). Recently, these lattices are also proposed as ex vivo platforms in bioreactors to test scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering to mimic the host healthy tissue in vivo. They act in vitro as support systems to lodge scaffolds and maintain the correct fluid flow [5].

In this sense, the internal structure of the fibered matrix implant is a major biomaterial characteristic for tissue engineering [6,7] that provide structural support for mechanical loads and keep the adequate distribution of stress within the tissue. Such constructs offer a flexible physical environment to allow passage of nutrients and removing cellular waste products contained in the synovial fluid in response to dynamic compression process similar to those observed in physiological tissue conditions [8]. Cells nutrition and by-product exchange are diffusive mediated processes occurring in the cellular surrounding region [9]. Therefore, these events are of special interest in biomedical implants for cartilage as being the only mean of nutrient uptake by chondrocytes, due to the avascular and no neural nature of this tissue [10].

The intrinsic permeability coefficient of the implant materials and inner fluid flux analysis are determinant to ensure homogeneous supply of nutrients thorough the system [11]. In this sense, the inner flux analysis provides insight into the adequate nutrient distribution within the healthy tissue [12]. To experimentally control both parameters, numerous manufacturing techniques have been developed, from particulate-leaching techniques, where salt, wax or sugar porogens are used to create the pores or channels [13], to the “rapid prototyping” where the fabrication process is computationally controlled [14]. Most of these methods can rapidly produce fibered matrix implants; however, the critical variables such as porosity, mechanical properties and diffusive parameters are not controlled.

The observed shortcomings are partially overcome by the use of interpenetrated polymer networks (IPNs) [15]. IPNs are polymeric systems of two or more independent networks which are spatially interlaced, but do not have covalent bonds between them (Fig. 2
                     ). The resulting biomaterial offers not only good mechanical properties and permeability but also high thermo stability and good dielectric properties [16].

Despite of the above mentioned advances in mimicking the natural tissue environment, oversimplified biomaterials for cartilage tissue regeneration are still being used [17]; since high experimental costs and consumed manufacturing time make inefficient the optimization process to obtain custom adequate biomaterials to host tissue singularities [18].

These observations motivate the development of new computational models to simulate the behaviour of each specific biomaterial avoiding try-and-error experimental assays and also providing additional insights in IPN manufacturing processes [19]. Due to the wide variety of hydrogel compositions and manufacturing procedures [20], experimental assays to characterize their behaviour are costly and time-consuming. In this sense, computational models can simulate their specific behaviour depending on their composition. Whereas hydrogels manufactured through traditional materials as collagen [21], have been widely modelled, computational models to simulate IPNs remain unexplored. Besides, the lack of understanding concerning the flux generated when applying different mechanical forces, prevent their use in new applications related to tissue engineering [22]. Specifically, it is of special relevance, to establish the magnitude and directionality of flux that will be held in each specific hydrogel composition [23]. It should be sufficient to enable nutrient diffusion to cells avoiding their death due to malnutrition and consequently, the matrix degradation [24]. For such materials, the constitutive models have a wide variation in their complexity, from simple linear-elastic models to hyper-elastic continuum models [25,26].

In this work, we present a 3D computational model to simulate the behaviour of IPNs based on Sussman–Bathe material model, to analyze the magnitude and direction of the fluid flux to explore the regions of the biomaterial with no nutrient supply and to predict the permeability of the IPNs that mimic cartilage tissue. For this, a fluid structure analysis is performed with ADINA software.

For this aim, three compositions of non-biodegradable poly(ethylacrylate) (PEA)–poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) IPNs were characterized to obtain the required model parameters (Young's modulus, aggregate modulus and material specific density) and to validate the computational model (permeability). In these systems, PEA defines a support network contributing to rigidity and mechanical resistance [27], while the second compound, PHEA, provides the diffusion properties to the material due to its hydrophilic nature that enables oxygen uptake [28]. Non-biodegradable and biocompatible nature of these PHEA–PEA IPNs ensures their stability and permanency in damaged areas [29]. Besides IPNs are suturable materials allowing its fixation to a specific zone of the cartilage [30]. Some experimental assays have been performed with similar lattices. These composites have been applied in damage rabbit cartilage and as corneal implants, observing a similar behaviour to host tissue and preventing the progression of damage [31]. For this work, the simulated mixed lattices have been previously characterized experimentally and its contents of PEA and PHEA were optimized to mimic the articular cartilage [32,33].

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

Prior to the computational model development, samples of PEA–PHEA hydrogels were synthesized and characterized [32,33]. For this work, new experiments to complete the framework of model parameters are developed. To understand the mechanical environment and lattice behaviour, in this section, we summarize both previous and new experiments.

PEA–PHEA hydrogels were used as an optimal candidate for biomedical implant, mimicking cartilage mechanical properties. These biomaterials are proposed as a substitution of cartilage damage areas leading continuous flux to healthy zones avoiding its deterioration [32,33]. Five samples of each family were obtained by punching 6 cylinders of 6mm diameter in a 2mm thickness sheet. Samples compositions are collected in Table 1
                        . Detailed description of the synthesis process can be recovered from [32,33]. Note that all the samples are a composition of solid and liquid materials, PHEA–PEA and PBS solution respectively, which configure a stable two phases composite material.

From the experimental work developed by Poveda-Reyes et al. materials Young modulus (E
                        
                           S
                        ) and permeability (k) were extracted [32–34]. Additionally, new experiments were performed to obtain aggregated modulus (H
                        
                           a
                        ), bulk modulus (K, that is the measure of the substance's resistance to uniform compression), Poisson's coefficient (υ) and characteristic stress–strain curve of each PHEA–PEA family. It is of importance to note that for such type of compounds, the variation of the stress–strain relation is very wide depending on percentage of each compound [32,33].

To avoid non-linear contact between the sample surface and the used tools, pre-contact assays were carried out to generate an optimal approach. In this sense, a pre-charge was applied of 0.01N.

PHEA–PEA IPN implants are bear compressive. Consequently, these materials are performed to exhibit high resistance to compression and limited tensile strength. Therefore, uniaxial compression test is experimentally developed to characterize their behaviour.

Three assays of both confined (CC) and non-confined (NC) configurations were performed. Specifically, H
                           
                              a
                            is obtained from CC assays whereas strain–stress curve and related E
                           
                              S
                            of samples are extracted from NC assay; in both cases fluid saturated samples are considered. A constant deformation was induced at 1mm/min in an Instron MicroTester 5548 [35] to reach a threshold value of 49N. As a result, engineering strain–stress curves were recorded.

For IPN PEA–PHEA network simulation, a two phases composite material is considered. In each point of the composite it is assumed the coexistence of two phases, the solid phase (including PHEA, PEA and the nanophase separation) and a fluid phase (PBS solution). Related experimental assays to obtain model parameters are coincident with this assumption performing the measurement of the composite samples [32,33]. For the constitutive model a hyperelastic material behaviour is considered. The behaviour of this biomaterial was modelled using the strain energy function (ψ) proposed by Sussman and Bathe [39]:

A Finite element (FE) model of each family sample (family 1: PEA60/40–64% PHEA; family 2: PEA50/50–71% PHEA and family 3: PEA40/60–79% PHEA) was used to reproduce the uniaxial compression test in hydrogel samples. Disks of 6mm diameter and 2mm thickness were simulated in all cases, coincident with experiments. During the compression process, a progressive load was applied to the upper surface of the samples; reaching its maximum value of 54.81kPa at 12s of simulation time. The FE model consisted of 1521 nodes and 1152 hexahedral elements. The material model was described using the previously proposed formulation developed within ADINA software for the three main effects observed experimentally; non-linear deformation, viscoelasticity and fluid flow through the porous structure. A total Lagrange formulation was employed under the assumption of large displacements and strains [42]. Set of the problem equations was solved using an iterative explicit dynamic analysis.

The applied model displacement constrains mimic the uniaxial compression test in NC conditions. Thus, displacement in z direction is restricted for the lower surface (u
                        
                           z

To simulate the flow of the continuous fluid medium though the material, the classical Navier–Stokes equations are applied [43].

The model described above is used to simulate the behaviour of reinforced hydrogels for cartilage tissue applications. Several simplifications have been made to develop this model. It is assumed that initially the hydrogel samples are saturated with PBS fluid without air within the porous structure.

First, additionally to mechanical characterization reported in literature [22,33] we have developed a common experimental assay to complete the required model parameters, which is a monotonic uniaxial compression test. Subsequently, H
                     
                        a
                     , K, υ, engineering stress–strain curves of each family sample were obtained. Later, the measured properties and those reported by Poveda-Reyes and Manzano et al. [32,33] where included into the computational model to predict the permeability of each family sample as well as to analyze the outgoing flux of fluid and the behaviour of these materials.

The summary of the experimental parameters required for the computational model is collected in Table 2. Significant variations for E

                        <0.05) when percentage of PHEA differs more than 29% between the tested samples. This fact shows the need of varying considerably the amount of PHEA to modify the resulting H
                        
                           a
                         of the IPN [32,33]. Experimental data points for strain–stress curves were recorded from the monotonic uniaxial compression assay for each sample. Fig. 3 shows the strain–stress curve of Sussman–Bathe theoretical prediction and fitted experimental data. Note that ADINA software preferences include tension–compression data. However, since these materials are proposed to compression and shear loading applications, they exhibit a low tensile strength. Thus, it is assumed a linear behaviour for the tensile part in the logarithmic strain–stress space.

The required finite element model parameters of each PEA–PHEA polymeric network are shown in Table 3
                        . The experimental parameters, volumetric expansion, β
                        =0.5 and relaxation time, τ
                        =10.0s−1 were estimated from materials with similar behaviour [45].

In line with experimental results [32,33], computational results demonstrate that the permeability of the material directly correlates with the amount of PHEA. Family 3 with 79% of PHEA offers higher permeability, k
                        =7.47·10−16
                        m4/Ns. For family 2, where the percentage of PHEA is 71%, the predicted and experimental permeability are in agreement with 6.05 4·10−16
                        m4/Ns and 6.12·10−16
                        ±1.025·10−18
                        m4/Ns respectively. Low percentage of PHEA produces the reduction of pore formation and as a consequence, the permeability of the sample is decreased as Poveda-Reyes and Manzano et al. [32,33] demonstrate experimentally. Family 1 with 64% of PHEA content shows the lowest experimental permeability of 5.67·10−16
                        ±5.21·10−17
                        m4/Ns while the permeability obtained by the numerical model is 6.0554·10−16
                        m2/Ns. Biologically, cartilage anisotropy and inhomogeneity are due to its composition, fibres orientation and ion distribution within the tissue [46]. Therefore, values adopted for characteristic parameters of cartilage, as permeability, are in a wide range (Fig. 4
                        , green column) depending on the cartilage layers (e.g. superficial, intermediate or radiate zone). The results show a high agreement between results in both cases (see Fig. 4). Comparing simulated results with human physiological permeabilities, it is observed that the three studied families exhibit values close to those reported in literature [46]. Internal fluid flux were computed, monitored and analyzed for 12s of hydrogel deformation coincident with experimental test. Results are shown for 0.8, 6.0 and 11.60s of simulation (Fig. 5
                        ).

Under the assumption of frictionless, impermeable bottom and upper surfaces, the fluid flows towards the lateral side of the sample when squeezing out (Fig. 5). Initially, after 0.8s of simulations, the upper area of the hydrogel presents the maximun flux velocity of 1.05·10−4
                           m/s. This velocity is reduced within the depth of the sample, reaching its minimun value in the lower area. After 6s of simulation, results revealed a prominent “bell-shape flow” where higher flux was in the inner area of the sample, 6·10−5
                           m/s. This phenomenon was also observed by Botchwey et al. [47] when measuring nutrient transport in three-dimensional matrices; the authors concluded that, in most cases some inappropriate designed dynamic culture environments lead to regions of insufficient nutrient concentration to maintain cell viability, and can result in steep nutrient concentration gradients within the hydrogel samples. This tendency remains until the end of the simulation process, at 12s. At this stage, homogeneous distribution within hydrogels is expected. However, there is a lower area of the samples where no flux supply is observed which considered as a critical region for nutrient diffusion, denoting areas without fluid passage to the host tissue. Botchwey et al. [47] also established experimentally the minimum flux velocity (7.4·10−5
                           m/s) sufficient to deliver glucose for cell maintenance. In Fig. 5, magenta colour refers to these zones that have flux velocity more than the minimum value.

In the second family, velocity profile is obtained (Fig. 5). For this family the amount of PHEA content is slighly increased to 71%. Hence, an increment in the intrinsic permeability of samples, respect family 1, is obtained. Subsequently, higher fluid velocity values and expansion of the fluid are showed in simulation results. At 0.8s, in Fig. 5, red arrows show a thin upper area where the flux magnitude is maximum, 1.05·10−4
                           m/s. After this threshold value, the fluid flux is reduced subtantially to 4.5·10−5
                           m/s and 7.5·10−6
                           m/s in the middle and lower area respectively. After 6s of simulation, the previous mentioned “bell-shape flow” is also clearly evidenced. 3D computational results revealed maximum flux velocities located not only in the upper layer of sample (1.05·10−4
                           m/s) but also in the medium zone (7.5·10−5
                           m/s). Whereas these mentioned areas received higher fluid supply, lower inner area is still insufficient irrigated, as occurs in previus analyses of family 1.

In the last studied family, percentage of PHEA is equal to 79% of total composition. In this conditions the flux distribution was also monitored after 12s of the squeezing simulation. At that time, the model clearly showed a progressive decrease of the flux extension towards the lower surface of the sample ranging from 1.05·10−4
                           m/s in the upper region (significant higher compared to results obtained for families 1 and 2) to 1.5·10−5
                           m/s below this layer (Fig. 5). Respect to lateral outgoing flux, while families 1 and 2 showed velocities of 7.5·10−5
                           m/s in this local regions, family 3 showed a velocity of 6.75·10−5
                           m/s. Compared with the previously studied families, incipient “bell-shape flow” shows a slightly reduced area with no fluid supply.

To fully understand the effect of composition and the resulting mechanical properties in the IPNs, internal flow rate together with geometrical changes (upper surface displacement, u
                        
                           z
                        , and diameter expansion, ∅
                        
                           sam
                        ) is also analyzed during the 12s of simulation. In this study, samples are assumed to be initially saturated with PBS solution.


                        Fig. 6
                        a shows the simulation results for maximum internal flow rate in each family sample. It is evidenced that families 1 and 2 experimented an abrupt outgoing of water after 2s of simulation. At this point, they yielded the highest outgoing flow rate peaked at 8.24·10−10
                        m3/s and 8.29·10−10
                        m3/s. After this threshold value, outgoing flux is maintained approximately constant until the end of the process (12s). Regarding to family 3, results showed lower internal flow rate which also exhibited a sharp increment during the first 1.2s of simulation and reached its maximum value at 6.336·10−10
                        m3/s. Hence, after 2s of simulation internal flow rate for family 3 is stabilized at 5.44·10−10
                        m3/s, lower than those observed in family 1, 7.804·10−10
                        m3/s, and family 2, 7.75·10−10
                        m3/s. For family 3 high fluid flux rates is expected due to its high permeability values (k
                        =7.47·10−17
                        m4/Ns); however, these are clearly overwhelmed by the “compaction effect” that takes place as a consequence of the lower mechanical properties of the polymer network (E
                        
                           S
                        
                        =0.55·10−6
                        Pa, υ
                        =0.462 and K
                        =2.41·106
                        Pa). Maximum and minimum flows usually applied in chondrocytes cultures and in bioreactors for cell maintenance [48] are showed in Fig. 6a (dotted line). The three computational flows obtained for each family are within this range.

In similar conditions, geometrical changes were also monitored (u
                        
                           z
                         and ∅
                        
                           sam
                        ), and again correlated to polymeric percentage composition and resulting mechanical properties.

Regarding to the upper sample surface u
                        
                           z
                        , family 1 and family 2 exhibit similar displacement after 12s of simulation, 1.543·10−4
                        m and 1.528·10−4
                        m respectively. By comparing families 1 and 2, bulk and Young's modulus of both families are in the same order (K
                        =5.29·106
                        Pa and E
                        =1.24·106
                        Pa for family 1; K
                        =8.15·106
                        Pa and E
                        =0.93·106
                        Pa for family 2). In vivo knee articular cartilage deformation, depending on activity developing, usually exhibits a maximum deformation lower than 8% (dotted line, Fig. 6b) [49]. Consistently, variation in diameter similarly increase for both families, they showed a fast expansion in the first 0.5s of deformation. Subsequently, the expansion of the sample diameter keeps smoothly until a peak value of 6.14·10−3
                        m at the end of the simulation (12s). High PHEA (and as a consequence lower PEA) percentage in IPN leaded to proportional higher maximal displacements (Fig. 6c). In this sense, family 3 (79% of PHEA content) yielded highest displacement in the upper surface of the sample as expected. It exhibits a sharp increment along the 12s of simulation and capture a displacement of 1.725·10−4
                        m at this final time. It showed lower diameter expansion, respect to families 1 and 2, the maximum reached value is 6.03·10−3
                        m at 12s of simulation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study presents a 3D model able to predict the permeability, monitor the velocity and direction of internal fluid flux and simulate the deformation of non-biodegradable PEA–PHEA implants for cartilage tissue engineering. The main novelty of this model is the consideration of Sussman–Bathe material model together with visco-elastic effects in a fluid structure analysis to capture the behaviour of IPN hydrogels.

Results showed that the proposed computational model is capable of predicting the permeability of the hydrogels and simulating its internal behaviour and geometry changes which helps to determine the optimum parameters needed for hydrogels fabrication. Moreover, the present computational model is the first one which predicts the direction and the magnitude of the flux thorough the IPN PEA–PHEA porous being these parameters essential for cell maintenance and viability.

In absence of literature data about IPN implants behaviour, we validate the presented model by comparing experimental permeability reported in [32,33] where the authors synthesize and mechanically characterize the studied PEA–PHEA families with obtained computational permeability for each hydrogel family. As expected, similar permeability values were obtained in both cases. Computational results showed that family 3 (40/60 PEA–79% PHEA) offered a wider range in permeability values than family 1 (60/40 PEA–64% PHEA) and family 2 (50/50 PEA–71% PHEA). Anyhow, the three families predicted and experimental permeabilities are within the cartilage physiological range, consequently, these materials perfectly mimics this tissue resistance offered to the passage of fluid [46]. Family 1 presents an inner region without flux which indicates no nutrient diffusion in this region and therefore, non-continuous passage of nutrients to the host tissue. Similarly, family 2 evidenced the same phenomena, but offering higher flux velocity in the peripheral areas of the implants. Family 3 showed a slight reduction of this critical region. This fact indicates that an addition in PHEA compound is strongly associated to the increment of the porosity and consequently, to higher permeability of the material to fluid flow through it.

The inclusion of the visco-elastic effect in the model formulation enabled accurately capturing the hydrogel deformation during the uniaxial compression test.

Simulation results showed how significant variations in the IPN networks generate significant changes in the mechanical properties and consequently in the material behaviour. So, in the light of obtained results, family 3 offers loading resistance similar to those observed in experiments in vivo 
                     [50,51].

Briefly, the presented model is capable of predicting the intrinsic permeability of IPN hydrogel samples when external loads are applied. Furthermore, it enables to capture the behaviour of theses biomaterials quantifying the influence of varying mechanical properties such as E
                     
                        S
                     , K and υ. This, together with the capability of displaying the results into easy interpretable 3D images, present this model as an interesting novel tool for designing, monitoring and controlling the efficacy of such materials as biomedical implants.
