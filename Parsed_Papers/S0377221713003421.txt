                  This study investigates multiperiod service level (MSL) policies in supply chains facing a stochastic customer demand. The objective of the supply chains is to construct integrated replenishment plans that satisfy strict stockout-oriented performance measures which apply across a multiperiod planning horizon. We formulate the stochastic service level constraints for the fill rate, ready rate, and conditional expected stockout MSL policies. The modeling approach is based on the concept of service level trajectory and provides reformulations of the stochastic planning problems associated with each MSL policy that can be efficiently solved with off-the-shelf optimization solvers. The approach enables the handling of correlated and non-stationary random variables, and is flexible enough to accommodate the implementation of fair service level policies, the assignment of differentiated priority levels per products, or the introduction of response time requirements. We use an earthquake disaster management case study to show the applicability of the approach and derive practical implications about service level policies.
               
            

Shortage management is a key supply chain performance driver. A stockout causes not only a canceled order (and therefore profit loss), but it also reduces the likelihood of receiving future orders from customers whose demand could not be initially satisfied (see Anderson et al. (2006) for a study about the effects of stockouts). Decision-makers with stockout-averse preferences (i.e., aversion to losing potential sales) have a strong interest in strict service level policies (Schweitzer and Cachon, 2000). These policies are particularly needed for supply chains operating in highly competitive, military (Kress, 2002) or humanitarian (Boin et al., 2010; Campbell and Jones, 2011; Rawls and Turnquist, 2010; Lin et al., 2012) environments, those dealing with a few large and dominant customers (Lejeune and Ruszczyński, 2007), those selling high-profit products (Schweitzer and Cachon, 2000), or those in which a shortage would trigger huge costs to set up the production process all over again (Dauzère-Pérès et al., 2007). The International Journal of Production Economics has recently devoted a special issue (Doerner et al., 2011) to extreme supply chains in which high reliability levels and the control of the service level performance over a medium-term planning horizon (see also Van Landeghem and Vanmaele, 2002) are indispensable. This study is motivated by such needs and examines the enforcement of stockout-related multiperiod service level (MSL) policies.

We consider multiperiod planning horizons and define an MSL policy with respect to the probability, proportion or amount of shortage occurring across the entire planning horizon. An MSL policy provides a representative measure of the responsiveness of the supply chain across the planning horizon (Kress, 2002). As opposed to an MSL policy, a stagewise (i.e., one-period) service level (SSL) policy measures the probability, proportion or amount of stockout at any single period considered independently of the other periods, and is an expected value measure that reflects the steady-state nature of the supply chain. A high probability of not having a shortage in any single periods of the horizon does not necessarily imply the same high probability of not having a shortage across the whole horizon (Pyke and Cohen, 1993).

Service level policies can be modeled with chance (probabilistic) and conditional expectation constraints (Prékopa, 1995). Constraints representing ready rate and fill rate SSL policies take the form of individual (separate) chance constraints, for which a deterministic equivalent can be easily derived. By contrast, constraints enforcing ready rate MSL policies require the computation of multivariate probabilities, and take the form of joint chance constraints, for which it is more challenging to derive equivalent and tractable deterministic formulations ( Lejeune and Ruszczyński, 2007; Prékopa, 1995, 2003).

Beyond the distinction between multiperiod and stagewise, service level policies can be differentiated according to the nature of shortages they prevent. In this paper, we consider the ready rate service level which represents the probability of not having a stockout, and the fill rate and the conditional expected stockout service levels, which are related to the shortage quantities. A ready rate service level policy is favored when customer satisfaction is primarily driven by the occurrence or not of a stockout, while its magnitude is secondary (Kleijnen and Smits, 2003). A fill rate service level policy is enforced when the focus is on limiting the expected proportion of demand that cannot be satisfied with the available inventory (Kleijnen and Smits, 2003). The conditional expected stockout (Adenso-Diaz, 1996; Rose, 1972) represents the quantity of products that will be short in case of a stockout. It is particularly important to limit this value when it is necessary to order the amount of non-available product from a second source (Adenso-Diaz, 1996). The reader is referred to Hausman (2002), Kleijnen and Smits (2003), and Tempelmeier (2011) for a discussion on the suitability of the various kinds of service levels.

A key contribution of this study is that it provides decision makers with a modeling approach enabling them to implement stockout-related MSL policies. An important feature of the approach is its wide applicability. First, it can be applied to the various types (ready rate, fill rate, conditional expected stockout) of MSLs. Second, it is not affected by restrictive (independence) assumptions about the random variables and can handle stationary as well as non-stationary (i.e., seasonal) random demand. Third, it allows for a fine characterization of uncertainty. Indeed, even if the uncertainty is represented with extremely many scenarios, our modeling approach provides formulations that can be solved with off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Fourth, it can be used to enforce various managerial policies (fairness, differentiated service level, etc.).

We formulate new stochastic models for the construction of replenishment plans accounting for the requirements of three types of MSL policies. The models are multi-functional and define the optimal production/acquisition, distribution, and inventory decisions. Next, we propose a reformulation method that can be applied to the stochastic optimization problems associated with each MSL policy. The reformulated problems are deterministic and equivalent to the original stochastic planning problems. While the stochastic formulations could not be handled by optimization solvers in their original form, the reformulated problems can be efficiently solved with standard mathematical programming algorithms. The method rests on the concepts of service level sufficient trajectories which represent a set of sufficient conditions that must be satisfied in order to attain the prescribed MSL policy threshold. In addition to providing a new reformulation for the event-oriented ready rate MSL policy (Lejeune and Ruszczyński, 2007), we also develop a stochastic programming planning approach, formulate service level constraints, and define service level sufficient trajectories for the fill rate and conditional expected stockout MSLs.

In the brief outline of the literature presented here, we point out models which explicitly account for the uncertainty in production–distribution systems. Cardós et al. (2006) calculate the attained cycle service level in an (R,
                     S) periodic review inventory system when the demand is discretely distributed. Lejeune and Ruszczyński (2007) use the p-efficiency concept (Prékopa, 1995; Dentcheva et al., 2000) to design column generation and preprocessing algorithms allowing for the construction of inventory-production plans in which the multiperiod probability of a stockout is upper-bounded (see also Lejeune, 2008). Paschalidis et al. (2004) derive a base-stock production policy for a multistage supply chain that faces a stochastic demand and whose one-period probability of stockout must be below a prescribed level. Additionally, Chen and Vairaktarakis (2005) develop a production–distribution model in which the goods are directly delivered from the producer to the end-customer. A service level policy based on the time at which the products are supplied to the customers is used. Tempelmeier (2007) studies the uncapacitated single-item dynamic lot-sizing problem. Models that minimize the setup and holding costs and that include a service level constraint are presented. Kutanoglu and Lohiya (2008) develop an integrated base-stock inventory-transportation model for a single-echelon, multi-facility service parts logistics system with time-based service level constraints. Nagar and Jain (2008) use multistage stochastic programming for modeling the launching of new products with uncertain demand. The model allows for the adjustment of the production as uncertainties are resolved. The derivation of the optimal safety stock levels needed to achieve predefined fill rate service levels in multistage networks confronted with uncertain demands is studied by Boulaksil et al. (2009). Simulation is employed to solve the planning problem on a rolling horizon basis. We refer the reader to Chen (2010) for a detailed review of production–distribution models, and to Geunes and Pardalos (2003), Mula et al. (2006), Shen (2007), and the references therein for such models in a stochastic context. Tang (2006) presents the main types of supply chain risk and review the practices and quantitative models enabling to cope with them. Stochastic programming models for supply chain management are proposed by Dormer et al. (2005), while an overview of the formulation of stochastic constraints is given by Prékopa (1995, 2003).

Another key contribution of this study stems from the practical insights derived from the application of our approach to a real disaster management problem. The widespread impact of disasters highlights the need to develop planning models and methods allowing for an appropriate response (Rottkemper et al., 2011). Noting the difficulty to develop accurate demand forecasts due to the lack or inconsistent collection of historical data, and the multiple unknowns that humanitarian logisticians have to deal with, Ergun et al. (2011) advocate the development of stochastic planning models accounting for the many sources of uncertainty. Further, Snyder (2006) and Campbell and Jones (2011) insist about the importance to account for a wide range of possible situations and to consider a large number of scenarios in the disaster management and humanitarian relief contexts. The proposed models take an explicit consideration of the randomness of the demand for relief commodities, and can be conveniently used to implement disaster pre-positioning and response policies that satisfy strict service level requirements. Moreover, our model provides formulations that can be solved very efficiently regardless of the number of scenarios used to represent uncertainty. We illustrate the impact and adequacy of MSL versus SSL policies, and how priority levels per commodity, as well as fairness and response time policies, can be effortlessly integrated with the proposed approach. We refer the reader to the special issues of the International Journal of Production Economics (Volume 126, Issue 1, 2010) and OR Spectrum (Volume 33, Issue 3, 2011) providing for a thorough review of the disaster management literature, and to Altay and Green (2006) and Van Wassenhove and Pedraza Martinez (2012) for a detailed discussion of the contribution of OR techniques to the disaster management field.

In Section 3 of this paper, we define the general formulation of the stochastic replenishment model that enforces an MSL policy. In Section 4, we elaborate on the modeling approach and derive the new stochastic planning models and their deterministic reformulation. Section 5 analyzes the application of the approach to a disaster management supply chain problem. Section 6 offers concluding remarks.

We develop a replenishment planning model for integrated inventory, production/acquisition, and distribution decision making in a multistage (e.g., suppliers, manufacturers, distributors) supply chain. The supply chain faces a stochastic demand for its products which the distributors deliver to the end-customers. The supply chain managers do not want to carry stocks enabling the satisfaction of the highest possible estimated demand. Instead, the objective is to enforce a very strict MSL stockout-oriented policy, which allows the supply chain to trade some safety level for lower costs.

                      means that the cumulative supply must satisfy the cumulative demand in a way that allows the attainment of the MSL policy threshold p. The model (1)–(4) does not attempt to quantify the cost of losing customers for not satisfying their demand, but instead imposes, through the use of service level constraints (3), the minimization of the costs (1) subject to the attainment of an MSL policy, thus effectively limiting the risk of a loss of customers. We deliberately keep the discussion of the objective function, constraints, and decision variables very general in this section. Indeed, our first endeavor (Section 4) concerns the modeling of the service level constraint (3) which takes a very different form depending on the type (ready rate, fill rate, conditional expected stockout) of MSL. Next, in Section 5, we study a humanitarian network and provide a specific formulation for 1, 2, and 4.

We develop a modeling method to construct integrated replenishment plans that satisfy the conditions imposed by stockout-related MSL policies. The method can be applied in the same fashion to the ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout MSLs, and provides a deterministic formulation equivalent to the stochastic problem (1)–(4).

The proof is straightforward from Definition 1 and the definition of the service level constraint (3).

The next question to settle relates to the quantities defining service level trajectories. For each MSL, we first define the corresponding stochastic service level constraint and the conditions for a service level trajectory to be sufficient (Definitions 2–4), and then we formulate optimization problems whose optimal solution defines the optimal service level sufficient trajectory and replenishment plan.

In this section, we consider the fill rate and the conditional expected stockout MSLs. These are quantity-oriented performance measures that respectively concern the proportion and quantity of demand that can be satisfied with the available inventory.

The fill rate service level measures the expected fraction of demand that can be met without delay from on-hand inventory (Kleijnen and Smits, 2003; Tempelmeier, 2011; Teunter et al., 2010). Denoting by [a]+ the maximum of a and 0, the expected shortfall at j in period t is

The above inequality (7) shows how the fill rate MSL considers jointly all periods in the horizon. For each realization ω
                           
                              l
                           , the left side of (7) takes into consideration the maximum (over T) proportion of stockout that arises in any period t and multiplies it by the probability of ω
                           
                              l
                           . Many trajectories fulfill the conditions defined by (7). We shall now identify (through the solution of problem DFR) the optimal fill rate sufficient trajectory defining the least expensive conditions that satisfy the requirements of the fill rate MSL policy.

An alternative could be to impose an upper bound (1−
                           p′[j]) on the percentage of the total (i.e., up to ∣T∣) unsatisfied demand. This can be done by substituting

The conditional expected stockout service level concerns the expected quantity of missing products in case of a stockout (Adenso-Diaz, 1996). A conditional expected stockout MSL policy with threshold p″ upper-bounds the conditional expected amount of stockout that can occur across the planning horizon, and is modeled with conditional expectation constraints (Prékopa, 1995).

We define the upper bound

In this section, we consider the ready rate, also called non-stockout, MSL. This is an event-oriented performance criterion that represents the probability of not having a shortage at any point during the planning horizon. The enforcement of a ready rate MSL policy is modeled with joint probabilistic constraints ensuring that the probability of the joint fulfillment of a system of linear inequalities is above a prescribed probability level p representing the ready rate MSL policy threshold. We formulate one joint probabilistic constraint for each distributor j:

                        Lejeune and Ruszczyński (2007) have proposed a reformulation for (24) based on the concept of p-efficiency (Prékopa, 1995; Lejeune and Noyan, 2010) and have designed a column generation-based solution method. In this paper, we use a Boolean programming method (Lejeune, 2012a) to derive a new deterministic equivalent formulation for the ready rate MSL problem. The so-reformulated ready rate MSL problem can be solved very efficiently, without the need to use a specialized algorithm. The Boolean method can handle extremely large number of realizations for the random variables and is applicable to multivariate discrete probability distribution when the components of the random vector are linked through diverse dependency relationships. While the Boolean modeling method is used by Lejeune (2012a) for random variables represented by a set of scenarios, the method is here employed for random variables described by a general discrete probability distribution. We refer the reader to Lejeune (2012a) for a detailed description of the Boolean reformulation framework and its properties.

It is important to note that the additional number of binary variables (31) in DRR due to the reformulation of the stochastic constraint is equal to the number of cut points involved in the binarization process and does not depend on the number of realizations that the random variables can take. This is the key ingredient that allows the easy and fast solution of the DRR formulation even for granular representations of uncertainty.

In this section, we use a real-life problem to illustrate the applicability of the proposed MSL approach and derive practical insights. The problem involves the opening of emergency operations centers (EOC), and the acquisition, pre-positioning, and post-earthquake delivery of critical commodities. The problems are modeled with the AMPL algebraic programming language and solved with the CPLEX 12.4 solver on a 64-bit Dell Precision T5400 Workstation with Quad Core Xeon Processor X5460 3.16gigahertz CPU.

We consider a supply chain delivering relief commodities to the Los Angeles County area (a 4086.9square miles area with about 9.5 million residents) hit on January 17, 1994 by a 6.7-magnitude earthquake. The commodities are water, food and medicines which are generally regarded as the most critical supplies for daily living (Lin et al., 2009; Rawls and Turnquist, 2010) and need to be delivered immediately after the earthquake and during the post-earthquake recovery period. Commodities are typically transported from a central depot called emergency operation center (EOC) to distribution centers located around the affected areas and then distributed to individuals (Lin et al., 2009; Mete and Zabinsky, 2010). The Los Angeles County (see Lin et al., 2009) has ten distribution centers in Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Burbank, Santa Clarita, Palmdale, Duarte, Paramount, San Fernando, Pasadena, and Culver City, and an EOC can be opened at the last three of these locations. The demand for commodities is stochastic. We refer the reader to Lin et al. (2009, 2012) for a detailed description of the features of the Los Angeles County network. Table 1
                         defines the notations used in the formulation of the MSL planning problem for the Los Angeles County network.

                        The objective function (32) is the sum of the holding and acquisition costs of commodities at EOCs, the transportation costs between EOCs and distribution centers, and the set-up costs induced by the opening of EOCs. The flow conservation is ensured by constraints (33). We assume that the initial inventory levels f[i,
                        c,0] are fixed. Constraints (34) ensure that the flow between i and j does not exceed the capacity of the arc connecting them. Note that we only consider direct shipments between EOCs and distribution centers. The route between any two locations is based on detoured partial segments (defined in a government report (DeBlasio et al., 2002)) in case the earthquake has destroyed or damaged (part of) the shortest route. We use the conversion factors O[c] to express the volume of each commodity c in the unit used to describe the arc capacity A[i,
                        j] and the storage capacity Q[i]. In (35), the inventory levels are limited from above by the maximal storage capacity. Constraints (36) force β[i] to take value 1 if any of the commodities are acquired by EOC i at any time in the horizon and thus determine which EOCs are opened. Constraints (38) and (39) define the binary character and the non-negativity of the corresponding decision variables. Inequality (37) represents the requirements of the MSL policy. Since there are ten distribution centers and three commodities, we have thirty stochastic service level constraints.

                        Previous efforts to predict the occurrence of an earthquake have shown the difficulty of the task and the need to account for uncertainty. The US Geological Service (USGS) has developed an earthquake prediction for Parkfield, Calfornia, where six earthquakes of magnitude six occurred between 1857 and 1966 (Lindh and Lim, 1995; Roeloffs and Langbein, 1994; Wiemer, 2011). Although USGS predicted that the next earthquake would occur in 1988, it has not happened yet. The only successful earthquake prediction was for the 1975 Haicheng earthquake of magnitude 7.3, for which an evacuation warning was issued the previous day (Wiemer, 2011). In line with these observations, the interdisciplinary group of scientists studying California’s earthquakes provides forecasts in the form of probabilities (Field et al., 2008). In this paper, we model the demand for a commodity over the one-week recovery horizon as a multivariate random variable with discrete probability distribution. We assume that the demand is an increasing function of the magnitude of an earthquake, since the magnitude of an earthquake, defined as the “measure of the energy released in the quake” (Field et al., 2008), is typically considered to have a direct effect on the severity of the disaster and the resulting demand for commodities. The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) identifies seven “magnitude bins” (see Table 2
                        ) for earthquakes (National Earthquake Information Center, 2011). Associating one demand level to each magnitude bin, the random demand can take seven different values at each period.

To refine the probability distribution for the Los Angeles county area, we use the data provided by Field, Milner and the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (see Table 3
                        ). They report that the annual probability of a magnitude 7.5 or greater earthquake in California is about 2%. Over a 30-year period (column 2 in Table 3), California has a 99.7% (resp., 46%) chance to be hit by a magnitude 6.7 (resp., 7.5) or larger earthquake. For the Los Angeles region, the probability of a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake is 67%. Further, the probability of such a powerful quake appears larger in Southern California (i.e., which includes the Los Angeles area) than in Northern California (37% versus 15% chance in 30years).


                        Fig. 1
                         shows that the Southern San Andreas fault is the one with the highest probability of a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake within the next thirty years. The same probability for the Elsinore (resp., San Jacinto and Garlock) faults is 11% (resp., 31% and 6%). In addition to the probabilities, we develop an estimate of the demand level corresponding to each earthquake magnitude and use the data provided by Lin et al. (2009). They employ the HAZUS simulation software and historical data from the 6.7-magnitude Northridge earthquake to generate, for each network node, the daily demand level for each commodity and over a weekly recovery horizon. We use these estimates for the demand level corresponding to a strong (6–6.9) earthquake (i.e., such as the Northridge one) and infer the six other demand levels by assuming that they are proportional to the magnitude of the network.

In this section, we conduct a series of analyses on the above-described problem and provide managerial insights. Those insights pertain to (i) the type of service level policies adequate for multiperiod planning horizons; (ii) the cost impact of SSL and MSL policies; (iii) the supply requirements of the fill rate, ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSL policies; (iv) the computational tractability of the derived models; and (v) the incorporation of fairness, response time, and priority levels within the MSL policies.

In this section, we investigate the suitability of three formulation approaches for the enforcement of a ready rate service level policy across a multiperiod planning horizon. We consider the probability of having a stockout and the resulting MSL obtained with:

The first question concerns the suitability of these approaches to implement a ready rate policy across a multiperiod horizon during which the demand is uncertain. First, we build the best plan obtained with the IPC, JPC, and EXP models when the policy thresholds are equal to 0.9, 0.925, 0.95, and 0.975. Second, we proceed to a simulation study, generate 100 demand scenarios and calculate for how many of these a shortage occurs with the best plan for each model. This provides us with an estimate of the horizon-wide stockout probability and the ready rate MSL obtained with the JPC, IPC, and EXP models. Fig. 2
                            displays the results for the medication commodity. The acronym NS refers to the number of demand scenarios under which the supply chain experiences at least one stockout when the best plan is employed. The acronyms on the horizontal axis are the first three letters of the distribution centers.

With the optimal plan for the EXP model, the supply chain experiences a stockout in at least 43% (in Pasadena) and at most 66% (in Calabasas) of the demand scenarios. The ready rate MSL obtained with the EXP model ranges from 0.34 in Calabasas to 0.57 in Pasadena. Evidently, the solution of the EXP model does not allow the enforcement of a strict MSL policy and cannot be used in practice.

The top left-side graph in Fig. 2 displays the number of scenarios in which there is a shortage with the optimal JPC and IPC plans obtained when p[j,
                           c]=
                           p[j,
                           c,
                           t]=0.975, j
                           ∈
                           J, c
                           ∈
                           C, t
                           ∈
                           T. The ready rate MSL obtained with the JPC model ranges from 0.98 and 1, while the one obtained with the IPC model ranges from 0.82 (in Calabasas and Paramount) to 0.90 in Pasadena. The IPC approach guarantees that, in each individual period, the probability of negative inventory level is below 2.5%. Yet, the probability of a stockout at least once in the planning horizon varies between 10% and 18%. Similarly, if the targeted MSL policy threshold is 90%, the ready rate MSL obtained with the IPC model varies from 63% to 77%. This confirms (see also Henrion, 2004) the inadequacy of SSL policies if one seeks to have a small probability of stockout over the entire planning horizon. The plan based on the JPC model is the only one that satisfies the requirements of a ready rate MSL policy. These conclusions are supported by the results obtained for the rest of the policy thresholds (see Fig. 2 when p[j,
                           c]=
                           p[j,
                           c,
                           t]=0.95, 0.925, 0.9).

The next question pertains to the impact of the granularity of the planning horizon on the obtained MSL. More precisely, we analyze how the MSL generated by the IPC model depends on the periodicity of the demand and the number of periods in the horizon. For the daily demand, and the decomposition of the one-week planning horizon into seven periods, the above results confirm that the IPC model enforcing an SSL policy provides a very loose relaxation and is not appropriate for an MSL policy. Besides the daily demand, we shall now consider the half-day and two-day demand for commodities over the one-week recovery period and consequently subdivide the one-week horizon into fourteen and four periods. The results are displayed in Fig. 3
                            and confirm that the IPC model enforces much weaker requirements than those needed for a ready rate MSL policy. The ready rate MSL obtained with the IPC model is systematically smaller than the targeted ready rate MSL. The discrepancy between those two (i.e., obtained and targeted) MSLs widens as the number ∣T∣ of periods in the horizon increases. As ∣T∣ grows larger, the inadequacy of the IPC model to enforce a ready rate MSL policy becomes more pronounced.

We shall now proceed to a twofold analysis of the impact of using the JPC formulation on the costs. First, we compare the costs incurred with the best JPC-based and IPC-based plans. We consider a series of values α and set the MSL and SSL thresholds equal to α: p[j,
                           c]=
                           p[j,
                           c,
                           t]=
                           α, j
                           ∈
                           J, c
                           ∈
                           C, t
                           ∈
                           T.

Let V
                           
                              C,α
                            (resp., V
                           
                              S,α
                           ) be the costs incurred with the best JPC-based (resp., IPC-based) plan when p[j,
                           c]=
                           α, ∀j, c (resp., p[j,
                           c,
                           t]=
                           α, ∀j, c, t). The cost ratio R

                           V

                           /V
                           
                              S,α
                            represents the relative additional cost of an MSL policy over an SSL one for the threshold value α. Fig. 4
                            displays the value of R as a function of the value assigned to α (daily commodity demand), and illustrates the trade-off between cost and reliability over the multiperiod horizon. The left-most bar in Fig. 4 (α
                           =0.975) illustrates that the MSL policy obtained with the JPC model is 12.5% more expensive than that of the SSL policy determined by the IPC model. The trade-off is that the probability of a stockout across the horizon is 2.5% with the JPC model, while this probability is equal to 18% with the IPC model (which formally requires that the probability of a stockout at each individual period be below 2.5%). For α
                           =0.9, the additional costs incurred with to the JPC plan are 5% higher than those incurred with the IPC plan, but permit to increase the cross-wide probability of not having a stockout by 27% (i.e., 90% for MSL versus 63% for SSL). This shows that the probability of having a stockout at any point during the recovery period can be significantly reduced by using the proper IPC formulation, without creating a significant cost increase. Recall that the horizon-wide probabilities of not having a stockout when using the JPC model are displayed in Fig. 2.

Next, we examine the costs incurred with the JPC and IPC models when the same MSL policy threshold α is attained. Observe first (Fig. 3) that enforcing the IPC-based plan with SSL threshold p[j,
                           c,
                           t] leads to an MSL policy with MSL threshold α
                           <
                           p[j,
                           c,
                           t]. Consider the weekly demand for medication. Fig. 3 shows that the IPC model permits to obtain an MSL threshold α
                           =0.82 (resp., 0.77, 0.69, 0.63) by setting p[j,
                           c,
                           t]=0.975 (resp., 0.95, 0.925, 0.9), t
                           ∈
                           T, j
                           ∈
                           J in (43). Second, as explained above, the IPC problem can be easily reformulated as a deterministic problem that is much easier to solve than the JPC model enforcing an MSL policy. Thus, if the targeted MSL threshold is α, an approximative approach could consist in solving the JPC-based model with an SSL threshold p[j,
                           c,
                           t]≫
                           α.

We build the optimal JPC plans when the MSL threshold α is set to 0.82, 0.77, 0.69, and 0.63, and compute the ratio R′ of the costs of the IPC-based model to these of the JPC-based model when the same MSL threshold is attained. Fig. 5
                            shows that the ad hoc procedure is not cost effective and triggers excessive costs. To illustrate this, observe the left-most bar in Fig. 5. While both the IPC and JPC plans allows to reach an MSL policy with identical threshold equal 0.82, the plan based on the IPC model is 21% more expensive than the plan based on the JPC model. Similar observations prevail for the other threshold values. The results show the cost benefits of using the appropriate formulation (40) to deploy an MSL policy.

We shall now assess the requirements imposed by the ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout service levels. In order to do so, we calculate:

Ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSL policies are more demanding than fill rate MSL policies. Observe, for instance, that a ready rate MSL policy with threshold p
                           =95% guarantees a fill rate MSL

                                             ′

                            higher than 99.7%, while a fill rate MSL policy with p′=95% ensures a low, ranging between [34.9%, 58.8%], ready rate MSL policy. Similarly, a conditional expected stockout MSL policy with threshold p″=90% results in a fill rate MSL policy at least equal to 99.7%. For all considered problem instances, the requirements triggered by the fill rate MSL with policy threshold p′ are weaker than those of the ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSLs with identical policy threshold (p
                           =
                           p′=
                           p″) and are thus redundant.

The proposed modeling framework permits to account for dependencies among random variables, which is a very realistic and desirable feature as underlined by Mete and Zabinsky (2010) and Snyder (2006), and to use a fine representation of the random variables, which is also recommended by Snyder (2006) and Campbell and Jones (2011). We shall now analyze the computational tractability of the reformulated problems. Table 5
                            reports the computational times (in CPU seconds) needed to solve the ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout MSL problem for four values of the MSL policy threshold.


                           Table 5 shows the contribution of our reformulation approach for computational and applicability purposes. The stochastic optimization (see Section 4) planning problems derived for each MSL could not be solved by any optimization solver in their original form. However, the entries in Table 5 show that the equivalent and deterministic reformulated problems could all be solved to optimality in less than 3seconds with the default settings of the Cplex 12.4 solver. This is particularly remarkable for the ready rate MSL reformulated problem, as the solution of previous reformulations for this problem required the development of a specialized algorithm.

Note also that the modeling framework permits the construction of a plan that simultaneously enforces event-oriented (ready rate) and quantity-oriented (fill rate and conditional expected stockout) MSL policies. The model formulated below can be used to define a plan meeting the requirements of the ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSLs

We solve four instances of problem (44) for the humanitarian supply chain network, in which the ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSL thresholds are successively set to p
                           =
                           p″=0.9, 0.925, 0.95, and 0.975. The computational times to solve these instances are about the same (resp., 2.7, 1.6, 1.2, and 1.2seconds) as those reported in Table 5 for the ready rate MSL. This shows that the model ensuring the joint enforcement of these two MSL polices is computationally tractable. The requirements triggered by the fill rate MSL policy are redundant to those imposed by the ready rate and conditional expected stockout MSLs. These results support those presented in Section 5.2.3.

The modeling framework can be efficiently and conveniently used to implement a fair policy across the network. We shall propose three approaches to instilling fairness in the disaster response plan. The approaches can be used concomitantly.

Recall that each of the proposed MSL models incorporates one stochastic service level constraint for each demand node and commodity. This feature is very important, since it allows the introduction of priority or urgency levels per commodity and/or per demand node. We shall first define fairness as the provision of the same service across the network and accordingly assign the same priority level to each demand node. This is accomplished by setting the MSL threshold p[j,
                           c] to the same value for each demand node j: p[1,
                           c]=
                           p[2,
                           c]=⋯=
                           p[∣J∣,
                           c], c
                           ∈
                           C.

Note that it can be suitable to impose a different MSL threshold per type of commodity c. Arboleda et al. (2009) and Lin et al. (2009) underline the importance of commodity-related priority levels and assign the highest priority to medication, followed by water and food. Lin et al. (2009) represent the priority of the commodity as a decreasing function of the time window within which its demand must be satisfied (e.g., one, two, and three days for medication, water and food, respectively). We can easily introduce distinct priority levels for each commodity. Denoting by c (resp., c′, c″) the most (resp., second most, least) important commodity, the commodity prioritization feature implies that: p[j,
                           c]>
                           p[j,
                           c′]>
                           p[j,
                           c″], j
                           ∈
                           J. Here, the priority level associated with the supply of a commodity c to a demand node j is an increasing function of the MSL policy threshold p[j,
                           c] enforced for c at j. Note that commercial supply chains can be willing to provide a differentiated customer service level to each customer or category of customers (Teunter et al., 2010). This can be easily done by imposing a different MSL threshold p[j,
                           c] per customer j.

Our second fairness approach is based on the response time of the supply chain. It is a function of the time required to provide the supplies needed by the demand nodes, and takes into account the geographical locations of the demand nodes and EOCs as well as their impact on the supply system. Lin et al. (2009) model fairness by imposing the same delivery time window for a commodity c for each distribution center. Observe that all the replenishment plans constructed so far involve the opening of one single EOC at San Fernando. Assuming that the delivery time is an increasing function of the distance separating an EOC and a demand node, the demand nodes (e.g., Santa Clarita, Burbank) located close to San Fernando benefit from a much faster response time than those located farther (e.g., Paramount).

The location of the opened EOCs will now be investigated with the objective to provide a homogeneous and timely response across the network. This can be achieved by introducing a form of covering constraints, which consider a demand to be satisfactorily met if it originates from a place located within an acceptable distance or traveling time from an open EOC (Murali et al., 2009). We propose two forms of covering constraints to implement a fair response time policy across the network.

The first type of covering constraints requires a minimal proportion λ
                           
                              j
                            of the supplies delivered to each node j to come from a local EOC (i.e., EOC located within distance of at most d from j), thus ensuring that the supplies are delivered fast. Let I be the set of EOCs and I
                           
                              j
                           , j
                           ∈

                           % of the total amount of supplies delivered to j at each time t. To ensure an equitable response to each node j, we consider the same acceptable distance d and assign the same value to λ
                           
                              j
                            for each j. We introduce the covering constraints (45) in the problems enforcing ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout MSLs, and evaluate the impact of these constraints on the response time. Note that a response time constraint cannot be enforced for the Palmdale node which is separated from its closest EOC (San Fernando) by more than 42miles. Since the specified maximal allowable distance d is set to a pretty small value (i.e., 30miles), the optimal plans for each MSL require the opening of two EOCs, one in San Fernando and one in Pasadena. The increase in the total costs (from 4.2% to 12%, depending on the MSL policy and threshold) is mainly due to the set-up costs for the opening of the second EOC at Pasadena. The opening of a second EOC permits to reduce the response time for the distribution centers located in Pasadena, Burbank, Culver City, Duarte, and Paramount. Fig. 6
                            shows the proportion by which the response time has decreased. For example, the response time for Duarte is 62.16% lower than before.

Alternatively, we can formulate the response time constraints in such a way that a minimal proportion γ
                           
                              j

As above, we introduce the constraints (46) in the problems allowing the enforcement of ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout MSLs, and evaluate the impact of the constraints (46) on the response time. This formulation of the coverage constraints can be applied to all distribution centers (including Palmdale). Three EOCs are now open in Culver City, San Fernando, and Pasadena. The cost increase (with respect to the solution without any covering constraint) ranges from 7.4% to 14.2% (depending on the MSL policy and threshold). The reponse time for the distribution centers located in Culver City, Pasadena, Burbank, Duarte, and Paramount decreases (when compared to those without any covering constraint) in the proportions shown in Fig. 7

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Demand shortage results in customer dissatisfaction and loss of goodwill, and is a key performance driver for supply chains. In this paper, we consider supply chains operating in uncertain environments and whose goal is to construct an integrated replenishment plan that satisfies the requirements of stockout-related MSL policies. MSLs are increasingly needed by companies with stockout-averse preferences.

We use a discrete-time stochastic programming framework to derive new integrated planning models enforcing ready rate, fill rate, and conditional expected stockout MSL policies. We develop a reformulation method that can be uniformly applied to each type of MSL policies. The method provides deterministic formulations which are equivalent to the original stochastic ones and rests on the concept of service level sufficient trajectory. The proposed models constitute a valuable cross-functional and cross-entity decision support tool to increase the overall reliability throughout the supply chain, and have an extended applicability. First, the modeling approach is not restricted by any independence assumptions between random variables, and can be applied for time-dependent, stationary, or non-stationary (i.e., seasonal) demands. Second, the method is flexible enough to allow the incorporation of various managerial objectives, which can range from the implementation of a fair service policy (a crucial principle in humanitarian supply chains), the introduction of priority levels per type of products or commodities, the differentiation of the service level provided to (categories of) customers, to the adoption of a homogeneous and timely response policy. Third, the method can be seamlessly used to simultaneously enforce several types of MSL policies limiting both the probability and the magnitude of a stockout across the planning horizon. Fourth, the modeling approach provides formulations that can be solved very fast with off-the-shelf solvers regardless of the number of scenarios used to represent uncertainty and that do not require the development of specialized algorithms. This is particularly valuable for planning models implementing a ready rate MSL policy and including joint probabilistic constraints.

We apply the proposed method on a real-life humanitarian supply chain problem based on the 1994 Northridge earthquake and derive practical insights. Pre-positioning and response plans involving the acquisition, storage and transportation of relief commodities are designed so that the stockout rate for commodities during the post-earthquake recovery period are below the threshold prescribed by ready rate, fill rate and conditional expected stockout MSL policies. The study shows that the expected value-based replenishment plan has very limited applicability and confirms that SSL policies are inadequate for implementing strict, horizon-wide service level performance metrics. SSL policies guarantee that the occurrence of a stockout at each individual period is low. However, the probability of at least one stockout happening across the whole planning horizon is not limited – it can be very high, and increases as the number of periods in the planning horizon becomes larger. We also observe that, among the three types of MSL policies, the fill rate MSL policy is the least constraining. Further research endeavors will concern the construction of integrated plans enforcing an MSL when the uncertainty originates from sources other than the demand (e.g., transportation times, arc capacities).
