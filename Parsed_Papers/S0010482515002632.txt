                  A large percentage of dermatologist׳s decision in psoriasis disease assessment is based on color. The current computer-aided diagnosis systems for psoriasis risk stratification and classification lack the vigor of color paradigm. The paper presents an automated psoriasis computer-aided diagnosis (pCAD) system for classification of psoriasis skin images into psoriatic lesion and healthy skin, which solves the two major challenges: (i) fulfills the color feature requirements and (ii) selects the powerful dominant color features while retaining high classification accuracy.
                  Fourteen color spaces are discovered for psoriasis disease analysis leading to 86 color features. The pCAD system is implemented in a support vector-based machine learning framework where the offline image data set is used for computing machine learning offline color machine learning parameters. These are then used for transformation of the online color features to predict the class labels for healthy vs. diseased cases. The above paradigm uses principal component analysis for color feature selection of dominant features, keeping the original color feature unaltered. Using the cross-validation protocol, the above machine learning protocol is compared against the standalone grayscale features with 60 features and against the combined grayscale and color feature set of 146.
                  Using a fixed data size of 540 images with equal number of healthy and diseased, 10 fold cross-validation protocol, and SVM of polynomial kernel of type two, pCAD system shows an accuracy of 99.94% with sensitivity and specificity of 99.93% and 99.96%. Using a varying data size protocol, the mean classification accuracies for color, grayscale, and combined scenarios are: 92.85%, 93.83% and 93.99%, respectively. The reliability of the system in these three scenarios are: 94.42%, 97.39% and 96.00%, respectively. We conclude that pCAD system using color space alone is compatible to grayscale space or combined color and grayscale spaces. We validated our pCAD system against facial color databases and the results are consistent in accuracy and reliability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Psoriasis is a chronic and autoimmune disease with red and scaly plaques on skin [1]. Statistics show that psoriasis affects about 125 million people of the world population [2]. The influence of psoriasis differs depending on the geographical regions. The prevalence of psoriasis in Europe, USA, Malaysia and India is about 0.6–6.5% [3], 3.15% [3], 3% [4] and 1.02% [5], respectively. Psoriasis not only affects the skin, but also the quality of life [6]. This is due to physical appearance and evil eyes of other people. This results in an increased risk of suicidal attempts (about 30%) [7], making psoriasis an equally dangerous disease and at par with depression, heart disease and diabetes [8]. Thus, psoriasis has become a major concern to health care organizations and the society. Presently, there is no permanent cure for this disease but it can be controlled by prolonged and attentive treatment. The cause of psoriasis is still unidentified but most researchers agree that the prime reason for this disease is genetics [9]. There are various types of psoriasis namely plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. Among all, plaque is most commonly found in about 80% of the cases [10]. Thus, this study is focused on plaque type psoriasis.

Dermatologists generally follow visual inspection and sense of touch to predict the severity. Skilled training and experience is required to infer the disease stage and grade and then to prescribe medication to control this disease. This process is very subjective and brings unreliability to the process of decision making. The process is laborious and very time consuming and creates large volume of data sets with huge images hard to handle manually. Thus, the process is very inefficient. They prefer to look for color of the lesions, scales deposited on them and their area of coverage to understand the severity of the diseases. The color of lesion varies from light red to dark red (purplish). The light red indicates reduced scales and improved condition of the disease while dark red indicates large deposition of scales and severe condition. So, hypothetically, color of lesion is adapted as a criterion for classification of psoriasis disease. Our hypothesis is that there is a strong power in color information in psoriasis skin images. When psoriasis images are acquired, they are color images and there is no way to qualitatively tell and classify it because it is all visual. Thus, there is a clear need for an objective analysis combined with subjective analysis. A general review on psoriasis and its risk stratification using CAD system can be seen in our recent review [11].

Many researchers have proposed computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems for classification of the dermatology disease [12–14]. These CADx systems either use only grayscale features or combination of color and grayscale features for dermatological disease classification but never tried to understand the power of color features embedded in these colored dermatology images. This paper brings to the forefront the key aspects i.e., color features and psoriasis disease classification as their basis. But, before color features can be selected, the principal color space has to be identified. There are many different color spaces that have been defined in the literature, which may be beneficial in different applications. This paper brings a new paradigm of color spaces with extensive search from literature and then adapted in data mining paradigm for psoriasis disease classification to mimic the dermatologist. So, we explored 14 different color spaces which may be useful for psoriasis disease classification. Further, we investigate the power of color features against grayscale features independently and in a combined framework.

This study brings significant contribution in the field of dermatology by exploring 14 kinds of color spaces for risk assessment using machine learning paradigm. These color spaces namely are: RGB, normalized-RGB, YCbCr, HSV, HSI, CIE XYZ, CIE Lab, CIE Lch, CIE Luv, hunter-Lab, SCT, opponent, CMY and CMYK. Two statistics, i.e., mean and standard deviation is computed for each color space component. Overall, 86 color features are extracted using 14 color spaces. Furthermore, 60 grayscale features are extracted from eight different texture feature extraction techniques namely, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Intensity Histogram (IH), Invariant Moment (IM), Gray Level Difference Statistics (GLDS), Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM), Statistical Feature Matrix (SFM) and Fractal Dimension (FD).

We present an in-depth analysis of the power of color features and grayscale features independently for psoriasis disease classification in support vector machine framework. The reader will find the following new components in this paper: (i) design and exploration of 14 color spaces (86 features) applied standalone for psoriasis color skin disease classification; (ii) design and analysis of 60 grayscale features (derived using 8 grayscale feature extraction techniques) applied indendently for psoriasis color skin disease classification; (iii) ability to choose dominant features using PCA-based feature selection without altering their respective feature values; (iv) introducing the color feature power term which helps in understanding the power of the color spaces in machine learning paradigm, and finally; (v) introducing a reliability factor for CADx systems in enviornments when color and grayscale spaces are independent and combined.

Classification is performed for five different kernel functions i.e., linear kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel and polynomial kernel of order one, two and three, where kernel function of polynomial of order two showed the best results. The 10-fold cross-validation protocol is used in the support vector machine-based framework. The proposed system using color features alone shows the highest classification accuracy of 99.94% with sensitivity and specificity of 99.93% and 99.96% using a 10-fold cross-validation using polynomial kernel of order two. Using the color features alone, grayscale features alone and combined color and grayscale features, the sytem accuracy was: 92.85%, 93.83% and 93.99%, respectively. We measure the reliability of the system in these three frameworks yielding 94.42%, 97.39% and 96.00%, respectively. Our results show that the color features alone is as powerful as grayscale features for classificaion of psoriasis disease. Our pCAD results are consistent both in accuracy and reliability while changing the database from psoriasis to facial skin.

The preparation of database is done by mimiking dermatologists view of manually segregating the healthy skin (normal) and psoriatic lesion (abnormal skin) from the images of each patient. The normal and abnormal skin samples are cropped freehand to capture any shape through MATLAB. The images are zoomed to maximum extend to make sure that the border visibility is very clear. As the features calculated depends on the color and texture, so utmost care has been taken to crop lesions from available images. The cropping is done inner to the actual boundary to avoid false inclusion of background which may alter the features generated from the lesion. Thus 270 samples of normal skin and 270 samples of abnormal skin are acquired from the images of 30 patients. There are few samples which are fuzzy in nature i.e., considered as an abnormal sample but actually they belong to normal sample and vice-versa. First three rows of 
                     
                     Figs. 1 and 2 show the samples of normal and abnormal skin respectively and last row of Figs. 1 and 2 show the fuzzy normal and abnormal samples respectively. This database has been adapted previously on our earliear developments [15].

The data mining paradigm is adapted to explore the color feature power. The spirit of this machine learning framework and risk stratification comes from methods developed by Suri and his team [16–19]. This utilizes the machine learning paradigm in support vector machine framework. The machine learning is adapted to establish the generalization using training-based color image data set and a priori physician classified labels, which in turn is used for transforming the test color image data set to predict the unknown risk class. Even though, this model is used for understanding the color space power independently, it can still be extended for grayscale feature set independently, or in a combined way where best color space features and grayscale features can be used. Our extensive amalgamation of 86 color space features and 60 grayscale features utilizes the PCA-based feature selection criteria where the feature set values are unaltered ensuring the selected features are dominant while retaining the stability and reliability of the pCAD system. Our pCAD system uses machine learning paradigm shown in 
                     Fig. 3. It has two components as shown by the dotted line. The left side reflects the offline system since it uses the training image data while the right side reflects the online system since it uses the testing image data set. In the offline system, the input RGB image is converted into 13 different color spaces and then features are extracted from different color spaces including RGB color space. In the feature selection step, dominant features were selected using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted feature set and to select only unique and highly discriminating features without altering the true values of the features. The dominant feature set and the clinical ground truth are used as inputs to the offline classifier in order to determine the machine learning parameters. The dominant features generated in offline system are extracted from the test images. Subsequently, the machine learning parameters from the offline system and dominant features of test images are used to determine the class label of the test images.

Color and grayscale features are the two main feature categories for discriminating a psoriatic lesion and healthy skin. Grayscale texture features give information about a particular pattern in an image. Thus, it is a significant feature to distinguish psoriatic lesion and healthy skin. Texture features are extracted from grayscale image, thus RGB image is converted to grayscale image using weighted sum of R, G and B components [20]. Since there is a great variability between colors of psoriatic lesion and healthy skin, color features are considered. In total, our proposed system computes 86 color features and 60 grayscale features.

Since psoriasis images are color images, color features provide valuable information to discriminate psoriatic lesion and healthy skin. To extract the color features, an exhaustive color feature space consisting of 14 color spaces are considered namely: RGB, normalized-RGB, YCbCr, HSV, HSI, CIE XYZ, CIE Lab, CIE Lch, CIE Luv, hunter-Lab, SCT, opponent, CMY and CMYK. All of these color space are known in the literature [15,21–24]. Since the input images are in RGB color space, the mathematical formulations for conversion from RGB to remaining 13 color spaces are provided in Appendix B. Two statistics, i.e., mean and standard deviation is calculated for each of the color spaces. The mean value characterizes the average color and standard deviation represents the color variation corresponding to color component considered. Since each color space contains three color components except CMYK which has four color components, overall 86 color features ({13 color spaces×3 color components×2 statistics}+{1 color spaces×4 color components×2 statistics}) are extracted for each sample image.

Grayscale texture features provide the information about a particular pattern in an image. Thus, it is a significant feature to distinguish one pattern from another and quantify the texture present in a lesion. One of the most common texture analysis techniques is Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). We have extracted 18 features derived from GLCM [15,25]. Another prominent texture feature extraction technique is Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM). From the GLRLM a total of 11 features are extracted [15,25]. Other than these two well-known texture feature extraction techniques, there are many other techniques such as Intensity Histogram (IH) [25], Invariant Moment (IM) [25], Gray Level Difference Statistics (GLDS) [26], Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) [27], Statistical Feature Matrix (SFM) [28] and Fractal Dimension [15]. Overall 60 texture features are extracted from eight different texture feature extraction techniques. Readers may refer to [29] for comprehensive texture analysis.

Due to extensive color spaces and its number of features, there is a need for the data mining framework to be able to select the dominant features with changing the color feature values. This becomes even more important when we are using combined color and grayscale space leading to about 146 features. Optimized feature selection avoids the redundant and less dominant features and improves the efficiency and time consumption of machine learning algorithm. One such popular dimension reduction technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Individual application of PCA only gives reduction in dimensionality of feature space, so polling contribution based optimized feature selection method is used here [30]. Though PCA gives concise feature values, the goal here is to extract the indices of the dominant features; hence, we adapted a polling methodology [30]. The benefit of the polling method is that the original feature values are never lost in the process of dominant feature selection. The algorithm for feature selection is as follows:
                              
                                 
                                    Step 1: Calculate the average across each feature space dimension and subtract it from each value in the corresponding dimension.


                                    Step 2: Compute the covariance matrix of the data set.


                                    Step 3: Compute the eigenvectors (V) and eigenvalues (λ) of the covariance matrix.


                                    Step 4: Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and arrange the corresponding eigenvectors in the same order.


                                    Step 5: Choose the # of principal components (m) to be considered using condition:

The main aim of our experiments is to explore the ability of the color spaces and its features in classification of psoriasis disease. Further to compare and contrast the CAD׳s ability to perform in different scenarios under machine learning paradigm when color features and grayscale features are independently taken and when the features are combined. These experiments are all driven by PCA-based model where the power of PCA helps in identification of dominant features and retain them as more features are added gradually. Keeping the spirits of the above discussion in mind, we have devised three sets of experiments: The first experiment is to optimize the SVM kernel type in PCA-based feature selection paradigm while keeping the data size 
                        (
                        
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                        )
                      fixed. The experiment two is performed to compare and analyze the power of color, grayscale features independently, and in combined framework with fixed data size 
                        (
                        
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                        )
                     . The last and third experiment presents the effect of change in data size on the machine learning memorization vs. generalization concept for all three sets of spaces: color, grayscale and combined. The list of symbols has been provided in Appendix A for more clarity to readers.

The goal of this experiment it to understand the color space, grayscale space and combined space in PCA-paradigm while keeping the data size fixed to 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                         and optimize the SVM kernel type for best accuracy. Thus, we are interested in selection of the best SVM kernel function with changing PCA cutoff values, while allowing the addition of new features in color space. Here, 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        =540 images consist of equal number of psoriatic lesion and healthy patient images, i.e., 270. To select the best SVM kernel type, we have experimented five different conventional kernels i.e., linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial kernel of order one, two and three. The least square method is adopted here to find the separating hyper-plane. To generalize the SVM classification process, cross-validation strategy with k=10-fold method is adapted. Five performance parameters i.e., sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve i.e., AUC are computed. Finally, the best SVM kernel function is chosen on the basis of accuracy.

This experiment is focused on understanding how PCA-based model is able to identify the color features (86 features) compared to grayscale (60 features) and combined feature set (146 features). Thus, the role of this experiment is to carefully vary the PCA-cutoff gradually and see how the pCAD retains the color features when foreign features are added to the existing feature population. Further, we also exhibit how the number of dominant features grows with the gradual increase in the PCA-based cutoff. Finally, we have devised a formulation which helps us exhibit the power of the color feature (named as color feature power) in achieving the generalization process in machine learning paradigm. All the above is extendable to grayscale (60 features) and combined feature set (146 features) and hence we replicate this experiment set to these feature set and compare and contrast here.

The behavior of the pCAD system is influenced by (a) the number of subjects (data size) present in its training-based model and (b) cutoff values chosen during the data mining process. Thus, it is important to understand the pCAD׳s accuracy with increasing populations in terms of subjects and increase in cutoff values during the PCA-based selection. This experiment thus consists of 11 data sizes ranging from 
                           ℕ
                        =50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 to 540. Each data size consisted of equal number of diseased and normal patients. The pCAD system was designed to train and test using cross-validation protocol on all three feature spaces: color space, grayscale space and combined color and grayscale space.

This section includes the outcomes of above depicted three experiments and their correlation. In first experiment, we have analyzed the classification accuracy for two important factors i.e., PCA cutoffs and various SVM kernels. For the selected kernel, the performance parameters are calculated for considered 20 PCA cutoffs. In second experiment, accuracy and number of dominant features as a function of PCA cutoffs are shown for all three parts: color features alone, grayscale features alone and combined. This is also followed by calculation of feature power of color and grayscale features in independent and combined framework. This is termed as feature power. Lastly, in third experiment, the average accuracy and reliability index are calculated for all cutoffs at each data size for all three scenarios. This finally gives system accuracy and its reliability for all three scenarios.

Since the goal of this study was to explore the power of color features, this experiment is performed on color features framework only. Classification is performed for five different kernel functions and best kernel function is selected based on classification accuracy. Accuracy as a function of PCA-cutoffs are plotted for all the five kernel functions. Our observation shows that, the polynomial kernel of order two behaved uniformly over all the possible PCA-cutoffs as depicted in 
                        Fig. 4. As a result, we fixed our analysis on subsequent experiments using this polynomial kernel of order two. 
                        Table 1 shows all the performance on all the parameters of the pCAD classification. This includes: SE, SP, PPV, ACC and AUC for selected kernel function and for PCA-cutoffs ranging from 0.900 to 0.995. As seen in Table 1, PCA-cutoff of 0.985 shows the highest accuracy of 99.94%. This is shown by italic values in the table. 
                        Fig. 5 shows the ROC curve at PCA-cutoff of 0.985 for K=10 (number of partitions), 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        =540 and T=20 (number of trials) using polynomial kernel of order two while taking color space alone into consideration. As can be seen, AUC=0.999. Further, the mean and standard deviation of accuracies for T=20 trials as a function of PCA-based cutoff for color features has been shown in 
                        Fig. 6 for K=10 and 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        =540 using kernel function of polynomial order two. It has been noticed that the maximum standard deviation is 1.05 and average is 0.5 for all cutoffs which shows that there is not much change in accuracy when we repeat the protocol for T=20 trials.

Here, we show how the PCA-cutoff affects the accuracy of the pCAD classification system in color space set-up. Since our hypothesis states that as the PCA-cutoff increases gradually the number of color features increases while retaining the best or dominant color features. This effect can be noticed by increase in the classification accuracy with an increase of the PCA-cutoff. We exactly demonstrated this effect in 
                        Fig. 7(a). To show its stability, we also provide how the relationship between the dominant features and the PCA-based cutoff increased. This can be seen in Fig. 7(b), which shows the number of dominant features vs. PCA-based cutoff for K=10,

It can be observed from Fig. 7(a) and (b) that for an equivalent accuracy between color space and grayscale or combined spaces at a particular cutoff, the number of dominant color features are nearly half the number of grayscale or combined features. This clearly shows the power of the color feature space while achieving the generalization of the machine learning pCAD-based system. We took a step further to express the color power for the color feature space and is analytically given as

In this experiment, we have presented the effect of varying data size in order to identify the memorization vs. generalization abilities of the pCAD system. Our experiment took 11 data sizes ranging from 50 patients to 540 patients i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 and 540. For each data size selected, classification accuracy is then calculated for 20 cutoffs ranging from 0.900 to 0.995 with an interval of 0.005. 
                        Table 2 shows classification accuracy for color features alone. Similarly, these observations have also been recorded for other two scenarios; grayscale feature alone and combined color and grayscale features. The average accuracy value for all cutoffs at each data size is calculated for all three scenarios as shown in

                        Fig. 9. These curves clearly demonstrate that as the population size increases, the accuracy increases and further reach point of diminishing returns which further proves our hypothesis.

Further, the system accuracy can be calculated using following formula:

To evaluate the reliability of the system, we take the ratio of standard deviation to mean accuracy on running the proposed system by considering all PCA-based cutoffs on all data sizes. The concept is to see how reliable system is with increasing feature population and selecting the optimal features using PCA while increasing the data size.

The average accuracy and reliability index as a function of data size is depicted in 
                           Fig. 12. Further, the system accuracy and its reliability is calculated, as shown in 
                           Table 7 for all three scenarios: color features alone, grayscale features alone and combined. All the results using facial skin image database confirms our observations and findings of pCAD system using psoriasis image database.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our hypothesis assumes that color provides an important information in psoriasis disease classification. Thus, our objective was to present an in-depth analysis of psoriasis disease classification using support vector machine framework in three different scenarios: (i) choosing color space and its features; (ii) choosing grayscale features derived from grayscale spaces and (iii) by combining the color and grayscale spaces. In all, we had explored the power of 14 color spaces (86 features) and 8 grayscale spaces consisting of 60 grayscale features. In each of these scenarios, our paradigm adapted a PCA-based feature selection technique to choose the dominant features without altering their original feature values. We further established a criteria for estimating the "feature power" that helped in understanding the power of the color spaces in machine learning paradigm. Further, the reliability index of the pCAD system was evaluated in all three scenarios demonstrating the effectivness of the color spaces compared to grayscale and combined spaces.

A total of 86 features were derived using 14 color spaces by considering the mean and standard deviations in each of the 14 pools. Before we explored a series of experiments, we ensured that we had the best kernel type selected for the SVM-based classification scheme. Thus, our objective was to fix the data size and vary the kernel types. The kernel function of polynomial with order two showed the optimal results (Fig. 4). We utilized the PCA-based feature selection method based on polling and ensuring that the original feature values were never lost. Our results showed that for this selected kernel, the performance parameters were: sensitivity (99.93%), specificity (99.96%) and accuracy (99.94%) and the best PCA cutoff 0.985 (Table 1). The clinical interpretation of 99% accuracy implies that our system is able to find true positive (TP) cases with an accuracy of 99%. This means that the data set which were truly abnormal were classified as abnormal and the data set which were truly normal were classified as normal. Our observations showed that the best dominant color features at PCA cutoff of 0.985 belonged to color spaces: CMY, CMYK, HSI, HSV, CIE Lch and Hunter-Lab. This accounts for six color spaces out of 14 color spaces resulting in a nearly 43% of contribution from the given 14 color spaces.

The stability of the pCAD system is controlled by the heart of the system, i.e., PCA-based feature selection. Thus another powerful way to evaluate the color power is to understand how the classification accuracy changes with PCA cutoffs. Our results are shown in Fig. 7(a), how the accuracy changes when cutoff changes from 0.900 to 0.995. As cutoff increases and more features are added into the feature pool, the efficiency increases. This is because the pCAD is able to retain the dominant features with the increase in cutoff values. This interpretation is mirrored in Fig. 7(b) as well, where the number of color features increase with the increase in cutoff values. Also note that for an accuracy of 95% or above, and for a particular PCA-based cutoff, the number of features required in color space are almost half the number of features required in grayscale or combined spaces. Thus, the power of color features can be felt in classification of psoriasis healthy vs. diseases cases using PCA-based paradigm. The key to the success is the role of polling method as discussed in PCA-based feature selection. We hypothesized that psoriasis images have strong color information. Thus, we used several color spaces for feature extraction. Due to large number of features, we adapted the PCA-based feature selection method based on polling criteria. Though, PCA gives concise feature values, the polling strategy extract the indices of the dominant features. This prevents altering the dominant features and the original features are never lost. Under the changing conditions of the training data such as data size, lesion grades, image resolutions, the PCA-based system can handle such fluctuations elegantly. No system is fool proof, but under the normal assumptions of our study, this PCA-based system is robust and shows a promising accurate and reliable results and stable machine learning solution to risk stratification.

In addition to further confirm the color feature power, we have calculated and formulated the feature power in all three scenarios: color, grayscale and combined. It was observed that the feature power of color scenario is highest for all PCA-based cutoffs (Fig. 8). This experiment demonstrate that the color features alone are as powerful as grayscale features and combined color and grayscale features.

To analyze the power of color space compared to grayscale and amalgamated spaces, we further evaluated this model and hypothesis by understanding the accuracy distributions with varying data size. This would give us two sources of information: (a) how good is our generalization compared to memorization and (b) how close is color feature space to grayscale or combined space when it comes to data mining and ability to characterize the classification process. We therefore took data sizes ranging from 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, and 540 images, respectively. Further, we took cutoffs ranging from from 0.900 to 0.995 with interval of 0.005 when using the PCA-based dominant feature selection process. The mean accuracy is calculated for all cutoffs for each data size in all three scenarios i.e., when color and grayscale spaces are independent or when they are combined. Our observation and findings already have shown that the color features alone are as powerful as grayscale features. Further, in order to generalize the system we have analyzed the effect of data size on the classification accuracy. The generalization of any CADx system is defined when the accuracy reaches the point of diminishing returns with the increase in population sizes. In our pCAD system, we reached the generalization at K=10, 
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        =250, and T=20 (Fig. 9). This behavior is being further validated in Fig. 12(a) for the facial color data set, where the stabilization of the curve of the accuracy with data size reaches at data size of around 2000 in the database of 4000, i.e., around 50% of the total data size. The generalization behavior reaches around the same time when plateau reaches. Even though, our pCAD system reached to generalization at N
                        
                           i
                        =250, we have demonstrated the effect of data size to its maximum capacity of N
                        
                           p
                        =540, thereby showing how the curves behave without dipping. This indicates successful generalization of the system. Further, the system accuracy and its reliability is calculated in all three scenarios under this set-up, i.e., color features, grayscale features and combined. The system accuracy obtained were: 92.85%, 93.83% and 93.99% (Table 4) and system reliability obtained were: 94.42%, 97.39% and 96.00% (Table 6). A high reliability index shows small deviation in average accuracy as the data size increases (Eq. (5)) and which further concludes that PCA is acting very strong by varying data sizes. This shows that the system is accurate and equally reliable and confirms that color scenario is as powerful as grayscale and combined scenario. This protocol was tested on facial skin image database and the results of experiments validated our observations and findings of pCAD system using psoriasis image database. Even though, accuracies are very promising, larger clinical setups do have provisions for validating psoriasis grades and stages using biopsy based methods. Further, there are factors which can affect the machine learning paradigm such as (i) devices used for data acquisition, (ii) external factors like lightening conditions under which the image data was acquired, and (iii) the gold standard adapted during the training phase of the machine learning system [32]. Though these three factors are interesting to study, but currently it is out of the scope for this publication.

Since there are no public psoriasis databases and further lack of literature and machine learning applications on psoriasis, we have chosen to compare our methods against melanoma and other dermatology images based techniques which involve concept of color spaces as shown in 
                        Table 8. A comparative analysis of 11 color models in combination with three classifiers has been presented in [22] for classification of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stained histopathologic images. The paper concluded that there is no single model which is better than others; however a combination of C4.5 decision tree and SCT color space provided better classification for HE stained histopathologic images. Celebi et al. [33] used six color spaces for color feature extraction along with shape and texture features for classification of pigmented skin lesions in dermoscopy images. The sensitivity of 93.33% and specificity of 92.34% has been reported using SVM classifier. A study of effective color features for a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) application in dermatology is presented in [34] using eight color spaces. The paper reported YCbCr, CIE Lab, CIE Lch, CIE Luv and RGB as best color spaces for this application. Pereira et al. [35] presented an approach for classification of dermatological ulcer images by extracting statistical texture features from four different color space components. An accuracy of 73.80% and AUC of 0.82 has been reported using multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier and concluded that CIE Lab and CIE Luv color components provided better classification performance than the RGB and HSI components. A SVM-based approach for the recognition of malignant melanoma versus dysplastic naevus has been proposed in [36]. Color-based features from three color spaces (RGB, HSI, CIE Lab) and border features are extracted and obtained an accuracy of 94.10%. Barata et al. [37] proposed two Systems (global and local) for detection of melanomas in dermoscopy images using texture and color features. The sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 80% is reported for global method against sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 75% for local method. Further, the role of color and texture features is compared and concluded that color features outperform texture features when used alone and HSV, HSI and opponent color spaces provide best color features. A dermatology CADx system has been presented in [15] to automatically classify dermatology images into psoriatic lesion and healthy skin utilizing color and texture features in SVM framework. The classification accuracy of 99.66% has been reported with sensitivity and specificity of 99.76% and 99.57% respectively. The variation in classification results can be observed in Table 8 due to several reasons such as differences in sample sizes, proportion of database, number and type of features used and classifier(s) chosen.

Even though Mete et al. [22] have evaluated 11 color models, following are the fundamental differences against our study: (i) our infrastructure of machine learning paradigm is to understand the difference between color, grayscale and combined feature set applied to psoriasis disease classification. On the contrary, Mete et al. [22] used Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stained histopathologic images for classification using color space only; (ii) We have coined a new formulation called color feature power for understanding the power of color features using 14 color spaces compared to grayscale and combined features; (iii) the PCA-based feature selection technique is the heart of our pCAD system, which is so fundamental in data mining framework, while this kind of feature selection technique is absent in [22].

The pCAD system proposed based on PCA and SVM here for psoriasis disease classification has been found successful. It still has a good scope of improvement. Better validation on larger data set is essential for clinical translation of the proposed prototype. Secondly, validation with ground truths from clinicians will facilitate the system with better inter-observer variability. Finally, the public databases for psoriasis are needed to prepare. Their benchmarking or standardization is not achieved yet as psoriasis is not popular, threatening and largely spread disease like melanoma. Even though PCA-based feature selection suits this dermatology application for risk assessment, there are more alternatives to feature selection methods such as Fisher Discriminant Approach (FDA), Greedy or weighted methods [38,39] which can be adapted to make the system exhaustive search or weighted approach. Note that our pCAD machine learning system was developed for lesion classification with two classes or grades. This is extendable to multiple classes or grades provided the training system must have enough data size for each grade to be able to learn the tissue characteristics of different grades of lesion. Further all feature sets must be normalized independent in each lesion grades or classes. These issues will be addressed in future by our group dedicatedly. Along with these, better image acquisition devices, imaging nterest and research collaborations are required to access diversified data.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A machine learning-based unique pCAD system for automated classification of psoriasis skin disease was demonstrated which showed the power of color features using 14 color spaces. This system was extended to grayscale feature independently, or showed the flexibility of adapting in classification when color features and grayscale features were combined. The simplicity of the model was enhanced by using a PCA-based feature selection criterion without altering the original or true feature values. The overall system pCAD passed all the significant data mining protocols ensuring the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reliability while using in all three setups: color space, grayscale space and combined color and grayscale spaces. The power of the color feature was analyzed and the hypothesis was proven and validated.

In CIE Lab color space, 
                           L
                         represents the lightness of the color, 
                           a
                         represents the red–green dimension, and the 
                           b
                         represents the blue–yellow dimension. First RGB to CIE XYZ conversion is performed and then the transformation from CIE XYZ to CIE Lab color space is done.
