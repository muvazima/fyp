                  The shortage of medical resources (mainly beds) is a critical and increasingly prevalent problem affecting hospitals. Of the factors that contribute to these shortages, the ambiguity and insufficiency of the criteria used to identify whether an inpatient should be discharged are among the most detrimental. To address this issue, this study applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) on existing inpatient data from the Neurorehabilitation Center at Toronto’s Bridgepoint Hospital to create a dynamic benchmarking system to evaluate the health stage of an inpatient ready to be discharged. Unlike the more traditional parametric techniques, DEA provides non-subjective benchmarking that does not require any prior specification of the production function making it a more desirable choice for this application. The dynamic model categorizes the inpatient’s discharge status as rejected, under observation, or approved. This new approach not only allows managers to gain insight into the potential causes of medical resource shortages, but also allows clinicians to treat inpatients more effectively based on their discharge categories. For validation, the results of the dynamic model were compared with actual inpatient discharge assessments provided by the Bridgepoint Hospital.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The shortage of beds, staffing and medical resources has become an increasingly common problem in hospitals worldwide. Occasionally, these shortages have resulted in hospitals failing to admit patients in acute need of care, leading to several unfortunate cases where more severe consequences were suffered. For instance, in 2008, a pregnant Japanese woman died after being refused by eight hospitals because none of them had a vacant bed (Coco Masters, 2009). Furthermore, research conducted by Robert, Reignier, and Tournoux (2012) showed that patients whose admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were delayed due to the lack of vacancy were subject to a much higher risk of mortality.

Despite the efforts in several countries to abate resource insufficiencies through policy reforms, the demand for medical resources continues to rise dramatically (Liberatore & Nydick, 2008; Smith, Cowan, Sensenig, & Catlin, 2005; Valdmanis, Bernet, & Moises, 2010). Consequently, there has been a significant research effort focused on resolving the mismatch between patient numbers and availability of resources. The majority of these studies attempted to rectify shortages by focusing on one of the following external causes: (1) rescheduling and adjusting the allocation of medical resources including nurses and wards (Blake & Carter, 2002; Geng & Xie, 2012; Kusters & Groot, 1996; Ridge, Jones, Nielsen, & Shahani, 1998; Siferd, 1994; Valouxis, Gogos, Goulas, Alefragis, & Housos, 2012; Verheyen, 1992; Vissers, 1998; Worthington, 1988; Zonderland & Timmer, 2012), (2) reducing patient waiting times (Chien, Tseng, & Chen, 2008; Griffiths, Williams, & Wood, 2013; Iversen, 2000; Saghafian, Hopp, Oyen, Desmond, & Kronick, 2012; Shimshak, Damico, & Burden, 1981; Vuyst, Bruneel, & Fiems, 2014), (3) adopting new patient admission criteria to lighten the load on hospitals (Vissers, Adan, & Dellaert, 2007), and (4) employing new managerial policies (Li & Benton, 2003; Oliveira & Bevan, 2008). The methodologies employed in the above references are able to temporarily alleviate the effects of insufficient medical resources; however, alone they cannot completely eliminate the problem.

In order to more fully address the problem, focus should be brought to an important internal cause of the shortages, namely that inpatients that have completed treatment may not be willing to be discharged from hospital. Generally, this can be attributed to one of the following two reasons: (1) Different clinicians use different scales and criteria to assess the health and condition of inpatients. This variability leads to uncertainty in the discharge decision making process. (2) Patients that do not need to pay for their medical treatments, e.g., those covered by health insurance, have less incentive to be discharged sooner. These reasons are significant contributing factors to the increased demand for medical services and the rising medical shortages, and thus should be considered in more detail. Therefore, this research aims to alleviate resource shortages through the construction of a benchmarking system by DEA that evaluates the discharge of inpatients undergoing neurorehabilitation.

Of the small number of professional medical journal papers that have focused on the topic of inpatient discharge criteria (e.g., Berk & Moinzadeh, 1998; Burns, Yee, Flett, Guy, & Cournoyea, 2013; Ead, 2006; Marshall & Chung, 1999; Turner-Stokes, 1999), the majority adopt parametric modeling techniques. Taking the research of Clark and Huckman as an example (2012), they tried to capture the quality performance of hospitals using a regression model, where the parameters were unknown and decided by the statistical distribution of the data. Although parametric methodologies are widely used and offer desirable characteristics, they possess some inherent limitations which render them unsuitable for the topic examined herein. First and foremost, parametric methods require prior parameter specification. These fixed values are derived from statistical distributions or through empirical methods, and are generally a poor representation of reality, even after considering unavoidable error and noise. Our study uses several measures to evaluate a patient’s recovery, including, but not limited to the Functional Independence Measure (FIM™), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©). While all are useful, the impact of each measure on the patient’s final functional status was not known, and thus fixing parameters was not a sensible option. Fortunately, non-parametric methodologies do not require any pre-specifications and assign all the weights automatically by the method itself. They also offer the opportunity to explore the relationships that exists between each variable and patient recovery. Hence, one of the leading non-parametric linear programming techniques, DEA, is employed in this study.

DEA is a powerful non-parametric approach that is used to evaluate and compare the relative efficiencies of peer units, also known as Decision Making Units (DMUs). The methodology was first introduced in 1978 by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978), who extended Farrell’s (1957) concepts of technical and allocative efficiency to create the CCR model, which created the foundations of DEA theory. In the past couple of decades, DEA has been attracting worldwide research interest as it is applicable to a wide variety of fields, including management, finance, agriculture, and non-profit organizations (Emrouznejad, Parker, & Tavares, 2008; Liu, Lu, Lu, & Lin, 2013; Paradi & Zhu, 2013; Yang & Morita, 2013). Additionally, it has been applied to medical institutions to evaluate the performance of individual hospitals or wards through the consideration of specific inputs and outputs (Ancarani, Mauro, & Giammanco, 2009; Brailsford & Vissers, 2011; Chen, Hwang, & Shao, 2005; Ippoliti & Falavigna, 2012). There has yet to be a publication on the application of DEA to evaluate inpatient progress through the admit-treat-discharge process.

In our study, we focus on applying DEA to inpatients. Each inpatient undergoing neurorehabilitation is treated as a DMU and is evaluated on their overall recovery which is based on their basic functional abilities, balance ability and cognitive performance. These recovery indicators are measured through three individual scores, namely the FIM™ Instrument, BBS and MoCA©, as well as a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score. Given this data, we use the resultant DEA score to classify a patient into one of three discharge categories: discharge rejected, discharge possible after further observation and discharge approved. This system could help improve the clinicians’ decision making process and rectify the ambiguity associated with the patient discharge process, thus allowing for more efficient patient treatment along with easing resource shortages.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces DEA and discusses the methodologies used to build the dynamic inpatient recovery benchmarking system. Section 3 provides a detailed description of how the proposed dynamic model was applied to inpatients undergoing neurorehabilitation in a Canadian medical institution. And to conclude, Section 4 summarizes the research and provides additional prospective applications of the proposed model.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

DEA was initially formulated as the CCR model, which was based on constant returns to scale. Then it was developed to consider variable returns to scale as the BCC model (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984) and the Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) (Tone, 2001). Basically, these DEA models could be classified into either radial or non-radial (additive) efficiency measurements. While each DEA model has its uses, as radial DEA models, the efficiency scores of CCR and BCC are limited by the fact that they do not account for mix inefficiencies, i.e., input excesses and output shortfalls (called slacks in more general terms) are not reflected in the obtained optimal solution. That is, if we define the efficiency score of DMU

                     =(1,…,1) is a unit vector used to sum up the total slacks in inputs and outputs. Without the second phase, a projected point being considered as the referential improvement target of DMU
                        o
                      may have slacks in some inputs or outputs, even though the projected point would have an efficiency score 1 by the first phase model. Thus a radial measure

                      alone cannot reflect the impact of slacks, and gives a higher efficiency score. Thus the SBM model, which accounts for mix inefficiencies (Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007) and integrates both a radial measure and slacks into the objective function, was selected for this study. In this section, the applied methodologies of this study are introduced. These include a SBM model with a constant input, discussion about returns to scale, a setup of the dynamic benchmarking criteria, and the update of these criteria. Further explanations of patient evaluation criteria and medical technologies are also provided.

To gain a better understanding of the final model, we begin with a brief introduction to the SBM model which forms the basis of our approach. For a complete text book on the subject of DEA, please consult (Cooper et al., 2007). Consider a set of n DMUs whose input and output vectors are represented by an m
                        ×
                        n input matrix 
                           X
                         and an s
                        ×
                        n output matrix 
                           Y
                        . The number of inputs and outputs are denoted by m and s. Thus, the efficiency score of DMU
                           o
                         (the current DMU under examination) is formulated by the following fractional programming form of the SBM model

                        , and is usually considered to be an improvement target. The target can be achieved by reducing inputs and increasing outputs towards a convex combination of DMUs (

                        ). Tone (2001) shows that the above SBM model satisfies the following three properties: (P1) Units Invariance: The optimal value of the objective function is independent of the units in which the inputs and outputs are measured. (P2) Monotony: The efficiency of a DMU is monotonically decreasing with an increase in each slack in either inputs or outputs. (P3) Translation invariance: Translating the input and/or output values will not change the efficiency score of the calculation.

In conventional DEA models, a DMU has both inputs and outputs, and DEA is used to evaluate a group of DMUs. However, we sometimes encounter DEA models with only one of either inputs or outputs. DEA models with a single constant artificial input (output) are not a new concept. It was perhaps first applied by Thompson, Singleton, Thrall, and Smith (1986) to determine the optimal location of a superconducting supercollider in the state of Texas. They designed a model with three inputs (facility cost, user cost and environmental damage), and set the output of each site equal to unity and used the input-oriented CCR model to compare six candidate sites. Moreover, Soares de Mello, Angulo-Meza, and Branco da Silva (2009) utilized radial DEA models with unitary input and outputs of gold, silver and bronze medals to rank countries participating in Olympic Games, as the input in this research context was not the key point. Similarly, there are also many other articles (e.g., Adolphson, Cornia, & Walters, 1991; Paradi, Rouatt, & Zhu, 2011; Prieto & Zoflo, 2001) using models with a constant input (output) in the case when only the output (input) of the DMU is the research interest.

The inpatient data utilized in this research was provided by the Neurorehabilitation Center at the Bridgepoint hospital in Toronto, Canada. The recovery process of patients at the Center was monitored by clinicians who score each inpatient during weekly multidisciplinary rounds of evaluation based on three measures: FIM™ Instrument, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE which demonstrate the inpatient’s overall medical condition.

The FIM score is derived from the patient’s ability to perform 18 tasks which assess their level of disability and how much assistance they require in their everyday life. Each of these tasks is rated on a 7 point scale ranging from 1, denoting complete dependence to 7, denoting complete independence. These individual scores are then summed to provide the overall FIM score, ranging from 18 to 126, which indicates the patient’s overall physical capability. BBS is composed of 14 tasks designed to measure a patient’s ability to perform various activities as shown in Table 1
                        . Similar to the FIM score, each BBS task is rated individually (in this case between 1 and 4) and then summed to get an overall measure of the patient’s ability to balance. The third score is the MoCA© score (maximum 30) which comprises 3 tests focused on arithmetic, memory and orientation. The majority of patients receive a MoCA© score, however a small number are assessed by the MMSE score instead. For the purpose of this study, both measures were treated equally, since the number of MMSE scores is very limited and the differences between the two measures are not obvious. A more detailed explanation of each score is provided in Table 1. These scores were utilized in constructing a benchmarking system to categorize the discharge potential of patients and also to treat them more effectively during their stay at the Center.

Each inpatient undergoing neurorehabilitation is considered to be a DMU. The model inputs include the patient’s medical treatment and circumstances, and the required resources and staff provided by the hospital. The hospital treats each patient and their condition to the best of its capabilities and shows no bias between patients. The patients deemed ready for discharge from the Center are those who have achieved a certain level of scores in FIM, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE. It is apparent that the research interest here is only about the three scores for the patients, thus the input is assumed to be 1 for each DMU.

Given that the patients suffer from various conditions, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and brain damage, their recovery paces are quite different. This means that they might have quite diverse functional gains in FIM, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE scores. Therefore, it is necessary to benchmark patients based on variable returns to scale (VRS) in order to classify patients more precisely depending on their score scales. Compared to constant returns to scale (CRS), VRS can suggest more appropriate improvement schemes for patients found “inefficient” in a DEA sense, enabling them to improve their scores based on their different returns to scale, i.e. recoveries dictated by their underlying conditions. However, we will consider both CRS and VRS models in the following context and show later that VRS is the only reasonable choice.

From the results of the model, the clinicians would know the score differences between patients having been discharged and the patients still undergoing neurorehabilitation. They could then develop a special medical treatment plan for each cluster of patients having the same reference set.

The output-oriented SBM model we are using in this research is as follows:

                         term in the numerator of problem (1) equals 0. Later we prove that a VRS-SBM model with a constant input as shown in (3) is useful when there are no inputs. But before this, as a precondition, we examine whether a CRS-SBM model without inputs makes sense. It has been shown that an output-oriented (input-oriented) CCR model without inputs (outputs) is meaningless (Lovell & Pastor, 1999). Here we extend this proposition to the SBM model by proving Lemma 1.

Since the choice of ε was arbitrary, it follows that the objective function of the above problem has no positive lower bound. The result follows. □

Therefore, we have to assume a constant input for all DMUs, since as we discussed above, CRS-SBM without inputs is meaningless. The input restrictive condition should be 
                           eλ
                        
                        ⩽1, where the only constant input equal is to 1. Then we prove that 
                           eλ
                        
                        <1 is actually not necessary in the following theorem.
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              An output-oriented CRS-SBM model with a single constant input is equivalent to the corresponding VRS-SBM model.
                           

The output-oriented CRS-SBM model with a single constant input is as follows.

Here we need to utilize the theorem of Cooper et al. (2007, p. 113): “Enhanced Russell Measure (ERM) and SBM are equivalent in that λ

                              values that are optimal for one are also optimal for the other”. Therefore, we can use ERM instead of SBM to prove the theorem. The output-oriented ERM with a constant input can be written as follows.

It follows that 
                                 eλ
                              
                              =1, and the CRS and VRS models are equivalent. □

It follows that we can use problem (3) to substitute for (1) if SBM is employed, and DMUs have multiple outputs and a single constant input. Moreover, it’s valid to assume the PPS exhibits VRS as the CRS and VRS models are equivalent in any event.

The criteria for determining whether to discharge a patient should be updated over time due to three aspects. Firstly, demographic characteristics of patients are changing, and the diversity of illnesses may also vary. Secondly, clinicians’ assessment practices may be subjective, thus affecting the criteria. Finally, emerging advanced medical technologies may accelerate and improve some patients’ recoveries, which would therefore necessitate updated benchmarking criteria. It follows that the benchmarking criteria should be designed to be dynamic. Therefore, we first think about forming a dynamic SBM model with a constant input based on model (3).

In order to provide un-biased and representative results, data was collected from patients of varying ages, diagnoses, occupations, and both genders. Nevertheless, there are still factors that can affect the objectivity of the analysis results. For example, a patient’s mobility is heavily influenced by their general standard of living and environment, their psychological stability, and the availability of the medical technology required for their individual treatment plan. Furthermore, the data is limited by the assessment criteria, which may not have the capability of providing a comprehensive representation of a patient’s specific condition. Lastly, static SBM models provide relative assessments of the DMUs based on the available dataset to create an efficient frontier. Given additional data, the efficient frontier may experience a shift. As a result, discharge patients evaluated as efficient by the original model may be outperformed (i.e., deemed inefficient) if additional discharge data is incorporated into the model. Based on these shortfalls, a traditional static SBM model was not suitable for this application; so a dynamic benchmarking system based on the modified dynamic SBM model (Cooper et al., 2007) was developed.

This model considers two sequential time points, t
                        −1 and t, under dynamic conditions. The efficient DMUs from the last time point t
                        −1 are stored in set 
                           E

                        , added at time t. The efficiency score of a DMU in

The slack variables in the objective function of (4) are attributed to the output shortfalls of the DMUs compared to efficient units from time t
                        −1. At time t
                        >0, DMUs of set 
                           A
                         are evaluated using model (4), and

                           t−1 is the set of DMUs each DMU in A is compared against.

Ultimately, it can be said that (4) is a dynamic model that varies with time t, but is a static system at each fixed time point. This means that at the specific time point when we update the efficient frontier of the system, model (4) can be regarded as a normal SBM model; thus, this dynamic model can also be formulated as VRS as we discussed in Section 2.2. Given this property and that

                           t−1 in problem (4) is defined as a convex combination of efficient DMUs in

In order to develop a dynamic system to evaluate patient recovery, the discharge evaluation process was first considered. This is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . After patients are admitted to the hospital, they are examined, triaged, and sent to the rehabilitation unit where each patient’s recovery is assessed for 14days. It should be noted that this process is that employed by Bridgepoint Hospital, and may (likely) be different at other institutions. After each 14-day cycle, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians discuss whether or not the patient is fit for discharge based on their recovery status, physiological state and self-care ability. But this process has inherent limitations, which include the inconsistency of clinician assessments and the possibility that the assessment results do not truly reflect the patients’ recovery status. To address these problems, we propose the benchmarking approach in Fig. 2
                        . This would not require the clinicians to elaborate upon the patient’s assessment scores (FIM™ Instrument, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE) but would instead input these scores into the benchmarking model created using (4). This model would then produce one simple SBM efficiency score ranging from 0 to 1. This score would then be characterized by the cumulative distribution function in (5) to evaluate whether or not a patient should be discharged.

Additionally, there is the case that a patient should be discharged on the grounds that there is no gain or very little gain in all of the assessment criteria (FIM™ Instrument, BBS, MoCA©/MMSE). This is represented by “no gain (NG)” in the patient’s chart and generally means that even though the hospital continues to offer rehabilitation, further measurable functional gains are not anticipated. To deal with this situation, patients whose efficiency increment is below 0.05 are indicated as NG by the model. Lastly, each of the efficiency scores of discharged patients (either

With the help of cut-off points at time t
                        −1, clinicians can determine how to treat the patients properly at time t. However, as time passes by, the cut-off points may need an update in order to include the data of new patients and to continue providing correct decision information for clinicians. Therefore, we introduce the specifics about how to update the cut-off points in the subsequent section.

                        . After this, we are able to judge whether or not the efficiency score of DMU
                           k
                         equals to 1. If it is 1, 
                           E
                        
                        
                           t−1 is updated to 
                           E
                        
                        
                           t
                         by adding this DMU. Otherwise, DMU
                           k
                         is discarded. Although 
                           A
                         was used for consistency, the benchmarking criteria can be updated with a data set containing DMUs that covers a broader time frame. This can greatly reduce the time required to update the benchmarking criteria. It should be noted that time t does not necessarily need to be consistent with the 14-day assessment intervals. The period from t
                        −1 to t is determined by management controlling the benchmarking system and might be a period of one month, half a year, or even longer.

In this section, the benchmarking system is applied to a data set of neurorehabilitation patients who were treated between November 2011 and September 2012 at the Bridgepoint Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Data from November 2011 to June 2012 was used as to generate the original evaluator set 
                           E
                        
                        0. The remaining data was used to update the evaluator set, thus making the update period three months. Each inpatient has three outputs at the time of being discharged from hospital. In order to protect the privacy of patients, sequential ID numbers were used instead of personal information. A patient’s recovery status is expressed by SBM scores shown in Table 2
                        , where patients 64, 75, 90 and 98 achieved the highest efficiency score of 1. These patients were recorded in set 
                           E
                        
                        0 and served as the evaluator set for future patients admitted to the center. The slacks are also listed in the table to show how to adjust an inefficient inpatient’s outputs in order to reach their target. Concretely, clinicians could utilize the slacks to identify where rehabilitative therapy should be focused. The slacks are also helpful for patients being discharged in the sense that they could understand how to continue the rehabilitation training outside the hospital. Detailed training methods to improve different kinds of functional recovery are attached in Appendix A.

The efficiency distribution of the data set is provided in Fig. 4
                        . The horizontal axis denotes 117 patients, and vertical axis corresponds to the efficiency score of each patient. All the patients are rearranged along the horizontal axis in ascending order of their efficiency scores, thus the percentage of patients under a given score can be determined in an easy way. Referring to the criteria for rehabilitation in Ontario (Sutherland & Walker, 2006), the group of patients who are rejected for discharge was selected such that

                        , while the group rejected for discharge but under further observation was selected to have 
                           
                              F
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             ρ
                                          
                                          
                                             d

                              =
                              50
                              %
                           
                        . Thus the cut-off point between patients with discharge rejections and those to be observed further is the 11th (117×10%) highest efficiency score. The score of the patient in this position is 0.5664, which corresponds to the efficiency score of patient 46. Similarly, the cut-off point between inpatients requiring further observation and patients who are approved for discharge is 0.8093, which corresponds to the efficiency score of patient 1. Determining if a patient should be discharged can, therefore, be judged by where their score would lie on the distribution shown in Fig. 4. Apparently, the efficiency scores rise dramatically for the first decile of patients. The slope of the curve decreases from the first decile.

To demonstrate how to classify patients and determine their recovery status, Table 3
                         presents the evaluation process for two typical patients (137 and 164). It can be seen that all three outputs increase dramatically while undergoing rehabilitation. The sum of the slacks of the three outputs tends to decrease as the length of stay increases, although the slack for a particular output may increase due to shifts in the reference set. Both patients were rejected for discharge after the first two 14-day intervals as their efficiency scores fell under the cut-off point of 0.5664. During the next interval, patient 137 enters the “further observation” group where an additional 7-day rehabilitation is assigned. Their assessment shows little change, resulting in a very small increase of their efficiency score. It follows that they are cleared for discharge on the grounds that they are now classified as NG. On the other hand, patient 146 skips the “further observation” class and is immediately approved for discharge as the efficiency score substantially improves to a point where it exceeds the cut-off point of 0.8093.

This section presents an application of the methodologies presented in Section 2.3. To update the former benchmarking criteria (
                           E
                        
                        0) with data from July 2012 to September 2012, the new patients’ efficiency scores are first calculated by the evaluator 
                           E
                        
                        0 as shown in Table 4
                        . The outputs of the DMUs located on the cut-off points, the average efficiency scores, and the membership of the set of reference units are listed in Table 5
                        . As before, patients can find their target improvements indicated by their slacks. Following the updating process, the number of DMUs was increased from 117 to 151 and the cut-off points shifted from

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The current research focuses on constructing a dynamic benchmarking system to evaluate the recovery status of neurorehabilitation patients through the consideration of multiple assessment criteria including the FIM™ Instrument, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE. In order to improve the complex and subjective assessment process performed by clinicians to determine whether or not to discharge a patient, a dynamic non-parametric benchmarking system constructed using DEA is proposed in this paper. This model was able to produce encouraging results. Moreover, a dynamic modeling approach was taken to allow the user to update the benchmarking criteria and expand the data set when further data is available. Over time, the model should get better at identifying which patients should be discharged or put into further treatment.

As this was preliminary research into the feasibility of creating a dynamic benchmarking system for the health care sector, a few key points should be made: (1) due to the lack of available medical records, the number of DMUs used in this study was insufficient for a more comprehensive assessment of the model. As the number of DMUs increases with time, the benchmarking criteria will become more correct; (2) the percentiles for the three classes of patients (i.e. discharge rejected, under observation, discharge approved) are flexible and may vary between hospitals and wards. Moreover, the general benchmarking criteria chosen for any hospital require professional opinions from clinicians and management; and (3) although this research was conducted for a neurorehabilitation hospital, the methodology can easily be applied to other related fields.

Neurologic injuries can affect the body in a number of ways, thus requiring a wide range of treatments and treatment durations. In the future, it would be beneficial to incorporate more specific information on patient injuries, which may include stroke, disabilities, neurological disorders, traumatic/non-traumatic brain injuries, and traumatic/non-traumatic spinal cord injuries, into the model to provide more refined and meaningful discharge classifications and treatment suggestions. For patients discharged from hospital, especially those discharged because of no measurable functional gains, further rehabilitation training as shown in Appendix A is suggested.

Realistically, the proposed benchmarking system could be implemented in a hospital ward by setting up a real time scoring system containing all criteria including FIM™ Instrument, BBS and MoCA©/MMSE, and these would be displayed while clinicians could input patient assessments. The average efficiency scores would then be calculated by the system using the benchmarking approach shown here to provide the clinician with instant recovery and discharge statuses. In closing, we think that this initial research in setting up a benchmarking system for implementation in the field of medicine will be insightful and informative for future researchers.

Research has shown that rehabilitation therapy and locomotive training are effective treatment approaches for patients who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury (Selzer, 1999). Conventional rehabilitation, which includes upper extremity training, transfer training, balance training and walking training, is introduced here.

Upper extremity training mainly consists of the mobilization and selective movement of the shoulders, hands and arms, as well as grasping exercises which may require help from a therapist. These exercises may include mixing cream, pouring water into a glass, reaching to move a cup, picking up coins, picking up an eating utensil, grasping and releasing various blocks, and other functional movements required for daily activities. The level of difficulty of the tasks is modified throughout the treatment depending on the patients’ abilities and their improvements. Through effective upper extremity training, patients can greatly improve their functional ability and use of the effected arm in their daily life.

Another essential component of movement is the body’s ability to balance. The balance function involves the interdependent stance symmetry, steadiness and dynamic stability (Nichols, 1997). The concept of balance covers four subdivisions of motor skills: (1) postural control on a stationary basis; (2) postural control in voluntary movements; (3) postural control in involuntary movements; and (4) postural control in external perturbations (Ragnarsdottir, 1996). Consequently, balance exercises used in the rehabilitation process can include any activities and movements that help to maintain, enhance or restore balance (McCloskey & Bulecheck, 2000).

Much like balance, the ability to transfer weight from one foot to another is essential for a patient’s independence and safe return home. Transfer training is a critical goal of rehabilitation and includes activities that focus on moving the body from one surface to another surface, bed mobility, sitting, sit-to-stand and bed to wheelchair movements, and wheelchair transfers (Jette et al., 2005). For some patients, this form of treatment will be centered on teaching the patient compensatory strategies to safely deal will their new mobility limitations.

Stroke is considered to be one of the leading causes of adult disability (Whitall, 2004), with walking impairments being one of the most devastating post stroke disabilities (Hesse, 2002). It follows that walking is a major focus of post stroke rehabilitation (Bohannon, Horton, & Wikholm, 1991). Recently, there has been an increased interest in the implementation of combination training focusing on strength and cardiorespiratory health. This rehabilitation process includes gait and gait-related tasks which are practiced using a functional approach (Duncan & Studenski, 2003; Macko & Ivey, 2005; Salbach & Mayo, 2004). Studies have shown that programs focusing on cardio-respiratory and gait-oriented training are more beneficial in improving walking competency. However, in order to be more beneficial, the training programs should be patient specific, focusing on relearning functional gait-related skills that are relevant to the individual patient’s needs (Kwakkel & Kollen, 2004; Van & Kwakkel, 2004).

There are several researchers who employed task-related training in order to improve the effect of rehabilitation (Blennerhasset & Dite, 2004; Kim & Jang, 2003; Mudie & Winzeler, 2002). Studies have shown that the task-oriented rehabilitation is more effective than traditional rehabilitation therapy, and that the active use of task-oriented training by stroke survivors leads to improved functionality, health and overall quality of life (Rensink & Schuurmans, 2009).
