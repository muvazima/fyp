                  Companies operating global supply chains in various industries struggle with parallel importers diverting goods from authorized channels to gray markets. While the existing gray market literature mainly focuses on pricing, in this paper we develop a model to examine the role of demand enhancing services as non-price mechanisms for coping with gray markets. We consider a manufacturer that sells a product in two markets and a parallel importer that transfers the product from the low-price market to the high-price market and competes with the manufacturer on price and service. We show that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to provide more service in both markets. We explore the value of service and the effects of competition intensity and market responsiveness to service on the manufacturer’s policy. We find that a little service can go a long way in boosting the profit of the manufacturer. Investing in service enables the manufacturer to differentiate herself from the parallel importer and to achieve the ideal price discrimination. In addition, service increases the value of strategic price discrimination when facing parallel importation. We also analyze the case when the manufacturer sells through a retailer in the high price market and can delegate service provision to the retailer or provide service herself. We find that delegating service to the retailer reduces double marginalization and can simultaneously benefit the manufacturer and the retailer, even if the retailer is not as efficient as the manufacturer.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Companies in various industries are increasingly challenged by the diversion of their products to unauthorized distribution channels known as gray markets which resell genuine products legally purchased from authorized distributors. Gray markets are mainly the product of regional price differentials arising from supply chains that promote geographic pricing aimed at expanding commerce. Regional price differentials combined with diminishing trade barriers all but ensure gray market trade, also known as parallel importation, by which products purchased cheaply in one region are imported by individuals or enterprises to undercut higher pricing in another region.

Globalization and on-line sales feed gray markets, which in 2008 cost the U.S. IT industry alone approximately $58 billion and accounted for as much as 30 percent of total sales, according to a study by international auditing firm KPMG (2008). A 2009 Deloitte study found that gray market imports annually cost U.S. manufacturers upwards of $63 billion in sales (Bloomberg, 2009). Gray markets trade in a broad set of products including electronics, pharmaceuticals, college textbooks, beverages, cigarettes, automobile parts, luxury watches, jewelry, chocolates, and perfumes (Schonfeld, 2010).

Most gray market sales are legal under the first sale doctrine, which allows purchasers to resell, display, or dispose of legally acquired items. Moreover, because gray market goods are genuine—unlike black market counterfeit products—companies are limited as to the legal strategies available to fight them. Although gray markets generate a new stream of demand, manufacturers generally consider gray markets harmful because products diverted to gray markets end up competing with those sold by authorized distributors and brand value may erode as products become available to segments that the manufacturer deliberately avoided. Gray markets also free ride on advertising and other manufacturer efforts to increase sales (Gallini & Hollis, 1999).

Since price differentials drive gray markets, brand owner efforts tend to focus mostly on pricing mechanisms. Some luxury brands, TAG Heuer and Christian Dior for example, have gone so far as to forgo the advantages of geographic pricing altogether. They have instituted uniform pricing policies, charging the same amount for their products worldwide (Antia, Dutta, & Bergen, 2004). Strategies like uniform pricing, price reduction, and price matching can lower the pressure from gray markets, but there is a limit to the amount brand owners can compromise on what they charge. Price manipulation can reduce brand equity by confusing consumers, damaging the brand reputation, and lowering profit margins.

One promising alternative for controlling gray markets is boosting authorized channel demand by investing in demand enhancing activities commonly referred to as “service” or sales effort in the marketing and operations literature (e.g. Iyer, 1998; Krishnan, Kapuscinski, & Butz, 2004; Taylor, 2002; Tsay & Agrawal, 2000; Winter, 1993; Xia & Gilbert, 2007). Service broadly represents all marketing efforts to increase product demand such as merchandising, advertising, promotions, attractive in-store demonstration, after-sales support and service offerings, and providing information and guidance to consumers. As a non-price mechanism, value adding services significantly help companies to increase their revenue, enhance customer satisfaction, and promote repeat business. The contribution of service to profits has substantially grown in many industries. In 2011, Deloitte Research reported that after-sales services contributed 19 percent–47 percent to revenues across various industries (Kumar & Sailesh, 2011).

Service can play a major role in encouraging consumers to buy products from authorized channels instead of gray markets. The ubiquity and rapid growth of gray markets in recent years and the limitations of price mechanisms have drawn the attention of many companies to demand enhancing services. In 2011, Mercedes-Benz reported that the percentage of Benzes sold in Thailand that were supplied by the gray market had risen from 13 percent in 2008 to 51 percent. In response to this rapid growth of the gray market, Mercedes-Benz cut the prices of seven models by between 2 and 5 percent and offered more leasing alternatives to induce demand. In addition, the company announced that it would no longer honor after sales services to gray market vehicles to protect its brand image, unless owners of such vehicles paid a one-time fee and register the vehicle with official Mercedes-Benz dealers (Bangkok Post, 2011a; 2011b). BMW also confronted a burgeoning gray market in Thailand and decided to deny service to gray market vehicles (Harman, 2010).

Automotive giant Hyundai wrestled with the same parallel importation problem as Mercedes-Benz in the Philippines. By 2002, gray market Starex vans were pouring into the country via unauthorized channels, and their owners were requesting Hyundai service. Hyundai responded by lowering its prices several times, but the parallel importers immediately slashed theirs as well. Eventually, the auto maker offered a three-year, 100,000-kilometer warranty which was an aggressive service package for deterring parallel importers (Ocampo, 2003).

In addition to offering post-sale services, providing services before and during the sale can greatly boost demand for authorized channels. Nike and Apple are among reputable brands that invest heavily on creating a pleasant shopping experience for customers in their retail stores by educating customers about the brand and providing information about products that address customers’ needs (Quinn, 2013). In a study of gray markets, Galstian (2000) states that point-of-purchase service dimensions such as attractive in-store product demonstrations are highly effective in building a strong brand image to infuse emotion into products, elicit the emotional and social dimensions of shopping, and deter gray markets.

The entities that develop and engage in gray market activities are not limited to unknown individuals who buy one unit of a product and then resell it on the internet. Nowadays many parallel importers are well-established companies with a centralized planning system that buy large quantities of products from authorized dealers and resell them to customers. For example, Amazon, eBay, Kmart, and Costco are among the famous retailers known to have sold gray goods (Bucklin, 1993; Schonfeld, 2010). Although these gray market retailers primarily compete with authorized channels on price, they also invest in different types of services to promote their products. Other examples of such gray marketers are Authenticwatches.com, Jomashop.com, and Prestigetime.com that sell genuine luxury watches, B&H Photo, Video & Pro Audio that sells electronics, audio and video equipment, and professional cameras, and New Zealand’s big retailer, The Warehouse (Krause, 2012). These companies provide services to their customers.

Motivated by these observations in practice, in this paper we analyze the impacts and effectiveness of value adding services in controlling the competition from gray markets. To our best knowledge, our paper is the first quantitative analysis of service mechanisms in the context of parallel importation. We expand the existing framework for analyzing parallel importation (e.g., Ahmadi & Yang, 2000; Xiao, Palekar, & Liu, 2011) by incorporating service competition between a manufacturer selling a product in two markets and a parallel importer. The manufacturer determines her
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        We use ‘she’ for the manufacturer and ‘he’ for the parallel importer and the retailer in Section 4.
                      price and service in each market. If the price differential between the markets is sufficiently large, the parallel importer may buy a quantity of the product in the low-price market and resell it in the high-price market. The parallel importer behaves strategically, maximizing his total profit by way of quantity, resale price, and service offerings. We formulate the competition between the manufacturer and the parallel importer using a Stackelberg game and explore the following:

                        
                           1.
                           
                              Manufacturer’s decisions:
We show that parallel importation compels the manufacturer to provide more service in the high-price market to combat the competition from the parallel importer and to increase the amount of service in the low-price market to make up for raising the price in that market.


                              Manufacturer’s policy and the value of service: We find that a little investment in service can significantly help the manufacturer to curb the competition from the gray market and increase her profit. Demand enhancing services enable the manufacturer to differentiate herself from the parallel importer, especially when the gap between consumers’ perception of the parallel import channel and their perception of the authorized channel shrinks.

Moreover, we examine the simultaneous effects of consumers’ responsiveness to service and the strength of competition between the authorized and gray market channels on the manufacturer’s policy (allow or block) towards the parallel importer. We find that the manufacturer is better off allowing parallel imports when competition is moderate and is better off blocking parallel imports when the level of competition is either low or very high. More importantly, whereas companies that only use price to manage gray market activities have very limited ability to achieve their ideal price discrimination policy, companies that take advantage of service mechanisms have more power to implement a perfect price discrimination policy, even if the gray market is a mild or strong competitor for the authorized channel.

We also compare the manufacturer’s optimal profit to her profit when she adopts a uniform pricing policy. We find that choosing prices and services strategically is significantly more valuable than following a myopic uniform pricing policy. In addition, the value of strategic decision–making in the presence of parallel importation generally increases when service plays a bigger role in enhancing demand.


                              Effects of service control in decentralized supply chain: We study a decentralized supply chain in which the manufacturer sells the product through a retailer in the high price market. We explore the impacts of service control (by manufacturer or retailer) on service investment, gray market volume, and supply chain profits. Manufacturers may delegate services to a retailer if service activities such as in-store product demonstrations and providing a high-quality shopping experience have a strong influence on consumers. Manufacturers may also delegate services to a retailer if the retailer can penetrate the market and communicate with consumers more effectively. On the other hand, a manufacturer may retain control of the service decision and only delegate the pricing decision to the retailer. The automobile industry is an example for the first scenario while the consumer electronics industry provides examples for both scenarios (Xia & Gilbert, 2007). We also observe both scenarios in Best Buy. Efforts for promoting sales of Apple products in Best Buy are managed by Best Buy salespeople, whereas Samsung recently partnered with Best Buy to open 500 Samsung Experience Shops within Best Buy stores. These shops are operated by Samsung salespeople who provide assistance to customers (Gara, 2013).

Interestingly, we find that delegating service to the retailer can benefit both the manufacturer and the retailer, even if the retailer is not more efficient in providing service than the manufacturer. Therefore, entrusting the retailer with service can lead to a win-win situation. In our experiments, we observed an average profit increase of approximately 6 percent for the manufacturer and 13 percent for the retailer. This provides insights into managing demand enhancing services for managers that operate decentralized supply chains and face gray markets. To our best knowledge, we are the first to analyze the effects of service control in a supply chain that faces competition from gray markets.

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. In Section 3, we formulate and solve the Stackelberg game model, and describe the impact of service and parallel importation on decisions. We also explore the effects of service responsiveness and competition intensity on the manufacturer’s policy, and examine the added value of strategic price and service decisions in the presence of parallel importation. Section 4 explores the effects of service control when the supply chain is decentralized in the high price market. Section 5 summarizes the results and concludes with future research directions. The Appendix contains all proofs.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our research is related to and bridges the gap between three streams of literature: the price and service (sales effort) competition literature and the gray markets literature. The price and service literature mainly studies competition and/or coordination of price and service decisions. Iyer (1998) analyzes coordination in a distribution channel with two authorized retailers competing on price and service. Tsay and Agrawal (2000) study a manufacturer selling to two retailers who compete on price and service and find that the intensity of competition and the degree of cooperation affect total sales and profitability. Taylor (2002) and Krishnan et al. (2004) study contracting and coordination of sales effort and inventory decisions. In their analysis of revenue-sharing contracts, Cachon and Lariviere (2005) consider a case in which retailers exert sales effort. Xia and Gilbert (2007) investigate how a dealer’s organizational structure affects a manufacturer’s decision to invest in demand enhancing services or to delegate services to the dealer. Jin, Wang, and Hu (2015) study the combined effect of contract type and the decision right of sales promotion. None of these papers considers gray market activities.

Existing research on gray markets primarily focuses on public policy and pricing. Empirical evidence of gray markets and their causes can be found in Bucklin (1993), Myers (1999), Maskus (2000), and Antia et al. (2004). Ahmadi and Yang (2000) study a supply chain with a price-setting manufacturer and parallel importer. They show that parallel importation can increase manufacturer profit if the distribution cost in the high-price market is sufficiently greater than the distribution cost in the low-price market. Xiao et al. (2011) show that the structure of the authorized channel is critical to determining the profitability of parallel importation. Autrey, Bova, and Soberman (2014) consider two firms selling in a domestic and emerging markets in the presence of gray market. They show that when the products are highly substitutable, adopting a decentralized structure in the emerging market is advantageous. Autrey, Bova, and Soberman (2015) later show that firms may be better off with gray markets if they invest in emerging market development and sell complementary products. Ahmadi, Iravani, and Mamani (2015) investigate the impacts of market conditions and product characteristics on a manufacturer’s policy towards parallel importation.


                     Dasu, Ahmadi, and Carr (2012) consider a decentralized supply chain with a retailer that can sell excess inventory to the gray market. Altug (2014) determines when product diversion to a domestic gray market (as opposed to parallel importation) by a large number of retailers that face stochastic demand will benefit a manufacturer. Hu, Pavlin, and Shi (2013) look at how a reseller can exploit the gray market to benefit from supplier quantity discounts. Su and Mukhopadhyay (2011) consider a manufacturer offering quantity discounts to one dominant retailer, encouraging multiple fringe retailers to get involved in gray market activity.

Despite the crucial role of services, this mechanism has received little attention in the gray market literature. Dutta, Bergen, and John (1994) study retailers who sell across their territories (bootleg) and show that the optimal policy is to tolerate some level of bootlegging. Although they have a service decision variable in their model, they use a transaction cost approach and focus on deployment of an exclusive territory distribution system. Chen (2002) explores the relationships between parallel importers and trademark owners from the viewpoint of social welfare. Chen (2009) later considers a manufacturer contending with parallel importation and analyzes the effects of demand function and price elasticity on profits. Although Chen’s studies incorporate a service variable, they only focus on manufacturer decisions regarding the authorized channel in the region to which gray goods are imported and ignore the price and service decisions for the region where the parallel importer acquires the product. They also assume that the parallel importer either is not a strategic decision maker and the quantity of imports is exogenous, or he does not provide service. In addition, the studies do not analyze service control by the manufacturer or the retailer.

Our paper also relates to the channel conflict literature which studies the competition between manufacturer-owned direct channels and retailer-owned indirect channels. Tsay and Agrawal (2004) and Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess (2003) are representatives of this literature. They show that under certain conditions a dual distribution channel can actually benefit a manufacturer. Our model is similar to dual channel models in that the parallel importer and the manufacturer may simultaneously offer the product in a market. However, there is a key difference between dual channel models and our parallel importation model. In dual channel management, a manufacturer has full control over the design of her distribution channels. She can choose to sell her product through an independent retailer if the circumstances prove that selling through direct and indirect channels simultaneously increases her profit. Otherwise, the manufacturer can refuse to sell her product to the retailer. In contrast, in our model the manufacturer does not have full control over the parallel import channel because it emerges as a result of the price gap between two markets. Moreover, in practice manufacturers cannot identify parallel importers (Antia et al., 2004), and therefore they cannot refuse to sell to parallel importers. Instead, manufacturers can only decide how they want to cope with the existence of parallel importers and adjust their decisions, such as prices and services, accordingly.

The research questions we address distinguish our work from the aforementioned studies because we (1) determine when a manufacturer should allow or block parallel importation by her price and service decisions and explore the leverage the manufacturer derives from providing service when she encounters parallel importation; (2) study the impact of parallel importation on manufacturer decisions and the impact of service investment on the manufacturer; (3) explore the effects of competition intensity and high-price market’s responsiveness to service on the manufacturer’s policy towards parallel imports; and (4) analyze the service control decision in a decentralized supply chain in the presence of parallel importation.

Consider a manufacturer who operates in two separate regions (hereafter referred to as market 1 and market 2). Initially, we assume that the manufacturer sells through a vertically-integrated authorized distribution channel. Table 1
                      lists the notations used throughout the paper. The manufacturer produces the product at constant marginal cost c and offers the product at price pi
                      in markets 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           1

                     . For a simpler exposition, we do not consider the manufacturer’s variable selling cost in each market, though these parameters can be easily added to the model and they do not impact the qualitative nature of the results in general. The manufacturer provides service si

                            can result in a total demand that exceeds N, we assume this outcome does not occur in equilibrium. Achieving a total demand greater than N requires setting a very low price and/or providing an abundance of service which is not practical due to financial risks and service cost. Service investment clearly helps increase demand but not to the extent of exceeding the market base.

Service cost will be quadratic if the service has a significant store-level inventory component. For other types of service, managers usually invest in the lowest-hanging fruit so that further increments in the service level become progressively more costly (Tsay & Agrawal, 2000).

We assume that the manufacturer’s services only enhances authorized channel demand. In practice, many demand enhancing services such as promotions, free installation, after-sales support, and warranty are only offered to customers who buy the product from authorized distributors. In addition to BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Hyundai service policies described earlier, Nikon, Sigma, and Ticino are examples of companies that deny warranty and after-sales services to customers who obtain their products from gray markets.

                      Nevertheless, some services such as advertising and in-store demonstration may also increase the demand in gray market channels. We discuss the effect of relaxing this assumption in the conclusion.

The interaction between the manufacturer and the parallel importer is modeled with a Stackelberg game in which the manufacturer is the leader and the parallel importer is the follower. The sequence of events is depicted in Fig. 1
                     : (1) The manufacturer sets her price and the amount of service in both markets; (2) If the parallel importer decides to transfer the product, he chooses his quantity, resale price, and amount of service to provide in the high-price market.

To analyze the impact of parallel importation on the manufacturer, we first consider the case where there is no parallel importation. The manufacturer maximizes total profit by solving

The first inequality ensures that the market bases are large enough to offset the production cost. The second inequality ensures that investing in services to promote sales is sufficiently costly. The lower bounds rule out the unrealistic scenario in which the manufacturer can achieve unbounded profit by investing in an infinite amount of service. The optimal decisions in the absence of parallel importation are

After the manufacturer sets her prices and services, the parallel importer may consider buying the product in the low-price market and reselling it in the high-price market. We assume, without loss of generality, that if the manufacturer sets her prices without taking parallel importation into consideration, then price in market 2 will be larger than price in market one and the direction of imports will be from market 1 to market 2.

                           Remember that parallel importation will emerge only if price is higher in one market than the other. Thus, this assumption is necessary for analysis. The direction of imports remains intact for the equilibrium prices of the game.

When the parallel importer offers the product in market 2, consumers have options to buy the product from the manufacturer, buy from the parallel importer, or not buy the product at all. The first step of analysis is to model the segmentation of market 2 consumers. We adopt and expand the market segmentation approach in Ahmadi and Yang (2000) and Xiao et al. (2011) in order to compare our results with the existing literature and investigate the impact of demand enhancing services. More specifically, we define consumer surplus functions that depend on three components: (1) consumers’ valuation of the authorized channel and the gray market; (2) the prices offered by the manufacturer and the parallel importer; and (3) the amount of services provided by the manufacturer and the parallel importer. Consumers make the decision that maximizes their surplus. We assume the surplus for not buying the product is zero.

First we define consumer surplus for purchasing the product from the manufacturer as

                         as the consumer surplus for buying from the gray market when the parallel importer offers the product at price pG
                         and provides service sG
                        , where θG
                         represents market responsiveness to the parallel importer’s service. Similar to ψm
                        , in ψG
                         parallel importer’s service enhances consumer’s valuation of the gray market. The parameter 0 < δ < 1 reflects consumers’ perception of the gray market relative to the authorized channel. It captures the notion that consumers have a lower perception of gray markets compared to authorized channels (but not a lower surplus necessarily). This assumption has been used in previous analytical models (e.g. Ahmadi & Yang, 2000; Altug, 2014; Xiao et al., 2011). Moreover, empirical studies of gray markets such as Huang, Lee., and Ho (2004) and Thompson (2009) have observed that consumers value the peace of mind they get when they buy from authorized channels. Nevertheless, consumers ultimately decide to buy from the manufacturer or the parallel importer based on their surplus which measures the net effect of consumers’ perception as well as the price and service decisions of the manufacturer and the parallel importer. In other words, a given consumer will buy from the manufacturer if ψm
                         > ψG
                        ; otherwise, the consumer will buy from the parallel importer.

                         result in two policies towards the parallel importer: Either the manufacturer allows a certain quantity of parallel imports; or she sets her prices and services such that parallel importation becomes unprofitable. For brevity, we have deferred the formulas for the optimal prices and service decisions to the appendix. The manufacturer can maintain her ideal price discrimination policy, meaning charge

                         in (2), when either the parallel importer does not exist at all or when consumers in market 2 have such a low valuation of the gray market channel that parallel importation is not profitable. However, if consumers view parallel imports as a viable alternative (meaning δ is not too low), then the parallel importer can potentially profit from transferring the product from market 1 to market 2. In this situation, the manufacturer needs to react and adjust her decisions to protect her market share. In Section 3.3, we provide more insights about manufacturer’s policy towards parallel imports.

                           Proposition 1
                           
                              Whether the manufacturer allows or blocks parallel importation, she provides more service in both markets.
                           

In the presence of parallel importation, the manufacturer promotes the authorized channel more aggressively in both markets. Although the manufacturer reacts to parallel importation by increasing the price in market 1 and reducing the price in market 2 (thereby reducing the price gap), she also provides more service in market 2 to counteract the competition from the parallel importer and also increases the amount of service in market 1 to compensate for increasing the price in that market.

                           Proposition 2
                           
                              (a) The optimal service level increases in both markets with the consumers’ relative perception of parallel imports.
                           


                              (b) If one of the following conditions holds, then service helps the manufacturer block the parallel importer’s entry: Either θ

As δ increases, consumers’ perception of the gray market relative to the authorized channel goes up and the gray market becomes more credible to consumers. In particular, when δ ≈ 1, consumers become almost indifferent between the manufacturer and the gray market, thereby intensifying the competition. In this situation, the manufacturer uses demand enhancing services as an additional lever to differentiate the authorized channel from the gray market and attract more consumers.

The conditions for θ
                        1 and θ
                        2 in part (b) underscore the important role of service in managing the competition from parallel importers. The functional form of

                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              2
                           
                         are provided in the appendix, and it is easy to show that both 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              1
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              2
                           
                         satisfy Assumption 1. It will not be profitable for the parallel importer to transfer the product if service is sufficiently valued by customers in both markets. If market 1’s responsiveness to service is sufficiently high (above 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              1
                           
                        ), then the manufacturer will provide more service and can afford to increase the price in market 1. This increases the parallel importer’s purchasing cost and makes parallel importation unprofitable.

In a similar manner, the condition for θ
                        2 highlights the value of providing service in the high price market where the manufacturer and the parallel importer vie for consumers. If market 2’s responsiveness to service is sufficiently high (above 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              2
                           
                        ), then by providing service the manufacturer can attract more customers to the authorized channel and win the competition from the parallel importer. Moreover, we can show that 
                           
                              
                                 θ
                                 ˜
                              
                              2
                           
                         decreases with δ. As δ increases, consumers start to perceive the authorized channel and the parallel import channel almost equally. In this situation, investing in more demand enhancing services (as recommended by part (a) of the proposition) gives the manufacturer significant leverage in block gray market activities.

Next we analyze the effect of service on manufacturer’s prices in the presence of parallel importation.

                           Proposition 3
                           
                              Suppose the manufacturer’s optimal price and service decisions result in the same policy—either to allow or block parallel importation—whether she does or does not invest in service. Then, the optimal prices when service is provided are higher than the optimal prices when no service is provided.
                           

Price in market 1 as well as price in market 2 will be higher when the manufacturer invests in service provided that the manufacturer uses the same policy (either allow or block) both when she only uses price and when she uses price and service together to control gray market activities.

For the rest of our analysis, we focus on the case of 
                           
                              
                                 q
                                 G
                                 *
                              
                              >
                              0
                           
                        . This is the scenario in which the parallel importer actually transfers product and competes with the manufacturer. The next proposition describes how consumers’ responsiveness to manufacturer service in market 2 and relative perception of parallel imports affect manufacturer decisions.

                              The price gap between markets 1 and 2 increases with high price market’s responsiveness to manufacturer service.
                           


                        Proposition 4 explains an interesting observation; the price gap is increasing in market 2’s responsiveness to manufacturer service. This is because providing service in market 2 enables the manufacturer to attract more customers to the authorized channel; therefore, the manufacturer can afford to increase the price gap. In other words, demand enhancing services alleviate the pressure on the manufacturer to reduce her price gap.

Having looked at the impact of service and parallel importation on manufacturer decisions, in this section we further explore the role of service in managing gray market activity. We also provide managerial insights about the effects of responsiveness to service and the degree of competition between the authorized channel and the parallel import channel on the manufacturer’s policy towards the gray market. Finally, we compare the performance of the price and service decisions proposed by our model to the uniform pricing policy that is used in practice by some companies.

We conducted numerical experiments to measure the extent of the additional profit the manufacturer gains by investing in service when she faces parallel importation. The parameter values are listed in the Appendix. The value of manufacturer’s service parameters were selected in a way that if there were no parallel imports, investing in service would increase the profit of the manufacturer by 3 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent. Fig. 2
                         shows the results of our experiments and reports the percentage of increase in the manufacturer’s profit when she uses both price and service to cope with parallel importation compared to when she only uses price. When δ is very low, the additional profit is constant because consumers’ perception of parallel imports is too low for the gray market to emerge, regardless of whether the manufacturer offers service or not. As δ increases and the parallel importer becomes more competitive, service significantly helps the manufacturer to promote the authorized channel and earn higher profit. Fig. 2 clearly shows that a little service can go a long way and provides significant leverage in coping with gray markets. Thus, It is crucial for companies to recognize the importance of service and incorporate this non-price mechanism in their reaction to gray markets.

Managers who are challenged by parallel importers face an important question: what policy should they adopt towards parallel importers? Do they need to change their price and service decisions? If yes, should they adjust their decisions such that they allow and tolerate parallel imports, or should they block parallel imports? Since the focus of this research is service, we provide insights about the effects of service responsiveness and the level of competition between the authorized and gray market channels on the manufacturer’s optimal policy towards the gray market. More specifically, we capture the degree of competition by the parameter δ. When δ is low (closer to 0), the parallel importer is not a strong competitor for the manufacturer because consumers essentially perceive the authorized channel to be superior to the gray market channel. On the other hand, when δ is high (closer to 1), consumers’ perception of the gray market channel is close to their perception of the authorized channel; therefore, the parallel importer creates intense competition for the manufacturer. To capture the effect of service, we use the value of θ
                        2 which represents consumers’ responsiveness to manufacturer’s service in market 2 where the authorized and gray market channels compete.

We conducted various numerical experiments using different combination of parameter values. We gradually varied the values of δ and θ
                        2 and found the manufacturer’s optimal policy. Noting that for specific values of parameters, one should consult Proposition 1 to precisely determine the optimal policy, Fig. 3
                         qualitatively summarizes the overall effects of responsiveness to service and competition intensity on the optimal policy towards parallel imports.

The first pattern we observe in Fig. 3 is the sequence of policies along the horizontal axis for different levels of competition. Ideally, companies that sell products in multiple countries want to charge different prices in the markets, based on markets’ responsiveness to price and service, to maximize their profit. The presence of parallel importers challenges the ability of companies to price discriminate, forcing them to deviate from their ideal decisions and reduce the price gap. Generally speaking, we observe that when parallel imports are intrinsically viewed by consumers as an inferior channel, the manufacturer is able to implement her ideal price discrimination policy (i.e., charge the prices in (2)) without worrying about the presence of the parallel importer. As competition starts to pick up, the manufacturer is compelled to change her decisions. When the level competition is somewhat high, the manufacturer reduces her price gap a little bit and provides a bit more service just to block the parallel importer. For moderately high competition, however, blocking parallel imports is no longer the optimal policy because it would require a steep reduction in the price gap which would hurt profits in the authorized channels. Therefore, the manufacturer is better off allowing a certain quantity of parallel imports. Finally, when consumers view the gray market channel as a viable option and, as a result, the parallel importer creates fierce competition for the authorized channel, the manufacturer blocks the parallel importer with her price and service decisions to avoid a sever loss of market share.

The second observation from Fig. 3 highlights the value and effectiveness of service in coping with gray market activities. If the manufacturer only relies on the price mechanism for coping with parallel imports, or consumers’ responsiveness to service is very low, it will be extremely difficult for the manufacturer to achieve the ideal price discrimination, unless the gray market channel is a very weak competitor (the lower left corner). In contrast, when consumers’ responsiveness to service is moderate or high, through investing in services the manufacturer can actually achieve her ideal price discrimination policy, even if the parallel importer creates moderate or strong competition for the authorized channel. In other words, investing in demand enhancing services lessens the pressure on the manufacturer to compromise on her decisions. As a matter of fact, our observation is corroborated by the motivating examples in the introduction. When Hyundai and Benz faced price competition from parallel importers in Southeast Asia, they initially used price to protect their market share. However, both companies ultimately resorted to service mechanisms to draw customers to their authorized channels. The new service offerings by Hyundai and Benz forced the parallel importers to either stop importing vehicles or turn into authorized dealers for the automobile manufacturers.

We close this section by providing managerial insights about the value of making price and service decisions strategically in the presence of parallel importers. Implementing the optimal price and service decisions prescribed by our model requires estimating the value of parameters related to the gray market, such as the relative perception of parallel imports, parallel importer’s transfer cost, and market responsiveness to parallel importer’s service. In practice, some companies such as TAG Heuer and Christian Dior have adopted a uniform pricing policy and charge the same price for their products across all markets to eliminate gray markets entirely. Although the uniform pricing policy requires less information and facilitates price coordination, companies that adopt this policy forgo the benefits of price discrimination in the strategic policy. To explore the value of using a strategic policy as opposed to a myopic uniform pricing policy, we compare the manufacturer’s profit under the strategic price and service policy to her profit under the uniform pricing policy, which is obtained from maximizing

                        Fig. 4
                         reports the profit gap (in percent) between the strategic price and service policy and the uniform pricing policy for four service parameter values. First, we observe that the strategic policy is significantly more profitable than the uniform pricing policy. The profit gap ranges from 6 percent to 29 percent and is higher when δ is not too close to 1. As δ approaches 1, in the strategic policy the manufacturer reduces the price gap and increases her services in reaction to the intense competition from the parallel importer. In this situation, the loss of profit from charging a uniform price in both markets will be lower (relative to when δ is not close to 1). Nevertheless, the profit gap is still considerable. Therefore, adopting a strategic price and service policy instead of a uniform policy is worthwhile as it enables companies to significantly increase their profit through appropriate price discrimination while controlling the extent of gray market activities.

Second, we observe from Fig. 4 that when δ is sufficiently close to 1, the profit gap between the strategic and myopic policies increases with the contribution of service to profit. When δ is close to 1, the authorized channel and the gray market are almost identical in the eyes of the consumers, and competition is intense. In this situation, the strategic policy allows the manufacturer to provide the right amount of services to differentiate herself from the parallel importer. The uniform pricing policy, however, results in suboptimal price and amount of services that impede the manufacturer’s ability to confine the volume of parallel imports to the desired level. Therefore, when service has a great potential for boosting demand in the authorized channel, the strategic price and service policy is even more valuable to companies than the uniform pricing policy.

In our analysis thus far, we have assumed that the manufacturer operates a centralized supply chain. In this section, we study the effects of service control on the competition between the manufacturer and the parallel importer when the manufacturer’s distribution channel is decentralized. Service control refers to whether the manufacturer controls service herself or delegates service to her authorized retailer. For simplicity, we focus on the supply chain structure in market 2 where the manufacturer and the parallel importer compete. We assume the manufacturer sells through a retailer in market 2 and sells directly in market 1. To analyze service control, we study two decentralized models: (1) Retailer service (Model R) and (2) Manufacturer service (Model M). In both models, the manufacturer charges the retailer wholesale price ω and the retailer determines the retail price p
                     2. Service in market 2 is decided by the manufacturer in model M and by the retailer in model R. The sequence of events for both models is described in Fig. 5
                     . We assume the retailer’s service cost parameter is equal to λ
                     2. This allows us to control for the effect of service cost efficiency and focus our analysis on the effect of service control decision. The optimal decisions of models R and M are denoted by superscripts R and M, and are provided in the appendix.


                     Retailer service (Model R): We first analyze the scenario in which the retailer controls service. Since service control by the retailer does not impact the segmentation of market 2, the parallel importer’s optimal decisions have the same functional form as (5). Following backward induction, in stage 2 the retailer solves

                                    The sales volume and profit of the parallel importer are higher when the supply chain is decentralized.
                                 

The amount of service provided by the decentralized supply chains is at most 50 percent of the amount of service provided in the centralized supply chain. The double marginalization phenomenon in the wholesale price contract, caused by the self-optimizing behavior of the supply chain members, increases the purchasing cost of the product for the retailer and forces him to reduce the investment in service. The inefficiency due to double marginalization also results in the manufacturer providing less service in Model M. The sharp reduction in the amount of service provides an opportunity for the parallel importer to attract more customers; therefore, parallel importer’s sales volume and profit go up in both models.

We now compare the two decentralized models to better understand the effects of the service control decision.

                                    (a)
                                    
                                       The wholesale price is lower in Model R than in Model M.
                                    


                                       The amount of service in market 2 is higher in Model R than in Model M.
                                    


                                       The volume of parallel imports is lower in Model R than in Model M.
                                    

Part (a) of the proposition indicates that the manufacturer charges the retailer a lower wholesale price when the retailer is in charge of service compared to when the manufacturer herself controls service. The reason is that when the cost of service is borne by the manufacturer, she is compelled to increase her wholesale price to recover the cost of service. Delegating service to the retailer reduces the manufacturer’s cost and softens double marginalization.

Part (b) of the proposition shows that the amount of service provided by the retailer in Model R is higher than the amount of service provided by the manufacturer in Model M. This is because the retailer pays a lower wholesale price when he is in charge of service; therefore, he can afford to increase his investment in service. The increase in the amount of service induces more consumers to buy the product from the authorized channel in Model R. Consequently, the volume of parallel imports is lower when the retailer is in charge of service as stated in part (c).

                           Proposition 7
                           
                              Both the manufacturer and the retailer are better off when service is controlled by the retailer. This statement continues to hold as long as the retailer’s service cost coefficient is below a threshold

                        Proposition 7 describes an interesting result. When the manufacturer sells her product through a retailer, delegating the service decision to the retailer benefits both the manufacturer and the retailer. The driver of this result is the finding in part (a) of Proposition 6 that the manufacturer charges the retailer a lower wholesale price when the cost of service is borne by the retailer. The lower wholesale price alleviates double marginalization and incentivizes the retailer to provide more service. The increase in the amount of service enhances authorized channel demand and reduces the competition from the parallel importer. Thus, the savings from a higher market share and a lower wholesale price outweigh the cost of providing more service and increase the retailer’s profit. Higher market share for the authorized channel also outweighs the reduction in the wholesale price for the manufacturer and increases her profit. Therefore, allowing the retailer to manage service results in a win-win situation. Moreover, even if the retailer is somewhat less efficient than the manufacturer in providing service, service control by the retailer continues to benefit both members of the supply chain as long as it is not excessively more costly for the retailer to provide service. Using various parameter values in our numerical experiments, we observed an average profit increase of 6 percent for the manufacturer and 13 percent for the retailer as a result of delegating service to the retailer. This result is valuable to managers of global companies that distribute their products through authorized retailers and face parallel importation; such companies should delegate the service decision to their retailers. This strategy will be welcomed by retailers because it creates a win-win outcome.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Service can function as a pivotal non-price mechanism in managing the competition from gray markets. In this paper, we used a Stackelberg game model to capture the price and service competition between a manufacturer and a parallel importer. We found that the emergence of the gray market forces the manufacturer to increase the level of service in both high-price and low-price markets.

We then explored the value of service for coping with the gray market and found that even a little service can help the manufacturer a great deal. In fact, when consumers perceive the authorized channel and the gray market channel almost equally, service helps the manufacturer differentiate herself from the parallel importer. In addition, we investigated the combined effects of service responsiveness in the high price market and the degree of competition between the authorized and gray market channel on the manufacturer’s policy. We observed that the manufacturer is better off allowing parallel importation when the level of competition is moderately high. Moreover, investing in demand enhancing services helps the manufacturer to implement her ideal price discrimination policy more easily. We also compared our strategic decision-making policy with the uniform pricing policy that some companies have adopted in practice to eliminate parallel importation completely. We observed that making price and service decisions strategically is significantly more valuable than using the myopic uniform pricing policy. Even though the uniform pricing policy may be easier to implement, it is important that companies use a more sophisticated policy for controlling parallel importation.

We also investigated the effects of service control when the manufacturer sells her product through a retailer in the high price market. We found that delegating service to the retailer alleviates double marginalization and can result in a win-win situation in which the profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer go up, even if the retailer is not more efficient than the manufacturer.

Our research can be extended in several directions. We assumed that manufacturer’s services only benefit authorized channel customers. Nevertheless, some services, such as advertising and in-store demonstration, may inevitably increase the demand of the gray market channel as well. Our experiments indicated that when the parallel importer can freeride on some services, the authorized channel reduces the price gap further to protect its market share. Due to limited space, we did not present those experiments. An interesting extension would be to consider multiple authorized retailers that compete on price and service. Another extension might be to incorporate demand uncertainty. Finally, our analysis of decentralized scenarios takes into account only the wholesale price contract. The effects of other types of contracts on competition merits further consideration. We leave these directions for future research.
