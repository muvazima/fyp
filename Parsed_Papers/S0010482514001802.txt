                  Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is one of the major causes of vision loss and blindness in ageing population. Currently, there is no cure for AMD, however early detection and subsequent treatment may prevent the severe vision loss or slow the progression of the disease. AMD can be classified into two types: dry and wet AMDs. The people with macular degeneration are mostly affected by dry AMD. Early symptoms of AMD are formation of drusen and yellow pigmentation. These lesions are identified by manual inspection of fundus images by the ophthalmologists. It is a time consuming, tiresome process, and hence an automated diagnosis of AMD screening tool can aid clinicians in their diagnosis significantly. This study proposes an automated dry AMD detection system using various entropies (Shannon, Kapur, Renyi and Yager), Higher Order Spectra (HOS) bispectra features, Fractional Dimension (FD), and Gabor wavelet features extracted from greyscale fundus images. The features are ranked using t-test, Kullback–Lieber Divergence (KLD), Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve-based and Wilcoxon ranking methods in order to select optimum features and classified into normal and AMD classes using Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using private (Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India), Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) datasets. The proposed system yielded the highest average classification accuracies of 90.19%, 95.07% and 95% with 42, 54 and 38 optimal ranked features using SVM classifier for private, ARIA and STARE datasets respectively. This automated AMD detection system can be used for mass fundus image screening and aid clinicians by making better use of their expertise on selected images that require further examination.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

AMD is a chronic irreversible medical condition characterized by drusen or hyper- or hypopigmentations [1]. It is caused due to cell damage in the macula region resulting in central vision loss. AMD is a multi-factorial disease and has various risk factors, viz. age, ocular risk factors namely drusen, retinal pigmentation, choroidal neovascularization and systemic risk factors namely family history, hypertension and smoking [2–5]. AMD is one of the leading sight-threatening diseases among people above 50years [1,6]. About 20–25 million people are affected globally and it may increase three times in the next 30–40 years with the increase in ageing population [2,7,8]. World Health Organization reported that 8 million people have already been affected with severe blindness due to AMD [2,7,8]. AMD is mainly classified into two types wet and dry [1,9]. They are briefly explained below:
                        
                           (i)
                           
                              Wet macular degeneration affects the retina due to filling of fluid under the retina [1]. It leads to bleeding (see Fig. 1
                              b) and scarring causing loss of vision. It progresses rapidly and may respond to laser treatment in the early stage [1,10]. Approximately 10% of all people with macular degeneration have the ‘wet’ type [1,10,11].


                              Dry macular degeneration is caused by the lack of functioning of visual cells [1]. Initial symptoms of dry AMD are the presence of fatty deposits, called drusen (see Fig. 1c), on the retina [12]. There is no treatment for ‘dry’ type [13]. Most of the people with macular degeneration are affected by the ‘dry’ type [1,10].

The Wisconsin AMD grading system categorizes drusen based on size and visibility of the boundary, and is adopted in this study. Drusen can be classified as hard or soft. Further, soft drusen is classified as distinguishable or indistinguishable. Retinal pigmentary lesions are grouped into hypo- and hyper-pigmentation [10,2,14]. The presence of clinical features such as drusen, retinal pigmentation and Geographic Atrophy (GA), dry AMD is categorized into three stages, early, intermediate, and advance 
                     [6,10,2], which are briefly described in Table 1
                     .

The drusen can be identified by the manual evaluation of retinal fundus images by trained clinicians [6]. Several authors have developed automated drusen segmentation methods, which are the initial step in AMD classification. Automated drusen segmentation methods are briefly described in Table 2
                     .

The important challenge in the above-mentioned methods is the identification of drusen and also differentiating drusen from the background noise and other lesions. Moreover, the variation in the shape and size of drusen varies from image to image causing inaccurate detection of drusen. Hence, traditional image segmentation techniques are not very effective in isolating drusen within the retinal photographs [6].

In this paper we are proposing to classify normal and dry AMD classes without segmentation of drusen. The fundus images are preprocessed using adaptive histogram equalization. Further, various non-linear features (FD, HOS entropies, and Gabor wavelet) are extracted from the preprocessed images and ranked using t-test, KLD, CBBD, ROC-based and Wilcoxon ranking techniques. Finally, the ranked features are fed to the set of supervised classifiers to identify the best performing classifier. The black diagram of the automated AMD diagnosis system is shown in Fig. 3.

This paper is organized as follows: Image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, ranking and selection are presented in Section 2. Classifiers used for AMD classification are briefly described in Section 3. The results of feature ranking method and various classifiers are explained in Section 4. The obtained results are discussed in Section 5 and a conclusion is provided in Section 6.


                        Private dataset: The normal and dry AMD fundus images were acquired using TOPCON non-mydriatic retinal camera (TRC-NW200) from Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India. The images were photographed and labelled by the group of ophthalmologist. The hospital ethics committee has approved the image data for research. The five hundred and forty 24-bit Red Green Blue (RGB) colour images (Normal-270 and dry AMD-270) were stored in lossless JPEG format with an image size of 480×364pixels. The stored AMD images were reviewed by an experienced ophthalmologist and graded into early, intermediate and advance (see Fig. 2
                        
                        ) dry AMD images according to Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [27] classification.


                        Public dataset: Two publicly available datasets, viz. ARIA (http://www.eyecharity.com/aria_online) and STARE (http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare), were also used to test the performance of the proposed AMD detection system. The ARIA dataset consists of 101 normal and 60 AMD images acquired using Carl Zeiss Meditec fundus camera with 50° field of view and a resolution of 768×576pixels. The STARE dataset consists of 36 normal and 47 AMD images acquired using TOPCON fundus camera with 35° field of view and a resolution of 700×605pixels.

The green band of the RGB colour fundus images was subjected to contrast enhancement using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). This technique divides the images into blocks and performs adaptive histogram equalization on the divided blocks by considering the pixels in the adjacent area. Hence, each pixel in the image is mapped to a new intensity value which is proportional to its rank in its context region [28], causing anatomical structures such as Optic Disc (OD), macula drusen, and Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to appear more visible.

This section describes the different techniques used to extract features from each green band AMD fundus image. In this work, we have extracted FD, Gabor wavelet, entropies and HOS features from the preprocessed fundus images. They are briefly explained below.

Fractal dimension is used to model the natural objects reflecting roughness and self-similarity [29]. Let us consider A is a bounded set in n dimensional Euclidean space and its fractal dimension (D) can be computed using the following equation:

                           , where i is an integer (here i=2). Moreover, the grid size is doubled until

The radon transform (RT) provides many useful features which may not give any physical meaning as per human perception, however it has mathematical properties which can discriminate the objects [41]. This technique is generally used to reconstruct the image from scattering data in computed tomography. RT transforms the images pixels into line parameters in the Radon domain for a given set of angles [41]. RT [42] can be computed using the following equation:

Higher order spectra, or polyspectra, are Fourier spectral representations of third and higher order cumulants of ergodic random processes. They have been extended to apply to deterministic signals and images. In this work, we have the third order HOS or the bispectrum to extract features [44–46]. The bispectrum [47–49] of a deterministic signal x(t) can be estimated as

Feature selection removes the redundant features and retains features which contributes to the classifier performance. It avoids “curse of dimensionality” to enhance the classifier performance [51]. In this work we have evaluated five feature ranking methods namely t-test, KLD, CBBD, ROC-based and Wilcoxon ranking methods. t-test compares the population means of the two groups to identify the correlation among the features [52]. KLD ranks the features based on divergence measure between normal and dry AMD classes [53]. Chernoff bound provides exponential decay on tail distributions using independent variables. Hence it is used with the Bhattacharyya distance for feature ranking [54]. ROC-based feature ranking selects the features using area between ROC and random classifier slope [54]. The Wilcoxon method is a non-parametric test, which does not assume normal distribution.

Efficient classification systems can help reduce the screening time and can be used provided they do not trade off accuracy more than desirable. In this work we have used SVM, DT, PNN, k-NN and NB classifiers. They are briefly described below.

SVM uses data from normal and dry AMD groups to construct a hyperplane, which separates the two classes. It can be used for non-linearly separable data using kernel functions [55,54,56]. In this work, different kernel functions namely linear, polynomial of orders 2, 3 and radial basis function (RBF) are used. Moreover, we have selected the RBF sigma (
                        σ
                        =
                        2
                     ) value to tune the classifier performance. The DT classifier performs the classification task based on set of rules derived from the input features of the training data [54] (normal and AMD). PNN is a feed forward neural network based on Parzens׳ results on probability density estimators. It has three layers such as input, pattern and summation. The compete transfer function in the summation layer used the distance vector probabilities to make the decision during testing [57]. The summation layer spread value (σ) of 0.1 is chosen to obtain maximum accuracy. k-NN is a non-parametric lazy learning algorithm using nearest neighbour principle and makes decision by computing distance between the nearest neighbours [54,58]. In this work we have used k-NN classifier and found that K=1 gave the best performance. NB classifier is derived using the Bayes theorem. It assumes that the data is obtained from normal distribution and also independent. The maximum likelihood algorithm is used to compute the class prior probability and the feature probability. This model is then used along with a maximum a posteriori decision rule to determine the class label of unknown data [54].

@&#RESULTS@&#

The performance of the proposed automated AMD detection system is evaluated on private, ARIA and STARE datasets. AMD progression can be detected by the presence of drusen, pigmentary irregularities and new vessel proliferation. These abnormal lesions changing the pixel pattern in the retinal fundus images, which can be quantified using entropy and non-linear features.

The summary of statistics (Mean±StandardDeviation (SD)) of extracted features is shown in Fig. 4
                     a–d for private dataset. It shows that the texture values are low for AMD and high for normal (see Fig. 4b and c) due to the presence of homogeneous pixel patterns of drusens in the AMD images. Also, most of the HOS entropy values are high in the case of AMD (see Fig. 4a and d), due to the presence of drusens.

The 3D scatter plot of private dataset (Fig. 5
                     ) shows that the Gabor wavelet based features are distinct for normal and AMD classes with some overlapping. Gabor functions often provide the optimal resolution both in spatial and frequency domains compared to other wavelet basis functions [33]. Hence it has more discrimination power (Fig. 5). Fig. 6
                      shows the box plot of FD for normal and AMD classes.

The extracted features are ranked using t-test, KLD, CBBD, ROC-based and Wilcoxon ranking methods. Further, these ranked features are incrementally nested and then fed to NB, DT, k-NN, PNN and SVM classifiers using the bootstrapping approach [59]. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The dataset is separated into 10 distinct sets, nine sets are used to build the training model and the remaining set is used for testing. It is repeated 10 times with different train–test combinations and finally the performance measures namely sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and accuracy are computed over the 10-folds (Tables 3–5
                     
                     
                     ). A linear SVM outperformed all other classifiers investigated for this problem on DT, PNN, k-NN and NB classifiers.

The performance measures plot (Fig. 7
                     ) of SVM classifier with preprocessing shows that the 42, 54 and 38 ranked features are significantly contributed to achieve the maximum accuracy (Mean±SD) of 90.19±5.38%, 95.07±4.81% and 95±6.46% respectively for private, ARIA and STARE datasets using CBBD, t-test and KLD ranking methods. However, SVM classifier without preprocessing shows that the 56, 19, and 67 ranked features obtained an average accuracy (Mean±SD) of 92.96±3.88%, 92.57±7.04% and 85.14±12.95% respectively for private, ARIA and STARE datasets using Wilcoxon, CBBD and t-test ranking methods. The obtained results (with preprocessing) are comparable, since the SD is deviating 5% from the Mean (see Fig. 8
                     ). From the results we can infer that using a larger set of test images is good and gives a better estimate of how the method generalizes to unseen data.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Fundus image analysis helps in the detection of various posterior segment eye diseases namely AMD, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma [60]. In this work, various non-linear features are extracted from normal and AMD fundus images to perform automated detection. The yellow pigmentation and drusen results in contrast in the green band and then it is extracted as information in the features [33]. The main effect of feature ranking was that the Gabor wavelet and HOS entropies were ranked higher than that of the other features. Hence, the mean accuracy of the proposed system using private, ARIA and STARE dataset is more than 90% and the SD is 5% (see Fig. 8).

A full list of ranked features is not shown in this paper because of space limitations and a summary of observations is provided instead. The ranking of features differed from one dataset to another and also depended on whether the images were subjected to pre-processing with adaptive histogram equalization. It was observed that the Gabor features dominated the list of top features for both ARIA and STARE datasets when the images were pre-processed. However, entropy and HOS features also figured higher up on the list when there was no pre-processing. For the ARIA dataset and for the private dataset, HOS features figured in the top 10 features in terms of statistical variation, when there was no pre-processing. On the private dataset, HOS and entropy features appeared in the top 10 even with the pre-processing. The fact that a linear SVM classifier performed the best suggests that the features distributed are clustered and are probably not on non-linear manifolds where a kernel based method may have worked better.

The classification results show that SVM linear kernel achieved highest classification accuracy (see Tables 3–5) compared to other kernels. Other classifiers such as NB, k-NN and PNN yielded maximum accuracies (Mean±SD) of 83.90±5.82%, 84.07±4.55% and 86.99±7.40% using 6, 57 and 49 features respectively for private and ARIA datasets, whereas DT achieved the maximum accuracy of 82.59±5.25% using 29 features for private dataset. Hence, we can infer that the SVM classifier with linear kernel achieved maximum accuracy in classifying normal and dry AMD classes. The summary of our results obtained for the automated diagnosis of AMD is shown in Table 6

Köse et al. [61] have proposed inverse segmentation method to identify healthy and unhealthy areas in the AMD fundus image. Initially, the OD and macula are located using the Sobel filter and relative locations of these two structures. Further, region growing algorithm is initialized around macula to segment out healthy and unhealthy regions. Next, the inverse of segmented image is taken to generate the unhealthy segmentation result. Their method achieved a segmentation accuracy of more than 90%.

Ahmad Hijazi et al. [62] have proposed two stage Case Based Reasoning (CBR) technique applied to histogram of the retinal image to detect AMD. Their approach involved two stages: (i) case base generation and (ii) classification of unknown image. Their algorithm achieved a mean sensitivity of 86% compared with graders.

Köse et al. [63] have presented statistical segmentation method to differentiate healthy and unhealthy regions of macula for automated AMD detection. The statistical texture features such as intensity variation, distribution, low and high extreme distribution are computed on characteristics and sample images after preprocessing. Finally, difference between the intensity distributions of characteristics and sample images segments the unhealthy area. Their method obtained the accuracies of 92.76% and 96–100% to segment out unhealthy and healthy areas respectively.

Hijazi et al. [63] have presented two data mining techniques such as spatial histograms and hierarchical image decomposition for automated screening of AMD. Initially, the spatial histogram is generated from different regions by utilizing texture and shape information of the AMD featured images. Further, an average signature histogram is generated for each region with respect to each class. In the hierarchical decomposition approach the image is decomposed by angular and circular manner. Their approach achieved accuracies of 74% and 100% using spatial histogram and hierarchical decomposition respectively.

Zheng et al. [65] have presented automated AMD grading system using image-mining techniques. The hierarchical trees based decomposition is applied on preprocessed images. Then weighted frequent subgraph mining algorithm is applied to extract features. Their method obtained an highest classification accuracy of 99.6% using SVM classifier.

Agurto et al. [64] have proposed AM–FM based AMD detection using retinal fundus images. Their approach decomposed the green channel image into different representations using AM–FM method on 140×140 pixels Region Of Interest (ROI) which reflects the intensity, geometry and texture of the different lesions present in the image. Further, features such as statistical moments and histogram percentiles are computed. Finally, partial least square method is used to classify the features as DR and AMD. Their method was evaluated in two datasets namely RIST and UTHSCSA and achieved AUC of 0.84 and 0.77 respectively.

The main advantages and uniqueness of the proposed system are summarized below:

                           The proposed system does not require any segmentation.

State of the art accuracy (90.19%, 95.07% and 95%) on larger datasets (private, ARIA and STARE) used for testing (see Table 6).

Our results are consistent over 10-fold cross validation, which shows that the obtained results are robust and reproducible.

The proposed system uses non-linear features such as HOS entropies and Gabor wavelet, which are more robust to noise. Hence, it can provide accurate results during mass dry AMD screening.

The execution time of the optimal system for feature extraction (image data size=540/161/83), training (10-fold) and testing (10-fold) is 266.318/39.7368/39.0108s, 0.0310/0.0041/0.0037s and 0.0235/0.0033/0.0032s respectively for private/ARIA/STARE dataset using Intel i7-4770 3.47GHz processor, 16GB 1600MHz CL9 DDR3-RAM and MATLAB 2012b computational environment. Hence our proposed system is fast.

The proposed method can be extended for the detection of other eye diseases like DR and glaucoma.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Regular eye screening will help to diagnose dry AMD and may avoid the loss of vision in old aged subjects. In this work, an automated dry AMD screening system using fundus images is proposed. The non-linear features extracted using HOS and Gabor wavelet are able to identify the abrupt changes in the normal and dry AMD images. The proposed system achieved an average accuracy of more than 90% and the SD of 5% consistently (in all 10-folds) using SVM classifier for all three datasets namely private, ARIA and STARE. Moreover, the testing time of the proposed system is less, hence this system can be used as an adjunct tool for mass screening of eye to diagnose dry AMD cases.
