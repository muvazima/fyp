                  The fresh fruit supply chain is characterized by long supply lead times combined with significant supply and demand uncertainties, and relatively thin margins. These challenges generate a need for management efficiency and the use of modern decision technology tools. We review some of the literature on operational research models applied to the fresh fruit supply chain. It is an attempt to gain a better understanding of the OR methods used in the revised papers apparently independent and oriented towards problem solving rather than theory developing. We conclude by outlining what we see as some of the significant new problems facing the industry like the lack of holistic approaches for the design and management of fresh FSC. Finally, some future research directions are indicated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the recent years the fresh fruit sector has grown significantly fueled by an increasing demand of customers concerned in healthier diets, food quality requirements and all year around availability of fruit (Reynolds, Buckley, Weinstein, & Boland, 2014). Fresh fruit is defined by the Food Agricultural Organization's (FAO, 2014) as: the portion of a plant housing seeds commonly eaten as dessert (i.e. tomatoes are considered vegetable). The previous definition is important for this review to avoid the inconsistencies in segmenting fruits, flowers and vegetables reported by Shukla and Jharkharia (2013). Fresh fruits are consumed raw, whether whole or prepared. Prepared refers to minimally processed such as peeling, slicing or shredding, having not undergone any treatment (chemical, physical or biological) to ensure preservation other than chilling. According to FAOStat (2012) the fresh fruit production has been increasing worldwide by 20 percent between 2003 and 2012. It is observed a notable trading activity during the same period, doubling the overall imports, being the European Union (EU) who dominates the import/export market. Other aspects affecting such development are the industrialization of the production process, governmental food safety regulations and price variability. The industrialization refers to the use of mechanical means, the adoption of good agricultural practices and the automatization of sorting, selecting and packaging fruits including sometimes some minor minimal processing tasks. As a consequence of the globalization, competitors, regulations and the increasing demand for high quality, value-added and customized products, the fresh fruit sector tends to be specialized and integrated vertically in Fruit Supply Chains (FSC) to become more competitive and dynamic. The fast handling and seasonable attributes of fruits in relation to high volatility of supply and demand make the storage a critical activity to manage robust FSC. In addition, fresh fruits' quality is related with parameters like sweetness, crunchiness and strength, connected in some way with the optimal ripeness of the fruit. Hence, special considerations to preserve freshness and product quality require more limited delivery deadlines, more controlled storage conditions, better quality of end-products and minimize losses due to deterioration (Dabbene, Gay, & Sacco, 2008; Verdouw, Beulens, Trienekens, & Wolfert, 2010), making the underlying supply chain more complex and harder to manage than other supply chains (Ahumada & Villalobos, 2009). These challenges generate a need for management efficiency and the use of modern decision technology tools (Akkerman, Farahani, & Grunow, 2010; Lowe & Preckel, 2004). As FSC comprise all the activities to procure, produce and distribute fruits to the end customers, production, transport and distribution planning needs to be integrated in order to be optimized simultaneously (Shen, 2007; Mula, Peidro, Díaz-Madroñero, & Vicens, 2010).

The present review aims at determining current state of the art in operational research models applied to the fresh FSC in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the mathematical modeling methods used in these applications. Future trends are pointed out to provide a basis for future research. Hence, we intend to do that by (1) reviewing the literature on planning models for fresh FSC, (2) classifying the literature by different criteria (3) considering other planning models of interest to fresh FSC and (4) outlining the fresh FSC perspectives in the future. To achieve this, we did an extensive research of scientific papers including optimization or operational research (OR) models for fresh fruit regardless the modeling approach and covering all or part of the FSC.
                  

In view of the proposed classification of the literature done by Mula et al. (2010) and Ahumada and Villalobos (2009), a synthesis of both has been performed including additional criteria used to organize and present this review. In this sense, as shown in Fig. 1, we have proposed different taxonomies to classify the revised papers and giving a multidimensional approach of each one. So that, the proposed taxonomy in this paper considers the following six classification criteria:


                        Decision level: Regarding the scope of decisions there are three levels: strategic, tactical or operational corresponding to long, medium and short time horizon respectively. Ahumada and Villalobos (2009) identified activities such as financial planning and network design as strategic; the harvest planning, crop selection and scheduling and labor as tactical; and activities such as production scheduling, transportation planning and storage as operational. Such a classification might become a bit difficult when dealing with activities moving between strategic and tactical decisions, or between tactical and operational (Shukla & Jharkharia, 2013; Farahani, Rezapour, Drezner, & Fallah, 2014).


                        Analytical modeling approach: Considering the mathematical methods or mathematical relationships used to model and solve the problem within the context of fresh FSC.


                        Purpose: Models are classified based on the type of decision variables related to different activities: sowing, production, harvesting, distribution or inventory. The nature of the objective function (revenue, profit, cost or other function) to optimize (maximize or minimize) and whether the objective involves one or more criteria are also revised.


                        Practical application: The existence of a real problem inspiring the paper or a case study is important to value the applicability and interest of the model beyond the theoretical approach. Furthermore, we register other relevant information such as the type of fruit and the country of origin where the case study was developed.


                        Novelty
                        
                           :
                         This aspect is interesting to highlight the author's contribution and originality of the paper to the fresh FSC with respect to contemporary literature, i.e. at the moment the revised paper has been published.


                        Research segmentation by journal
                        
                           :
                         The scope of the journals where revised papers are published may be useful to understand the motivation of the research and the multidisciplinary approach.

Works done in non-perishable, processed and long shelf life fruit like canned, dried or transformed in juice or wine overlapping part of the fresh FSC have been discussed apart in this review. The decisional problems regarding fresh FSC for canning or processing plants or wineries are similar to human consumption of fresh fruit as all of them are consumers.

A comprehensive search of related research papers from last decades was applied to produce a synthesis of peer-reviewed literature. We searched papers published in international peer-reviewed journals or books from the main electronic bibliographical sources (Scopus, Web of Science) using different keywords. We have used the following keywords to do the search: “Fresh fruit” and “Supply chain” and “Optimisation” or “Operational Research” or “Operations Research”. The outcome depended on which fields are performed on the search. For instance, only 9 papers were found in Scopus searching the proposed keywords within the Title, Abstract or Keyword's list of the paper. However, 127 were found if the keywords appeared in whatever part of a paper. This keywords' set was difficult to be fixed because always there were listed many irrelevant papers. In the end, an individual paper by paper examination was necessary to make a final decision. Other keywords like “harvesting” or “scheduling” or “management” were also used to catch susceptible papers of being included. From the collected material, we filtered the papers according to the following rules: (i) the papers should be written in English language, (ii) they include decision variables modeling the production planning or logistics of fresh FSC, (iii) the papers satisfying the previous rule but dealing with other perishable agricultural product like vegetables instead of fruit were also selected but processed apart. From the second rule, we included some articles dealing with the production planning of fresh fruit regardless they are not for fresh consumption. This is the case, for example, in the paper by Ferrer, MacCawley, Maturana, Toloza, and Vera (2007), in which the authors present a scheduling model for grape harvesting for wine production. The third rule enabled us to consider several papers in the field of perishable products. Double checking with keywords in the Title, Abstract or Keyword's list was done arising few references more. We use back-tracking to find earlier relevant sources (e.g. Willis & Halon, 1976), and forward-tracking in Web of Science to find literature that are referring to the central sources. We also looked for recent surveys in related domains in order to find additional sources excluding conference papers.

We can classify the revised papers in two categories. The first category gathers papers dealing with Fresh FSC or one fruit or family of fruits. In these papers, fruit is not processed, just packaged and delivered to retailers for marketing. The second category regroups papers either sharing or overlapping part of the FSC, or in neighboring domains or perishable products with similar problems to the FSC (e.g. vegetables). Examples of that would be Munhoz and Morabito (2001) who illustrate problems related with the processing of juicy fruits, or Ahumada and Villalobos, 2011a, 2011b) who show similar problems in the tomato industry.

The organization of this paper is as follows: in the next section we introduce some background about the fresh FSC, decision levels and some examples. In Section 3 we present supply chain models that have been developed for fresh fruit, and we classify them according to the different criteria presented in Fig. 1. Later on, in Section 4, we present some related models to fresh FSCs and in Section 5 we outline a view of OR in FSCs. In the last section we provide a summary of the review and conclusions.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

It is only during the last 10 years that the agri-food industry in general and the fresh fruit sector in particular have recognized and started embracing SCM as a key concept for its competitiveness (Lucas & Chajed, 2004; Tsolakis, Keramydas, Toka, Aidonis, & Iakovou, 2014). Ahumada and Villalobos (2009) performed one of the first reviews about planning models in agricultural supply chains (ASC); however the lack of holistic proposals to ASC was evident. Their revision included papers since 1985 focusing on different agricultural products, perishable and non-perishable, mostly vegetables. Other SCs related to livestock production such as cattle, pig, milk or meats were not included. Even though, given the broad spectrum of products FSC had a limited coverage. Audsley and Sandars (2009) revised also OR models in agriculture but limiting the review to British developments. This revision did not include the perspective of FSC, but gave interesting arguments to explain observed shortcomings when approaching the modeling of the agricultural sector in the past. More recently, Zhang and Wilhelm (2011) presented an interesting revision of OR models in specialty crops industry covering fruits, vegetable, grapes and wine, ornamentals, tree nuts, berries and dried fruits. However, they included products out of the scope of this review according to the FAO's definition of fresh fruit and the SC perspective was lacking too.

On the other hand, Shukla and Jharkharia (2013) summarized the existing literature from 1991 to 2011 in fresh production such as fruits, flowers and vegetables. The main characteristic of the review is that all papers were focused on perishable, deteriorate, edible, and fresh production. They also categorize literature by geographic region and journal, but do not emphasize the decision problems nor OR methods.

Focusing more on supply chain characteristics, Farahani et al. (2014) presented examples of the typical decisions taken in general SCs, while Tsolakis et al. (2014) presented the kind of decisions in agricultural SCs. These decisions are divided into strategic, tactical and operational, linked to a temporary horizon. Hence, operational decisions are more related to pricing and demand; tactical decisions are related to mid-term contracts in purchasing, transportation, IT and facilities; and strategic decisions are related to the long term assets, operations and company's vision and mission.

The fresh fruit sector is competitive and dynamic, with many uncertainties related to fruit biology, diseases, climate and market, plus added logistical complexities. A newly planted fruit tree takes years to start producing fruits and the strategic decision of planting must be made before demand and selling prices are known (Zhang & Wilhem, 2011). Therefore, operational and tactical decisions need to be taken more accurately and permitting tactical adjustments rapidly. In this context, flexible decision support and models play an important role to help managers through the entire FSC which are in continuous change because of the different sources of uncertainty to cope with. The structure of the FSC is not static but it can be diverse regarding the number of agents taking part in the different activities involved ranging from farming (i.e. land cultivation, fruit production and harvesting), processing, packaging, warehousing, transportation and distribution to marketing. Changes in the industrialization of activities, stakeholders, uncertainty in production, legal regulations and new trends in markets and demand make this sector being more unforeseen than others whose SC designs have been consolidated and used for years (Huang, 2004). Because of the wide variety of FSCs structures, Verdouw et al. (2010) presented a basic model with templates for the design of fresh and processed FSCs in a deep detail. Nadal-Roig and Plà (2015) formulated a transportation planning model for a FSC in which a fruit logistic center was supplied of fruit by different storing centers on demand during the non-harvesting season. The general structure of the FSC described by Nadal-Roig and Plà (2015) is common in modern FSCs, although the actors taking part may vary. Therefore, as problems and needs in terms of modeling can be different, slight variations in the structure can be found in literature. For instance, Canavari, Centonze, Hingley, and Spadoni (2010), emphasized the role of producers and considered three different FSCs (1) where a producer sends the fruit to a small retailer who selects their suppliers on the basis of the price, (2) where a producer sends the fruit to large retailers and (3) called “ho.re.ca” by the authors where the producer sends the fruit to driving actors such as hotels, restaurants and catering companies. Similarly, Srimanee and Routray (2012) modeled the FSCs in Thailand as a network of five different FSCs linked by the producer who established a percentage of production according to the final consumer (local market, local collectors, cooperatives, assemblers and export agents). A different approach was presented by Zang and Fu (2010) who presented four different FSCs designs existing in China (worldwide 1st fruit producer) with different characteristics, stakeholders and limitations. All the revised FSCs had different emphasis in some part of the design or in one or several components, therefore there are some specificities not shared between them.

A summarized overview of the 28 revised papers is presented in Table 1
                      including a brief description and the goals to achieve for each one.

The classification of the revised papers according to the decision level is presented in Table 2
                     . As it is shown, there are six papers dealing with strategic decisions, 19 related to tactical decisions and also 14 at the operational level. While 15 papers are devoted to one specific decision level, there are 12 papers that combine decisions at different levels like strategic-tactical or tactical-operational. Most of the strategic decisions consider the optimal mix of varieties to plant and how to replace them over time. These studies were presented as an analysis of the investment project in fruit production.

There is a variety of mathematical approaches used to model and solve decision problems related to revised fresh FSC. Table 3
                         displays the acronyms and corresponding meaning of the different mathematical modeling approaches considered for this review.


                        Table 4
                         is composed using the acronyms introduced in Table 3. As shown in Table 4, most of the papers preferred linear programming as modeling technique. From 28 papers, 16 are included in this category being the larger. This is due to the ability of ILP to model and solve real-life instances. The rest of papers used other methodologies less popular with three, two or one representatives. Also, most papers employed just one method and it was strange to find more than one method in a paper. Only, eight papers combined different methodologies either to compare them (Vitoriano, Ortuño, Recio, Rubio, & Ayuso, 2003) or as an alternative to an unsuitable first approach to the problem (Arnaout & Maatoukw, 2010; Bohle et al., 2010; Ferrer et al., 2007) or just to refine and complement first approaches (Broekmeulen,1998; Hester & Cacho, 2003; Bai, Burke, & Kendall, 2008). Special mention deserves the hybrid approach of Lambert et al. (2014), who developed an expert system for predicting orchard yield and fruit quality of Persian lime making use of fuzzy logic. Later on they develop a simulation model to see the impact on the Persian lime supply chain.

Depending on the FSC different production processes may be involved. In this section we pay attention to the coverage of the different stages involved in the proposed PSC models. The decision variables are taken into account to verify the stages considered along the production process of the PSC. For such purpose, we identified four types of decision variables related to: Planting (i.e. decisions on fruit and variety), Production (i.e. decisions on production planning and scheduling), Harvesting (i.e. decisions on harvesting means and season), Distribution (i.e. decisions on transport) and Inventory (i.e. decision variables associated with the inventories in different storing places and systems). As shown in Table 5
                        
                        , revised papers considered in decreasing order decision variables associated to production, distribution and harvesting, respectively. Regarding the variables associated with inventory and sowing, the number of studies is lesser. However, 17 of the papers presented a combination of decision variables, and only 11 papers focus on optimizing a single production stage.

Regarding the coverage of the fruit supply chain, there are two remarkable papers: Masini, Blanco, Petracci, and Bandoni (2007) and Cittadini, Lubbers, Ridder, Van Keulen, and Claassen (2008). The former integrated production, inventory and distribution decisions. The latter considered decisions regarding growing, harvesting and production.

The objective function in most of the papers consisted in maximize the profit, net revenue or net present value. Fewer papers considered the minimization of costs (Starbird, 1988; Yu, Wang, & Liang, 2012; Velychko, 2014, González-Araya, Soto-Silva, & Acosta, 2015). However, when calculating the income almost all the papers used constant prices ignoring variations over time in the market. This procedure is useful to compare different alternatives in the long term, but may reduce the applicability in the short or medium term. Only Broekmeulen (1998) simulated different scenarios of prices to test his model.

Although there were three papers emphasizing modeling or resolution aspects by using numerical examples, all the rest were either based on real cases or case studies. Even though, not all of them were applied in a later stage. An important aspect for practical applications is the availability of real data and the collaboration with the sector. It is important to disclose whether the modeling approach presented in the revised papers relies on practical or theoretical data. Besides the practical applicability, Table 6 displays also the type of fruit and the country where the project is developed.

Only five papers (see Table 6) included a case study based on existing databases to test the proper operation of corresponding proposed model (Broekmeulen, 1998; Gigler, Hendrix, Heesen, van den Hazelkamp, & Meerdink, 2002; Van Der Vorst et al., 2014; Amorim, Gunther, & Almada-Lobo, 2012; Lambert et al., 2014). The rest of the papers just described the application to real cases.

The novelty associated with each of the papers is presented in Table 7
                         that illustrates roughly how the interest of the fruit industry has been evolving over time.

Research projects dealing with decisional problems in fresh fruit supply chains produce papers usually published in OR journals. Then, the fruit characteristics may not be of much concern as the main objective of OR journals rely on the method excellence. On the other hand, there is very less interest in Agricultural journals to address decision making issues as only four papers where published in such journals. In such scenario, the chances of theory development, specifically for fresh FSC had been very less (Shukla & Jharkharia, 2013).

On the other hand, if we pay attention to the year of publication, clearly, the interest in fresh FSC is rather recent. There are a scarce number of references, but most of them have been published this century and more than a half in less than 10 years ago. However, the increment in references is expected to increase even more in the following years by two main reasons: changes in the diet leading to a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables (Reynolds et al., 2014) and the increasing competition of the sector pointing to OR methods as a way to cope the uncertainties of flexible FSC (Van der Vorst et al., 2014;
Plà, Sandars, & Higgins, 2014).

Major characteristics of other OR models related to fresh FSC are listed and presented in Table 8
                     . The final product of the SCs considered in this section is not a fresh fruit. These papers are devoted to processed fruits (12 papers) or vegetables (six papers), two of them covering both products at a time. Most of these models are concerned in good quality management and product freshness to get optimal products. Processed fruits differ from fresh fruits in the last stage of the chain, but they share the production, harvesting, storing and transportation of the raw material.

Among the 16 papers listed in Table 8, 14 were focused on tactical and/or operational decisions and only two analyzed strategic issues. Regarding the decision variables, only 11 papers analyzed production or production plus another process while seven included decisions on distribution and five in harvesting. A few papers considered the whole FSC but most of them included the producers or processing plants. Only Teimoury, Nedaei, Ansari, and Sabbaghi (2013) focused on the last stage of the chain: distribution at national level to support agricultural policy decisions, aiming to analyze the interactions of price, demand and supply, for applying the best import quota policy. With respect to mathematical methods (coded according to Table 3), pure or mixed linear programming models are the most common followed by stochastic programming models. Other methodologies were multi-objective linear programming and simulation. Finally the studies presented were developed mainly in USA and Brazil, being the rest testimonials of other countries. The products concerned were orange juice, grape for wine, tomato, canned pineapple, peppers, and banana.


                     Cholette (2007) formulated a mixed ILP model to help match transports between wineries and distributors. Parthanadee and Buddhakulsomsiri (2010) developed a simulation model to solve a real scheduling problem. They model the system accounting for dimensions shared by many fresh FSC like uncertainty in raw material, multiple types of finished products and the share of the same resources. However, they fit the model for the canned pineapple industry, a final product that does not correspond to a fresh fruit product. The paper of Rong, Akkerman, and Grunow (2011) focused on the management of fresh food quality modeling quality degradation. The authors gave a general approach to fresh food and the problem of preserving the quality as happens with fresh fruit, but they select bell peppers as illustrative case study. Tan and Çömden (2012) made an important contribution to show the benefit of considering uncertainties when planning production of annual plants. In particular they consider random demand and supply (yield risk).

Six papers composed two series of three papers each of the same authors devoted to a particular crop. Ahumada and Villalobos (2011a, 2011b) and Ahumada et al. (2012) focused on tomatoes and Munhoz and Morabito (2001, 2010, 2013, 2014) on orange juice production. It is important to highlight the contribution of Ahumada and Villalobos (2011a, 2011b) and Ahumada et al. (2012) who formulated an operational planning, a tactical planning, and a robust tactical planning model for tomato ranging from cultivation to production and distribution. They accounted for variations in cultivation and productivity rates. Munhoz and Morabito (2001, 2010, 2013, 2014) intended to optimize the orange supply chain, taking oranges as raw material for producing different juice related products. The first paper analyzed the operational planning, the second one presented a model of aggregated production planning, and the third and fourth ones presented a robust optimization of an aggregated planning, giving robustness indices of fruit ripening. In these investigations the harvesting of oranges with a prestated maturity degree was of great importance for the production of juice. A good conversion of oranges into juice is related to a good quality of the fruit which depends on the control of optimal maturation indices.

Along the revision process, we had found papers dealing with other agricultural supply chains (ASC) out of the scope of the present review. However, we judged the interest of papers including optimization models of other perishable or fresh food supply chains where the modeling technique, the relevance or the meaningfulness in the context of our review is easily transferable to the fresh FSC industry. For instance, a similar SC to fresh FSC is that related with floriculture as it deals with a cultivated and perishable product. For example, Caixeta-Filho, van Swaay-Neto, and de Padua Wagemaker (2002), Rantala (2004) and Widodo, Nagasawa, Morizawa, and Ota (2006) are papers interested in the optimization of the supply chain management of flowers. Thus, they considered harvesting, distribution and inventory management. The agricultural nature and the perishable aspect of flowers are common traits also present in fresh fruits. Furthermore, preserving the quality and durability of these products till the moment they are purchased by the final costumer is also of interest for SC managers.

Other papers dealing with different agricultural supply chains sharing similar characteristics with fresh fruits are presented in Table 9
                     . Hsiao, Kemp, van der Vost, and Omta (2010) explored outsourcing to reduce logistic costs of SC, but they found that the relationship between levels of outsourcing, performance and supply chain characteristics is complex. Cai and Zhou (2014) and Agustina, Lee, and Piplani (2014) considered the transport of food products while Tsao (2013) focused on non-linear optimization applied to fresh food supply chain design. Ketzenberg, Bloemhof, and Gaukler (2015) considered the management of sustainable food supply chain and transport alternatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

There are reviews more focused on a product like Moccia (2013) who presented a survey of researches related to OR methods in the industrial part of wine production, because of that he also included several modeling on grape production but always linked with the final interest of his review in wines.

New models and tools for improving farming, harvesting and production plans along the FSC are required because the intrinsic characteristics of fresh fruits industry have not yet been handled properly (Soysal, Bloemhof-Ruwaard, Meuwissen, & van der Vorst, 2012). The SC in the agri-food industry in general and in the fresh fruit sector in particular is characterized by long supply lead times combined with significant supply and demand uncertainties, and relatively thin margins. According to Lowe and Preckel (2004), these challenges generate a need for management efficiency and the use of modern decision technology tools. Moreover, fresh FSC requires a new generation of decision models in which new variables like quality deterioration or wastage should be integrated (Rong et al., 2011; Ketzenberg et al., 2015) and new decisions like outsourcing activities be considered (Hsiao et al., 2010). Most of the perspectives of OR in FSC management were pointed out for ASC by Plà, et al. (2014) and are also valid for fresh FSC. Hence, operational research in large FSC can make important new contributions at middle management levels to: optimization of production planning; scheduling; and logistics across a large integrated industry, and the optimal exploitation of an increasingly sophisticated business environment. Specifically, for developing competitive and sustainable FSC, a number of critical issues need to be tackled in order to create added value for all the involved stakeholders with respect to: (i) the definition of key performance indicators of the unique characteristics of fresh FSC that differentiate them from traditional SC networks, (ii) the decisions that should be made on the strategic, operational and tactical levels under different dimensions, e.g. efficiency, quality, safety, etc., (iii) the policies which are required to ensure traceability and sustainability of the fresh FSC, (iv) the appropriate innovative interventions to foster radical advances and competitiveness within the changing FSC context (Tsolakis et al., 2014), and (v) the promotion of consumer culture to manage risk and dissemination of standards across FSC actors (Manzini & Accorsi, 2013).

Because of product proliferation, fresh FSC face significant inventory and fruit-variety management challenges (Lowe & Preckel, 2004). The increasing scale and integration of supply and demand chains creates a need for optimization across a number of previously autonomous businesses, which may be operating in different regulatory environments. However, there is a lack of holistic approaches for the design and management of ASCs. This research gap is even more evident in the case of perishable goods and fresh FSC. The growing scale of the fruit industry together with increasing opportunities or responsibilities for traceable, environmental, and ethical goods means that primary producer decisions form part of overall decision making. A development in this field is the emergence of modeling frameworks that include existing and accepted decision models, such as optimal harvest scheduling and logistical discrete-event simulation, and optimal process scheduling enhancing the scalability of developed models (Higgins, Thorburn, Archer, & Jakku, 2007; Shukla & Jharkharia, 2013).

Regulation, social responsibility and consumer values create a more complex business planning environment. There are new dimensions contributing to differentiate new products like Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or production of organic fruit very limited at present. Specific data relating to the extent of organic fruits or on-farm processing of fruit for sale to consumers through catering or retail establishments is currently unavailable. However, a few models that are found in the literature address these challenges roughly as Ahumada and Villalobos (2009) mentioned. Another remarkable trend is the convergence of sustainability and supply and demand chains, emphasizing the growing importance of environmental issues when managing an entire supply chain involving consumers, production, customer service, and traceability (Linton, Klassen, & Jayaraman, 2007). Sustainability is controversial since international trade can now be economically achieved for a large number of fresh fruits raising green-house gas emissions and waste management issues. At the same time, increasing global competition creates pressure for lower prices. So, efficient management of the transportation, distribution, and inventory management of fresh fruit, is essential for profitability and provides additional research opportunities. But Soysal et al. (2012) claimed for taking from practice specific sustainable requirements into consideration to support business decisions and capture fresh FSC dynamics. Hence, research efforts should focus more on the configuration of sustainable fresh FSC networks (Tsolakis et al., 2014; Eskandarpour, Dejax, Miemczyk, & Péton, 2015).

Climate adaptation and food security are two major research frontiers for the OR community but with a limited impact on fruit production at the moment (Valin et al., 2014). There are issues with changes in water availability and its seasonal variability, extreme weather events, viability of processing infrastructure in the case of reduced production, changes in crop maturity and time windows of harvest and competition with other land uses. Just considering the water availability aspects, Haddad and Shahwan (2012) show an optimization modeling approach to agricultural production under financial risk of water constraint. However, the number of variables affecting fresh FSC operation is high and most relying on variable and/or uncertain events like weather, natural disasters (flooding, hailing, frost, and drought), raining or water availability, crop production, quality, market price, demand, etc (Valin et al., 2014). To this respect, uncertainty and risk should also be better considered in FSC.

New information technologies (precision agriculture, global-positioning-system, etc.) in conjunction with inexpensive computers and sensor technology should allow FSC managers to monitor yields and so develop detailed and more precise production plans. As result, the coordination between different stages can be strengthened raising the efficiency of the entire FSC. There is a challenge with the development of integrated planning models capable of capturing data or updating parameters from such information systems and permitting an easy adoption by managers (Gunasekaran & Ngai, 2004; Lehmann, Reiche, & Schiefer, 2012).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we have revised operational research models to solve decision problems related to fresh FSCs. It is an attempt to gain a better understanding of the OR methods used in the revised papers apparently independent and oriented towards problem solving rather than theory developing. Although there are some reviews done by previous researchers regarding ASCs, there is no review focused on fresh FSCs. We have stated the rapid growth and technification of the sector in the last years to satisfy the increasing demand, regulations and competiveness present in the sector. As a consequence, the number of papers published in this last years has been growing. Despite this, a few papers are focused on SCs structures and there is a lack of holistic approaches for the design and management of fresh FSC.

Among the papers revised, most of them were focused on tactical and operational decisions and less considered strategic decisions. In particular, the problems attracting more attention were transport, routing, planning and allocation problems involving the production and distribution stages. Regarding modeling techniques and mathematical methods, linear programming, integer or mixed integer are the most dominant methods. Other techniques are not so used and it is a consequence of the novelty of the proposals or the solvers available. Although the common objective of the papers were the maximization of the benefit, only cost function was described in detail and income was calculated from averaged prices considering roughly uncertainty in sale prices over time. Most of the papers were based in real cases and became real applications tailored to particularities of specific fresh FSCs.

Finally, we also extend and reinforce the work done by previous authors in regard to the perspective of OR in agri-fruit industry pointing out new opportunities, for instance, the challenge of dealing with organic fruit production, or proposing sustainable fresh FSCs, climate adaptation, food security and seasonability's issues, and at methodological level, the integration of complementary methods such as optimization and simulation, or changing the perspective from a monocriterion to a multicriteria approach related to multi-echelon FSC.
