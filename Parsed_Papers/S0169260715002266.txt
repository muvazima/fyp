                  Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring type of cancer among women, and it is the major cause of female cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its incidence is increasing in developed as well as developing countries. Efficient strategies to reduce the high death rates due to breast cancer include early detection and tumor removal in the initial stages of the disease. Clinical and mammographic examinations are considered the best methods for detecting the early signs of breast cancer; however, these techniques are highly dependent on breast characteristics, equipment quality, and physician experience. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems have been developed to improve the accuracy of mammographic diagnosis; usually such systems may involve three steps: (i) segmentation; (ii) parameter extraction and selection of the segmented lesions and (iii) lesions classification. Literature considers the first step as the most important of them, as it has a direct impact on the lesions characteristics that will be used in the further steps. In this study, the original contribution is a microcalcification segmentation method based on the geodesic active contours (GAC) technique associated with anisotropic texture filtering as well as the radiologists’ knowledge. Radiologists actively participate on the final step of the method, selecting the final segmentation that allows elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis with the segmented microcalcifications presented in a region of interest (ROI). The proposed method was assessed by employing 1000 ROIs extracted from images of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). For the selected ROIs, the rate of adequately segmented microcalcifications to establish a diagnosis hypothesis was at least 86.9%, according to the radiologists. The quantitative test, based on the area overlap measure (AOM), yielded a mean of 0.52±0.20 for the segmented images, when all 2136 segmented microcalcifications were considered. Moreover, a statistical difference was observed between the AOM values for large and small microcalcifications. The proposed method had better or similar performance as compared to literature for microcalcifications with maximum diameters larger than 460μm. For smaller microcalcifications the performance was limited.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cancer is the name given to a group of more than 100 diseases, whose common characteristic is the uncontrolled growth of cells that can potentially invade other tissues and organs in the body, and its main types are lung, prostate, cervical, breast and skin cancers [1]. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring type of cancer among women, and it is the major cause of female cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its incidence is increasing in developed as well as developing countries, and it accounts for around 22% of new cancer cases that are reported each year [2]. Breast cancer is also one of the leading causes of female deaths in Brazil. INCA predicted the occurrence of 57,120 new cases of this disease in 2014 [3]. Although breast cancer is more common in women, it can also occur in men. According to INCA, in 2010, breast cancer was responsible for 147 male deaths, corresponding to 1.14% of the total deaths (12,852) due to breast cancer in Brazil [2].

In Brazil, death rates related to breast cancer are high, mainly because of late diagnosis, i.e., when the disease is already in an advanced stage [2]. Efficient strategies to reduce such high death rates include early detection and tumor removal in the initial stages of the disease. Clinical and mammographic examinations are considered the best methods for detecting the early signs of breast cancer; the objective of the latter is to identify non-palpable breast lesions [4].

Nevertheless, several factors, such as physician knowledge and experience, equipment quality, and the presence of adipose and glandular tissues, may affect the diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer screening. Even if the mammographic procedure is carried out by an experienced technician using adequate equipment, the final mammography quality is highly dependent on the breast tissue itself; the more the adipose, the easier is the analysis and diagnosis [5]. Furthermore, the sensitivity of mammography is very low for patients younger than 40 years, because they have highly dense parenchyma, and for patients older than 70 years owing to the composition of the breast tissue beyond this age [6].

In routine mammography, microcalcifications are considered as significant signs of the existence of malignant lesions, as they occur in most breast cancer cases. Microcalcifications are small granular deposits of calcium that appear in a mammogram as small bright dots. Microcalcification detection is often difficult, requiring a radiologist to carefully examine the mammogram; the microcalcifications may be hidden, especially in dense tissues [7].

Despite their frequent occurrence in mammograms, only 30–50% of microcalcifications in breast carcinoma are detected via mammographic examination, whereas 60–80% are detected via histological examination [7]. The difficulty in detecting microcalcifications in mammograms is due to their variation in shape (from granular to rod shapes), orientation, brightness, and diameter, as well as the density of the surrounding tissue [8].

In an effort to facilitate microcalcification detection and diagnosis, computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems have been developed [9,10]. Such systems can minimize the false-positive and false-negative rates in breast cancer diagnosis, and they are usually based on parameters extracted from microcalcifications; for example: mean microcalcification area, mean microcalcification orientation, compactness, roughness, number of microcalcifications in a cluster [11,12].

CADe systems allow automatic detection of lesions (including microcalcifications), whereas CADx systems are employed for classification of lesions; in general, the latter are used to provide a second opinion, thereby increasing the accuracy of a radiologist's final diagnosis [9,10,13–16]. CADx systems basically involve three steps [17,18]: (i) segmentation, (ii) parameter extraction and selection of the segmented microcalcifications and their clusters, and (iii) lesion classification. Although improvements to any of the individual steps could enhance the performance of the entire system, the segmentation step is considered to be the most important step [17–19], because it defines the characteristics of the microcalcifications to be used in the following CADx steps.

Several techniques have been adopted for segmenting microcalcifications, such as active contours [18,20–22], gray-level histogram features associated with fuzzy rule-based classifiers, methods based on image entropy [23], wavelet analysis [14,24,25], and morphological filters [7,26]. More recently, researches pointed out the importance of some microcalcifications segmentation techniques with good results for this task. These researches are mainly based on active contours [17], wavelet analyses [27] and mathematical morphology [28].

Arikidis et al. [17] presented a multiscale active contours method to segment microcalcifications in mammographic exams, which also employs radiologists’ intervention for manually defining a seed point to initialize the method. A ROI was defined as a square of 81×81 pixels, centered at the seed point. The authors assessed the results by comparing the obtained segmentation areas with the ones manually defined by a radiologist, and pointed out a mean value of area overlap measure of 0.61±0.15.

Batchelder et al. [27] used the 2D wavelet transform modulus maxima method (WTMM) to detect microcalcifications in human breast tissue in mammograms and to characterize the fractal geometry of benign and malignant microcalcification clusters. They estimated a 3D fractal structure of a breast lesion by pairing the information from two separate 2D projected mammographic views of the same breast (cranial–caudal (CC) and mediolateral-oblique (MLO) views) and defined the “CC-MLO fractal dimension plot”, where a “fractal zone” and “Euclidean zones” (non-fractal) were defined. The authors analyzed 118 images from 59 patients (25 malignant and 34 benign) obtained from a digital databank of mammograms with known radiologist diagnostics and determined which cases would be plotted in the fractal zone and which cases would fall in the Euclidean zones. From their results, a Bayesian statistical analysis showed (with 95% credibility) that the probability that fractal breast lesions are malignant is between 74% and 98% and the probability that Euclidean breast lesions are benign is between 76% and 96%.

In a previous study, we presented a semi-automatic segmentation method based on mathematical morphology (MM) and Otsu's method [28]. The method was applied to 1000 ROIs from images provided by the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). Morphological operators were applied to enhance the image contrast between microcalcifications and background, while Otsu's Method automatically selected the best gray-level threshold to segment microcalcifications in a ROI. As a post-processing stage, a set of morphological filters was applied to fill up any small flaw in the segmented microcalcifications. Finally, two experienced radiologists (R1 and R2) independently choose, among three possibilities, the segmentation image considered as the best to elaborate a diagnosis hypothesis. In this qualitative evaluation the method proposed in [28] adequately segmented 97.8% (R1) and 97.3% (R2) of the microcalcifications presented in the 1000 ROIs with regard to the possibility of establishing a diagnosis from exactly the same ROIs. In a quantitative evaluation, the mean value of the area overlap measure was 0.64±0.14, considering as gold standard to compare with the area of the segmented microcalcifications, the manually delineated microcalcifications made by the most experienced radiologist (R1: more than 30 years of radiology practice).

Also using the same database, but with only cranial–caudal images, Moradmand et al. [29] applied morphological operators and wavelet transformation to enhance the mammography images, before investigating two semi-automatic methods of microcalcifications segmentation: adaptive threshold and watershed segmentation. Although the authors did not present a quantitative result in their work, they conclude that watershed segmentation is more accurate than adaptive threshold, but is more time consuming and claim that the whole system introduces an improvement in the breast cancer detection.

The geodesic active contours technique has been used to segment satellite images [30], nodules in ultrasound images [31] and for detection and tracking of moving objects [32], for example. The present work proposes, for the first time, the application of the geodesic active contours (GAC) technique in segmenting microcalcifications, evaluates its performance and compares with other works presented in literature. Moreover, the GAC is associated with anisotropic texture filtering as well as the radiologists’ knowledge. The proposed method was assessed using 1000 regions of interest (ROIs); they were extracted from images of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) [33]. Herein, the radiologists’ knowledge is incorporated as the final stage of the method. Their task is to evaluate the possibility of establishing a diagnosis hypothesis from the segmented images. The GAC method was evaluated qualitatively, based on the opinions of two radiologists with more than 30 years (R1) and 15 years (R2) of experience in breast radiology, and quantitatively by calculating the area overlap measure (AOM) based on the microcalcifications delineated by the more experienced radiologist, which were considered as the gold standard.

The GAC method aims to minimize the contour energy, given by [34]

                         represents the convolution between the original image I(x, y) and a Gaussian of standard deviation σ, which determines the smoothing that will be employed in I(x, y). The α parameter controls the contrast level over the edge used as a threshold for gradient evolution.

Some filters were used in this work to reduce the background noise and enhance the contrast of the analyzed images. The basic theory of these filters is described below.

The first filter applied to the original image is the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) filter, which aims to enhance image contrast. Such filtering is performed by applying the adaptive histogram equalization function, limited by contrast. This function limits the contrast in homogeneous regions of the image, while avoiding enhancement of the noise that may be present therein. Furthermore, it operates on small regions and equalizes each of them, instead of equalizing the image as a whole. Further details can be found elsewhere [35,36].

The alternating sequential filtering (ASF) technique makes use of morphological filters; it applies these filters alternately and iteratively to an image in order to reduce its background noise. The morphological operators commonly used in this procedure are the opening and closing operators, or the opening by reconstruction and closing by reconstruction operators. For example, one can proceed with some iterations by first applying the morphological opening operator, and then, the morphological closing operator, alternately. The structuring element (SE) may or may not be changed at each iteration [37]. The morphological closing operator can also be applied before the morphological opening operator. Because these two filters are not dual, they yield results that are somewhat different [37].

The Gabor filter [38] is a linear filter that is used for edge detection. In the spatial domain, a 2D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal or co-sinusoidal plane wave; it is defined by the frequency of this plane wave and by the direction of the Gaussian window spread [39].

Considering only the real part, with the Gaussian window spread equal in the x and y dimensions, one can use the following expression for Gabor filter implementation [31].

Eq. (7) favors high-contrast edges over low–contrast edges, while Eq. (8) favors larger regions over smaller regions in an image [40].

Owing to its characteristics, an ADF can be used to remove noise in a digital image without blurring the important elements of the image (the ADF only blurs the image background, making it more homogeneous). Accordingly, an ADF may be useful in edge detection methods [40].

The database used in our study comprised 158 mammograms obtained from 78 patients; they were extracted from three image sets of the DDSM database: benign_1, benign_2, and cancer_1. The images from cancer_1 and benign_1 have a resolution of 50μm/pixel, whereas benign_02 has a resolution of 43.5μm/pixel. Those different resolutions were taken into account across the whole analysis. As in the case of [11,26,41], the original images (300dpi), which were 12- or 16-bit images, were converted into 8-bit images in order to reduce the computation time. Moreover, 1000 ROIs from 20×20 pixels up to 41×41 pixels [20] were selected by the double reading procedure. First, an experienced radiologist selected the ROI, and then, another radiologist independently confirmed it. We decided to use all the microcalcifications in a ROI, provided that the size of ROI was no bigger than 41×41 pixels. This approach allowed checking the possibility of establishing a diagnosis hypothesis with the microcalcifications segmented by the proposed method. The ROIs selections were made using a program developed in MATLAB® (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA), specifically for this task, which allowed delimiting a rectangular area in the original image with the PC mouse. The same program warned if a ROI size was higher than 41×41 pixels. In such cases, the radiologist reselected the ROI, keeping them smaller or equal to this proposed maximum size. Thus, 500 ROIs were selected from images of the benign databases (793 microcalcifications), and another 500 were selected from images of the cancer database (1343 microcalcifications). Among the 1000 ROIs, the types of benign and malignant microcalcifications observed, according to DDSM, are presented in Table 1
                        . All the ROIs were selected from delimited regions already marked in the DDSM images [33]. Considering the mammography views, craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique, the one that best represent the microcalcifications was selected, and both views were considered in many cases.The microcalcifications were classified by their maximum diameters, following the criterion proposed by [17]. Thus, lesions (608 microcalcifications) with maximum diameters less than 460μm were classified as small lesions, whereas the remaining was classified as large lesions (1528 microcalcifications). An example of ROI extracted from a mammogram (Fig. 1a) with large benign microcalcifications is shown in Fig. 1b.

The segmentation procedure proposed herein was developed using MATLAB® (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA), and it was based on the method proposed in [31]. Originally, the GAC segmentation method had been used for segmenting nodules present in ultrasound breast images, but herein, this procedure was adapted to segment microcalcifications. The following paragraphs describe the proposed procedure and state the parameters for the different filters that are employed in parentheses. The flow chart shown in Fig. 2
                         illustrates the entire process, which has been already adapted to microcalcification segmentation.

In Fig. 2, one can observe two branches starting with CLAHE filter from the original ROI box. These two branches define the two important inputs to the GAC method: (a) the image, where the GAC gradients are determined, and (b) the initial contour that will be adapted based on the gradients. In order to determine the initial contour (Fig. 2b), the procedure involved two filters in a pre-processing step: CLAHE was applied to improve contrast (size of the regions to be equalized: 2 rows by 2 columns; contrast enhancement clipping factor: 0.1; distribution parameter: 0.1; distribution type: exponential) and the ASF was used to reduce background noise. The ASF consisted of alternating opening by reconstruction and closing by reconstruction operators (SE: disk; diameter: 2 pixels; number of iterations: 1). Next, a pre-segmentation procedure, which searches for the initial contour for the GAC method, was performed using morphological operators. First, it is necessary to identify an initialization point (seed point) within the object to be segmented in the original ROI, which is achieved with a single mouse click by a radiologist. Thus, a square, generated from the morphological dilation applied in the seed point position of the filtered image, was used as the mark image in the minima imposition procedure. This technique forces the existence of a regional minimum in the original image, in regions defined by a mark [37]. After minima imposition, the morphological opening and closing operators were applied to the image to further improve its contrast and reduce background noise. Finally, the watershed technique [37] was applied to determine the initial contour.

Considering the branch defined to the input image pre-segmentation procedure (Fig. 2a), CLAHE was used again to enhance image contrast (size of the regions to be equalized: 2 rows by 2 columns; contrast enhancement clipping factor: 0.1; distribution parameter: 0.1; distribution type: exponential). Then, the anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF) guided by texture descriptors derived from the Gabor filter (Gaussian window propagation parameter: 2; frequency: 0.05 rad/s) was applied to reduce noise without blurring the boundaries between homogeneous regions [34]. A two-dimensional network structure with eight neighboring nodes (control points) was used for conducting the diffusion (number of iterations: 50; integration constant: 1/7; border sensitivity constant: 2; diffusion coefficient: Eq. (8)).

Then, energy minimization of the object border was performed according to Eqs. (1)–(4) in order to identify the microcalcification contour (maximum number of iterations: 300; smoothing curvature parameter (SCP): 0.5, 1.25, and 2.0). As SCP is the main parameter that affects the GAC performance concerning structures of different sizes, three SCP values were adopted to segment microcalcifications with different sizes. Hence, three segmented images are generated, one for each value of SCP.

Tests were performed in 20 pre-selected ROIs containing microcalcifications of different size, shape, orientation, and brightness in order to define the parameters used in GAC method, which were modified in relation to their original values, as described in [31]. For each parameter, 21 values centered on the original value (at intervals of ±10%) were tested. The values that provided the best segmentation of the 20 tested ROIs were selected on the basis of the opinion of an experienced radiologist.

Finally, for each of the 1000 selected ROIs, a figure showing the original ROI along with three segmented images, generated by the application of the three before mentioned SCP values in the contour energy minimization step, was created; this figure contained the microcalcification contour candidates. At different moments, the figures were randomly and separately presented to each of the radiologists, one at a time. Among the three images segmented, the best option for elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis was to be selected by each radiologist. If a radiologist was not able to elaborate a hypothesis with any of the segmented images, then none of them was considered adequate. Note that the entire segmented ROI was considered for a radiologist to establish the diagnosis hypothesis, i.e., if the microcalcifications in the ROI were adequately segmented in a radiologist's opinion, the results were considered adequate, regardless of the number of microcalcifications; otherwise, they were considered inadequate.

It is important to highlight that this last step of the proposed procedure makes use of the radiologists’ knowledge. In a real clinical situation a gold standard will not be available, and in some cases the segmentation result can be inadequate. Hence, the radiologists’ intervention is an important step on the proposed procedure.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the images obtained in each step of the proposed procedure. In this example, the SCP value is 0.5. Note that in the implemented program, the image gray-level was inverted before processing (Fig. 3c). Thus, the image characteristics would be closer to those generated by ultrasound, for which the method was originally designed.

In this work, the results were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative criteria. The proposed method was qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the opinions of two radiologists with more than 30 years (R1) and 15 years (R2) of experience in breast radiology, and it was quantitatively evaluated by the AOM approach. It is known that evaluation based on the opinions of radiologists is highly subjective and dependent on the experience of the radiologists. The same can be said about manual contour design, which is considered difficult because of the small size of the calcifications [10]; thus, a radiologist might delineate contours with less detail than what can be perceived visually. The two evaluation procedures were carried out in order to minimize subjectivity, as they are considered complementary.

As previously mentioned, two experienced radiologists choose the best segmentation for elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis. The qualitative assessment was based on these choices. Although the evaluation method is operator-dependent, according to [12], radiologists’ opinions are well accepted for evaluating segmentations methods. A similar approach was followed in [42]. However, in that segmentation method, six different boundaries were determined by an algorithm and presented to the radiologists. The radiologists had to select the most accurate delineation, and if necessary, modify the boundaries to adjust the segmentations. In the method proposed herein, only three possible segmentations were presented to the radiologists, and they were not allowed to modify the boundaries.

The performance of the quantitative evaluation was independent of the qualitative evaluation. The more experienced radiologist manually delineated (i.e., segmented) the 2136 microcalcifications of the 1000 selected ROIs, and these contours were considered as the gold standard for calculating the AOM, expressed as [17]

In this equation, M denotes the microcalcification manually delineated by the radiologist and R represents the segmentation obtained using the proposed method (i.e., the one considered by the radiologist as the best option for elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis). The symbol ∩ denotes intersection, i.e., the number of pixels common to both segmentation procedures, and the symbol ∪ represents the union of the M and R areas. Hence, if there is no overlap between the delineated microcalcification and the one from the proposed method, AOM=0. For a complete overlap, AOM=1.

The Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test for paired data (Wilcoxon two-sided rank sum test, p
                        <0.05) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between AOMs obtained from benign and malignant microcalcifications, as well as between those obtained from small and large ones.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                     Fig. 4
                      shows an example of the result achieved by GAC segmentation, i.e., the original ROI and its three segmented images obtained using the three aforementioned SCP values in the energy minimization step. For comparison, the microcalcification manually delineated by the more experienced radiologist for each original ROI is also shown (Fig. 4b). According to both radiologists, the most adequate result was achieved with SCP=0.5 (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, for a different selected ROI (Fig. 5
                     ), the radiologists considered the most adequate segmented image to be the one obtained with SCP=1.25 (Fig. 5d). Similarly, for another selected ROI (Fig. 6
                     ), the radiologists considered the best-segmented image the one obtained with SCP=2.0 (Fig. 6e).

For the 1000 selected ROIs, the more experienced radiologist (R1) identified at least one adequately segmented image among the three presented segmented images in 89.9% of the cases, regardless of whether they were extracted from the benign or malignant image databases. The other radiologist (R2) did so in 86.9% of the cases. Considering only the 500 ROIs extracted from the benign databases, the rates were 88.2% (441 ROIs) for R1 and 86.4% (432 ROIs) for R2. For the 500 ROIs selected from the cancer database, these rates were 91.6% (458 ROIs) and 87.4% (437 ROIs), respectively. Table 2
                      summarizes these results.

Considering the joint radiologists’ opinion, there is an agreement between them that the microcalcification segmentation method proposed here was adequate for 832 ROIs (83.2%), and inadequate for 64 ROIs (6.4%). Based on these results, the agreement between the radiologists is considered moderate (kappa index=0.50) [43].

Among the studied microcalcifications, the ones that presented the biggest percentage of inadequate segmentation by type of microcalcification were the faint ones with no clearly defined shape (amorphous segmental: 29% (2/7)), the punctate with pleomorphic appearance (punctate pleomorphic: 29% (5/17)), and the pleomorphic deposits in ducts and branches of a segment (pleomorphic segmental: 25% (9/36)). However, those errors correspond to less than 2% of the 1000 ROI studied and less than 16% of the total of errors observed. Considering the type of microcalcifications with the biggest number of ROI selected (pleomorphic clustered), the percentage of inadequate segmentation inside this group was 9% (37/403), corresponding to less than 4% of all ROI evaluated.

According to BI-RADS [44], the breast tissue can be classified in four categories: density 1: almost entirely fat (<25% fibro-glandular tissue); density 2: scattered fibro-glandular dense tissue (25–50% fibroglandular tissue); density 3: heterogeneously dense (51–75% fibroglandular tissue); density 4: extremely dense (>75% fibroglandular tissue). Observing Table 3
                     , one can conclude that the density does not seem to influence the results achieved by the proposed method.

By regarding the radiologists’ opinions separately (Table 4
                     ), the microcalcification segmentation was considered adequate in at least 45.5% of the ROIs with SCP=0.5. Further, the resulting segmentation with SCP=1.25 and SCP=2.0 was considered adequate for at least 23.8% and 11.8% of the ROIs, respectively. In the worst case, according to the second radiologist, the microcalcifications presented in 13.1% of the ROIs were inadequately segmented, regardless of the SCP value. Fig. 7
                      shows two examples of ROIs considered inadequately segmented by the radiologists, regardless of the SCP value. ROIs with considerable background noise can be observed, even after the pre-processing steps are performed.

Based on the 2136 microcalcifications (from the 1000 selected ROIs) manually delineated by the more experienced radiologist, the mean AOM was estimated to be 0.52±0.20. Table 5
                      lists this value as well as those determined separately for the 793 benign and 1343 malignant microcalcifications. A statistical difference was observed between the AOM values of the benign and malignant microcalcifications (p
                     =2.9×10−5). Table 6
                      lists the mean AOM values for small (maximum diameter less than 460μm) and large segmented microcalcifications. A statistical difference was observed between the AOM values of the small and large microcalcifications (p
                     =2.0×10−47).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

With the aim of segmenting microcalcifications of different sizes and shapes, the GAC method proposed herein always uses three different SCP values in the energy minimization step. For each ROI, three segmented images (one for each SCP value) are presented to a radiologist, who selects the best image segmentation for elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis.

According to the two consulted radiologists (Table 4), with SCP=0.5, 52.6% (R1) and 45.5% (R2) of the ROIs had adequately segmented microcalcifications. Further, with SCP=1.25 and SCP=2.0, the adequacy rates were 25.5% (R1) and 23.8% (R2), and 11.8% (R1) and 17.6% (R2), respectively. These results indicate the importance of using different SCP values to segment different microcalcifications. The importance of selecting an appropriate SCP value can also be observed qualitatively in Figs. 4–6, where microcalcifications of different sizes and shapes are shown to be properly segmented by this method.

However, in some cases, the segmentation procedure proposed herein could not segment all individual microcalcifications in a ROI. Nevertheless, by considering the radiologists’ knowledge, such cases were considered adequate because the radiologists agreed on their diagnosis based on the segmented images. By considering the radiologists’ opinions independently, the resulting segmentations were considered inadequate for diagnosing no more than 13.6% of the benign lesions and 12.6% of the malignant ones; the corresponding rate was 13.1% when considering all microcalcifications (Table 2). Some of the 131 ROIs that were inadequately segmented (89 of 131) presented considerable background noise (e.g., Fig. 7) according to the radiologists.

Moreover, for the selected ROIs, the rate of adequately segmented microcalcifications to establish a diagnosis hypothesis was 89.9% for one radiologist (R1) and 86.6% for the other (R2) (Table 2). These rates were higher than that (76%) achieved in [21], where different images from the same database (25 mammograms) were used; 45 ROIs (300dpi, 8 bits) containing malignant (20 ROIs) and benign (25 ROIs) microcalcifications were processed. Further, only one SCP value was employed (SCP=0.5), and the parameters in the pre-segmentation step were not altered as compared to the original values used in [21].

In a previous study [28], the proposed MM segmentation method exhibited better performance (R1: 97.8% and R2: 97.3%) with regard to the possibility of establishing a diagnosis from exactly the same ROIs. An assessment of the AOMs (Table 5) shows that the GAC method presented a mean value (0.52±0.20) inferior than the one achieved in [28] (0.64±0.14).

The GAC method tends to soften the curves of outlined objects, producing rounded segmentations. Moreover, difficulty in dealing with changes in the topology of the objects to be outlined was reported by several authors in the case of the original active contours method [34,46,47]. This issue seems to be more critical in the case of small objects, as can be observed in the segmentations obtained using the GAC method in this work, where the AOM value for small microcalcifications (0.30±0.18) is lower than that for large ones (0.57±0.17) (Table 6). Moreover, in the present study, it was observed that the selection of a seed point, which is necessary to initialize the GAC method, is a difficult task for microcalcifications with diameters less than 460μm, even for experienced radiologists. The literature indicates that active contours methods are not adequate for segmenting small lesions [45]. Nevertheless, several procedures for segmenting microcalcifications based on active contours can be found in the literature [17,18,20], and their performances are discussed over the following paragraphs.

For images with more than one lesion, the GAC method has to be processed multiple times, once for each existing lesion, and each case requires a seed point. Difficulty in simultaneously segmenting multiple objects has been reported as a limitation of active contours methods [34,46,47]. Moreover, successful segmentation in the active contours methods is highly dependent on the location of the seed point. In this work, the best results were generally obtained when the seed point was placed closest to the centroid of the object to be segmented.

Paquerault et al. [18] qualitatively compared the results obtained by applying two microcalcification segmentation methods: the radial active contours (RAC) method, based on gradients, and the region-growing (RG) method. They employed a database consisting of the mammograms of 76 patients, selected from the archives of the Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago, US; this data included 144 microcalcification clusters. The evaluation was performed by two observers (O1 and O2) who were instructed to rate the accuracy of the segmentation based on how well the segmented contours agreed with their mental visualizations of the contours. The accuracy rates were 67.9±22.9 (O1) and 31.4±24.5 (O2) for the RG method, and 91.7±3.2 (O1) and 83.2±12.4 (O2) for the RAC method. Hence, we selected the minimum rate for the RAC method as [18] (83.2–12.4=70.8) to classify a segmented image as adequate; thus, at least 86.9% of the ROIs were considered as adequately segmented for the GAC method. This finding suggests an efficacy that is at least similar to that of the RAC method proposed in [18]. Paquerault et al. [18] also implemented a third technique based on the watershed transform, but they did not report the accuracy rates obtained with this technique. Note that all the segmentation methods discussed in [18] begin with manually identified seed points, which were carefully selected to represent the centers of the individual microcalcifications.

Using the same database (DDSM), but not the same images, Arikidis et al. [17] presented a method based on multiscale active contours for segmenting microcalcifications; their method also involves intervention by radiologists. The seed for initializing the active contours is manually defined by a radiologist, and the ROI is defined as a square of 81×81 pixels, centered at the seed point. Hence, based on this scheme, their method will segment only the microcalcifications individually marked by the radiologist, and thus, it tends to be time consuming. Arikidis et al. [17] reported that the computation time for segmenting each microcalcification was 0.42s. They assessed the results by comparing the obtained segmented areas with those manually defined by a radiologist, and obtained AOM mean values of 0.61±0.16 and 0.61±0.14 for large and small microcalcifications, respectively. Results based on the microcalcifications types were not presented. In the GAC method proposed herein, the AOM mean values were lower for both large (0.57±0.17) and small (0.30±0.18) microcalcifications. Further, the computation time for each microcalcification was 0.40s.

In addition, Arikidis et al. [17] applied two more segmentation techniques to their selected microcalcifications: the RAC method described by Paquerault et al. [18], and the multiscale active rays (MAR) method, which they proposed themselves [20]. For the MAR method, the mean values were 0.56±0.17 and 0.49±0.19 for large and small microcalcifications, respectively. The corresponding values for the RAC method were and 0.35±0.15 and 0.49±0.13. Based on these results, it is observed that the GAC method achieved higher AOM mean values for large microcalcifications and lower for small microcalcifications.

Betal et al. [48] also reported AOM values for their MM-based segmentation study. However, they estimated the exact pixel ground truth by making adjustments to the delineations provided by their automated segmentation method, thereby obtaining a positively biased final result. Owing to the lack of further studies on quantitative evaluation based on AOM, the results of the GAC method proposed herein were compared only with those obtained in [17].

Unlike the methods presented in [17] and [18], as well as the proposed GAC method, where intervention by radiologists is required at an intermediate stage of the segmentation procedure (e.g., to introduce a seed point that represents the microcalcification center), the MM method presented in [28] integrates the radiologists’ knowledge only at a key step in the process, i.e., for selecting best image segmentation to elaborate an adequate diagnosis hypothesis. By considering exactly the same images as those used in this study, the MM method was found to adequately segment almost 98% of the ROIs [28].

Herein, it is important to highlight that despite some studies previously mentioned have used the same database, the comparison among the different performance published is clearly hampered, once different studies use different images. If very different results were observed, it would be possible to infer the possible reasons for such difference. However, marginal different results may be related to differences on the selected images as well as the quantity of images studied.

Rebouças Filho et al. [49] proposed the 2D adaptive crisp active contour method, an automatic segmentation method based on active contours, for segmenting lung images in computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Their method does not require a seed point because the initialization curve is obtained, based on pre-knowledge of structures that will be segmented, in terms of positions and radiological pulmonary densities [50]. This approach seems not to be feasible for microcalcifications in a mammogram. However, it would be possible to automate the localization of the seed point by including a step for locating the center of mass of microcalcifications, based on another method. Nevertheless, the incorporation this step could introduce false positives in the segmentation analysis [18], which is one of the main motives of reducing the interest of radiologists on fully automated methods. Moreover, comparison of the proposed method with others in the literature that also use seed point would be hindered [17,18,20]. For those reasons, we opt for a semi-automatic segmentation procedure.

Some works in literature use the microcalcifications cluster analysis [11,18,29]. It is important to clarify that our segmentation result also allows such analysis. Once the individual microcalcifications were segmented, it is possible to assess them as a cluster, characterizing its morphology.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The originality of this work resides in two points: (1) the geodesic active contours (GAC) technique associated with anisotropic texture filtering to segment microcalcifications in mammography; and (2) the contribution of the radiologists’ knowledge incorporated in the final stage of the segmentation method. In this method three different SCP values are employed in the energy minimization step. For each ROI, three segmented images (one for each SCP value) are presented to a radiologist, who selects the best option for elaborating an adequate diagnosis hypothesis. The proposed method had better or similar performance as compared to literature for microcalcifications larger than 460μm. For smaller microcalcifications the performance was limited. However, based on the radiologists’ knowledge, the achieved segmentation result would be adequate to perform a diagnosis hypothesis in at least 87.4% (437/500) of the malignant cases and 86.4% (432/500) of the benign ones. Then, one may suppose the proposed segmentation procedure associated to radiologists’ knowledge as feasible, foreseeing a clinical application.
