                  In this paper, we present two novel interference management stratagems for coexisting one primary user (PU) and multiple secondary users (SUs) by exploiting the unused spatial directions at PU. The cognitive stations sense their environment to determine the users they are interfering with, and adapt to it by designing the corresponding precoders using interference alignment (IA) in order to avoid causing performance degradation to nearby PU and SUs. The first proposed approach judiciously designs the set of precoders based on an improved version of minimum weighted leakage interference algorithm. However, there are still leftover interference signals in SUs’ desired signal space due to the limited iterative times in the first algorithm. To tackle this problem, another scheme combining the first one and power allocation method at the secondary stations is developed. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the demands for high speed data communication and more bandwidth growing rapidly, the radio resource becomes a major problem which makes further improvement of wireless network’s performance difficult. The cognitive radio (CR) concept [1] has been proposed to mitigate this spectrum crunch by relaxing the traditional fixed spectrum regulation and exploiting unused licensed spectrum bands that do not degrade the performance of the primary system. Various techniques have been provided to ensure that licensed and unlicensed users can share the radio resource. The design of CR networks mainly focuses on the secondary network since the goal is to increase spectrum efficiency without affecting the operation at the primary network [2]. There are two popular spectrum sharing schemes. The first one (spectrum underlay) allows the PUs and SUs access to the same channel simultaneously while constraining the transmitted power of secondary users so that it can be treated as background noise at primary users without exceeding the primary users noise floor. In the second scheme (spectrum overlay) secondary users need to detect spectrum holes and then access spectrum white space in a nonintrusive way [3]. As research goes deep, recognition of spectrum opportunity becomes rich. Communication opportunity exploited in multiple dimension is an important field. The availability of spectrum resource benefits from the application of multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) techniques [4]. So, the cognitive transmission which is considered as interference by primary user should lie in the subspace orthogonal to the useful signal space of the primary link. IA employs the above concepts.

IA aims to allow coordinated transmission and reception in order to increase the total degree of freedom (DoF) of the network. IA generates overlapping user signal spaces occupied by undesired interference while keeping the desired signal spaces distinct [5]. Cadambe and Jafar introduced the idea of IA for K-user interference channel in [5]. They show that IA achieves the maximum multiplexing gain in a K-user interference channel such that nodes sharing the same interference channel can achieve rates equal to one half of their corresponding interference-free rates. For case of generic channel coefficients, significant progress has been made in relating the feasibility of a system of interference alignment to the properness of the related system of linear equations [6].

In order to obtain IA, various numerical algorithms that both compute the IA precoding and receive filter have been provided in [7–11]. In [7] an algorithm, based on the idea of IA introduced in [5], was proposed which strives to minimize the interference spill outside the interference subspace, resulting in low dimensional subspace spanned by interference signal. A similar algorithm without the reciprocity assumption was introduced in [8]. In [9] an extension of the algorithm in [8] was developed that achieved better sum rate performance. In order to maximize the available DoF, a rank constrained rank minimization algorithm (RCRM) has been introduced recently, where the rank of the subspace spanned by interference signals is minimized subjected to full rank signal space [10]. In [11] an algorithm similar to max-signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) algorithm is proposed that seeks to minimize the sum mean square error (MSE) of all the receivers. The MSE algorithm is slightly complicated since the Lagrange multipliers need to be computed to design the transmit precoders. Due to natural signal separation between the interference and the desired information in K-user interference channel, the IA method naturally applies itself to CR networks where the main goal is to suppress the interference to the primary link. However, its expansion to CR networks may not be an easy straightforward task.

In this paper, we present opportunistic spectrum usage of one primary link operating under the IA scheme. The primary link is modeled by a single-user MIMO channel since it must operate free of any additional interference produced by secondary systems. Then, assuming perfect CSI at transmitter and receiver ends, capacity is achieved by implementing a water-filling power allocation [22] over the spatial directions associated with singular values of its channel matrix. Interestingly, even if the primary transmitters maximize their transmission rates, power limitations generally lead them to leave some of their spatial direction unused. The unused spatial directions can therefore be reused by another system operating in the same frequency band. Indeed, the secondary transmitters can send their own data to their respective receivers by processing their signals in such a way that the interference produced on the primary link impairs only unused spatial directions. Hence, these spatial resources can be very useful for secondary systems when the available spectral resources are fully exploited over a certain period in a geographical area. In this paper, we consider the PU activity model which finding the unused spatial hole [5] rather than spectrum hole [12–15] to ensure secondary transmission and considering the different system model and problem metrics from our previous work [16,17]. We consider the system model composed of a secondary K-user interference network, while the primary link consists of one pair of transmit-receiver. It is assumed that the PU enables to use the whole achievable DoF with the idea of the IA [5]. Our aim is to design a CR transmission scheme using IA that utilizes the unused DoFs of the primary network for secondary transmission without extra cost to the primary networks. This is done by designing the secondary precoder and decoder matrices such that no interference is incurred to the primary link, while the subspace matrix distance at the secondary network is minimized to search the precoding and decoding matrices for SUs. Due to the limited iterative times of the numerical computation, the interference signal is still existed in SUs desired signal space, and then we derive an improved interference suppression method by jointly considering power allocation scheme and the first proposed interference mitigation scheme. Even though the primary and secondary transmissions are designed for the considered system model, our proposed schemes can be extended to the general system model considering in [18].

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Considerable research has been done regarding the transceiver design based on IA in CR MIMO networks or similar system model. The authors in [19] propose an opportunistic scheme to utilize the unused eigenmodes of the primary channel, and introduce the secondary precoding and power allocation matrices that are separately designed to nullify the interference on the PU and maximize secondary transmission rates [19,20]. The method is introduced in [19] for single secondary link and then extended to multiple secondary links in [20] under the assumption of perfect CSI at all nodes. However, the method in [19,20] employs independent optimization. On the other hand, joint optimization designs can further improve the secondary rates by jointly designing the secondary matrices. In [21], an iterative method is proposed to nullify the interference on the PU and jointly design the secondary pre- and post-coders to minimize the interference between secondary links in case of perfect CSI. In [18], an improved version of cognitive IA scheme, which has better performance than method in [21], is derived to design the secondary precoders and receiver filters while causing no interference to PU. However, neither algorithm considers the strength of the direct signal to the intended SU. Although this does not matter in terms of the total DoF, it is however very important for practical values of signal-to-noise ratio. In [22], the authors proposed a cooperative IA algorithm to null out the interference between neighboring networks. They have formulated the problem as a coalitional game in partition form and proposed a distributed coalition formation algorithm, while accounting for the cost in terms of power for information exchange. Unfortunately, the authors restricted their work to deal only the co-tier interference and did not take the cross-tier interference into consideration, which is more dominant than co-tier interference in practice. In [23], the authors presented a cross-tier interference management strategy for two-tier networks by exploiting cognition and coordination between tiers by the use of IA. Moreover, the authors in [24] derive the secondary precoding and decoding matrices to have zero interference leakage into the primary network while the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio at the secondary receiver is maximized. However, the algorithm neglected potential co-interference sources.

Although IA techniques for CR networks exist in the literature, according to the best knowledge of the authors, there are a few IA schemes that deal with the analysis and the optimization of weighted leakage interference metric for CR networks in the presence of K SUs interference channels. The motivation of this work is to fill the gap, especially important for future communication.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The condition on the number of antennas, data streams and SUs in the secondary system to exploit the spatial hole in the primary link without causing the interference between primary link and secondary links as well as the structure of the secondary precoding and decoding matrices.

An improved cognitive IA algorithm based on the minimum matrix distance method is developed to exploit the spatial holes in the primary system without causing interference to the primary system.

And as the first proposed algorithm cannot ensure falling the interference signal perfectly into the secondary users interference subspace due to limited iterative times. Therefore, an improved version algorithm that combining the former proposed algorithm and the power allocation algorithm at the secondary transmitter is proposed.

                     0 is the Lagrange multiplier satisfying the power constraint in (3), related to the trace of the power matrix of PU which is affected by the precoder. After the precoding matrix for primary link have been obtained, we would spot on the secondary links in the following sections.

In this section, we specify the IA conditions for the CR system that we consider in this work. As explained before the focus of the problem is to empower the secondary links to transmit with highest possible rate in the presence of the primary link without degrading the performance of the primary link. To proceed, we would perform as follows: at first, we apply IA between the secondary links and design the precoding and reception filter matrices such that the interference between SUs are suppressed and the required dimension for the desired subspace of each SU is prepared. Since our problem is in the context of the cognitive scheme, the following constraints must also be satisfied in this progress: (i) the SUs must not cause any interference on PU and (ii) the additional interference from the primary transmitter on SUs should be eliminated. It is noteworthy that in order to facilitate IA between the secondary links, we need to impose the following constraints:

The constraints in (6) come from the existence of the primary links; the first constraint preserves the PU from the interference imposed by the secondary transmitters; the second constraint ensures that the interference caused by primary transmitter on the SUs is eliminated.

In summary, we are looking for the precoding and reception filter matrices for secondary links with regard to the IA problem in (5) in a way that the constraints in (6) should be also satisfied. To achieve this goal and find the appropriate solutions for precoding and receive filter matrices, initially we transform the IA problem into an unconstrained standard IA problem for a general interference network by employing the following definitions

To determine the feasibility of the DoF allocation for given number of antennas, we may consider the number of variables (Nv
                     ) and the number of the equations (Ne
                     ) in the feasibility conditions (8) because the multivariate polynomials is solvable if and only if they are proper, i.e., Nv
                      ≥ Ne
                      
                     [6]. For instance, in a symmetric CR system, each transmitter has M antennas, each receiver has N antennas, PU’s DoF is d
                     0, and each SU has d
                     1 DoF. The cognitive IA in (8) is proper if

                     It is worth mentioning that, in general, finding the solutions of these sets of bilinear equations in (9a) is challenging. To cope with this dilemma, we resort to the iterative algorithms, each with specific convergence criteria [7]. In the next section, we will propose two algorithms to find the precoding matrices

In this section, two efficient precoding design algorithms, which are the improved versions of the iterative minimum the weighted leakage interference (MinWLI) algorithm proposed in [21], have been proposed in such a way that they can simultaneously operate under the constraint that no additional interference is imposed between primary link and secondary links.

Before we present our algorithm, a definition of the distance between two orthonormal matrices

                           B
                         (or equivalently, between the two subspace spanned by them) is formulated as

The above proposed cognitive IA algorithm strives to ensure all interference signals from other secondary transmitters at intended SU fall into its interference subspace by an iterative style. However, because of the limited iterative times, interference signals may not fully fallen into the SUs’ interference subspace. Thus, there are some leftover interference signals falling into SUs’ desired signal subspace. In order to further relieve interference signals on SUs’ desired signal subspace, we could exploit the power allocation method. From the above cognitive IA algorithm, we can learn that the columns of

                        . Therefore, we can exploit the property to allocate the power to each data stream at each secondary transmitter and then formulate the following optimization problem:

The proof of convergence can be extended straightforwardly from that provided in Theorem 1 and hence we skip the proof. □

In this section, we provide simulation results to show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Let us assume that a PU and K SUs system coexist in the same frequency band. For example, we can consider a set-up in terms of cellular systems where in the same cell there exist a licensed primary transmitter and K unlicensed secondary base-stations that serve the corresponding PU and SU, respectively. It is assumed that all channel links experience flat Rayleigh fading. The noise power δi
                      is normalized to one. Without loss of generality, we assume that each node equips the same number of antenna, i.e., 
                        
                           
                              M
                              i
                           
                           =
                           
                              N
                              i
                           
                           =
                           M
                        
                     . As shown in [11], the choice of the initial points influences much on solving the weighted minimum mean square error model. Our algorithms have the same property. To be fair, for the same instance we use the same initial points for all models. For each plotted point, 1000 random realizations of different channel coefficients are generated to evaluate the average performance. Every algorithm runs for 500 iterations to make sure the convergence of the objective function value. The convergence threshold is given as

                     . Here, we define

                     . The performance of the proposed cognitive IA algorithms are evaluated in terms of two different metrics: the fraction of interference signal power in the SUs’ desired signal subspace and achievable rate. The most simulation parameters are listed in Table 2. We use Matlab simulation server R2010a based on 2.4GHz INTEL Xeon E5620 CPU with 8GB RAM and the operating system 64 bits Linux to run all the simulations.

                     , the performance of the proposed techniques are compared to the iterative cognitive IA in [21] labeled as “MinWIL”, the method in [18] labeled as “Hybrid CIA Scheme” and scheme in [24] labeled as “Max-SINR” in terms of the fraction of the interference signal power in the desired signal subspace under perfect CSI and different total number of the data streams in the secondary networks.

                     . If the IA is feasible, then the fraction of interference in the desired signal space is zero. Fig. 2 shows that, MDP-CIA scheme outperforms other algorithms with respect to Pavg
                     . When the total number of data streams in the cognitive networks is less than 17, all the schemes cannot can achieve perfect IA. Fig. 3 indicates that neither the proposed algorithms nor the three existing schemes can achieve perfect IA before the total number of data streams increases to 20. Therefore, MDP-CIA algorithm achieves the best performance in terms in Pavg
                      among all algorithms. The reason is that MDP-CIA algorithm considers the power allocation to reduce the influence of the leftover interference signal at SUs.


                     Figs. 4 and 5
                     
                      present the achievable rate of PU, SUs and total sum rate (in bits per seconds) versus SNR when the primary link’s DoF is determined to be the number of the active eigenmodes after the water-filling power allocation algorithm and each SU’s DoF is set to be identical. In the figure, ‘Primary’ and ‘Secondary’ indicate the achievable rates of the PU and SUs, respectively, and ‘Total’ represents the sum rates of the entire network. It is observed that our proposed algorithms improve the SUs’ rate significantly in the mid SNR regime. The reason lies in that the MinWIL algorithm limits the DoF that the SUs can use, while in our MD-CIA algorithm, the SUs can use all the DoF left by the PU. Furthermore, MDP-CIA algorithm can achieve better performance than MD-CIA algorithm, MinWIL algorithm, hybrid CIA scheme in [18] and max-SINR in [24] considering the power allocation method to reduce the influence of the leftover interference signal at SUs. At low SNR, SUs suffer from high noise which does not allow the users to transmit with high rates. As the operating SNR increases, the waterfilling power allocation assigns more active eigenmodes to PU, which decreases the secondary transmission rate if SNR exceeds some threshold. For example, in Fig. 5, the PU takes 2 degree of freedom as the 
                        
                           
                              SNR
                           
                           =
                           5
                           
                              dB
                           
                        
                     , each SU still has 2 degree of freedom. In high SNR regime, the PU occupies all available DoF and the SUs’ DoF are zero in all algorithms.

In Fig. 6
                     , we relax the identical DoF constraints of the SUs so that the different DoF allocation enables more effective user of available DoF. In addition, we fixed the maximum DoF of the PU as 2 and 4, respectively. This set is to avoid the case of PU occupying all DoF. From the figures, we can observe that the SUs’ achievable rate is monotonically increases with respect to SNR, which is because SUs’ available DoF does not fall to zero. Moreover, compared with other algorithms, MDP-CIA scheme achieves the best average sum rate.

In Fig. 7
                     , we investigate the effect of number of SU on the total capacity of secondary links under full CSI while considering PU activity model. It is assumed that the antenna of each node is set 
                        
                           M
                           =
                           6
                        
                     . The primary adopts adaptive transmission by exploiting appropriate number of active eignmodes. Since it can be guaranteed that primary transmission is not affected by the cognitive, achievable rate of primary increases with SNR. As it can be seen, the total capacity of secondary links increases with the number of SUs. On the other hand, it may provide an increased number of available DoF to the SU transmission which concludes the result in [5].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper explored the construction of precoder and receive filter for IA in CR networks. After finding the suitable pre- and post-processing matrices for the primary link and maximizing their rates through water-filling algorithm, we formulated an cognitive IA algorithm based on matrix distance method. We then came up with an modified algorithm considering power allocation method to reduce the leftover interference in SUs’ desired signal subspace. Using our algorithms, the SUs could completely utilize unused eignmodes or inactive data streams. With the help of simulations, we showed that all the proposed algorithms provided a significant achievable rate for both secondary network and total network while cause no interference to the primary link. It would be interesting to analytically derive the robust transceiver optimization under imperfect CSI.
