                  Microarray experiments generally deal with complex and high-dimensional samples, and in addition, the number of samples is much smaller than their dimensions. Both issues can be alleviated by using a feature selection (FS) method. In this paper two new, simple, and efficient hybrid FS algorithms, called respectively BDE-

                      and BDE-
                        
                           X

                                 f
                              
                           
                        
                     , are presented. Both algorithms combine a wrapper FS method based on a Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) algorithm with a rank-based filter FS method. Besides, they generate the initial population with solutions involving only a small number of features. Some initial solutions are built considering only the most relevant features regarding the filter method, and the remaining ones include only random features (to promote diversity).

                      is shown by using four Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (NB, SVM, C4.5, and kNN). Six high-dimensional well-known data sets of microarray experiments are used to carry out an extensive experimental study based on statistical tests. This experimental analysis shows the robustness as well as the ability of both proposals to obtain highly accurate solutions at the earlier stages of BDE evolutionary process. Finally, BDE-
