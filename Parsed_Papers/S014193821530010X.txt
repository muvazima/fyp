                  For visual secret sharing (VSS), general access structure (GAS), which can freely define the qualified set and the forbidden set, provides dealers the ability to share secret information with the qualified set but not the forbidden set. In previous studies, the proposed GAS schemes have focused on strong GAS, but it has retained restrictions and inconvenience in some secret-sharing scenarios. Recently, the random-grid-based VSS (RG-based VSS) technique has aimed to overcome the problem of pixel expansion from which the visual-cryptography-based VSS (VC-based VSS) techniques usually suffer. This paper presents a flexible GAS VSS scheme by RG that is appropriate for wide use and that serves special cases like (2, n), (n, n), and (k, n). The paper also outlines how the scheme can be extended for multiple secrets. The performance and the security of the scheme are theoretically analyzed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

In 1979, Shamir [16] and Blakley [3] proposed the k-out-of-n secret-sharing scheme, which is used to share secret information by dividing it into n shares and to recover the original secret information later by collecting any of at least k shares. This scheme opened a new era of information security. In 1995, Naor and Shamir [15] proposed a visual secret-sharing scheme based on visual cryptography (VC-based VSS) in which, according to a predefined codebook, a binary secret image can be encoded into n share images. In the decoding phase, by directly stacking at least k shares carefully, the secret information can be reconstructed by human eyes without any extra computational cost required.

Even though the (k, n)-VC-based VSS technique provides a way to share secrets, it cannot deal with arbitrary access structures. To compensate for this drawback, Ateniese et al. [1] extended (k, n)-VC-based VSS to general access structures (GAS) in 1996, in which an access structure is defined by the form

Hence, the authors re-define a flexible GAS to relax the restriction of strong GAS, as shown in Definition 2. The flexible GAS is more flexible and practical in VSS applications than the strong GAS.

                           -VC-based VSS, which can be regarded as a generalization of the threshold scheme, provides more flexibility in sharing secrets. Recently, many researchers have focused on the visual secret-sharing schemes for general access structures [2,9–12,23].

VC-based VSS may have two main drawbacks: (1) the sophisticated codebook needed to be predefined and (2) the pixel expansion problem. Thanks to another VSS scheme proposed by Kafri and Keren [13] in 1987, the random-grid-based VSS (RG-based VSS) is used to encode a secret image into two noisy random grids and decode the secret by directly stacking two random grids. Today, RG-based VSS has been conferred again and further extended to the threshold VSS, such as (2, n), (n, n) [4,6] and (k, n) [7] VSS, without the two drawbacks mentioned above.

With RG-based VSS still in its infancy, the authors propose a flexible general access structure visual secret-sharing scheme by random grids, in which the (2, n), (n, n), and (k, n) schemes are covered as special cases. The proposed scheme is more flexible and practical for VSS applications than those in previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is feasible, and the theoretical analysis in terms of performance and security is demonstrated.

As many studies have been focused on multiple secrets, whether VC-based VSS [5,8,10,11,14,18,20–22] or RG-based VSS [5], this paper also outlines how the proposed scheme can be extended for multiple secret sharing to benefit from saving the data transmission bandwidth and decreasing the storage requirement.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The traditional random-grid VSS scheme is briefly described in the next section. Section 3 describes the details of the proposed flexible GAS RG-based VSS scheme. Sections 4 and 5 show the formal analysis and the experimental results. The extended method for multiple-secret RG-based VSS is demonstrated in Section 6. Conclusions are provided in the final section.

                           ×
                           w
                        
                      is encoded into two random grids 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R

                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R

                      with the same size as that of S.

First, we randomly generate the value 0 and 1 to indicate the color white or black and assign them to each pixel of the first random grid 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     . Next, the other random grid 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      is created by referring both the corresponding pixels of secret image S and those of

                      to one of Kafri and Keren’s three algorithms. The function

The secret image S is encoded into two noisy random grids with both random grids being perfectly secure. (The reader may refer to the previous security analysis in Ref. [17,6].) In the decoding phase, stacking the random grids can reconstruct the original secret information such that it may be recognized by the human visual system.

Assume that visual secret sharing that realizes the general access structure is denoted as

The grids are noisy, so people cannot recognize the original secret information from any one random grid alone.

By Theorem 2, the stacked results of the generated random grids defined in the qualified set will be with a contrast greater than zero. Thus, in the decoding phase, when the random grids defined in any qualified set {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,2,3}, or

To sum up, the proposed flexible GAS VSS scheme is the general solution of RG-based VSS.

Today, many researchers are focused on multiple-secret VSS, whether it is VC-based VSS [8,12,14,18,20–22] or RG-based VSS [5,10,11]. They highlight that sharing multiple secrets is an important trend in VSS, which can save the data transmission bandwidth and decrease the storage requirement.

The proposed GAS RG-based VSS scheme is extended to the multiple-secret version, MS-GAS RG-based VSS, which can be used to encode M secrets into n noisy random grids such that the secret image can later be reconstructed by stacking the random grids with the defined qualified set but not with the forbidden set. Clearly, MS-GAS VSS is more practical because it achieves the goal of encoding multiple secrets using the same number of shares.

The multiple-secret VSS that realizes such a general access structure is denoted as M-

The diagram of the proposed MS-GAS RG-based VSS is shown in Fig. 3.

We demonstrate that the proposed flexible MS-GAS RG-based VSS scheme is feasible by conducting an experiment to encode M secret images using the different qualified sets.

The comparisons between the previous related works and the proposed method are shown in Table 1
                     . The proposed RG-based VSS method is efficient in terms of satisfying the definition of flexible GAS and encoding multiple secrets without any pixel expansion.

To shorten the paper, the demonstration that the proposed schemes can also be used to encode color images is omitted here. The related extension from dealing with binary images to gray-level or color images is the same as that in either Ref. [6] or Ref. [7].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Although VC-based VSS is one of the important image secret-sharing approaches, its innate disadvantages make RG-based VSS a better candidate. Moreover, strong GAS VSS sometimes has restrictions, so it is not always suitable for VSS applications. Thus, it is worthwhile to propose a flexible GAS RG-based VSS scheme. This paper proposes a flexible GAS RG-based VSS scheme that can encode a secret image into n noisy random grids such that the random grids defined in the qualified set can be stacked to recover the original secret image, but the grids defined in the forbidden set not.

The main contributions of the proposed scheme are that it achieves the goals of (1) flexible GAS RG-based VSS, (2) MS-GAS RG-based VSS, (3) removing the problem of pixel expansion, and (4) avoiding the complex design of codebooks. The previous (n, n) and (2, n) schemes are special cases of the proposed GAS version, as is the (k, n) threshold VSS.
