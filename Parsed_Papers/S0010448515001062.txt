                  Planar Bézier curves that have rationally parameterized offsets can be classified into two classes. The first class is composed of curves that have Pythagorean hodographs (PH) and the second class is composed of curves that do not have PHs but can have rational PHs after reparameterization by a fractional quadratic transformation. This paper reveals a geometric characterization for all properly-parameterized cubic Bézier curves in the second class. The characterization is given in terms of Bézier control polygon geometry. Based on the derived conditions, we also present a simple geometric construction of

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper deals with a class of Béziercurves that possess rational offset curves. Béziercurves are a common type of representations for free form curves in computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM)  [1]. Offsetting has diverse engineering applications including CNC machining, motion planning, railway design, shape blending, etc. However, it is known that a Béziercurve in general may not have a rational offset  [2]. This actually motivated a lot of research on offset approximation  [3–8]. On the other hand, the failure of preserving rationality of the offsetting results may cause extra cost in operations involving offsets and software development as well. Therefore it is interesting to explore the curves that allow rational representation of their exact offset curves.

In 1990, Farouki and Sakkalis introduced a class of polynomial curves called Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curves  [9]. A polynomial parametric curve is called a PH curve if the Euclidean norm of the hodograph of the curve is a polynomial. Hence for PH curves, their offset curves admit rational representation. Furthermore, PH curves’ arc length can be expressed as a polynomial function of the parameter. Since then, many works have followed. The idea of PH curves was extended to spatial PH curves  [10], rational PH curves  [11,12], Minkowski PH curves  [13], etc. Also many methods have been developed to perform Hermite interpolation using various PH curves  [14–19]. One can easily find hundreds of papers in these topics. Detailed review on PH curves and related topics can be found in Chapter 17 of the Handbook of Computer Aided Geometric Design  [1], book “Pythagorean-Hodograph Curves: Algebra and Geometry Inseparable”  [20], a special issue of Computer Aided Geometric Design in 2008  [21], and a recent survey  [22].

Having a Pythagorean hodograph is only a sufficient condition for the offset of a polynomial curve to be rational. For example, the parabola does not belong to PH curves, but the offsets to the parabola are rational  [23]. It has been proved that the necessary and sufficient condition for a properly-parameterized polynomial curve on a plane to have rational offsets is that the squared norm of its hodograph has at most two complex roots (with nonzero imaginary part) of odd multiplicity  [24–26]. PH curves are a special case of such curves corresponding to the situation that the number of complex roots with nonzero imaginary part of odd multiplicity is zero. The curves in the complementary set of PH curves do not have polynomial Pythagorean hodograph, but after reparameterization via a quadratic parameter transformation, they can have a rational Pythagorean hodograph. For convenience of description, in this paper we call such curves in the complementary set indirect-PH curves.

Note that sophisticated algebraic methods have been employed to analyze and construct curves with rational offsets. For example, the complex variable model was used for planar PH curves  [27] and indirect-PH curves  [25], and the quaternion model was used for spatial PH curves  [28,29]. On the other hand, polynomial curves are always representable in Bézierform and Béziercontrol polygons provide an intuitive way to dealing with curves. While in general the algebraic structure of the polynomial curves with rational offsets is not simply transferred to intuitive constraints on the control polygon geometry, Farouki and Sakkalis provided an elegant geometric characterization for cubic PH curves  [9], which are two constraints on the lengths of legs and two interior angles of the Béziercontrol polygons. Wang and Fang derived the geometric characterization of quartic PH curves also in terms of Béziercontrol polygons  [30]. This thus provides a geometric approach for constructing PH quartics. The use of control polygons was also proposed for designing planar

In this paper, we are interested in intuitive geometric constraints for cubic Béziercurves to be indirect-PH curves based on Béziercontrol polygons. Except for some brief description of cubic indirect-PH curves in  [25], no work has been published on the full geometric characterization of them. The main contribution of this paper is that we convert the special algebraic structure in the hodographs of indirect-PH curves into simple geometric constraints and present the full geometric characterization of cubic indirect-PH curves. The geometric characteristics are expressed using the lengths of edges and the interior angles of a quadrilateral formed from the Béziercontrol polygons. Furthermore, we present the construction of a characterization diagram for the Béziercontrol points. The idea of constructing a diagram to characterize cubic curves has been used in  [32–34]. Another contribution of the paper is a simple geometric construction of

                      Hermite interpolation using cubic indirect-PH curves. In particular, if a single cubic indirect-PH curve is available for the input Hermite data, the solution is actually a one-parameter family of curves. We prove that there exists a unique value of the parameter that minimizes the integral of the squared norm of the second order derivative of the curves.

The paper is organized as follows. Section  2 briefly reviews polynomial curves with rational offsets, which serve as the starting point of our work. Section  3 then presents the full geometric characterization of indirect-PH curves. The geometric construction of

                        Remark 1
                        
                           Theorem 2 tells that for a cubic indirect-PH curve, its hodograph can be expressed by a linear vector with respect to parameter 
                              t
                            multiplied by a linear scalar function 
                              ρ
                              
                                 (
                                 t
                                 )
                              
                           . This means that a cubic indirect-PH curve is actually an LN curve introduced by Ahn and Hoffmann  [35], though a higher degree indirect-PH curve is not necessarily an LN curve. The term “LN” stands for linear normal, which was introduced by Jüttler in the surface case  [36]. LN curves have linearly varying normals and play an important role in convolution. They are special instances of curves possessing a rational support function  [37]. This paper focuses on cubic indirect-PH curves (i.e., cubic LN curves). We analyze their geometric characteristics in terms of Béziercontrol polygon geometry, a full exploration of which was not done before.

                        Proof
                        Conditions (i)–(viii) actually correspond to Cases 1–8, respectively. Thus what remains is just to prove that if a Béziercontrol polygon is given as in Cases 5–8, the Béziercurve is an indirect-PH curve. In fact, we simply let

                        Remark 2
                        According to Corollary 3, the condition for a cubic indirect-PH curve to have no cusp is 
                              h
                              >
                              0
                           . Therefore, among the eight cases for indirect-PH curves, only Case 5 defines curves that do not contain cusps within the parameter domain

                        Remark 4
                        If we are required to examine whether a cubic spline consists of indirect-PH curves, a simple way is just to convert each segment into a Béziercurve by knot insertion and then to apply Theorem 5.

So far we have constructed a family of cubic Béziercurves characterized by parameter 
                           h
                        , which are indirect-PH curves and satisfy the requirement of

                         Hermite interpolation. Next we show how to select a “good” one from the family. Our criterion is that the integral of the square norm of the second order derivative of the curve is minimized, which is often used in fair curve design. Thus the problem is to solve

                     Fig. 13
                      shows a cubic Béziercurve in red and its control polygon. The Cartesian coordinates of the four control points are (0, 0), (0, 5.6), (3, 4), and (6, 1). It can be verified that this Béziercontrol polygon corresponds to Case 5 and the constraint (13) holds. Thus the curve has rational offsets. In fact, a parameter transformation could be

                      Hermite interpolation. Fig. 14
                      shows five such curves from the family with parameter 
                        h
                        =

                      from left to right. In particular, when 
                        h
                        =
                        1
                     , the indirect-PH curve is actually a quadratic Béziercurve.

                      is the optimal solution to the minimization problem (20). As a comparison, we also construct the cubic PH curve which is displayed on the right of Fig. 14. Different from indirect-PH curves, the PH curve is unique for the given 
                        
                           
                              G

                      Hermite data. In the bottom row of the figure, the curvature plots of the curves are presented.

When the given 
                        
                           
                              G

                      Hermite data do not satisfy the assumption in Section  4.1, a single indirect-PH curve without cusp(s) is not available. Then two indirect-PH curves can be used. Fig. 15
                      shows the construction of two indirect-PH curves under various situations. It can be seen that such bi-indirect-PH curves possess enough flexibility for 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      Hermite interpolation. In Fig. 15, the input data (two endpoints and two vectors) are displayed in green. The two constructed curves and their control polygons are shown in blue and black, respectively. The joint point between the two indirect-PH curves is drawn in red.

Finally, Figs. 16 and 17
                     
                      show

                      spline curves consisting of several indirect-PH curves that interpolate a sequence of Hermite data. This is done by automatically constructing indirect-PH curve(s) for each adjacent pair of data. The input data points for the closed curve in Fig. 16 are

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have derived the geometric characteristics of a class of cubic Béziercurves, called indirect-PH curves, which are not PH curves but can have rational Pythagorean hodographs after a quadratic parameter transformation. The characteristics are given in terms of Béziercontrol polygon geometry. The offsets to this class of Béziercurves are generally degree 8 rational curves. The construction of

                      Hermite interpolation using such curves is described. A single cubic indirect-PH curve has just one more degree of freedom than a quadratic Béziercurve, but bi-indirect-PH curves possess enough flexibility for

                      Hermite interpolation and shapes containing an inflection point.

While this paper focuses on the geometric characteristics of indirect-PH curves and their construction for

                      Hermite interpolation, it is interesting to combine them with PH curves in free form shape design. In addition, extending the current work to rational indirect-PH curves and quartic or quintic indirect-PH curves warrants further investigation since they provide more degrees of freedom.
