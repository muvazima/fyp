                  In wireless communication systems users compete for communication opportunities through a medium access control protocol. Previous research has shown that selfish behavior in medium access games could lead to inefficient and unfair resource allocation. We introduce a new notion of reciprocity in a medium access game and derive the corresponding Nash equilibrium. Further, using mechanism design we show that this type of reciprocity can remove unfair/inefficient equilibrium solutions.
                  The best response learning method for the reciprocity game framework is studied. It demonstrates that the game converges to the unique and stable Nash equilibrium if the nodes have low collision costs or high psychological sensitivity. For symmetric games the converged Nash equilibrium turns out to be the fair strategy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Using game theory to investigate the performance of medium access control (MAC) protocols have resulted in interesting insights. Game theory allows us to incorporate a variety of behaviors of the wireless nodes into the MAC design. One of these is the notion of reciprocity. The notion of reciprocity implies that users are neither selfish nor altruistic all the time. Rather, “they are nice to those who are nice to them, but mean to people who harm them”. A corresponding property is fairness that is also dealt with in our analysis. One of the main results we derive is that reciprocity changes the best response dynamics of the game and renders bad Nash equilibria to become unstable.

A homo reciprocan model for medium access control is investigated in [1] where one notion of fairness is considered. In [2,10], the effect of compassion is studied. Game theory has been used to analyze opportunistic radio networks in [3]. Packet collisions when multiple user transmit simultaneously usually provides an incentive for selfish behavior [6]. User can selfishly cheat in a MAC game, for example, an user may not respect the random exponential backoff in CSMA/CA by adjusting the contention window arbitrarily to its minimum size. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Rabin’s fairness Nash equilibrium [4] to analyze a medium access control game model with reciprocity. In our model, users have an incentive to punish selfish behaviors that allows them to avoid unfair equilibrium under certain conditions.

In [7], analysis of the fundamental equilibrium properties of the one shot random access game model is provided. It is observed that all centrally controlled optimal solutions are subsets of this game solution. This is extended in [8] to characterize the existence of uniqueness of Nash equilibria.

The transient network behavior and iterative game strategies are the focus of the studies in [9–12]. Effect of reciprocity on transient network behavior is studied in [9] using the notion of conjectural equilibrium. The operating points of the throughput region are shown to be conjecture equilibria. Dynamic altruistic behavior in Aloha random access game and its effect on altruistic behavioral stability is studied in [10].

We note that the idea of reciprocity is a “moral” correlation device that can help the medium access protocol to avoid bad equilibrium solutions. We also discuss methods to achieve good equilibrium solutions with respect to collision cost and psychological sensitivity of users. We show that an intervening mechanism designer [5] can remove the undesirable network equilibrium of MAC games by affecting the channel collision probability. The contributions of this paper are different from some of the previous works. For example, we address reciprocity in normal form MAC games while [9] addresses dynamic reciprocity. Moreover, the notion of reciprocity in [9] is different in that their addressed equilibrium is a conjectural equilibrium while we study the Nash equilibrium. One shot random access games studied in [7,8] do not consider fairness. Also unlike [8], our proposed learning mechanism converges to the unique stable Nash. Also in the symmetric game the converged Nash of our best response learning is the fair strategy while the best response in [8] does not guarantee to achieve the fair Nash.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the standard medium access game model. Reciprocity and fairness in these games are presented in Section 3. In Section 4 a best response learning method has been presented. Simulations and numerical results are presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Assume wireless nodes or players 1 and 2 are contending for the available spectrum. Then for the chosen strategies of transmit (T) or buffer (B) they receive payoffs according to the matrix M in Table 1
                        . It can be easily shown that this game has two pure Nash equilibria, namely,

                              As the result of this we observe that a designer can adjust the price of collision to shift the pure Nash equilibria of random access game to

                              This means that mechanism designer can easily trigger a punishment phase by setting an appropriate pricing policy. However our focus in this work is on mixed strategies.
                           

The kindness functions (7) and (8) use the Pareto efficient points to provide a reference point to measure how kind players are to each other. Notice that in our random access game model the stationary steady state strategies have been addressed and in fact the payoff matrix M is used to arrive at the suitable region for a mechanism designer. Therefore it is enough to consider the Pareto efficient region of a random access model where each user payoff is derived as

                        It means that the best response of user i in the unfair region is to increase the probability of transmission (or decrease the contention window size) with the increase in the number of collisions. This result can be utilized by a mechanism designer (base station) to change the network equilibrium by modifying the collision

                              =
                              
                                 
                                    θ
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                    +
                                    θ
                                 
                              
                           
                        . This means to have a suitable design that removes both highly inefficient and highly unfair equilibrium at the same time the designer should hit the number 
                           
                              θ
                           
                         exactly at a single point which is practically impossible. However this reciprocity model enables the mechanism designer to shift the network solution toward efficient and fair regions depend on the network situation. It provides users with incentive to punish the selfish behaviors, a characteristics the classic random access game is deprived of.

In the previous game theoretic analysis we addressed the single shot reciprocity medium access games. It was shown how reciprocity can empower the MAC games to remove the unfair/inefficient Nash equilibria. However it is not clear whether any Nash equilibrium exits for the game or not. If there exist any Nash equilibria, is it unique and does any simple learning mechanism exist that can converge to it? In this work we study the best response mechanism as the simplest strategy update mechanism. It is known that there are no general convergence results for classical random access games using these dynamics. We study how the introduced reciprocity element affects the learning dynamics.

In a practical multi player scenario users do not have the knowledge of each other collision costs 
                        
                           θ
                        
                     . Therefore let’s relax the assumption on the psychological utility of each user

                     Theorem 4.1 has two interesting results in terms of the stability and the fairness of MAC games:

First introducing reciprocity in MAC framework can help the random access games to achieve a unique Nash and therefore a stable equilibrium if the nodes acquire either small collision costs or high psychological sensitivity.

Second in a symmetric game where all nodes have the same collision cost 
                        
                           θ
                        
                      and psychological sensitivity 
                        
                           α
                        
                     , the game can reach a unique fair mixed equilibrium via the simple best response mechanism.

In the next chapter section we illustrate our assertions by conducting several simulations.

In Fig. 1

                     . Beyond the fairness threshold, the best strategy is to increase the transmission probability with the increase in the perceived channel collision probability

                      are simulated for networks of 5 and 10 nodes respectively. For simplicity it is assumed that

                     . The best response learning of Algorithm 1 is used. It is known that if the best response dynamics reach a steady state, then this state is a Nash equilibrium. As can be seen in Fig. 3a the best response of the nodes converges to a unique Nash equilibrium. Theorem 4.1 indicates the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium if

                                 ∑

                     . Fig. 3 a shows that the game converges to a unique Nash equilibrium even for a wider range of 
                        
                           θ
                        
                     , independent of the initialization. This is because Theorem 4.1 provides the sufficient condition for convergence to a unique Nash equilibrium but not the necessary condition. However, for increasing magnitude of 
                        
                           θ
                        
                      the game does not converge. In Fig. 3b we observe oscillation between pure strategies. This is because given a psychological sensitivity, with the increase in the collision cost users have less incentive to punish the unfair strategies and the unfair equilibria will not be eliminated. It is interesting to note that in the symmetric case of Fig. 3a, all nodes converge to the fair transmission strategy independent of the initial conditions

                      are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The results are the same as the symmetric case except that users with low collision cost end up with the higher transmission probability equilibrium.

                     . As it can be seen those who have the same collision costs end up with the same transmission probability. Also similar to the homogeneous case observations, for larger collision cost values the best response learning does not converge as it can be seen in Fig. 4b.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We introduce a notion of reciprocity in a MAC game and a corresponding fairness Nash equilibrium concept. The reciprocity can be considered as a “moral” correlation device that can shift the equilibrium of the game to the more desirable regions. Analysis shows that reciprocity can help the network to remove highly unfair/inefficient equilibria from the solutions. This, however, is dependent on suitable adjustment of the collision cost and psychological sensitivity. A mechanism designer can change the equilibrium of the network by intervening in the game and controlling certain parameters.

The best response learning mechanism for the reciprocity game converges to the unique and stable Nash equilibrium if users have low collision costs or high psychological sensitivity. For higher value of collision cost or lower psychological sensitivity users have less incentive to punish the unfair strategies and therefore the best response learning mechanism does not converge to a unique stable Nash equilibrium any more.
