                  Assuming that the proportion defective in a production process p is variable and the component lifetimes are Weibull distributed, integer nonlinear programming problems are formulated and solved in order to determine the optimum component inspection scheme by attributes for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration using available prior knowledge. A limited beta prior model is adopted to reflect the random fluctuations on p. The required quantity of components to test and the permissible number of component failures up to a specified censoring time are found by solving a minimisation problem with nonlinear constraints which are related to the tolerable average producer and consumer risks. First-order Taylor polynomials of the operating characteristic function are used to derive a quite accurate approximate solution. Lower and upper bounds are also deduced. Optimal solutions are usually robust to small variations in the Weibull parameters and prior information. Existing technical knowledge and experience are shown to be of great practical value in designing optimal sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes. The proposed approach generalises the classical viewpoint to those cases in which appreciable prior information on the fraction of defective systems exists, and also allows the analyst to determine the acceptability of a k-out-of-n:F system before assembly and to limit the range of p. Moreover, the practitioners may attain substantial savings in sample size and improved assessments of the true producer and consumer risks. A 4-out-of-5:F system of independent water pumps for cooling a reactor is considered to illustrate the suggested component test plans.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The design of sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes plays a fundamental role in industrial quality control and reliability analysis. Traditionally, a submitted lot of material is accepted or rejected on the basis of the experimental information provided by a random sample of test units. Acceptance inspection schemes usually specify the optimum sample size, test statistic and decision rule. In most cases, a constrained optimisation problem must be solved in order to determine the best sampling scheme. Acceptance test plans covering a wide range of situations are available in the scientific literature. Some recent references include Chen, Li, and Lam (2007), Fernández (2005, 2008, 2011), Arizono, Kawamura, and Takemoto (2008), Seo, Jung, and Kim (2009), Fernández and Pérez-González (2012a) and Wu, Aslam, and Jun (2012).

A common approach in practice to improve the reliability of a system is to introduce component redundancy. Many complex systems have a k-out-of-n:F configuration, i.e. the system failure occurs as soon as k of its n redundant components fail. The so-called k-out-of-n:F systems occupy a prominent position in applied engineering due to their simplicity, economic advantage, and high reliability. The k-out-of-n:F structure and various generalisations have been widely discussed in recent decades. Papers by Yamamoto, Akiba, Nagatsuka, and Moriyama (2008), Fernández (2010a, 2014a), Wang, Li, Huang, and Chang (2012), Xiang and Levitin (2012), Levitin, Xing, and Dai (2014), Wells (2014) and Xie, Liao, and Jin (2014) are just a sample.

System-based component testing is quite common in practice because it offers significant advantages in terms of time, effort and cost. System-level tests are frequently more complex, expensive and time-consuming. System reliability demonstration using component test data has been extensively studied in the literature, starting with the original paper by Gal (1974), and followed by the work of Mazumdar (1977, 1980), Yan and Mazumdar (1986, 1987), Easterling, Mazumdar, Spencer, and Diegert (1991), Rajgopal and Mazumdar (1988, 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 1997), Altınel and Özekici (1998), Rajgopal, Mazumdar, and Majety (1999), Altınel, Özekici, and Feyzioglu (2001) and Feyzioglu, Altınel, and Özekici (2008). Previous research generally assumes series or parallel systems with exponential component failures times, testing with replacement, and classical/frequentist risks to derive minimum-cost test plans. Recently, Bayramoglu (2013) studied the reliability of k-out-of-n complex system with two components per element. This paper considers k-out-of-n:F Weibull systems, testing without replacement, and average producer and consumer risks with a limited beta prior on the fraction nonconforming, and presents a computational procedure to determine the optimal sample size and decision criterium based on the number of component failures up to a given censoring time.

Reliability test plans for Weibull distributions are routinely carried out in industry; see the recent papers by Chen et al. (2007), Arizono et al. (2008), Seo et al. (2009), Fernández, Pérez-González, Aslam, and Jun (2011), Fernández and Pérez-González (2012b) and Pérez-González and Fernández (2013), and references therein. In our case, the design of the acceptance plan is stated as a constrained optimisation problem which minimises the required sample size while ensuring that specified maximum average producer and consumer risks on system reliability are not exceeded. Integer nonlinear programming problems are solved to find optimal sample sizes and decision criteria. The suggested approach constitutes a well-founded alternative to classical perspectives because it requires less sample data to achieve the same protection to producers and consumers than methods based only on sampling theory. Our viewpoint is extremely advantageous when considering the expenses associated with testing procedures. It is well-known that the use of substantial prior information can significantly increase the quality of the inferential methods; see, e.g., Fernández (2006b, 2010c, 2012, 2014b), Aktekin and Caglar (2013), Aktekin (2014), Ausín, Galeano, and Ghosh (2014) and Ensthaler and Giebe (2014).

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides the reliability function of a k-out-of-n:F system with Weibull distributed component lifetimes. Section 3 presents attributes component test plans to demonstrate whether system reliability has met the required level. The corresponding operating characteristic function is deduced in Section 4. A limited beta distribution on the true proportion nonconforming, as well as average risks and operating characteristic functions, is used in Section 5 to incorporate available prior knowledge on the manufacturing process. Section 6 deals with the design of optimal time-censored component test plans for k-out-of-n:F Weibull systems using prior information. The underlying integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated. An approximate global solution and a procedure for solving the minimisation problem are proposed. Lower and upper bounds on the optimal sample size and acceptance number are also derived. A system of water pumps for cooling a reactor is considered in Section 7 for illustrative purposes. The paper then offers a brief discussion and some conclusions in Section 8.

                     The Weibull distribution is one of the most important parametric models for the life-length of materials and devices, and includes as a special case the exponential distribution, which has an important function in reliability engineering; e.g., Fernández (2004, 2006a, 2010b), Mercier (2007), Pérez-González and Fernández (2009) and Li and Lin (2013).

The Weibull distribution is extremely flexible in fitting lifetime data because it encompasses both increasing

The shape parameter is customarily tied to the failure mechanism, i.e., s is assumed to be a known constant in many situations. In practice, this constant may be a widely accepted value for the problem under consideration or may come from previous or related data.

Since T coincides with the kth order statistic from the n component failure times, the pdf of the system lifetime is defined by

A basic assumption in classical inspection by attributes is that the fraction nonconforming p is constant. In many production processes, however, all components do not have an equal chance of being defective. In other words, there is often no reason to assume that p is a fixed number. Expert judgment and historical evidence can be used to assess a prior distribution on p. In most cases, existing technical knowledge and experience will be of great practical value in designing optimal sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes.

Since the beta distribution is the prevailing probability model to reflect the random fluctuations in the proportion defective and accurate information about lower and upper bounds on p is commonly available in reliability analysis, a limited beta

                         in the classical setting, i.e., when prior knowledge is discarded. In general, our approach significantly decreases the required sample size. Hence, the use of relevant prior information on the fraction defective is particularly attractive when test components are expensive or scarce.

According to Tables 1 and 2, the incorporation of available prior knowledge on p provides appreciable savings in sample size. For example, if 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              2.5
                           
                         and the prior information is assumed, the best inspection schemes for a 4-out-of-5:F system are (23,6), (19,6) and (15,6) when 
                           
                              r
                              =
                              0.9
                              ,
                              1.0
                           
                         and 1.1, respectively. If prior knowledge on p is discarded, i.e. adopting the frequentist perspective, the corresponding optimal plans would be (31,9), (25,9) and (19,8). The reduction in sample size due to the use of prior information is clearly significant.

A system of five water pumps for cooling a reactor was considered by Fernández (2010a). The water pumps are identical and act independently, and the failure of the system occurs as soon as four pumps fail, i.e., the system operates if at least two pumps function. Hence, the system has a k-out-of-n:F structure with

Fig. 1 displays the average producer and consumer OC functions for the sampling plan (29,6). Producer risks versus acceptable quality levels for the inspection scheme (29,6) when prior information is assumed or discarded are shown in Fig. 4

                      shows the corresponding consumer risks versus rejectable quality levels. In view of Figs. 4 and 5, it is clear that the producer and consumer risks drop when prior information is taken into account.

The design of optimal decision rules for acceptance of complex systems based on component test plans is an extremely practical and essential part of industrial reliability and quality control. Component test plans are almost always faster, cheaper and less complicated than system-level tests. System-based component testing is highly desirable from the practitioner perspective because the entire system need not be previously assembled and allows the assembly of the system to be postponed until a given high reliability at a certain fixed mission time can be assured. In this way, the acceptability of a system may be determined prior to assembly.

Essentially, the determination of the most efficient criterion for accepting or rejecting a lot of components can be formulated as an optimisation problem subject to several constraints often imposed by the producer and the consumer. A reliability sampling plan for lot acceptance purposes usually prescribes how many components must be placed on test, for how long and under what stress conditions (humidity, voltage, temperature, etc.), as well as for which values of the observed test statistic the submitted lot must be accepted.

In industrial manufacturing, even when the production process is stable, there is normally no reason to assume that the fraction defective p is constant. The adoption of a prior distribution on p is often beneficial in sampling inspection. Given that prior evidence suggesting that p is quite low is fairly common, this paper assumed a limited beta distribution with a reduced parameter space 
                        
                           (
                           c
                           ,
                           d
                           )
                        
                      to describe the stochastic behaviour of p. This prior model allows the engineer the flexibility to include precise limits of p into the decision analysis.

Assuming that the component lifetime distribution is Weibull, an integer nonlinear programming problem has been formulated and solved in the present paper in order to find the acceptance sampling plan with smallest sample size for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration based on a time-censored component inspection scheme by attributes and prior information that entails sufficiently small average producer and consumer risks. Nearly exact approximations to the optimal sample size and acceptance number are also deduced. A submitted lot is accepted whenever the number of observed failures by a prespecified censoring time

In general, the incorporation of prior knowledge on p yields a more effective use of information provided by the production process, and therefore a more realistic assessment of the actual producer and consumer risks, as well as appreciable savings in sample size. The use of relevant prior information is therefore especially important when test components are expensive or scarce.

The proposed attributes component test plans are quite insensitive to slight modifications in the Weibull parameters and the prior information, and are particularly advisable when it is economically inconvenient to test a whole system.

The influence of the prior information on the optimal sampling plan is moderate when c and d are close to
