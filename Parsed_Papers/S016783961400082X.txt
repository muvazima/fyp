                      curve interpolation using a special type of discrete logarithmic spirals. A “logarithmic arc spline” is defined as a set of smoothly connected circular arcs. The arcs of a logarithmic arc spline have equal angles and the curvatures of the arcs form a geometric sequence. Given two points together with two unit tangents at the points, interpolation of logarithmic arc splines with a user specified winding angle is formulated into finding the positive solutions to a vector equation. A practical algorithm is developed for computing the solutions and construction of interpolating logarithmic arc splines. Compared to known methods for logarithmic spiral interpolation, the proposed method has the advantages of unbounded winding angles, simple offsets and NURBS representation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Spirals, which have monotone curvatures, find wide applications in the fields of fair shape modeling, highway route design or artistic pattern design, etc. (Meek and Walton, 1992; Wang et al., 2004; Xu and Mould, 2009; Meek et al., 2012). Particularly, the clothoid spiral (also known as the Euler spiral) whose curvature is a linear function of its arc length, has often been used as a primary tool for curve completion or fair shape modeling (Kimia et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2012). Another popular spiral is the logarithmic spiral whose radius of curvature is a linear function of its arc length. The study of logarithmic spirals goes back to Descartes and Jacob Bernoulli (Davis, 1993). Logarithmic spirals have many elegant properties and can be used to model fair shapes as well as natural objects (Harary and Tal, 2011).

As a generalization of Euler spirals and logarithmic spirals, Miura (2006) proposed a general equation for log-aesthetic curves. By choosing different values for a particular parameter, one can define various spirals by the equation. Except for a few special cases like circles, evaluation of log-aesthetic curves depends on numerical integration or computation of special functions (Ziatdinov et al., 2012a). If boundary points and tangents are given first, parameters for an interpolating spiral are usually determined by solving nonlinear systems or by searching strategies (Coope, 1992; Miura, 2000; Yoshida and Saito, 2006; Ziatdinov et al., 2012b).

Inspired by the fact that log-aesthetic curves are usually computed numerically or approximated by other types of curves such as polynomials or rational polynomials, one can construct interpolating spirals discretely or using polynomials directly (Baumgarten and Farin, 1997; Yoshida and Saito, 2009; Walton and Meek, 2013; Yoshida et al., 2013). Polynomials or rational polynomials that have approximate linear plots of log curvatures are quasi-log-aesthetic spirals. These spirals can be evaluated explicitly. However, these curves are not log-aesthetic spirals exactly and many quasi-log-aesthetic spirals have to be pieced together when a high accuracy of approximation is desired. Geometric Hermite interpolating curves with minimal energy can generate fair shapes (Yong and Cheng, 2004), but the Euler spiral and the logarithmic spiral are of special interest in shape modeling.

In this paper we consider

                      Hermite interpolation by logarithmic arc splines. Our proposed algorithm is motivated by the equiangular property of logarithmic spirals and the high accuracy approximation of spirals by arc splines (Meek and Walton, 1999). By assuming that a logarithmic spiral is approximated by a sequence of smoothly connected circular arcs of equal angles and the curvatures or radii of curvatures of all arcs form a geometric sequence, we obtain a logarithmic arc spline.

                      Hermite interpolation by logarithmic arc splines can be formulated as solving the free parameters from a simple equation. All solutions to the equation can be obtained using an efficient numerical method. As opposed to previous approaches which assumed bounded winding angles and unique interpolating curves, we have no such restrictions and all interpolating curves to the given boundary data can be obtained efficiently. As offsets of circular arcs are circular arcs, the offsets of logarithmic arc splines are easy to compute. Logarithmic arc splines and their offsets can be represented by NURBS or transformed into curvature continuous curves conveniently (Yang, 2004). Therefore, the proposed curve can be used as an efficient tool for shape modeling and CNC machining.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews important properties of logarithmic spirals and proposes a definition of a logarithmic arc spline. Section 3 describes basic formulations of

Logarithmic spiral has several distinguished properties which make it a powerful tool for shape modeling. The clear or easily proved properties are listed with no proof.


                        
                           Property 2.1
                           
                              The angle between any radial line and the tangent line that passes through the same point does not change when the point moves along the logarithmic spiral.
                           

This property is also known as the equiangular property, which was first observed by Rene Descartes. In particular, the angle φ between the radial line and the tangent line is computed by 
                           λ
                           =
                           cot
                           ⁡
                           φ
                        , where λ is the parameter as in Eq. (1).

                              If a sequence of points are sampled from a logarithmic spiral with a constant winding angle between every two neighboring samples, the curvatures at the sampled points form a geometric sequence.
                           

It is noted that the points sampled with a constant winding angle from a logarithmic spiral also form a discrete logarithmic spiral. However, this curve is only

                         continuous. A practical algorithm for Hermite interpolation by this curve will also be given.

As a discrete approximation to the logarithmic spiral, a logarithmic arc spline is consisting of a sequence of smoothly connected circular arcs of which the center angles are the same and the curvatures form a geometric sequence. In particular, if all arcs are quater-circles and the growth rate of arc radii equals to the golden ratio, the logarithmic arc spline is a discrete approximation to the golden spiral.

It is proved in Meek and Walton (1999) that a spiral segment can be approximated by a spiral arc spline with a high accuracy when the arc number is a large number. We check the convergence of approximating logarithmic arc splines numerically. An original logarithmic spiral is defined by 
                           r
                           (

                        . We approximate the spiral by constructing logarithmic arc splines that interpolate the boundary data of the original spiral. Details of logarithmic arc spline interpolation will be given in next section. Fig. 2
                         illustrates the initial spiral and an interpolating logarithmic arc spline that consists of 10 or 40 arcs. Approximation errors using various numbers of circular arcs are given in Table 1
                        . From the table we can see that the approximation of a logarithmic spiral by an interpolating logarithmic arc spline appears to converge quadratically. However, a theoretical analysis is still not available at present.

For given boundary data and a specified winding angle ϕ which satisfies Eq. (4), we construct an interpolating logarithmic arc spline consisting of n segments of circular arcs. From the definition of logarithmic arc spline the center angle of each circular arc can be chosen as

                           =
                           
                              ϕ

                              . From the expressions of the coefficients of Eq. (7) we know that the signs of a, b, c and d change three times. Based on Descartes' rule of signs we know that Eq. (7) can have one or three positive roots.

                         and

                        , respectively. So, the initial value for the solution should lie in the corresponding interval too. To find a solution in interval

                         Hermite data with a big winding angle. As this spiral is in fact a rational function composed of logarithmic spiral and Möbius map, it is not exactly the logarithmic spiral generally. Our proposed logarithmic arc spline can approximate a continuous logarithmic spiral with a high accuracy and maintains many elegant properties of logarithmic spirals. Due to its flexibility and simplicity for computation, logarithmic arc splines can be used in fields of design and modeling.

In this section we present a few more examples to show the applicability of logarithmic arc spline interpolation for various shape modeling purposes.

First, we present examples to model a “C”-shape curve and a blade profile by logarithmic arc spline interpolation. To model a “C”-like shape users can just input four points plus four tangents; see Fig. 6
                     (a). From the figure we can see that the end tangents at two pairs of neighboring points lie on one side of the chord while the tangents for the rest two pairs of neighboring points lie on two sides of the corresponding chord. By choosing

                      and 
                        n
                        =

                              G

                      smooth curve consisting of 32 circular arcs is obtained. By the same technique we model a blade profile by logarithmic arc spline interpolation. Starting from 6 input points together with 6 unit tangents at the points (Fig. 6(b)), the minimum winding angles for the curves interpolating each pair of consequent points and tangents are first computed. After then, an interpolating arc spline consisting of total 18 circular arcs is obtained by interpolating 6 pairs of Hermite data.

Next, we present an example of curve interpolation using single-winding as well as multi-winding logarithmic arc splines. A sequence of initial points and tangents are given in Fig. 7
                     (a). For each pair of consequent points together with the unit tangents at the points the angles between the tangents and the chord are

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have introduced logarithmic arc splines which are tangent smooth and have similar properties of logarithmic spirals. Logarithmic arc splines can approximate logarithmic spirals with high accuracies when the numbers of arcs are sufficiently large. Given two points together with two unit tangents at the points, a practical algorithm is developed to construct interpolating logarithmic arc splines with a specified winding angle. By formulating the interpolation problem as solving a vector equation, all solutions to the equation and all logarithmic arc splines that interpolate the boundary data can be obtained. As compared with previous logarithmic spiral interpolation schemes, the proposed method can be used to construct interpolating spirals with unbounded winding angles. It also benefits that the obtained curves are compatible with NURBS and the offsets are simple to compute.
