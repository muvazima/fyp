                  The wireless sensor networks deployed in hostile environments suffer from a high rate of node failures. Such failures may convert a fully-connected sensor network into multiple disjoint sub-networks, leading to the network partition problem. The placement of relay nodes is the only way to restore the lost connectivity because these devices, compared to the sensor nodes, have a higher energy backup, with a longer communication range. In this paper, a new solution is proposed to heal the network partition problem in the wireless sensor network. The solution is based on a zero gradient point inside the convex hull polygon. The proposed solution is compared with various naive approaches, along with existing state-of-the-art solutions, that is, the Spider Web-1C heuristic and Steiner-minimum-tree based optimal relay node placement algorithm. The simulation experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have started playing an important role in the life of human beings through different applications. WSN applications such as combat field reconnaissance, border protection, space exploration, etc. operate in the harshest environments, resulting in reduction of risk to human life [1–3]. Since a sensor node is typically limited in its communication resources, a large count of sensor nodes is required to ensure full area coverage and further increase fidelity of the collected data [2]. Due to the small form factor and limited on-board energy supply, a sensor node is very much prone to failure and sometimes results in damage of the sensor nodes on a large scale, leading to the network partition problem in the network. Such a failure may convert a connected network into multiple disjoint segments. For example, some sensor nodes may be damaged after a snow or a sand storm or on the battlefield, a part of the deployment area may be attacked by the enemy explosives and, thus a set of sensor nodes in the vicinity may get destroyed (it is assumed that terrain is not destroyed) and the network gets converted into different disjoint sub-networks. For example, Fig. 1
                      shows a partitioned network after the failure of the large scale sensor nodes in the network. In this figure, eight disjoint segments are formed and represented by Seg1 to Seg8 in the partitioned WSN. The biggest challenge in such a type of scenario is to reconnect these disjoint segments with a small count of high power relay nodes. Therefore, repairing of such partitioned networks has become a current research area in WSN. A Relay Node (RN) is a more robust as well as a capable node with a significantly higher energy reserve and longer communication range (r) than the sensor nodes. RNs can, in principle, be equipped with sensor circuitry perform mainly the valuable data aggregation and data forwarding. Unlike sensor nodes, RNs may be mobile and can have some navigation capabilities. Therefore, RNs are preferred for network partition recovery because these nodes compared to sensor nodes are more easily and accurately placed in the disjoint sub-networks. Their radio range (r) is even higher, which can facilitate and expedite the lost connectivity restoration among the disjoint segments, effectively and efficiently. RNs being more expensive, a small count of RNs should be used for recovering the lost connectivity in the partitioned network. A small number of RNs can be found using the Steiner Minimum Tree with Minimum number of Steiner Points and Bounded Edge Length (SMT-MSPBEL), but it is shown to be an NP-hard problem for the large scale WSN [4,5]. Hence, a polynomial time solution is needed for an efficient recovery of the partitioned network. In this research paper, a similar type of network partition problem is considered and explored. The distinction of our proposedolution is that the network partition problem is addressed and solved by using a global zero gradient point inside the convex hull polygon, which has not been seen yet in any other published literature. In a similar work [14], the authors have considered a global minima based geo-cast routing technique for data dissemination to reduce data transmission distances between the nodes to enhance the network lifetime. However, the authors do not consider the network partition problem in their proposed solution, which is a very common problem in an unattended WSN. At the outset, our main contributions in this paper are:
                        
                           1.
                           Two naive approaches and two state-of-the-art heuristics are implemented along with our proposed solution to retrieve the lost connectivity of the partitioned WSN.

The proposed solution works perfectly for any number of disjoint segments without checking the angles between the edges of the disjoint segments which is a constraint in Discrete Fermat point based approach (i.e. SMT-ORC approach [5]).

The proposed solution is different from any other published partition recovery solutions (i.e. ORC-SMT, Spider Web-1C) because it considers global zero gradient point inside the convex hull polygon to find an optimal point for the placement of RNs, instead of taking three non-collinear disjoint segments at all times.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, related work is described. Section 3 gives the problem statement and describes our system model. In Section 4, details about the proposed solution are given. In Section 5, pseudo code is shown and explained. Section 6 gives an overview of various proposed state-of-the-art approaches for comparison purpose. In Section 7, performance evaluation through simulation experiments is described to prove the usefulness of our proposed solution, followed by conclusion in Section 8.

Many approaches have been suggested in the last five years to heal the network partition problem due to failure of single cut-vertex-node in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs)/WSNs. Also, few solutions have been suggested to recover partitioned network due to failure of large scale nodes in WSNs. The authors of [2,3] have performed a comprehensive study of the network partition recovery solutions in WSANs/WSNs to describe the current research gaps in this domain. All suggested approaches are classified into two broad categories: (a) centralized approaches, and (b) distributed or semi-distributed approaches. This classification is further divided into three different sub-categories, i.e. proactive, reactive and hybrid approaches. Under proactive sub-category, few new solutions have been proposed to deal with the network partition problem due to failure of the single cut-vertex-node. A similar type of classification is proposed for reactive and hybrid approaches. In all proposed solutions, controlled node mobility has been suggested to restore the lost connectivity of the partitioned network. For instance, in [6], a robot called Packbot is used to serve as a mobile RN. The use of robot enables the recovery of partitioned network, or break links. An algorithm is proposed to determine the trajectory of a moving robot in the network. A similar type of work is presented by Wang et al. [7]. The authors have suggested mobile RNs within 2-hop of the sink in the network to restore the lost connectivity of the partitioned network. Unlike [6], the idea is that the RNs do not need to travel the long distance in the network to save their energy. However, use of Packbots and similar types of devices is inefficient due to unexpected delays in data delivery, even if multiple such devices are used in the network. Another reason is the slow motion of these devices to cover every individually best point in the network.

Wang et al. [8] exploited the node controlled mobility in order to cover the coverage-holes that are not covered by sensor nodes during their initial deployment. The idea behind their proposed work is to identify some spare nodes from different parts of the network, which can be relocated to the coverage-hole places in the network. Since moving a node for a long distance can drain significant node power, a cascaded movement is suggested, if sufficient number of spare sensor nodes is available on the way. Finding spare nodes in the network is another critical issue in this proposed approach. Some centralized/semi-centralized approaches have been suggested to handle a large scale node failure in WSN, by using cascaded control mobility of the nodes.

In [9], partition recovery problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). The objective of the ILP based optimization model is to form a connected topology while minimizing the individual traveling distance of the involved nodes. The authors of [10] strive to restore lost connectivity by using a Multi-Integer Linear Program (MILP) based transportation network flow model. The proposed idea is to restore the lost connectivity by observing the minimum traveling distance of the actor nodes with the assumption that every actor node should be able to reach all destinations, i.e. all other nodes’ positions, when the repairing of lost connectivity is needed. Due to the centralized nature, this approach does not scale well. Another similar approach is proposed by Sentruk et al. [11] to improve the scalability problem by reducing the number of candidate locations. A node placement algorithm is proposed to find the set of locations which can guarantee the lost connectivity, if the RNs are deployed at these locations.

Vemulapalli et al. [12] have described another distributed approach based upon the knowledge of full paths of nodes to the sink node. The pre-failure route information is used to determine the location of the failed nodes in the network. Thus, upon partition, many nodes can attempt to re-establish the breached path towards the sink node by moving to the next hop location. Therefore, recovery cost will be high. To limit the recovery cost, the recovery process elects only one node as a leader node based upon its distance from the failed node or sink node. When the leader node moves towards the sink, a cascaded movement of nodes within the partition is also required in order to sustain intra-segment connectivity. Another approach based on game theory is suggested by Senturk et al. [13] by assuming the complete knowledge of the location of partitions, number of partitions, and failed nodes. Each partition is used as a player in the game. The payoff function is calculated based on the nodes’ degree which elects a partition representative

                     . The elected

                                 a
                              
                           
                        
                      opts to maximize the payoff of its partition which motivates the partitions to move towards each other. Due to the centralized nature of this approach, each representative node must know the payoff function of the other partitions and eventually network reaches the Nash equilibrium when all partitions are connected with each other. Lee et al. [14] proposed another optimized solution based on QoS parameters while repairing the disconnected network. Recently, Shiow-Fen et al. [15] proposed a 2-connected RN’s placement scheme to repair the disjoint WSN by assuming the complete knowledge of the partitioned network. Thus, after the partition, nodes can attempt to recover the path with any other node or with a calculated node depending upon the angle between the various segments. Thus, again, there is an issue of deployment of a large number of RNs to recover from the partitioned network.

Recently, two major heuristics have been suggested in the literature. In the first, the authors have considered the bio-inspired heuristic and proposed a spider web like RNs placement technique known as Spider Web-1C approach [4] within the disjoint segments that are located on the perimeter of the network. The proposed idea is to form the stronger connectivity (i.e. 2-connectivity among the nodes), achieve better coverage of the network and also enable balanced distribution of traffic load on the employed RNs. One of the main advantages of Spider Web-1C solution is that it connects the impaired network efficiently and effectively; but the major concern in the Spider Web-1C is the placement of a large number of RNs for the recovery of partitioned network.

The second approach is based on the Steiner Minimum Tree (SMT) called ORC-SMT [5]. The key idea proposed by the authors is the use of SMT to find a midpoint by considering three non-collinear outer disjoint segments at a time, which are formed after applying the convex hull algorithm recursively in the cyclic fashion. The points thus obtained are then applied recursively to find more Steiner Minimum Points (SMPs) for RNs placement. Thus, the multiple points, which are in radio range of RN, then become a single point for the placement of the RN. In this way, the procedure repeats itself till all outer disjoint segments are less than three segments. After that, RNs are placed on these calculated points by applying Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm such as Kruskal or Prim algorithm. The main advantage of ORC-SMT is that it connects various disjoint segments quickly and efficiently. But the main issue with the proposed solutions [4,5] is the number of placed RNs to connect disjoint segments.

In the system model, we assume a connected network in which a large number of sensor nodes are randomly deployed throughout the area of interest. The harsh environment of the application like sensor nodes deployed in a battlefield for field monitoring, where deployed nodes may be destroyed by enemy explosives (assume that terrain is not destroyed), causes the failure of the large scale nodes, which may generate multiple disjoint partitions of the connected network. The following assumptions are taken in the simulation experiments without losing generality:
                        
                           1.
                           All RNs are having a good battery backup and are under the direct control of a sink node.

The sink node can detect the failure of a large scale node in the network.

The network is obstacle free for the movement of RNs during the recovery process.

The sink node has sufficient number of RNs for partition recovery.

The failure of RNs does not occur during the recovery process.

The problem can be defined as follows: “N sensor nodes, which know their positions using some localization algorithm, are randomly deployed in an area of interest (AOI). Let us assume that j disconnected sub-networks are formed as a result of failure of a large scale node in the network. Each sub-network

                     . Our goal is to implement a solution that will ensure the lost connectivity among the disconnected sub-networks

                     and recover the impaired network by deploying a minimum number of RNs with their less recovery time, and thus, create a new connected network”.

Our proposed solution, unlike ORC-SMT, considers 
                        
                           n
                           -
                        
                     sided polygon of disjoint segments and finds a point, i.e. P, where gradient of all disjoint vertices or segments become zero inside the polygon, instead of calculating individual SMT using three non-collinear disjoint segments at a time. RRLC-GBP exploits the polygon property of the disjoint segments for deploying the RNs towards the calculated point P. In ORC-SMT approach, the calculated point behaves like a Discrete Fermat point

                      is a point within an equilateral triangle at which the sum of the distances between a calculated point and all three vertices of the triangle is minimized [16]).

RRLC-GBP observes three steps for the recovery of lost connectivity of the partitioned WSN:

Our proposed solution finds the point sets for each of the sub-networks with the random selection of any point inside the disjoint segments and then proposes its corresponding convex hull polygon. Therefore, the obtained convex hull polygons are small size polygons which consist of every point of the formed sub-networks as shown in Fig. 2
                                       . In this figure, six disjoint segments are shown with convex hull sub- polygons and their representative nodes are situated at the periphery of the respective polygon. The calculated points on the observed convex hull polygons are closer to other sub convex hull polygons than the points that are inside the corresponding convex hull polygons as shown in Fig. 2 (i.e. the points which are connected with lines). These outer points are considered as

                           . Then, it must lie on one half plane of the polygon whose boundary is the line joining two vertices

                              Placement of RNs to heal lost connectivity of partitioned network
                           

After identification of a point P at which the gradient of disjoint sub-networks becomes zero inside the polygon, the proposed solution will deploy RNs towards the calculated point to heal the lost connectivity. However, the number of RNs to join the sub-networks depends upon the distance

                      of any vertex from point P. Let r be the radio range of an actor node, the proposed solution RRLC-GBP deploys the RNs from each vertex towards point P at a distance

                     . The proposed solution is centralized in nature and a greedy strategy is proposed to deploy RNs towards point P from each segment. To achieve the task of the placement of RNs, the following sub-steps are suggested in the proposed solution:
                        
                           1.

                                             ,

                               and mark this observed location as the occupied position. After reaching the target position, RN will periodically broadcast its status to the sink node, either directly or through deploying RNs for its connectivity as mentioned earlier. It is quite obvious that more than one RN may approach for the same position, but these RNs will compete with each other by their cost (i.e. distance). Therefore, one with a lower cost will win and keep moving towards the calculated position. Likewise, the RNs having highest cost will reselect the new destination in the network after refreshing their list of locations. In case of tie, node ID is used to break the tie.

Each RN will repeat steps 2–4 until it reaches its calculated destination.

In this way, the disjoint sub-networks are contracted into a new connected network. A repaired topology (i.e. reconnected) is shown in Fig. 7
                     . In this figure, the outer segments are shown with blue symbols and red symbols are used to represent the inner segments (or inner terminals). The green symbols are the deployed RNs to connect the disjoint segments (or outer terminals). After the identification of the failure of large scale sensor nodes as suggested in the pseudo code, RRLC-GBP identifies the representative nodes and deploys RNs from each representative node towards the calculated point (a zero gradient point). As depicted in Fig. 7, a point with coordinates (2, 5) in the plotted graph after simulation for one topology is observed as the zero gradient point for the deployment of RNs. The inner segments will also deploy RNs towards nearby deployed RNs to connect quickly. All positions of the deployed RNs are calculated from the simulation scenario and values are plotted to show the actual deployment in the proposed solution as shown in Fig. 7.

                           , if it wins the competition (i.e. distance). In case the RN loses the competition, it will not move from its original position and reselect another position calculated by the sink node. Therefore, every time an RN is selected, it will move to the calculated location in the partitioned network. Thus, all the calculated locations will eventually be occupied by RNs, if sufficient RNs are available to the sink node. Therefore, the proposed solution restores the lost connectivity successfully and terminates assuredly.□

This section describes the pseudo code of RRLC-GBP to heal lost connectivity due to the failure of large scale nodes in the network.

The pseudo code of the proposed RRLC-GBP is shown in Fig. 8
                     . Before actual placement of RNs in the partitioned network, RRLC-GBP forms a convex hull polygon of the outer disjoint segments and computes

A brief description of some solutions, used for comparison with our proposed solution, is given below:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              Basic Deployment (BD): It is a very basic naïve approach in which the isolated segments will apply the Graham Scan, i.e. convex hull algorithm in the partitioned network to form a closed polygon. Outer segments will deploy the RNs on the periphery of the convex hull in circular fashion. Similarly, the inner segments will deploy the RNs towards the nearest placed RN. Due to the centralized nature of this proposed solution, all segments must know the location of its up-front segments. As depicted in Fig. 9
                              , the outer segments are represented by red squares situated on the boundary of the network and inner segments are shown with green symbols. More precisely, red symbols are outer representative nodes. The algorithm will deploy RNs from one outer segment to another segment and inner segment will deploy RNs towards the nearby deployed RN as discussed earlier. In this way, the segmented network will get connected. As mentioned above, it is assumed that all nodes know the complete topology of the network before the partition occurs in the network. The main issue in this proposed approach is the number of required RNs for healing the lost connectivity.


                              Center Deployment with Convex Hull (CDCH): In this proposed solution, outer segment nodes are firstly calculated in a similar way as done in our proposed RRLC-GBP. Then, the obtained outer segment nodes will calculate the representative nodes

                               will apply the convex hull algorithm to form a closed polygon of the outer segments. Further, each representative node of the outer segment will deploy the RNs towards CoD. Moreover, the inner representative node will deploy the RNs towards the nearest deployed RNs as shown in Fig. 10
                              . In this figure, the outer segments are represented with red symbols and inner segments are shown with blue symbols. Green symbols are the deployed RNs to stitch the disjoint segments (or outer terminals). All locations of RNs are computed through simulation experiments and values are plotted to show the actual deployment in this solution. After the final deployment, RNs are connected to a point CoD as depicted in Fig. 10. The main advantage of CDCH is that it requires a small count of RNs placements compared with BD approach, although it is a centralized approach. The main problem with this proposed approach is that it shows less scalability for large scale network. The CoD can be computed as given below:

                              Spider Web-1C heuristic: The key idea behind Spider Web-1C deployment strategy [4] is to place the RNs inside the damaged area to yield lost connectivity and improve the coverage in the best way. To balance the inter-segment path length in terms of the number of hops, RNs are placed near the estimated center of mass (CoM) of the segments. Basically, from each partition to CoM, Spider Web-1C will gradually deploy the RNs until all the partitions are connected effectively. In this way, Spider Web-1C not only improves the total coverage of the network, but also reduces the possible number of cut-vertex-nodes in the network. Before the actual placement of RNs in the partitioned network, Spider Web-1C firstly identifies the outer segments in AOI. To do this, it randomly picks

                               on convex hull polygon, Spider Web-1C calculates the CoM of the polygons as discussed earlier in CDCH. Then, RNs are deployed on the line between a segment and CoM. Obviously, the RNs around the CoM will be in the communication range of each other, and all disjoint segments will connect. Fig. 11
                               shows the pictorial representation of repairing network with Spider Web-1C heuristic approach. In this figure, the outer segments are shown with red color symbols and inner segments are represented by blue symbols. After the identification of outer and inner segments, the outer segment deploys RN on left and right sides of the calculated point of the disjoint segments and inner segment deploys RN towards nearby placed RN like CDCH. The locations of the RNs are calculated through simulation experiments and computed values are plotted to show the actual deployment in the proposed solution as shown in Fig. 11. The main advantage of this proposed approach is that it requires a small number of RNs deployments to heal lost connectivity of the partitioned WSN compared with BD and CDCH approaches.


                              Optimal Relay Node Placement Algorithm using Steiner Minimum Tree (SMT) on Convex Hull (ORC-SMT): ORC-SMT [5] pursues greedy heuristic that has two phases: (1) To identify the Steiner points (SPs) at which RNs have to be placed, and (2) add additional RNs in order to form a fully connected inter SPs topology while taking the communication range (r) of an RN into consideration. The first phase has further two main sub-steps that are used till all required SPs are computed. In the first sub-step, ORC applies the convex hull to identify the boundary disjoint segments. Then, SPs that connect every three non-collinear neighboring boundary disjoint segments are identified. These SPs are called first tier SPs. Furthermore, the convex hull algorithm is applied to identify boundary for the unengaged segments. These boundary terminals are then used in the second round to identify second tier SPs. Likewise, third tier SPs are identified based on the second tier SPs and so on. In other words, two sub-steps are applied recursively for m rounds until the number of points considered for computing a convex hull is less than three or they form a complete graph in terms of r of an RN. The authors assumed that there exist at least three non-collinear segments in the network such that the convex hull forms a closed polygon.

In the second phase, ORC-SMT stitches the disjoint segments with the identified SPs. Basically, every segment Segi identifies the closest SP and then RNs are placed on the line from Segi to such SP as shown in Fig. 12
                     , where RNs are placed from each outer segment to nearby SPs and algorithm terminates when placed RNs come in the range of each other for the recovering of lost connectivity. The same procedure is repeated for the first tier SP to connect them to the second tier and so on. Considering the segments as terminals, the convex hull of all disjoint segments is used to identify the boundary points which are represented by the blue symbols in the Fig. 12. The red symbols are used to show the inner segments (or inner terminals) and green symbols are the deployed RNs to stitch the disjoint segments (or outer terminals). The positions of the deployed RNs are calculated in the simulation scenario and values are plotted to show the actual deployment in the proposed solution. The main advantage of this suggested solution is that it uses a small number of RNs to connect the large damaged area.

                              Failure of ORC-SMT to convergence: During the experiments, it was observed that the ORC-SMT approach fails to converge when the number of outer disjoint segments is more than 5. This is due to the reason that in the randomly deployed topologies, when the number of outer segments increases more than 5, at least one interior angle of the Steiner triangle of SMT becomes greater than 60 degrees. The interior angle of a regular polygon can be calculated using the interior angle theorem of polygon i.e.

                              , where n is the number of sides of the polygon. The calculated Steiner Points (SPs) at which RNs have to be placed to join disjoint segments will lie on that vertex (triangle of SMT) whose interior angle is greater than 60 degrees as it is the property of the SMT. This questions the convergence ability of ORC-SMT towards the center of the deployment. The situation becomes more critical when structure of disjoint segments (i.e. convex hull polygon) starts taking the shape of a circle. In this case, many edges of the disjoint segments will have an interior angle greater than 60 degrees and, therefore, the ORC-SMT solution will choose only these edge points and not the midpoint of three co-linear disjoint segments. To understand this concept, let us consider a disjoint structure as shown in Fig. 13
                              , where six disjoint segments are situated at different locations in the network. It may be seen that if we consider any three non-collinear points (i.e. Seg1 to Seg6) to form an equilateral triangle to find an SP, then one of the interior angles of any observed equilateral triangle is greater than 60 degrees. The solution based on SMT i.e. ORC-SMT uses the same concept. For the example shown in Fig. 13, if we consider a triangle

                              ). Due to this reason, the ORC-SMT fails to converge towards the center of the deployment. It is thus clear that the ORC-SMT converges well only for a small number of disjoint segments (i.e. less than 5) because most of the edges will have an interior angle smaller than 60 degrees and these edges can use the property of SMT to find SPs towards the center of the deployment. The experimental results for ORC-SMT also confirm the same observation.

This section evaluates the performance of the proposed solution through simulation experiments. The simulation experiments act as a proof of the concept of the proposed solution. Using simulation experiments, it can be checked whether the proposed protocol adheres to its design requirements or not. The simulation is also used to show that the proposed solution outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches like ORC-SMT, CDCH and Spider Web-1C. The proposed solution is implemented and validated in C++ environment on NS2.34 [23]. The correctness proof is also shown in the paper. In the simulation, we consider a linear energy model where energy consumption due to the movement of the RNs is equal to 27.96J/m [8]. Table 1
                      shows the simulation parameters considered in the simulation experiments.

In the simulation experiments, 30 random topologies in the given area are taken with the number of outer and inner segments varying from 4 to 8, and 2 to 5 respectively. In order to study the impact of ron the performance of the given proposed approaches, it is varied between 50m and 200m. The results of individual experiments for these 30 topologies are then averaged. It is observed that with 95% confidence level, the results are within 5–10% of the sample mean. The following parameters are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              Number of placed RNs: This metric reports the total number of RNs that are required to heal the lost connectivity of the partitioned network. As aforementioned, RNs are usually more expensive than sensor nodes. Thus, this metric reflects the total cost of repairing of the partitioned network. Fig. 14
                              a and b show the required number of RNs while varying node radio range in the configuration. It is clear from the simulation graphs that ORC-SMT performs better than RRLC-GBP only when the number of partitions in the network is less than 5, as explained earlier. However, the proposed solution RRLC-GBP performs well for any number of disjoint segments as discussed earlier. BD approach shows a large number of RNs placements for repairing the partitioned network due to deployment of RNs on the border of the convex hull in circular fashion. Furthermore, Spider Web-1C shows similar results like RRLC-GBP as the node radio range is made higher. If we use a spider web structure to repair the impaired network and place RNs having larger radio range (i.e. 200m) in the Spider Web-1C, then it is observed that a small number of RNs will be required to connect the disjoint segments. This is due to the fact that the disjoint network will get connected much early without the need of continuous deployment of RNs till the CoM. This is also confirmed in the simulation results, as shown in Fig. 14a. However, if the RN radio range is made greater than 200m in Spider Web-1C, it will reduce the lifetime of the RNs and the network. Furthermore, the Spider Web-1C heuristic shows almost a similar performance like CDCH when the node radio range is less than 100m, as illustrated in Fig. 14b, because a large count of RNs is needed to connect disjoint segments and the deployment structure generated by Spider Web-1C will be similar to CDCH structure. The RRLC-GBP shows an excellent result compared with ORC-SMT, Spider Web-1C, CDCH and BD as the number of outer disjoint segments intensively increases or as nodes’ radio range is made greater than 100m. The reason is that a small count of RNs is deployed from all the segments towards a zero gradient point, as explained earlier. Figs. 15 and 16

                              Recovery time of network (RT): It defines the total time taken by any proposed solution to restore the lost connectivity (in seconds). More precisely, it shows the recovery time of the partitioned network. Fig. 17
                              a shows the effectiveness of RRLC-GBP over already proposed solutions. The recovery time of BD and CDCH is high because of the deployment of RNs on the edges of the specified structure. Although CDCH performs better than BD due to the deployment of RNs towards CoD rather than on the edges of convex hull polygon. It means CDCH will observe less recovery time to heal the lost connectivity as it is confirmed in Fig. 17a. The ORC-SMT behaves well because of its distributed nature when the number of disjoint segments is small (i.e. less than 5) as explained earlier. The proposed solution shows excellent results as the node radio range is made higher in the network. As explained earlier for the parameter Number of Placed RNs, if the RN radio range is made higher in Spider Web-1C, less recovery time will be required to connect the disjoint segments. However, it will reduce the lifetime of the RNs and the network, although fewer numbers of RNs will be used. Fig.17b confirms that the recovery time reduces with increases in outer disjoint segments. The proposed solution shows excellent results due to the deployment of RNs towards zero gradient point inside

                              sided polygon and can work for any number of disjoint segments. Moreover, RRLC-GBP shows small variation in its plot due to small changes in the zero-gradient point’s position inside the convex hull polygon for a large number of segments.


                              Average path length (APL): This metric depicts the expected path length between the disjoint segments after the recovery is done by the suggested solution. A short path length is preferred as suggested in various state-of-the-the-art approaches because it will reduce the data latency between the various connected segments when the network is reconnected [5]. Fig. 18
                              a and b show an average-extended path length as a function of number of outer segments and node radio range respectively. It has been found that ORC-SMT shows good results only when the number of disjoint segments is small (i.e. up to 5 segments), but the proposed solution RRLC-GBP shows excellent results for any number of disjoint segments in the partition. The accuracy of the calculated zero gradient point and diameter of the convex hull polygon also affect the average path length. Spider Web-1C shows good results compared with BD and CDCH approaches, when the RN radio range is increased to a large value (i.e. 200m). Further, ORC-SMT and RRLC-GBP show similar results when the node radio range is made higher and the number of outer disjoint segments is between 2 and 5 because of the accuracy of the calculated zero gradient point inside the polygon (like the center of a circle), as shown in Fig. 18b.

The network partition recovery problem is a major challenge in the large scale WSN taking into account the fact that WSN is deployed in harsh environments. It is required that such a network should operate with full connectivity at all times. Due to the direct impact of unhealthy surroundings on sensor nodes, their chances of failure are high and sometimes this causes failure of sensor nodes on a large scale. Consequently, such large scale failure of nodes converts a fully connected sensor network into multiple disjoint sub-networks, leading to the network partition problem. We have presented in this research paper, a new solution to deal with the network partition problem due to the failure of large scale nodes in WSN. The proposed solution is more effective and efficient because it can be applied to any number of disjoint segments with the placement of a small number of RNs for recovery. The key idea is that the lost connectivity restoration to solve the network partition problem is done by using a global zero gradient point inside the convex hull polygon of disjoint segments. The proposed solution shows effective results as compared to the existing benchmark approaches. From the simulation study, it is clearly observed that the proposed solution achieves a 40% improvement in terms of the number of placed RNs for recovery and 10–15% improvement in the average extended path length over Spider Web-1C heuristic. In future, our study can focus on testing of the proposed solution in the presence of obstacles to evaluate the actual network performance parameters like throughput, end-to-end delay, packet loss, packet delivery ratio, etc.
