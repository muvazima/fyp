                  Purpose
                  Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) result in partial collapse of vertebral bodies. They usually are nontraumatic or occur with low-energy trauma in the elderly secondary to different etiologies, such as insufficiency fractures of bone fragility in osteoporosis (benign fractures) or vertebral metastasis (malignant fractures). Our study aims to classify VCFs in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI).
               
               
                  Methods
                  We used the median sagittal planes of lumbar spine MRIs from 63 patients (38 women and 25 men) previously diagnosed with VCFs. The lumbar vertebral bodies were manually segmented and statistical features of gray levels were computed from the histogram. We also extracted texture and shape features to analyze the contours of the vertebral bodies. In total, 102 lumbar VCFs (53 benign and 49 malignant) and 89 normal lumbar vertebral bodies were analyzed. The k-nearest-neighbor method, a neural network with radial basis functions, and a naïve Bayes classifier were used with feature selection. We compared the classification obtained by these classifiers with the final diagnosis of each case, including biopsy for the malignant fractures and clinical and laboratory follow up for the benign fractures.
               
               
                  Results
                  The results obtained show an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 in distinguishing between normal and fractured vertebral bodies, and 0.92 in discriminating between benign and malignant fractures.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The proposed classification methods based on shape, texture, and statistical features have provided high accuracy and may assist in the diagnosis of VCFs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a fracture with partial collapse of the affected vertebral body. Clinically, a radiologist will have no doubt about the etiology of a traumatic VCF as a patient typically presents with a recent history of trauma, such as a fall or an accident. However, when the patient develops a recent vertebral collapse without trauma, or when there was a low-energy traumatic incident, the etiology needs to be investigated, and there can be difficulty in arriving at a diagnosis. This problem is common especially in the elderly population due to the higher incidence of VCFs secondary to bone failure. Vertebral fragility fractures secondary to osteoporosis are an increasingly important health issue [1,2]. The elderly population also has a high incidence of VCFs related to metastatic cancer affecting bone [3]. Clinically, a VCF secondary to osteoporosis is labeled as a benign VCF, and a VCF caused by bone metastasis is defined as a malignant VCF [3]. Complaints from patients related to both types of VCFs, benign and malignant, may be similar; however, the differentiation between the two types of VCFs is fundamental for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is effective in early detection of vertebral fractures [4,5]. The distribution of the signal intensity abnormality throughout the vertebral body is an important criterion to discriminate between benign and malignant VCFs in MRI, but the analysis of vertebral body shape can also help in this process [6–9]. A malignant vertebral collapse typically exhibits diffuse low signal intensity throughout the vertebral body in T1-weighted MRI. Osteoporotic VCFs, on the other hand, characteristically demonstrate partial preservation of the normal fatty bone marrow signal in the vertebral body in T1-weighted MRI [6]. In clinical practice, a radiologist compares the vertebral body signal intensity with the signal intensity in the intervertebral discs. Usually, normal vertebral bodies exhibit higher signal intensity than the intervertebral discs in T1-weighted MRI because of bone marrow adiposity. A vertebral body with bone marrow signal intensity similar to that of a neighboring disc is suspicious for malignancy [10].

VCFs may cause multiple types of changes in the shapes of vertebrae. Malignant VCFs could result in a posterior bulge or convexity of the posterior vertebral body wall, though this may occur together with a concave deformation of the vertebral plateaus. Malignant processes may cause the contours of vertebrae to be relatively rounded or smoothened due to bulging neoplastic tissue. In the case of benign VCFs, the vertebral plateaus may acquire a more accentuated concave shape, and subchondral bone impaction may result in rough contours with indentations. Benign VCFs may cause posterior wall fragment retropulsion with angulated or irregular contours [6,11].

Vertebrae without any fracture typically present nearly rectangular shapes in the sagittal plane. However, they may include small bone outgrowths and marginal bone proliferation known as osteophytes that may cause shape abnormalities. Such modifications of shape may potentially confound analysis with typical shape factors such as compactness and convex deficiency [12–14].

Link et al. [15] describe common signs of benign VCFs and malignant VCFs in MRI. Benign VCFs can present a concave posterior cortex, retropulsion of posterior fragments into the spinal canal, preserved marrow signal in T1-weighted MRI, and an isointense vertebra on T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast. Malignant VCFs can present a convex posterior cortex with an epidural mass, diffuse and low T1 signal, heterogeneous or high signal in T2-weighted and in T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast, and pedicles that show low signal in T1-weighted MRI.


                     
                     Fig. 1 shows two MRIs with both types of VCFs and normal vertebral bodies. Not all cases demonstrate the typical expected characteristics of benign or malignant VCFs in clinical practice, which calls for the development of accurate and reproducible diagnostic methods for VCFs with the aid of computational techniques.

There has been some research interest in the area of imaging of the spine involving VCFs and segmentation of vertebrae and intervertebral discs. Grados et al. [16] presented a review of 149 articles on description and evaluation of osteoporotic vertebral fractures with standard radiographs or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as well as the role of each method in clinical practice. The grading method of Genant et al. [17] for semiquantitative assessment of VCFs using standard radiographs provides information on the severity and prognosis of osteoporosis, while DXA for bone mineral density measurement may detect vertebral fractures in asymptomatic patients. Guglielmi et al. [18] conducted a morphometric study on benign VCFs in radiographs and evaluated a semiautomatic model-based image analysis software tool using a 6-point morphometry protocol and a manual procedure according to the shape and size measures of Genant et al. [17]. The time consumed for the semiautomatic procedure was significantly less than the time consumed for the manual procedure. The semiautomatic approach resulted in mean±standard deviation errors of 2.50±0.72% and 2.16±0.5% for anterior–posterior and superior–inferior measurements, respectively. They also noted that a vertebral deformity does not always indicate a vertebral fracture but a vertebral fracture is always accompanied by vertebral deformity, and also that the combination of semiquantitative visual and quantitative morphometric methods may be the best approach to the diagnosis of a vertebral fracture. Ribeiro et al. [19] proposed procedures for detection of VCFs in lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine using Gabor filters and an artificial neural network for extraction of the superior and the inferior plateaus of each vertebral body, and applied the method of Genant et al. [17] for classification using measures of height of the vertebral bodies. Their results indicated sensitivity up to 78% and specificity of 95%. Kasai et al. [20] developed an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for vertebral fractures based on chest X-ray images. Comparing with manual analysis performed by radiologists, they obtained accuracy ranging between 70.9% and 76.6% in the detection of vertebral fractures.

Al-Helo et al. [21] developed a CAD system for detecting vertebral body fractures in computed tomography (CT) images. Using active shape models and gradient vector flow active contours, they obtained 99% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity with the k-means method. Ghosh et al. [22] proposed a fully automated CAD system for detection of lumbar VCFs in CT images using three height deviation measures of vertebral bodies as features. They obtained an accuracy of 97.33%. While CT is the preferred modality for trauma patients, MRI is used in most of other clinical scenarios of spinal disease investigation [22].

The previous works reviewed above have in common the use of imaging modalities with ionizing radiation. Arevalo-Perez et al. [23] studied the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to aid in noninvasive distinction between pathological and benign vertebral fractures. They reviewed cases of patients with vertebral fractures who underwent DCE-MRI and biopsy. The results indicated that pathological fractures had significantly higher (p<0.01) perfusion parameters, compared with benign fractures. Khan et al. [24] studied variation in the aging lumbar spine using principal component and factor analysis in MRI. They used the MATLAB Statistical Toolbox [25] to compute the principal components using a variance technique, and found that disc signal intensities have strong correlation with natural aging and that the heights of the discs and vertebral bodies are correlated.

In our reviews, we have not found any work on classification of benign VCFs, malignant VCFs, and nonfractured vertebral bodies using image processing methods for extraction of diagnostic features in MRI.

We propose image processing methods to characterize statistical variations of gray levels, texture, and shape of vertebral bodies to detect VCFs and further to classify VCFs as benign or malignant towards CAD of VCFs using T1-weighted MRI. We describe our proposed Fourier-descriptor-based feature (FDF) and analyze its performance in conjunction with nine shape factors including convex deficiency (
                        
                           CD
                        
                     ), compactness (

                     ), and the seven measures based on central invariant moments as proposed by Hu [26]. Furthermore, we analyze three statistical measures of gray levels including the coefficient of variation (
                        
                           CV
                        
                     ), skewness (

                     ), and kurtosis (
                        
                           Kurt
                        
                     ) [27], and the fourteen texture features described by Haralick et al. [28]. The present paper is an updated and expanded version of our previous related presentations at conferences [7–9,29].

This study has been approved by the Research Committee of Ethics of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School. We used a set of MRIs of patients treated at the University Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, Brazil. The cases and images were collected from the Radiology Information System (RIS) and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) of the University Hospital spanning the period September, 2010–March, 2014. All exams were acquired using a Philips Achieva 1.5T MRI system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). The MRI acquisition protocol was the clinical routine protocol, and the images used in the present study are the T1-weighted median sagittal slices of each patient. All cases were selected and the diagnosis reviewed by a senior radiologist (M.H.N.B.). Three radiologists previously diagnosed all cases, and cases of metastasis were confirmed by biopsy and histopathology. The MRI exams were made anonymous to ensure privacy of the patients. The imaging parameters used are: T1-weighted sequence with mean echo time (ET)=9.83±0.82 ms, mean repetition time (RT)=489±75.58ms, mean field-of-view (FOV)=32.25×33.33±3.98×6.39cm, acquisition type 2D, flip angle 90°, and a slice thickness of 4mm.

For the present study, MRI exams of 63 patients, including 38 women and 25 men, with the mean age of 62.25±14.13 years, and diagnosed with at least one lumbar VCF were selected; some patients have more than one lumbar VCF. The set of images for analysis consists of 63 images in 8bits/pixel (256Gy levels) TIFF files, collected from 63 different exams. The lumbar vertebral bodies (L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) are the regions of interest (ROIs) of our study. The data set includes 102 lumbar vertebral bodies with VCFs, of which 53 are secondary to osteoporosis (benign VCFs) and 49 are secondary to bone metastasis (malignant VCFs); in addition, the data set includes 89 nonfractured (normal) vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine. Nonfractured vertebral bodies were selected from MRI exams of patients with benign VCFs in other vertebrae. Nonfractured vertebral bodies of cases with malignant VCFs were not included in the set of normal vertebral bodies.

Bone metastasis in the patients with malignant VCFs was secondary to multiple myeloma (n=12), breast carcinoma (n=8), lung carcinoma (n=1), prostate carcinoma (n=2), oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (n=2), cholangiocarcinoma (n=1), paraganglioma (n=1), inflammatory myofibroblastic cancer (n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=1).

Manual segmentation of the lumbar vertebral bodies selected from the 63 images was performed by a medical student (G.A.M.) with previous training in segmentation of spinal anatomy in MRI using Adobe Photoshop software CS5™ [30], supervised by the senior radiologist (M.H.N.B.). In addition, the results of segmentation were verified and modified where needed by the senior radiologist. Thus, the ROIs used in the present study represent the results of consensus between two observers. 
                        Fig. 2 shows samples of ROIs of normal vertebral bodies, benign VCFs, and malignant VCFs used in the study; 
                        Fig. 3 shows the corresponding contours.

We computed 27 features for each vertebral body ROI, covering 3 statistical measures of gray levels, 14 texture features, and 10 shape factors. All image processing and feature extraction methods were developed in MATLAB [25].

Before feature extraction based on gray levels, blocks of size 5×5 pixels were automatically positioned at each lumbar intervertebral disc (see 
                        Fig. 4), using the manually drawn masks of the vertebral bodies as reference, and the mean gray-level of all such blocks was computed. Each sagittal MRI section was divided by the corresponding mean disc value and the result was linearly transformed to the range [0, 255].

Three features were derived from the gray-level histogram of each vertebral body ROI. The feature 
                           
                              CV
                           
                         is given by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the ROI. The features 
                           
                              Skew
                           
                         and kurtosis 
                           
                              Kurt
                           
                         
                        [27] are the normalized third-order and fourth-order moments of the histogram characterizing the symmetry of the histogram and its peaked or tailed nature, respectively.

We computed the 14 texture features defined by Haralick et al. [28] using the averaged coocurrence matrix of the gray levels of each vertebral body ROI in four directions (±0°, ±45°, ±90°, and ±135°) and with the distance of one pixel. The 14 features are angular second moment or energy (

Because the same sequence of contour pixels is obtained if the contour is traversed repeatedly, z(n) is a periodic signal. Hence, Z(k) represents a Fourier series, with k being the index of harmonics of a fundamental frequency. Z(1) and Z(−1) represent circles centered at the coordinates given by Z(0); the use of Z(−1), Z(0), and Z(1) together in the inverse Fourier formula leads to the best-fitting ellipse to the given contour. Rough contours cause larger values of Z(k) for higher values of k than smooth contours. In order to characterize the shape changes caused by VCFs, in particular the roughness caused by benign VCFs and the smoother changes caused by malignant VCFs, we define the feature FDF as

                        , based on the moments of planar geometric figures, which have been used in many applications of shape analysis [12]. These features, while being effective in classification of several types of shapes, are difficult to interpret and relate to shape variations in a specific application such as analysis of breast tumors [9,12–14] or VCFs.

Two different types of analyses were performed in the present work: classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs, and classification of both types of VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies. Feature selection and pattern classification experiments were performed using the machine learning software WEKA [34].

The vectors of features were used as input to a wrapper method [35] for feature selection with a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. This method evaluates feature sets by using a learning scheme and the cross-validation step is used to estimate the accuracy of the learning scheme for a set of attributes. Features that were selected in at least 30% of the repetitions in the feature selection experiments were used in the subsequent pattern classification experiments with the same classifiers, also with 10-fold cross-validation. The classifiers used were the k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) method [36], a naïve Bayesian classifier [37], and a neural network with radial basis functions (RBF network) [38]. The k-NN classifier was based on the Euclidean distance. The naïve Bayes classifier did not use either supervised discretization or any kernel estimator. The RBF network used the following parameters: clustering seed=1; minimum standard deviation for the clusters=0.1; number of clusters=2; and ridge value for regression=1.0E−8. The RBF network used the k-means clustering algorithm to learn a regression model.

Feature selection experiments were conducted for each procedure of analysis and each classifier used. The performance of each classification procedure was analyzed using the confusion matrix, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC), and accuracy (ACC). Stratified cross-validation was used with each fold having the same class distributions as the complete data set. The performance measures were averaged over all folds.

In addition, statistical analysis was performed for each feature by grouping both VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies and for benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test [39] was applied to check the normality of the distributions of the features. As all sets of all features rejected the null hypothesis that the samples follow a normal distribution, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test [40] to compute the p-values to analyze the statistical significance of the differences between the sets. Furthermore, the area under the estimated ROC curve (

The notation used is *for 0.01≤p<0.05, **for 0.001≤p<0.01, and ***for p<0.001 to indicate statistical significance of the differences at various levels.

Based on Table 1, we can observe the importance of several texture and statistical features of gray levels in benign VCF versus malignant VCF classification by virtue of their high statistical significance and 
                        
                           
                              A

                     . As explained earlier, the distribution of the T1 signal intensity over a vertebral body is an important criterion to discriminate between benign and malignant VCFs in MRI. The presence of low-intensity T1 signal can be identified by the gray-level features, and the spatial distribution of low-intensity signals is characterized by the texture features. Shape features can also aid in this classification, as indicated by the high level of significance and high

                      of FDF.

When we analyze both classes of VCFs together in comparison with normal vertebral bodies, we see that the texture and gray-level features provided poor performance, as expected; more of the shape features show high significance and high values of

                      values are higher than when comparing benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs.


                     
                     Fig. 5 presents six graphs of the values of the mean and standard deviation of a few features for each class. The results obtained show that

                      values are, on the average, higher for benign VCFs than for normal vertebrae, but lower for malignant VCFs than for normal vertebral bodies. This agrees with visual analysis of shape changes caused by the two types of VCFs and the observations described in the introduction. The mean skewness of malignant VCFs is higher than that for benign VCFs. This indicates that the relative T1 signal levels are distributed more on the lower side of the histogram for malignant VCFs than for benign VCFs. The T1 signal intensity for malignant VCFs is, on the average, lower than that for benign VCFs, which also agrees with the observations made earlier.

                      for all VCFs together against normal vertebral bodies.

In general, Fig. 5 and the statistical analysis in Table 1 confirm what was expected. The statistical features of gray levels and texture features are statistically highly significant when analyzing malignant VCFs versus benign VCFs; some of the shape features are also important in this task. When comparing all VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies, the shape factors are more significant and the

                      values are also higher than those for the texture features and statistical features of gray levels.


                     
                     Table 2 presents the results of feature selection for each classifier for classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs; 
                     Table 3 provides the same for all VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies. 
                     Table 4 presents the results obtained based on AUROC for classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs after feature selection for the different classifiers tested. 
                     Table 5 presents the results for classification of all VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies after feature selection for the different classifiers tested. The overall results obtained show excellent potential for CAD of VCFs.

                     , which is statistically significant for this type of classification, was selected in all feature selection experiments for all classifiers. Values of k<7 were tested, but the related performance measures were lower than those for k≥7 as presented.

The ACC rate of the RBF network classifier for benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs was the lowest obtained and its AUROC is only slightly better than that of k-NN with k=7. On the other hand, for classification of all VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies, the ACC rate is the highest with the RBF network.

For both types of classification, the naïve Bayes classifier provided the best performance considering the values of AUROC, and the best ACC rate for classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs. Various texture features were selected for both types of classification. The feature selection step for this classifier, in both situations, selected the highest number of features to compose the feature vector in the experiments conducted.

The AUROC obtained for classification of all VCFs together versus normal vertebral bodies is at least 0.92 and increases up to 0.97 for the naïve Bayes classifier used. These results are better than the results obtained in our previous study which used only shape features [9], where the AUROC of the naïve Bayes classifier used was 0.945. It is apparent that texture features and statistical features of gray levels are also important in this type of classification.

In the classification between benign VCFs and malignant VCFs, even though the performance is slightly poorer, AUROC values up to 0.92 were obtained, which also indicates good performance. This result is slightly better than the results of our previous study using only texture features and statistical features of gray levels [7], which obtained AUROC up to 0.91 for k-NN with k=3. The performance of the k-NN classifier for k=9 and 11 in the present study is better than that in our previous study [7]. Thus, shape features are also important for this type of classification. We can note the importance of the texture features and statistical features of gray levels for the classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs by comparing the current results with the results of our previous study using only shape features, where the highest AUROC obtained was only 0.78 [9].

The step of manual segmentation of vertebral bodies is a limitation of our study. Future studies will address questions regarding the effects of interobserver and intraobserver variations on the features extracted and their performance in classification. Benjelloun and Mahmoudi [42] proposed a tool for segmentation which was able to detect contours of cervical vertebrae in X-ray images using a discrete dynamic contour model and a template matching process associated with a polar signature system. Wang et al. [43] proposed an automatic segmentation method for vertebrae and intervertebral discs using a regression segmentation approach in sagittal and axial sections of CT and MRI. Duarte Barbieri et al. [44] proposed a method for automatic segmentation of vertebral bodies in MRI using superpixels. Tang and Pauli [45] developed a fully automatic method for extraction of the spinal curve in MRI by first extracting intervertebral disc positions and then using these positions to segment the spine using a method for registration of vertebrae. They observed that a constraint of their method concerning the image is that the disc intensity must be different from the vertebral body intensity. With the inclusion of automatic segmentation methods, our methods proposed for analysis and classification of vertebral bodies could lead to the realization of a clinically useful CAD system.

The analysis of the vertebral bodies individually and separately ignores important information outside the vertebral bodies, such as the presence of epidural mass and abnormal signal intensity of the pedicle in malignant VCFs [11]. The use of only the median sagittal slice is another limitation of our study: VCFs compromising only the lateral regions of vertebral bodies could be missed and therefore misclassified by our present method. Extension of segmentation and feature extraction methods to three dimensions would be important in the implementation of a robust CAD system for VCFs. The analysis of T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast could be important for the detection of possible signs that could differentiate between VCFs, such as an isointense vertebra in T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI after gadolinium contrast for benign VCFs and heterogeneous or high signal in T2-weighted and in T1-weighted MRI after gadolinium contrast in malignant VCFs [15].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Most of the features of statistics of gray levels, texture, and shape presented in this study are important for both types of classification of VCFs. In general, the

                      values of the significant texture features and statistical features of gray levels are higher than those of the shape features for classification of benign VCFs versus malignant VCFs, and the opposite occurs for discrimination of all VCFs together against normal vertebral bodies. However, the features

                      do not follow this trend. The naïve Bayes method was the best classifier in the present study in both types of classification tasks with high levels of performance. The proposed methods are promising for CAD of VCFs. In future research, we will evaluate our methods for characterization of VCFs with the inclusion of an automatic segmentation method and extend the methods to three-dimensional analysis of vertebral bodies.
