                  There is a critical requirement for semantic interoperability among heterogeneous computer-aided tolerancing (CAT) systems with the sustainable growing demand of collaborative product design. But current data exchange standard for exchanging tolerance information among these systems can only exchange syntaxes and cannot exchange semantics. Semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems is difficult to be implemented only with this standard. To address this problem, some meta-models of tolerance information supporting semantic interoperability and an interoperability platform based on these meta-models should be constructed and developed, respectively. This paper mainly focuses on the construction of a meta-model for assembly tolerance types with a description logic 
                        ALC(D)
                      based approach. Description logics, a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies, are well-known for having rigorous logic-based semantics which supports semantic interoperability. 
                        ALC(D)
                      can provide a formal method to describe the research objects and the relations among them. In this formal method, constraint relations among parts, assembly feature surfaces and geometrical features are defined with some 
                        ALC(D)
                      assertional axioms, and the meta-model of assembly tolerance types is constructed through describing the spatial relations between geometrical features with some 
                        ALC(D)
                      terminological axioms. Besides, 
                        ALC(D)
                      can also provide a highly efficient reasoning algorithm to automatically detect the inconsistency of the knowledge base, a finite set of assertional and terminological axioms. With this reasoning algorithm, assembly tolerance types for each pair of geometrical features are generated automatically through detecting the inconsistencies of the knowledge base. An application example is provided to illustrate the process of generating assembly tolerance types.
               
            


                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     


                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Semantic interoperability refers to the ability of computer systems to transmit data with unambiguous, shared meaning  [1]. With the sustainable growing demand of collaborative product design, there is a critical requirement for semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems  [2,3]. To implement semantic interoperability, heterogeneous CAT systems should have the ability to transmit tolerance information with unambiguous, shared meaning. However, CAT systems are developed separately and independently by different vendors. The data storage format and information transmission mode are all different in these systems. So CAT systems must use the standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP)  [4] as an intermediary to realize the exchange of tolerance information among them. From the perspective of data exchange, STEP has the following drawbacks  [5]: (1) STEP uses neutral files to realize data exchange. Because these neutral files always occupy a large amount of space, it is difficult to implement the real-time data exchange. (2) STEP attempts to use the EXPRESS modeling language to construct consistent semantic models. But because concepts are always expressed with ambiguous meaning in different application domains, it is difficult to construct a general semantic model. (3) STEP provides the mapping mechanisms from EXPRESS language to extensible markup language (XML). The uncontrollable nestifications in XML will lead to extremely complex structure and lacking data constraint of XML documents. Data exchange in STEP still remains on the level of syntax but not on the level of semantics. Thus, tolerance information is difficult to be transmitted unambiguously and semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems is difficult to be implemented only with STEP  [6].

To accomplish semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems, some meta-models of tolerance information supporting semantic interoperability should be constructed and then an interoperability platform based on these meta-models should be developed. This paper mainly focuses on constructing a meta-model of assembly tolerance types with a description logic 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      based approach. The meta-models of other tolerance specifications will be constructed and the interoperability platform based on all these constructed meta-models will be developed in the upcoming works.

Description logics, a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies, are well-known for having rigorous logic-based semantics supporting interoperability. They have been widely applied to the field of industrial information systems to realize semantic interoperability  [7]. The main strength of description logics is they provide considerable expressive power going far beyond propositional logic, while reasoning is still decidable. Furthermore, they offer highly efficient reasoning algorithms  [8]. As a kind of knowledge representation languages, the intuition of description logics is to define concepts of a domain and use these concepts to specify the properties of individuals occurring in this domain. The primitive symbols of description logics are a set of role names, a set of concept names and a set of individual names. Starting from these symbols, each kind of description logics provides a set of constructors to form complex roles and concepts. Attributive language with complements (
                        ALC
                     )  [9] is one of the most influential description logics. It provides negation (
                        ¬
                     ), conjunction (
                        ⊓
                     ), disjunction (
                        ⊔
                     ), existential restriction (
                        ∃
                     ) and value restriction (
                        ∀
                     ) constructors for construction of concepts. With these constructors, some knowledge on abstract logical level can be described. For example, the concept Computer-aided-tolerancing can be specified as follows:
                        
                           
                              
                                 Computer
                              
                              -
                              
                                 aided
                              
                              -
                              
                                 tolerancing
                              
                              ≡
                              
                                 Tolerance
                              
                              -
                              
                                 design
                              
                              ⊓
                              ∃
                              
                                 use
                              
                              .
                              
                                 Computer
                              
                              .
                           
                        
                      Which represents that computer-aided tolerancing is concerned with all aspects of using a computer to do tolerance design. 
                        ALC
                      not only provides certain expressive power for describing the knowledge on abstract logical level, but also desirable computational properties such as decidability, soundness and completeness of deduction procedures. However, a drawback of 
                        ALC
                      is that all the knowledge has to be defined on abstract logical level. For example, coaxiality tolerance can be defined as a geometric variation caused by two coincident lines. This example refers to the knowledge defined on concrete logical level. 
                        ALC
                      is not sufficient for describing the knowledge in the example.

To meet the requirements of applications in which the knowledge can be defined on a concrete logical level, 
                        ALC
                      is extended by adding a concept-forming predicate constructor and 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                        [10] is therefore achieved. 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      divides the set of logical objects into two disjoint sets, the abstract and the concrete objects. Abstract objects can be related to concrete objects via attributes. Relations between concrete objects are described with a set of domain specific predicates. Referring to these predicates, properties of abstract objects can also be described through using the concept-forming predicate constructor. In 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                     , the pair consisting of a set of concrete objects and a set of predicates defined over these objects is called a concrete domain. With a concrete domain, knowledge in a concrete application domain can be described and reasoned conveniently. So 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      is quite sufficient to model assembly tolerance types. To make this paper self-contained, a technical background about 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      is sketched in Section  2.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. An overview of related works is given in Section  3. Constraint relations in the spatial relations based assembly tolerance representation model  [11] are defined with some

                      assertional axioms in Section  4. Section  5 defines a concrete domain

This paper mainly refers to representation and interoperability of tolerance information. During recent years, a significant number of works have been devoted to the study of tolerance representation model and interoperability among computer-aided (CAX) systems. Main works are summarized below.

Tolerance representation model is mainly concerned with two problems  [13]. One is to organize and represent tolerance information in a relative independent way, and meanwhile, reflect the semantic distinctions of different types of tolerances. The other is to design a data structure and then take it as carrier of storage and representation of tolerance information in computers. As Wang  [14] pointed out, a good tolerance representation model should be able to convey full semantics of dimensional and geometrical tolerances and should be able to support analysis and synthesis with a simple yet comprehensive structure. In order to achieve these goals, a large number of tolerance representation models have been carried out. According to the techniques used to represent tolerance information, these representation models can be classified into the following categories  [15]: 
                           
                              •
                              Surface and graph models. In these models, tolerance information is represented by some surfaces and graphs, where basic structure is solid structure or feature structure, nodes are features, planes, edges and vertexes, and attributes of nodes are tolerances and reference datum  [16]. Typical examples of surface and graph models are CSG model [17], B_rep model [18], CSG/B_rep model [19], tolerance network model [20], Tolerance-Maps model [21] and graph-based model [22]. Surface and graph models only provide tolerance symbols. They are not able to convey full semantics of dimensional and geometrical tolerances.

Variational geometry models. In these models, tolerance information is represented by variations of nominal geometry. Each feature surface or geometrical feature of the real part is associated with a perfect shape feature. Variations between substituted geometrical features can be represented by vectors  [23], small displacement torsors  [24], matrices  [25], metric tensors  [26], virtual gauges  [27] and constraints  [28]. Although variational geometry models can represent relations between different geometric solids, they cannot represent variable geometry.

Structural models. In geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing, the most widely used structural model is the technologically and topologically related surfaces (TTRS) model  [29]. The model is adopted by Dassault Systèmes Company and is implemented in CATIA.3D FDT™  [30]. But it mainly considers the topological surface connections and does not consider the technological surface connections  [31]. Aiming at this problem, Liu et al.  [32] proposed a hierarchical model based on features. The hierarchical model not only considers the topological surface connections, but also considers the technological surface connections. But the number of feature types to be processed in the model is somewhat limited  [33]. Aiming at this problem, Zhang et al.  [34] increased the number of feature types from seven to eleven and adopted polychromatic sets to construct a hierarchical representation model. The model is able to automatically generate some recommended assembly tolerance types. However, for the same feature surfaces, the number of recommended assembly tolerance types generated by the model is somewhat large and the model cannot be directly used to assembly tolerance analysis and synthesis. Aiming at these problems, Qin et al.  [11] introduced a spatial relation layer and used adjacency matrices to construct the spatial relations based assembly tolerance representation model. Through mapping spatial relations to assembly tolerance types, the number of recommended assembly tolerance types generated by the mapping from feature surfaces to assembly tolerance types can be further reduced. Besides, information of degrees of freedom can be attached in the elements of adjacency matrices when recommended assembly tolerance types are generated by spatial relations so that the proposed model can be directly applied to assembly tolerance analysis and synthesis. However, the spatial relations based model does not consider the semantic interoperability problem of assembly tolerance information.

Mathematical definition based models. In these models, the mathematical definitions of all types of tolerances are provided building on the engineering semantics of these tolerances. The common mathematical tools are vector loops, matrices, geometric variations and Jacobian torsor  [35]. Mathematical definition based models can convey full semantics of dimensional and geometrical tolerances and can support analysis and synthesis. They have been adopted by many commercial CAT software companies and have been realized in CETOL 6 Sigma™, eM-TolMate™, VSA.3D™/VSA-GDT™ and 3DCS™  [30]. However, these models rarely consider the semantic interoperability problem of assembly tolerance information.

Other models. In recent years, some distinctive techniques have been applied to build tolerance representation models. XML  [36], generalized intervals  [14] and fuzzy logic  [37] are typical examples of these techniques.

As can be seen from the above review, research in tolerance representation has been paid much attention over the past decades. Many tolerance representation models have been proposed in this area. By using data structure, mathematical definition, symbolic language, logic language and other techniques, these representation models give many kinds of formal representations of tolerance information. Some kinds of formal representations can convey full semantics of dimensional and geometrical tolerances and can support analysis and synthesis with a simple yet comprehensive structure. The ambiguous problem caused by the descriptions of tolerance information in natural language has been well solved. However, these representation models rarely consider the semantic interoperability problem of tolerance information.

As part of the trend toward customizable and flexible product development tool suites, multiple CAX systems are often used for various phases of product development. As a result, the problem of interoperability among these heterogeneous systems emerges. This reflects the unfortunate reality that software vendors tend to use proprietary data representation as a competitive advantage, which severely inhibits interoperability  [38].

To solve the problem of interoperability, data exchange mode in CAX systems was classified into horizontal data exchange and vertical data exchange by Bianconi et al.  [39]. Horizontal data exchange is used to mean the data exchange among heterogeneous CAX systems. It mainly focuses on geometric information. However, more important than just geometric information is the design intent stored in design history and constraints. This makes the design intent reservation during data exchange something of a hot issue  [40,41]. At present, it is common practice to have a design geometry data model created from CAD systems translated into an intermediate data format like STEP file format, and then imported into the computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) applications. Conceptually, such data exchange mode belongs to vertical data exchange due to the fact that the data is transferred from upstream applications into downstream applications. Wang and Xu  [42] classified the intermediate data format into proprietary data format and neutral data format. Most commercial data exchange service providers tend to use the proprietary data format because it offers a competitive edge. In the development history of data exchange standard, several international standards for data exchange have been established, such as drawing exchange format (DXF), initial graphics exchange specification (IGES) and STEP. In these standards, STEP is the most complex and advanced standard  [43,44]. It covers almost all the applications used in each phase of product life cycle  [45].

The construction and implementation of a STEP based meta-model to capture and share design knowledge in an attempt to accomplish the interoperability among CAX systems is not new. Many works have being done in this domain  [46]. Representative works are the works by Patil et al.  [47], Jardim-Goncalves et al.  [48], Agostinho et al.  [49], Zhang and Yin  [50], Zhu et al.  [51], Matsokis and Kiritsis  [52], Zhan et al.  [53] and Barbau et al.  [54]. Patil et al.  [47] designed and realized a framework called product semantics representation language (PSRL) to represent product knowledge. The framework emphasizes the importance of capturing semantics of product data information from different sources and focuses on representing knowledge in an unambiguous and computer interpretable way. However, PSRL cannot be used to encompass the stakeholders in all phases of product life cycle. Jardim-Goncalves et al.  [48] implemented a framework for the development, usage and extension of integrated data and knowledge models, using as a reference existent standard-based protocols. The framework enables STEP application protocols to interoperate at meta-model and knowledge levels. But it mainly focuses on construction of a meta-model for an individual application domain. This increases the overhead due to the fact that the same model created in different CAX systems could have different representations. Agostinho et al.  [49] proposed to adopt the model morphism methodologies for the manipulation and transformation of STEP conceptual models to more wide spread realization oriented technologies, such as XML or web ontology language (OWL), easier to adoption by smaller organizations. Zhang and Yin  [50] proposed an ontology-based modeling framework to the engineering design knowledge on the Semantic Web. The ontology implementation in the framework differs from previous research works on ontology based knowledge representation and reasoning in that it associates multidisciplinary product models with ontology models by semantic indexes and also provides a way to map high level requirements. Zhu et al.  [51] discussed the needs for a standard format to communicate and exchange product data between various CAD/CAE applications. They pointed out one of the disadvantages of STEP is that STEP could only operate at syntax level and could not operate at semantic level. Matsokis and Kiritsis  [52] constructed and implemented an ontology for semantic object model of product data and knowledge management. This work is a significant improvement over previous works since it uses description logic in an ontology which enables reasoning. But it mostly focuses on building ontologies from existing models. Zhan et al.  [53] proposed an ontology-based approach to share knowledge related to product data in CAD/CAE applications. The approach integrates the design evaluation information which the CAD/CAE applications individually provide. It leads to the ability to create, share and exchange knowledge for solving design evaluation challenges involving multiple applications and viewpoints. Barbau et al.  [54] proposed an approach to enable the translation of STEP schema and its instances to OWL. By defining some rules for the translation from EXPRESS to OWL, an OntoSTEP model is constructed. The constructed model can easily be integrated with any OWL ontologies to create a semantically rich model.

As can be seen from the above review, most of the previous research works on interoperability among CAX systems are mainly focus on the construction of a meta-model from a CAX file for a single model or an individual application domain. This increases the overhead because the same model created in different CAX systems could have different representations. Furthermore, these works rarely considers the semantic interoperability among CAT systems and rarely involves the construction of a meta-model for tolerance information. It is necessary to construct a meta-model of tolerance information supporting semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems. This paper mainly focuses on construction of a meta-model of assembly tolerance types. The meta-model of other tolerance specifications will be constructed in the upcoming works.

The spatial relations based assembly tolerance representation model  [11] is hierarchically organized. It mainly consists of part layer, assembly feature surface layer and spatial relation layer. Assembly constraint relations between parts, assembly constraint relations between assembly feature surfaces of parts and spatial relations between geometrical features of assembly feature surfaces are constraint relations in these three layers, respectively. Assembly constraint relations between assembly feature surfaces are determined by assembly constraint relations between parts. Spatial relations between geometrical features are determined by assembly constraint relations between assembly feature surfaces. Assembly tolerance types are determined by spatial relations between geometrical features  [15]. To apply

                     . In this section, constraint relations in the three layers are defined with some

Part layer is the first layer of the spatial relations based model. Its main functions are to extract the assembly constraint relations among parts, to construct an

An assembly can be regarded as a finite set of parts which have assembly constraint relations with each other. Let Part be a concept name which denotes a part of an assembly. Let ACR be a predicate name which denotes an assembly constraint relation between two parts of an assembly. Parts and the assembly constraint relations among them can be formally defined by

Each part of an assembly can be regarded as a closed geometry which is constituted by a number of feature surfaces. In all of the feature surfaces of a part, the feature surfaces, which have assembly constraint relations with the feature surfaces of other parts, are called as the assembly feature surfaces of this part. Each part of an assembly has at least one assembly feature surface. Thus the assembly constraint relations among parts can be decomposed into the assembly constraint relations among assembly feature surfaces of each part.

Let AFS be a concept name which denotes an assembly feature surface of a part. Let ACR be a predicate name which denotes an assembly constraint relation between two assembly feature surfaces. Assembly feature surfaces and the assembly constraint relations among them can be formally defined by

                         assertional axioms representing the extracted spatial relations, and to lay foundation for the representation of assembly tolerance types.

Based on the study by Srinivasan  [55], there are seven types of feature surfaces: spherical surface, cylindrical surface, planar surface, helical surface, revolute surface, prismatic surface and complex surface. Zhang et al.  [34] increased the number of types of feature surfaces from seven to eleven. These eleven types of feature surfaces are inner spherical surface, outer spherical surface, inner cylindrical surface, outer cylindrical surface, planar surface, inner helical surface, outer helical surface, inner revolute surface, outer revolute surface, inner prismatic surface and outer prismatic surface. The polychromatic sets based representation model  [34] cannot handle the information of degrees of freedom, so in the model complex surface can be decomposed into some types of feature surfaces in the above first six types of feature surfaces. That is why the model is not sufficient for further tolerance analysis and synthesis.

To lay foundation for further tolerance analysis and synthesis, the spatial relations based model  [11] add inner complex surface and outer complex surface into the above eleven types of feature surfaces. The number of types of feature surfaces is thus thirteen. The possible constraint relations and corresponding associated derived features of the thirteen types of feature surfaces are shown in Table 1
                        .

As shown in Table 1, the associated derived feature of each type of feature surface is a single point, a single straight line, a single plane or their combination. Therefore, the spatial relations among associated derived features are essentially the spatial relations among points, straight lines and planes. In practice, the spatial relations among points, straight lines and planes are as follows: coincide, disjoint, include, parallel, perpendicular, intersect and nonuniplanar   [56] (Table 2
                        ). Furthermore, each type of real feature surface has constraint relation with its ideal feature surface  [56] (Table 3
                        ).

According to the spatial relations in Tables 2 and 3, the spatial relations between geometrical features of each pair of mutual constraint assembly feature surfaces can be formally defined by

As defined in the Definition 1, a concrete domain consists of a set of concrete objects and a set of predicates defined over these objects. In the spatial relations based assembly tolerance representation model, parts, assembly feature surfaces and geometrical features can be intuitively regarded as concrete objects, and constraint relations between parts, assembly feature surfaces or geometrical features can be intuitively regarded as predicate names. As defined in Definitions 8 and 9, constraint relation in part layer or assembly feature surface layer is ACR. As defined in Definition 10, constraint relations in spatial relation layer are COI, DIS, INC, PAR, PER, INT, NON and CON. With these objects and constraint relations, a concrete domain for assembly tolerance representation can be formally defined as follows.

Assembly tolerances mainly consist of geometrical tolerance, angle tolerance and dimensional tolerance. At a top-down stage, geometrical and dimensional tolerances of parts can be determined by assembly tolerances of the corresponding product. That is, assembly tolerance design of a product should be finished first, and then tolerance design of parts is done based on assembly and functional requirements of the product. A feature can be regarded as a surface or as a set of surfaces. The individual characteristics of a single feature include straightness, flatness, roundness, cylindricity, profile any line and profile any surface. They are not associated with datums but instead are associated with ideal shapes. The characteristics of more than one feature include parallelism, perpendicularity, angularity, position, concentricity (coaxiality), symmetry, circular run-out, total run-out and angle. They need one or more datums to control the scope of their changes.

In practice, assembly tolerance types have mapping relations with the spatial relations between geometrical features of assembly feature surfaces of parts. As one example, the assembly tolerance type determined by

                         denotes an ideal cylindrical surface constrains a real outer or inner cylindrical surface. The mapping relations between spatial relations and assembly tolerance types are therefore one-to-one or one-to-many relations  [56, Appendix 1].

According to Table A.1
                        , it can be concluded that assembly tolerances are essentially some spatial relations between assembly feature surfaces or geometrical features of mutual constraint assembly feature surfaces. A spatial relation between assembly feature surfaces or between geometrical features of assembly feature surfaces can be regarded as a binary relation between a constraint object and its corresponding constrained object.

In current commercial 3D solid modeling systems, designers can conveniently design complex assemblies. All the parts of an assembly can be designed respectively as separate geometric models at part modeling mode. The assembly can also be constructed by assembling all the parts together after specifying assembly constraints between parts at assembly modeling mode. The mate feature tree of the assembly is automatically achieved after all the parts are assembled. An algorithm named Liaison Table Generator (LTG)  [57] is proposed to achieve the mating relations exist among parts in the format of mate feature tree. Another algorithm named Assembly Mate Extraction (AME)  [58] is proposed to extract the assembly feature surfaces of parts stored in the format of mate feature tree. According to the LTG algorithm, the AME algorithm, the spatial relation based model for generating assembly tolerance types  [11] and the defined meta-model of assembly tolerance types in Section  5, an approach for generating assembly tolerance types automatically is carried out according to the following steps.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Construct a 3D assembly model of the product. According to the functional requirements of the product and the ideal size of each part, a 3D assembly model of the product can be conveniently constructed in 3D solid modeling systems.


                                 Disassemble the 3D assembly model of the product. According to the mechanical structure of the product, its 3D assembly model is continuously split until the whole assembly is disassembled into parts.


                                 Extract assembly constraint relations between parts and assembly feature surfaces of parts. When the above two steps are finished, a mate feature tree of the product is automatically achieved in solid modeling systems. Based on this, the LTG algorithm  [57] is applied to extract assembly constraint relations among parts and the AME algorithm  [58] is applied to extract assembly feature surfaces of parts.

According to the above steps, automatic generation of assembly tolerance types can be implemented. Its flow is shown in Fig. 2
                        .

A gear reducer  [11,34] is taken as an example to illustrate the process of generating assembly tolerance types. Based on the designed approach, the steps to generate assembly tolerance types for the gear reducer are as follows. 
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Construct a 3D assembly model of the gear reducer. According to the functional requirements and the ideal size of each part of the gear reducer, its 3D assembly model is constructed in 3D solid modeling systems. A partial view of the gear reducer is shown in Fig. 3
                                 .


                                 Disassemble the 3D assembly model of the gear reducer. According to the mechanical structure of the gear reducer, its 3D assembly model is continuously split until the whole assembly is disassembled into parts. As Fig. 4
                                  shows, the transmission structure of the gear reducer is disassembled into twenty parts.


                                 Extract assembly constraint relations between parts and assembly feature surfaces of parts. When the above two steps are finished, the mate feature tree of the gear reducer is automatically achieved. Based on this, the LTG algorithm  [57] is applied to extract assembly constraint relations among parts, and the AME algorithm  [58] is applied to extract assembly feature surfaces of parts.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

In the previous sections constraint relations in the spatial based assembly tolerance representation model  [11] is defined with some 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      assertional axioms and then a meta-model of assembly tolerance types supporting semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems is constructed. The meta-model is formalized with description logic 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                     , a kind of knowledge representation language which has rigorous logic-based, explicit and computer interpretable semantics. Because of this, it can lay a good foundation for further implementation of semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems. As introduced in Section  3, a large number of works have also been devoted to the research of tolerance representation model and interoperability among CAX systems. It is quite necessary to discuss the differences between the work in this paper and these related works.

By using data structure, mathematical definition, symbolic language, logic language and other representation techniques, the surface and graph model  [17–22], variational geometry model [23–28], structural model  [29–34], mathematical definition model [35], XML model  [36], generalized intervals model  [14] and fuzzy logic model  [37] provide many kinds of formal representations of tolerance information. Some kinds of formal representations can convey complete semantics of dimensional and geometrical tolerances and can support analysis and synthesis with a simple yet comprehensive structure. Ambiguous problem caused by the descriptions of tolerance information in natural language has been well addressed. But these models rarely consider the semantic interoperability problem of tolerance information. In contrast, the meta-model in this paper has rigorous logic-based, explicit and computer interpretable semantics supporting semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems. This can be reflected in the process of specifying the assembly tolerance types for the gear reducer. As shown in Section  6, the assembly tolerance types of the gear reducer determined by each pair of mutual constraint geometrical features are generated automatically by detecting the inconsistency of the meta-model. The semantic interoperability process of the meta-model has been implemented with an ontology-based approach  [15].

The construction and implementation of a meta-model to capture and share design knowledge in an attempt to realize the interoperability among CAX systems is not new. Many works have being done in this domain  [38–54]. Most of these works are mainly focus on the construction of a meta-model from a CAX file for a single model or an individual application domain. This increases the overhead because the same model created in different CAX systems could have different representations. In addition to this problem, these works rarely considers the semantic interoperability among CAT systems and rarely involves the construction of a meta-model for assembly tolerance information. The work in this paper and the upcoming works will fill in these gaps.

Although the constructed meta-model has a distinctive advantage in the aspect of semantic interoperability, it has some limitations. Main limitations of the meta-model are as follows: (1) The meta-model is not suitable for the assemblies consisting of non-rigid parts. The meta-model is constructed based on the spatial relation based model  [11]. Because the spatial relation based model is constructed under the simplifying assumptions of rigid body, the meta-model cannot be used to generate tolerance types for the assemblies consisting of non-rigid parts. One future work is to construct another meta-model for the tolerance specifications of non-rigid body. (2) Most knowledge captures, instantiations and mappings need to be made manually during the process of creating a semantically rich model on the basis of the meta-model. To implement semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems, a common model of tolerance specifications for these systems should be constructed first based on the meta-model. Then the mappings between the common model and the tolerance representation model in each CAT system should be created so that tolerance information exchange among these heterogeneous CAT systems with unambiguous and shared meaning can be implemented through the common model. Most knowledge captures and instantiations in the process of constructing the common model and most mappings between the common model and the tolerance representation model in each CAT system need to be made manually. Despite the waste of time this implies, this may lead to redundancies and human errors. So another future work will focus on how to capture knowledge and create mappings automatically. (3) It is difficult to find a systematic method to evaluate the construction principle, application requirement, concept organization, function design and actual usage of the meta-model. Reasoning of assembly tolerance types increases the information available in the meta-model in a quasi-infinite way. Evaluating the inference meta-model must therefore anticipate the information generated by inference, which implies numbers of scenarios that are not easy to imagine. So evaluating the construction principle, application requirement, concept organization, function design and actual usage of the meta-model is probably the most difficult step nowadays in designing inference meta-models. Current methodologies of inference meta-model design do not focus enough on this stage. It is a valuable work to study the evaluation method of the proposed inference meta-model for assembly tolerance types.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A meta-model for assembly tolerance types is constructed in this paper to ultimately implement semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems. The constructed meta-model is formalized with description logic 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                     , a kind of knowledge representation language which has rigorous logic-based, explicit and computer interpretable semantics. Since 
                        ALC
                        
                           (

                      provides a formal method to describe the research objects and the relations among them, constraint relations in the spatial relations based model  [11] are represented with 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      assertional axioms, and assembly tolerance types determined by spatial relations between geometrical features are represented with 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      terminological axioms. With the highly efficient reasoning algorithm to detect the inconsistency of the knowledge base providing by 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                      automatically, assembly tolerance types determined by each pair of mutual constraint geometrical features can be generated automatically by detecting the inconsistency of the meta-model. Because of the rigorous logic-based, explicit and computer interpretable semantics of 
                        ALC
                        
                           (
                           D
                           )
                        
                     , the meta-model can lay a good foundation for future implementation of semantic interoperability among heterogeneous CAT systems.
