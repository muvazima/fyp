@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Next Generation wireless networks require high speed and high data rate communication to support a wide range of applications, including voice, video, e-mail, web browsing, and so on. Due to the multi-path component of a wireless environment, it is challenging to provide a reliable communication link. Further, when multiple users communicate over the same frequency band at the same time, they will experience conflicts due to multiple-access interference (MAI). Verdu introduced the concept of multi-user detection (MUD) for code division multiple-access (CDMA) and demonstrated that, it is possible to exploit this interference to mitigate its effect when the multi-user signals have been propagated through multi-path environments. Further, it has been elucidated in [1] that MUD outperforms any single-user reception for a multi-user setting when communicated over a multi-path environment. Furthermore, as described in [2,3], MUD is capable of enhancing the bit error rate (BER) performance, thus allowing for the inclusion of more users, than corresponding systems not using MUD by mitigating MAI, multi-stream interference (MSI), and co-channel interference (CCI). Explicitly, this type of MUD, when employed at the base station, can alleviate the effects of these interferences and hence provides better BER performance. Nevertheless, for downlink (DL) communication, we require a low-complexity mobile station with higher power-efficiency. Hence, the concept of a multi-user transmitter pre-processing technique (MUTP) has attracted the interest of the research community. The MUTP technique transfers the required signal processing from the mobile station to the base station for DL communication and hence reduces the complexity of the receiver [3]. MUTP requires the knowledge of the channel state matrix of all of the users at the base station (BS) in DL communication to formulate the pre-processing matrix. In [3,4], the authors have elucidated that a higher BER performance can be achieved for DS-CDMA and SDMA systems using zero forcing (ZF) MUTP by alleviating the effect of DL multi-user interferences. In [5], the authors demonstrated the performance of singular value decomposition (SVD) based MUTP for uplink (UL) communication. In [6], the authors addressed the BER performance of MUTP assisted MIMO-space division multiple access (SDMA) and demonstrated that the TP technique provides a superior performance by mitigating the effects of MSI and MAI. In [7], the authors explicated the BER performance of SVD based MUTP technique for a double space-time transmit diversity (DSTTD)-SDMA system over correlated frequency-selective channels and demonstrated, by using simulation results, that its performance is superior in terms of the BER.

To achieve a higher BER performance, the concept of a chip interleaved code division multiple access (CDMA) system has been recommended as a possible access scheme for future wireless communication that can mitigate the effects of MAI and inter-symbol-interference (ISI). Such an accessing scheme offers all of the benefits of CDMA with a low level spreading sequence. In [8,9], the author and his team elucidated that it is possible to achieve a high processing gain when the bandwidth expansion is dedicated to low-rate channel encoding. The author Frenger and his team proposed code-spread CDMA [9], which combines the advantages of low-rate channel encoding and direct sequence (DS)-spreading and demonstrated that it is possible to achieve higher BER than conventional CDMA. It was elucidated in [10] that the chip-interleaved CDMA is capable of providing superior results in terms of BER by mitigating the effects of MAI and ISI. In [10], Li Ping and his team demonstrated that chip interleaved CDMA, known as interleave division multiple access (IDMA), outperforms CDMA system by invoking the turbo style of decoding algorithm. Further, in [11], it was demonstrated that multi-carrier (MC)-IDMA is capable of providing better BER in addition to the higher spectral efficiency for DL communication when the iterative decoding algorithm is invoked.

Most of the above-mentioned research papers considered the MUTP technique for the SDMA system [7]. In this contribution, we consider the problem of mitigating the effects of MAI and ISI using the ZF-MUTP algorithm for the IDMA system and evaluate the BER performance of the ZF-MUTP aided turbo-coded IDMA system, considering both the equal power approach and the maximum-signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) approach. We also compare the performance of our considered MUTP assisted turbo-coded IDMA with an uncoded IDMA system. We developed the channel model based on Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) specifications, as detailed in Table 1
                     , to investigate the BER performance of our considered system.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the system configuration. Section 3 illustrates the power allocation regime. Section 4 describes the performance results and discussion. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

                      shows the transceiver structure of a ZF-MUTP assisted coded IDMA system. In this correspondence, we assume that the K DL users are randomly distributed in a single cell system. We assume the following: base station is equipped with Nt
                      transmit antennas and each of the mobile stations is equipped with Nr
                      receive antennas.

                        k
                     . We modulate the bit stream using the BPSK modulation technique. We then encode the bit stream using the turbo code. In this context, let

In this study, we assume that the impulse response of the channel that connects the kth MS and BS is frequency-selective. To be specific, the channel model is based on the Standard University Interim (SUI) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel specifications. The channel model parameters are summarized in Table 1. For frequency-selective fading, the channel impulse response connecting the jth receive antenna and the ith transmit antenna can be expressed as

In this section, we present the performance of coded ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system for the SUI channel models [15] and LTE [16] channel models by invoking the two power allocation regimes, namely, the equal power regime and the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) regime. We describe the channel model parameters in Table 1 and the simulation parameters in Table 2
                     . We presume a Doppler shift of 0.5 Hz, with antenna correlation of 0.7 and 0.4 for SUI-1 and SUI-3 channel models [15], respectively. For the SUI-5 channel model, we consider a Doppler shift of 2.5 Hz, with antenna correlation of 0.3. We assume a Doppler shift of 70 Hz and 300 Hz and a mobile moving at a velocity of 40.8 km/hr and 162 km/hr based on the LTE-typical urban channel and LTE-extended vehicular channel specifications [16]. In addition, we employ 15,000 channel realizations for each value of SNR. We realize the binary PSK modulation technique and 50 users with three iterations for a coded system. Further, we considered a spreading length of 128 and three iterations. Furthermore, we have considered maximum log-MAP type turbo decoder for our analysis.


                     Fig. 2
                      shows the BER performance of uncoded IDMA system with ZF-MUTP and an equal power allocation regime when communicating over a three tap fading channel model pertaining to the SUI-1 channel specifications. The uncoded system with ZF-MUTP provides a BER of 10−3 at an SNR of 20 dB.

                      shows the BER performance of our considered system with the turbo code for the SUI-1 channel specifications, considering both the equal power regime and the MSNR regime. The MSNR power allocation regime attempts to assign more power to the sub-channel with a smaller eigenvalue; hence, we observed that the performance of our considered system employing MSNR is superior to that of the equal power allocation regime. From our simulation results, it is observed that the coded ZF-MUTP based IDMA system employing MSNR power allocation scheme provides a BER of 10−5 at an SNR of 1 dB, while our considered system with equal power allocation regimeprovides a BER of 10−5 at an SNR of 2 dB. From Figs. 2 and3, it is observed that our considered system with iterative decoding algorithm provides superior performance in terms of the achievable BER with less SNR.


                     Fig. 4 illustrates the BER performance of a coded ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system for SUI-3 channel specifications. From Fig. 4, we observe that to achieve a BER of 10−4, our considered coded ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system considering an equal power allocation scheme requires a SNR of 1.6 dB, whereas the MSNR power allocation scheme requires a SNR of only 0.6 dB for an SUI-3 channel model.


                     Fig. 5 depicts the BER performance of a coded ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system for the SUI-5 channel specifications. From Fig. 5, it is observed that to achieve a BER of 10−4, the coded ZF-MUTP supported IDMA system employing an equal power scheme requires a SNR of 1.7 dB, whereas our considered system with the MSNR power allocation scheme requires an SNR of 0.9 dB for an SUI-5 channel model.


                     Fig. 6 indicates the BER performance of our considered ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system when invoking either the equal power allocation strategy or the MSNR policy for an LTE-extended vehicular channel model. From the figure, it can be observed that the ZF-MUTP assisted system with MSNR policy provides a better BER performance.


                     Fig. 7
                      demonstrates the BER performance comparison of our considered ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system using the equal power allocation strategy and MSNR policy for an LTE-extended typical urban channel model. From the figure, we observe that our considered system with a MSNR based power allocation policy provides a better BER performance with less SNR.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this contribution, we investigated the performance of a DL single cell multi-user turbo coded IDMA system supported by ZF-MUTP invoking the two power allocation regimes, namely, equal power policy, and MSNR policy. We simulated the BER performance of our considered system for SUI and LTE channel specifications. Our simulation results revealed that ZF-MUTP completely eliminates DL MUI when a perfect CIR is considered at the base station, while offering a low complexity receiver in the context of DL communication. Further, we observed that when the iterative decoding algorithm is employed, we can improve the BER performance results with less SNR, although the transmitted signals are contaminated by noise and are propagated through multi-path environment. Finally, our investigations on the BER performance of our considered turbo coded ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system based on two power allocation regimes reveal that the MSNR power allocation regime results in a superior BER performance with less SNR compared to the equal power allocation policy.
