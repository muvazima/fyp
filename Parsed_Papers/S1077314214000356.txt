                  This work presents an objective performance analysis of statistical tests for edge detection which are suitable for textured or cluttered images. The tests are subdivided into two-sample parametric and non-parametric tests and are applied using a dual-region based edge detector which analyses local image texture difference. Through a series of experimental tests objective results are presented across a comprehensive dataset of images using a Pixel Correspondence Metric (PCM). The results show that statistical tests can in many cases, outperform the Canny edge detection method giving robust edge detection, accurate edge localisation and improved edge connectivity throughout. A visual comparison of the tests is also presented using representative images taken from typical textured histological data sets. The results conclude that the non-parametric Chi Square (

Conclusions and recommendations are finally presented contrasting the tests and giving guidelines for their practical use while finally confirming which situations improved edge detection can be expected.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over recent years the advances in quantitative systems for biomedical and microscopic imaging have resulted in many applications moving from the purely qualitative analysis of image information to fully (or semi) automated Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and computer aided information extraction systems. One of the key processes underpinning the success of these is the accurate segmentation of constituent image components. This process is commonly, but not exclusively, based on gradient edge information, as in the work of He et al. [1], or the active contour methods of Elmoataz et al. [2] and Svoboda and Matula [3,4], and even the watershed techniques in the work of Beucher and Lantuèjoul [5] and Krishnan et al. [6]. The edge detection process generally applied prior to this segmentation is expected to return accurate detection and location of edges, good suppression of unwanted image texture, clutter or noise and finally continuous closed edge contours.

A typical application for these edge based operations is in the segmentation of stained histological images, as discussed in the work of He et al. [1] and Adiga and Chaudhuri [7]. These images generally have poorly identifiable boundaries, excessive levels of unwanted texture and often a low level of contrast (noted by Todman and Claridge [8]). In these situations it becomes important for the edge detection method to preserve the key edge information, while filtering out the high frequency unwanted texture elements. However, often the edge itself is merely the delimiter between two regions identified by different textures with little discernible step in grey level. Then gradient methods of edge detection are often supported by complementary noise filtering to suppress unwanted texture but this can prove destructive on parts of the edge interface itself. Previous studies have shown how in these situations statistical based edge detection proves more accurate and by applying the edge detection in a single unique process removes the need for any smoothing or preprocessing filtering stage [9–15].

Although a number of studies have detailed the development, success and failures of different edge detection methods, notably the work of Papari and Petkov [16], there has been no presented studies covering a full objective analysis of a wide range of statistical edge detection methods, therefore the literature lacks full quantitative analysis of the accuracy of these methods. Consequently it is difficult to ascertain from the literature which edge detection technique to apply in any particular situation and where any potential improvement in accuracy may be seen. Accordingly this work aims to present an objective set of comparison tests which contrast the performance of several statistical approaches for edge detection on various textured image sets. Comparisons are presented throughout against the traditional Canny gradient edge detection method [17], which is seen as the standard edge detection technique for many applications.

The statistical tests under analysis are all applied within a dual region window based edge detection filter which through the application of angle oriented pixel masks, evaluates the texture of the image to determine the edge location, strength and direction. Seven common statistical tests are applied within this technique, however many more can be applied in future studies. The tests presented represent a range of both parametric and non-parametric tests namely, the Difference of Boxes test, the Student’s t-test, the Fisher test, the Likelihood test, the Mann–Whitney test, the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and the Chi Square test. A quantitative analysis of all these tests is novel to this work and an objective performance metric determines the success of each against a pre-defined ideal ground truth edge image.

To illustrate the potential improvement offered from this work images are also analysed from two typical stained histological image sets (a selection is shown in Fig. 1
                     ) and are courtesy of the Mouse Atlas and Gene Expression project [18] and the Histology Image Dataset (histologyDS) [19], both used here under the creative commons attribution license. These images represent a range of typical texture interfaces found within histological datasets and medical tissue datasets and are used as an illustration of the common problems apparent to automated segmentation. We discuss the success and failures of edge detection (both traditional and statistical) on these sample images and aim to illustrate where improved segmentation can be offered to other heavily textured datasets.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will review the historical developments within statistical based edge detection paying particular attention to any developments for textured and cluttered images. Section 3 will detail the implementation and the method of statistical edge detection used within this work. Section 4 then presents a full quantitative analysis of the statistical tests, detailing the experimental methodology and controls applied (sub-Section 4.1) and the objective performance measure used (sub-Section 4.2). Finally Section 5 concludes the findings from this work, presenting a list of successes and failures for the various statistical tests (Table 6) showing the overall success of each with regards to accuracy, suppression of unwanted image texture and improved connectivity of the edge detection results.

Traditional edge detection methods commonly apply a first derivative computation of the image edge to assess any change in intensity profile of neighbouring pixels. Therefore a strong intensity change corresponds to accurate edge information and yields good results. Edges within histological images like the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas (MA) set or the HistologyDS set (Fig. 1) [18,19], exist between regions of differing pixel texture and low levels of intensity difference. Any differences in texture can therefore be analysed based on the statistical properties of the texture alone. The work of Davis [9] first introduced the notion of image texture analysis, confirming the noted limitations of first order derivative methods in texture analysis and indicating the potential value of region based statistical operations for texture discrimination problems. The work of de Souza [10] complements this idea by introducing the concept of statistical parametric and non-parametric region based texture analysis methods for images. These were applied for the detection of edges, particularly rib structures, in noisy X-ray imagery and the work contrasts the Student’s t-test (t-test), the Fisher test (F Test), the Chi Square test (
                        
                           
                              
                                 χ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     ), the Likelihood ratio test, and the Tau (
                        
                           τ
                        
                     ) test. Although lacking a full objective analysis of the success of the individual methods de Souza’s work clearly demonstrates their suitability for edge detection and indicated the direction for future studies. Non-parametric statistical tests are also applied for successful edge detection in the work of Bovik et al. [11]. Here the authors detail the successful use of two non-parametric ranking statistical edge detectors, namely the Wilcoxon and Median tests, and although largely theoretical and lacking a comprehensive objective analysis does clearly illustrate how these non-parametric statistical tests outperform many common parametric statistical tests on noise free and noisy sample images. Additional work by Bovik and Munsonn [20] enhanced this study, showing statistical edge detection using the local region average values in pixel texture and leading to the development of the first Ratio of Averages (RoA) edge detection method. This technique is shown to be suitable for overcoming high levels of image speckle noise and again improving over the traditional methods. Brooks and Bovik [21] also showed how when measured objectively against an ideal response, this RoA edge detector produced inconsistencies related to the localisation of edges which is often undesired. To overcome this the authors developed and compared two further statistical edge detection methods, namely the Ratio of Order Statistics detector (RoS) and the Ratio of Blues detector (RoB) [21], both of these detectors, when objectively assessed outperformed the original RoA detector both on edge localisation and noise suppression.

Similar non-parametric statistical tests are also evaluated in the work of Beauchemin et al. [12], namely the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (WMW). The authors work details two significant contributions to the field of region based statistical edge detection, namely how non-parametric tests are effective at overcoming a low image signal to noise ratio and also how their statistical significance is independent of the pixel texture distribution and therefore gives a tolerance against extreme observations. This work does note one significant shortcoming in non-parametric statistical tests, namely how a loss in the output efficiency is common because only the rank of the pixel distributions is used in the test.

Parametric local region statistics have also been commonly applied within edge detection to effectively detect textured interfaces, most notably within the work of Guest [13] and Fesharaki and Hellestrand [22]. Guest [13] applied two common parametric statistical tests, namely the Student’s t-test and the Fisher test and showed using a subjective analysis how both tests can succeed where the Canny method fails, whereas Fesharaki and Hellestrand [22] used a similar technique alongside the Student’s t-test to offer improvements in both noise-free and noise-corrupted images. Similar non-linear region methods of edge detection are used within the work of Cafforio et al. [14] who uses a simple isotropic dual circular window for the statistical analysis to provide robust edge detection and additionally in the work of Sciascio [23] illustrating how this technique gives a comparable response to the Canny filter, albeit measured subjectively. Work by Lim and Jan [24,25] further confirms the previous work of Guest [13] and Fesharaki and Hellestrand [22] by showing how the Student’s t-test outperforms the Canny method on images corrupted with added noise. Lim and Jan [24] 
                     [25] also show how this parametric t-test can be outperformed by the non-parametric Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test on images where the noise is of high levels, again illustrating where non-parametric tests offer an improvement. These statistical methods, while removing the need for the smoothing parameters evident in Canny and other gradient based techniques therefore negating the location problems, perform statistical confidence checks using probability values and look-up tables. Work by Bowring et al. [26] has since described the possibility of producing segmentation superior to both the Canny filter, and SUSAN filter [27] using parametric statistical methods, without the need for this confidence check. This method was further adapted by Fan et al. [28] who incorporated an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to be a fuzzy classifier for the strength of the edge found by the statistical tests. Further confirmation of statistical methods in edge detection giving improved robustness to image noise have since been demonstrated by Ponomarenko et al. [29], Peng et al. [30] and Haldar et al. [15] who all demonstrated how statistical edge detection outperforms traditional gradient methods given images with high levels of noise and Fu et al. [31] who through statistical difference measures overcame the inherent speckle noise problems in synthetic aperture radar images.

Throughout the literature performance comparisons of these statistical edge detection methods is generally confined to subjective testing and often for a limited specific set of images. A few key studies have sought to assess the improvements objectively, notably Kundu [32] who analysed a novel three phase statistical edge detector using Pratt’s Figure of merit [33] and Hou and Koh [34] who have applied the Pratt comparison measure to detail the improvement from robust statistics over derivative methods corrupted with high levels of impulsive noise. Although this work is not an exhaustive objective analysis of a range of statistical methods, the initial results show how an objective analysis can be used to indicate the measured improvements from a particular statistical technique. Where objective studies have shown an under performance of statistical techniques, namely in the work of Setayesh et al. [35] who shows a robust rank order non-parametric test being outperformed, the failures can be attributed to comparisons being made with incomplete processing. The authors in their work note that a Robust Rank Order statistical edge detection filter has no post-processing applied and therefore the objective comparison with the Canny filter (including Non-Maximal Suppression and Hysteresis thresholding) can be questioned.

@&#METHODS@&#

The implementation of statistical edge detection used within this work is the method initially described by Guest [13] and Bowring et al. [26] and has been further extended within this work. The principle of this statistical edge detection filter is briefly illustrated in Fig. 2
                      and will now be described in detail.


                     Fig. 2a shows a sample of dual region masks used within this statistical edge detection filter, and Fig. 2b shows four masks applied to a typical histological image section with a clearly defined texture edge. These masks are used to measure the local pixel texture differences in the image regions and therefore locate edges. The principal idea is to evaluate two-sample statistical tests over the two regions (A and B) covered by each mask and a decision based on the statistical test applied can then indicate the location and strength of edges or non-edges. It is likely that any two-sample statistical test used in the decision would give a high response if both data sets (A and B) are from different image regions (see Fig. 2b mask 4), and likewise a low response if they are from the same region (see Fig. 2b masks 1 and 3). This statistical difference will have a peak response when the mask lies over the intersection of two different image regions and therefore at the location of an edge, with the angle of each mask indicating the edge orientation (see Fig. 2b mask 4). The maximum response from each test can then be used to reconstruct the output image pixel by pixel, and the mask angle (Fig. 2a) being useful in post processing and Non-Maximal Suppression edge thinning stages.

Several masks of different sizes can be used within this technique. These masks can range in odd numerical increments from as small as 
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                         pixels to as large as required.

As the size of the statistical mask is increased more pixels are used in the evaluation, therefore the size of the mask acts as a scale parameter in the edge detection giving different results for the different mask scale applied. Smaller scale masks (
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                        ) would be accurate for detecting finer changes within the image pixel texture whereas larger scale masks (
                           
                              19
                              ×
                              19
                           
                        ) would be more suitable for noise suppression and for detection of edges that are corrupted by unwanted excessive texture. Within this work results are presented on masks covering 
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                         to 
                           
                              51
                              ×
                              51
                           
                        .

The angle of the mask is another parameter which is changed throughout this work to allow edge detection at various orientations. The number of mask orientations used and the angle step size used between each mask angle is proportional to the size of the mask used. If small scale masks are used (for example 
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                        ) then 12 mask angles can be used providing an angle step of 
                           
                              15
                              °
                           
                        . If larger masks are used (greater than 
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                         pixels) then 20 masks are possible and a reduced angle step of 
                           
                              9

                        .

For this work common two-sample statistical tests are used to compare the mask regions (A and B). Where a set is described in the test it refers to one of the two mask regions shown in Fig. 2a. Each test presented in this section is chosen to represent a common range of statistical tests available and can be roughly subdivided into either a parametric mean based or variance based test and a distribution (or ranking) based non-parametric test.

The Student’s t-test is a popular mean based statistical test which tests the null hypothesis that two distributions will have the same or a similar mean value. It is generally used where the two populations (or data sets) will have similar variances, however Bowring et al. [26] showed in practise it gives good results even with regions of greatly differing variances. The two-sample T test for two equally sized regions is given here as Eq. (1):

The Difference of Boxes (DoB) test is the second mean based statistical test used in this work. The DoB test was initially defined in the work of Rosenfeld and Kak [36] and Bovik et al. [11] and calculates the difference in the means of the two mask regions. Usually two varying size mean filters are used as described by Rosenfeld [37], however here simply the means of the two different mask regions are used. The DoB statistic is therefore given using Eq. (2) as the absolute difference in the means of region A and B.

If the means of the two mask regions does not differ significantly a more suitable approach would be to analyse the variance of the two regions. The Fisher test (F-test) is the first variance based test to be used for this situation. The F-test is applied to check the hypothesis that two datasets will have the same or a similar variance. The two-sample F-test is defined as the ratio of the variances of region A and B using Eq. (3):

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (or KS Test) checks neither the variance nor the mean of the two pixel regions, but simply checks, via sorting or ranking, for any difference in the two distributions. The KS-test is one of the most common rank tests and is based on an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of sorted ascending data points defined in Eq. (6):

The statistical filter technique presented in Section 3.1 using all the statistical tests from Section 3.2 will be evaluated through four different experiments. Experiment 1 (sub-Section 4.3) is a quantitative performance on synthetic images with controlled statistical properties. Experiment 2 (sub-Section 4.4) presents a quantitative test on synthetic images which have been created to replicate real texture properties of images. Experiment 3 (sub-Section 4.5) shows a quantitative test on images consisting of multiple interfaces of different statistical magnitudes. Finally experiment 4 (sub-Section 4.6) shows the statistical tests on real histological images. For all tests a general comparison is given to the benchmark Canny edge detection. The Canny method is chosen as the standard within edge detection, with it generally being the method of choice in many edge segmentation applications. This work compares to Canny over a range of mask sizes from

                      and Canny Gaussian scales. Further methods for edge detection are not compared within this work as we compare against the traditional edge detection method as a comparator. A Monte-Carlo analysis will be performed for all results whereby a range of input images using the same controls are tested and the mean (

                     ) across all results is given as the overall performance measure. These tests therefore contrast the suitability of statistical edge detection, evaluating both accuracy of the results and suppression of unwanted image texture.

For all results within this work we apply the common standard post processing stages of Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) and thresholding with Hysteresis. This is the same technique as is applied in the Canny filter [17]. Throughout the results thresholds were defined for the hysteresis where the high threshold (THH) was varied in 12 decrements covering the range of greyscale values from 240 to 20 and where the low threshold (THL) is set to always be 40% of the current THH. Each threshold image is then compared against the ideal using an objective pixel comparison metric. Canny results are also given for the same threshold levels and comparisons are given against the Canny results for all threshold images. This form of control within the tests allows all results to be a comparison of the difference in the individual statistical tests against the Canny technique with no variation in the threshold or NMS technique.

To allow a variance analysis of the results and to illustrate the robustness of the statistical methods across a range of input images, five independent versions of each image using a Monte Carlo method is used for experiment 1, 2 and 3. This allows five representations of each image within each of the experiments.

Quantitative analysis of edge detection performance is a non-trivial task and extensive work has detailed the key developments towards supplying a full objective method. Traditional methods measure the output result based on the performance within a proposed segmentation task. This is usually in the context of automated object segmentation, or where manually, then items being seen and classified by an observer [38]. Often the objective measures are applied against a desired result, which is usually the manual segmentation or recognition by a user, for example the University of South Florida dataset in the work of Heath et al. [38] and Bowyer et al. [39] and also the Berkeley segmentation dataset applied in Martin et al. [40]. While these methods offer a good objective segmentation framework their application within objective texture edge detection analysis is less common. Not only is the data defined to replicate objects generally with little texture but often the data contained within these datasets is derived on segmentation of boundaries or closed object contours and therefore not specifically edges. Therefore ground truth results, which often contain accurate boundary information, have generally less accurate edge information. Often edges are incorrectly represented or missing as the ground truth method favours object boundaries. This brings into question the suitability of these datasets for measuring texture edge detection and as one aim of this work is to provide a general template of the performance of statistical edge detection methods, the creation of controlled synthetic pixel interfaces which replicate real and controlled texture interfaces is preferred.

Objective performance of edge detection is generally performed as a measurement of accuracy in the results against an ideal ground truth image. Many methods exist for performing this measurement each aiming to provide the optimal method for measuring similarity to the ideal output. Notable methods for objective analysis include the Probablistic Rand Index (PRI) of Savitzkey and Golay [41], the Figure of Merit (FoM) by Pratt [33], the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves of Bowyer et el [39], the Pixel Correspondence Metric (PCM) of Prieto Segui and Allen [42], the Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measures (F) of Martin et al. [40], and also the Variation of Information (VI) measure by Melia [43] to name a few. Often these measurements are defined as a measurement of the edge detection accuracy or hit rate (usually the total of true positives and true negatives), against miss detected edges (the total of false negatives) and over detected edges (the total of false positives) [40]. These methods are particularly suited for measuring the change on edge detector performance as a parameter (typically a threshold) is varied. However initial analysis within this work showed that some measurements using this approach can have inaccuracies when determining the true location of edges to the ground truth. Specifically, both the PRI [41], and VI [43] methods when in test, awarded comparable performance (to 2 d.p precision) for edges which are either misaligned or fragmented, or when the number of detected edge points is the same in the output image as the number of ideal edge points, irrespective of the location. Our work found that both the PRI and VI measures award an ideal result to the ground truth given this problem. As this work aims to show performance with a controlled tolerance for edge location and accuracy to the ideal response the PCM [42], FoM [33] and CDM [39] prove more suitable.

The Pixel Correspondence Metric (PCM) [42] is an objective measure for assessing edge detector response against an ideal ground truth image. PCM evaluates all the pixel points in two given images

                        ). Any non-matched pixel points are then measured as errors where the comparison then eliminates the possibility of multiple matches to the same edge point through a process of weighted matching using bipartite graphs. This form of bipartite matching ensures that for every non-zero pixel point in the edge detected image the PCM match value is maximised using the ideal as defined in Eq. (11). For the work presented here the binary implementation of PCM by Prieto Segui and Allen [42] is used.

                         distances of either one or two pixels across the mask scales used, whereas low responses can be awarded when

                         is set to a zero value. Table 1 additionally shows a comparison of the PCM measure response against both the Figure of Merit (FoM) by Pratt [33] and the Closest Distance Metric (CDM) defined in the work of Bowyer et al. [39]. Comparable responses are shown for both the FoM and CDM measures (with 
                           
                              η

                        ) gives a greater response for both edge detectors across all mask sizes.

As ambiguities can be expected when defining ideal digital representations or ground truth edge interfaces, and when sub-pixel positions are not considered, edge detector results can be subject to a location shift in their outputs from the ideal. Therefore, having 
                           
                              η
                           
                         values of one or two is generally advised to compensate for this expected shift. A 
                           
                              η
                           
                         value of one is used throughout this work allowing for a single pixel shift in the results from the ideal.

For this test a set of synthetic images are presented which represent common texture interfaces as a single edge between two different textured regions (Table 2
                         Images A–C). Each image has an associated ground truth, which represents the single interface as a binary output ideal response. All images are created with controlled statistical distributions to ensure the texture interfaces are free of any unwanted repetition or noise. For example, Table 2 Image A represents a textured interface generated with a mean difference in pixel grey-scale and near zero variance, whereas Table 2 Image B represents a variance interface with both a mean and variance change and Table 2 Image C indicates a variance only change with near zero mean change.

The results presented in Table 2 show the mean and standard deviation PCM measurement (where

Analysing the results for the synthetic interface images within this experimental test (Table 2 and Fig. 3
                        ) it is clearly shown that with mean interface edges (Table 2 Image A) the Mann–Whitney U test, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         test, Difference of Boxes test and Student’s t-test are the most successful. Generally these tests achieve a mean PCM measure in excess of 96
                           
                              %
                           
                         across most mask scales and often producing a peak PCM measure in excess of the Canny peak result of 97.1. Minimal deviation is also shown across all the images within each Monte Carlo set showing a consistency in the edge detection performance throughout the different tests. As expected with this type of mean interface the variance based Fisher test gave the poorest result, with a peak PCM measure of 45.9 being achieved for a 
                           
                              5
                              ×
                              5
                           
                         mask size resulting from a spurious over detection of edges within the image texture.

Analysis of the results from a combination of both mean and variance based edge patterns (Table 2 Image B) shows how the Student’s t-test, Likelihood test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test are now the most successful. All three tests achieving a maximum PCM in excess of the 96.7 maximum awarded to the Canny filter. Again limited deviation is found across all images in each set indicating a consistent response to the texture variants within the edge set. The Fisher test is again the least successful of all tests with a maximum PCM measure of 77.8 being achieved. Although this result indicates the partial success of the Fisher test for mean and variance edges further analysis shows how the output edge is shifted in location greater than the one pixel (
                           
                              η
                           
                        ) against the ideal. This localisation error is due to the variance computation of the Fisher test and can be expected to increase in proportional to the increase in mask size.

If the mean based interface is now completely removed and the results analysed against a variance based interface only (Table 2 Image C), then the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         and Fisher tests are now the most accurate for edge detection with a peak mean PCM of 97.1 and 95.8 respectively. The KS test (with a PCM of 95.6) is also suitable at detecting this type of variance edge. All three statistical methods of edge detection give higher mean PCM measures and lower deviation as the mask size increases and greatly outperform the Canny method with a peak PCM of 2.0. Overall the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         outperforms the Fisher test for this variance edge in addition to being one of the most successful detectors of mean only interfaces (Table 2 Image A).

If the statistical technique is visually evaluated against the image results for the Canny method (Fig. 3) a comparison can be drawn between the statistical results and the Canny results for both mean interfaces and mean variance interfaces; with specific tests (namely the Mann–Whitney U test) improving over the Canny results and achieving a greater mean PCM measure and less deviation in the edge pixels along the detected edge interface. For variance only interfaces the statistical Fisher test, KS test and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         test all outperform the Canny method, which due to its derivative nature fails to detect any variance interface and gives a high response to the image texture (Fig. 3).

For test 2 each image represents controlled texture synthetically created from a typical textured image, here we use a sample histological image (Fig. 4
                         top). The pixel statistics are extracted from eight different tissue regions within this sample image. These statistics are then used to create four synthetic test interfaces (Fig. 4a–d). A simple analysis of the statistical pixel differences in these textured interfaces against the synthetic images from experimental test 1 is given in Table 3
                        , and indicates that typical histological interfaces commonly exist with a difference in both the mean and the variance due to the pixel texture. Therefore the interfaces within the second set seem to be most similar to Table 2 Image B, in having both a mean and variance change in texture. (See Fig. 5
                        ).

Analysing the PCM results for these images (Table 4
                        ) then the accuracy of the statistical edge detection tests is again noted. Again both the mean based Student’s t-test and the Difference of Boxes test perform well across each image within the set, detecting the edge interface while suppressing the unwanted texture. Both of these statistical tests give comparable performance to the Canny achieving a PCM measure greater than or in the region of 96.0. Nonparametric statistical tests also perform well at finding these synthetic interfaces, illustrating the suitability for these tests in heavily textured images. The Kolmogorov Smirnov test performed best overall and can outperform the Canny filter achieving a PCM measure of 99.1 (Table 4). The 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         test is again another non-parametric test which proves successful for this textured edge detection and although showing poor results at small mask sizes notably for Image A in Table 4 does improve at larger mask sizes and generally outperforms the Canny method overall (Table 4 Images A–D).

Within real images a single interface cannot be generally assumed due to lighting variations, image clutter and object variation. Therefore synthetic images consisting of various edges with interfaces of different intensity levels and texture properties would be more representative of the real world. Test 3 aims to illustrate this situation by detailing the results for multiple interfaces of varying statistical differences and magnitudes within a sample image. For this test a single mosaic image containing various edges of different controlled statistical pixel distributions is used (Fig. 6
                        a). This mosaic image contains three rows of interfaces giving 26 edges in total and consisting of different properties and magnitudes (the values of the interfaces is given in Fig. 6b). The associated ideal edge response is again a binary image whereby all interfaces are given the same intensity or value (Fig. 6c).

The results shown in Table 5
                         are again the mean PCM measure across the five different Monte Carlo derived versions of this image with the deviation given throughout for all the edge detection filters. These results show that the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         performs the best overall, achieving high PCM values and illustrating its accuracy in detecting all the edge interfaces within this image. The results show correct detection and location and a peak PCM measure of 96.8, and above 94 for all masks of 
                           
                              9
                              ×
                              9
                           
                         or greater.

Although giving a spurious edge response to some image texture, and failing to detect one of the interfaces within the image (the lower left edge in Fig. 6a), the KS test is the second most successful of all the edge detection tests (see Fig. 7
                        ). This shows that these two non-parametric tests offer improvements where the Canny method fails and outperform all other statistical tests in synthetic situations which mimic real world problems. This robustness in performance is due to the output from these tests being proportional to the mask size used, this contrasts the noted problems of the non-parametric tests losing efficiency discussed by Beauchemin et al. [12]. Here this limitation is measured as an advantage since the result of the edge is normalised locally within the test and acts as a local threshold on the edge detection results, therefore giving the same response for a high intensity or variance change edge and also a low intensity or variance change edge. This makes both tests suitable for applications where edges can be both weak and strong and removes the need for defining a subjective global threshold for the output image. As expected the mean based edge detection tests, namely the DoB test and the Student’s t-test, give a comparable response to the Canny edge detection filter. However the DoB test is more suited to detect edges of lower intensity changes, here shown in the detection of the interfaces in the top left and bottom left of the image, where the intensity step is only 10 grey levels in height. The likelihood test also gives a comparable test to the Canny filter, and the Mann–Whitney test shows a suitability in detecting lower intensity changes irrespective of the change in variance.

The final test, the F test, again gives the poorest response to the image, giving both over detection of edges and a spurious response to the texture, this is in addition to the location shift problem detailed in experimental test 1. This experimental test does however illustrate the possibility of the Fisher test being used to detect edge interfaces edges where other methods fail, namely with the mean based tests and variance interfaces. However generally this will result in fragmented and shifted edge responses and therefore edge linking and location correction should be considered.

For this test a typical set of real textured images have been used to show the possibility of achieving improved edge detection and suppression of unwanted tissue texture within a practical segmentation situation. The images presented are courtesy of the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) and the histologyDS dataset [18,19]. For clarity only eleven images from the sets are presented here in Figs. 8–10
                        
                        
                        . Edge detection is performed across all images using mask sizes from 
                           
                              5

                         inclusive. However unlike general intensity images containing easily classified or discernible objects, like the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset [40], texture images like this, are more problematic to segment manually. Often the suitability of ground truth data cannot always be guaranteed to represent accurate edges and boundaries or closed contours are more easy to define. For this test a comparison to the benchmark Canny filter is visually presented (Figs. 8–10), with the corresponding best statistical edge detection results and Canny results shown.

The results of the first histological set in Fig. 8 show the statistical edge detection methods in general produce comparable responses to the Canny filter and are suitable for accurately detecting the tissue texture interfaces where mean based edges in texture can be assumed. This is most notable when using the Difference of Boxes (DoB) statistical test at smaller mask scales of 
                           
                              7
                              ×
                              7
                           
                         (in Fig. 8a1–c1). This mirrors the results from the synthetic images (in Table 4) where comparable PCM measures were constantly awarded both the DoB and Canny methods. If larger scale masks are used, namely 
                           
                              9
                              ×
                              9
                           
                         and 
                           
                              11
                              ×
                              11
                           
                        , then both the Difference of Boxes test and the Student’s t-test can give a suppression of the unwanted histological texture located in inner tissue sections (Fig. 8a2–a4, b2–b4, and c2–c4) while preserving segment boundaries. This is compared to the Canny filter (Fig. 8a5–c5) which although accurate, fails to suppress unwanted tissue texture while preserving these important segment edges.

The results in Fig. 8d1–d4, show the statistical Difference of Boxes test at large masks scales (
                           
                              13
                              ×
                              13
                           
                         and 
                           
                              15
                              ×
                              15
                           
                        ) which continues to improve this suppression of the unwanted histological texture and clutter while preserving the segment interfaces between the key sections (Fig. 8d1 and d2). Again the Canny filter (Fig. 8d5) fails to accurately segment this complex interface and eliminates some inner edge boundaries. Not only do the statistical methods continue to suppress the cell texture and segment the texture interfaces in these examples, but they also allow for continuous edge linking to be possible between faint or difficult to detect regions. Fig. 8e3 and e4 shows the statistical Fisher test and Likelihood test at masks of 
                           
                              11
                              ×
                              11
                           
                         and 
                           
                              13
                              ×
                              13
                           
                        . Here both tests improve over the Canny method (Fig. 8c5) by providing improved edge detection and edge linking on the central tissue sections where some of the finer sections of the embryo become disconnected and discontinuous in the Canny result.


                        Fig. 9 now shows a sample of the histologyDS dataset, which in contrast to the EMAP histological images, contain a variety of texture interfaces of generally varying magnitudes. Edges within these images are not therefore always defined where there is a mean change in the pixel intensity as was common in Fig. 8, and generally there is a range of different edge interfaces, with intensity and variance commonly being the definition of an edge (for example as illustrated in Fig. 9a). Edges can also be a result of low level intensity changes (see Fig. 9b), or even a combination of both low level intensity changes, and higher level intensity or texture changes (see Fig. 9c).

The results for these images reveals that the statistical tests generally outperform the Canny method throughout giving both improved edge detection and increased edge continuity. Fig. 9a1–a4 shows the results from the statistical KS and Mann–Whitney (U) test at scales of 17×17 to 21×21. If these results are compared to the Canny method (Fig. 9a5) then comparisons can be drawn between them. However, looking closer at the statistical results corresponding to the region indicated in Fig. 9a, shows that when texture is the interface in the image, then all the statistical tests correctly locate the three differences in histological tissue. Whereas the Canny filter (Fig. 9a5) is less successful in this situation, generally returning incomplete and fragmented edges. This highlights the possibility of the non-parametric statistical tests being more suited to texture interfaces where a mean change is not guaranteed.


                        Fig. 9b, shows an example where edges within histological data can consist of varying levels of intensity change, here illustrating both high contrast edges and low contrast edges in the region indicated. The statistical

                        , DoB and Students t-test both perform well on this image, with the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ

                         test giving not only accurate detection of the cell sections, but also the closed outer contour of the surrounding tissue within the area indicated (Fig. 9b1 and b4). This is not evident with the Canny method (Fig. 9b5), which although accurate at detecting the boundaries of the cell structures, fails to accurately detect the low intensity outer tissue section. This complements the results from Section 4.5 (experimental test 3) where the statistical 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         test was the most suited for detecting all edge heights and differences within the statistical interface image including the very low levels of intensity change. This performance is continued within Fig. 9c, where the non-parametric statistical tests, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        , KS and Mann–Whitney (U) are all successful at detecting the strong and weak edges indicated within this image, therefore improving over the Canny method where the weaker edges become fragmented or go undetected (Fig. 9c5). These results show how in situations where the edge height is non-uniform in the image and strong edges cannot be assumed a priori the non-parametric statistical tests are the most suitable for detecting all edges.

This hypothesis is confirmed within the results presented in Fig. 10a–c. Here all images have intensity boundaries of varying magnitude and generally consist of a very low contrast value. Again regions of interest are illustrated in these images and the statistical non-parametric tests (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        , KS and Mann–Whitney) are the most suitable edge detection tests, with all returning accurate connected contours of the edges within all images (Fig. 10a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, b4 and c1, c2). This continues the improvement offered over the Canny method which often returns fragmented or missing edges (Fig. 10a5, b5, and c5).

Recommendations can be drawn from all the experiments which will aim to determine in which situation a particular statistical test is most suited. Table 6
                         details these recommendations, drawing from all the results presented within the experimental tests. It presented the advantages and disadvantages for each test contrasting which situations a specific test would be most suitable. Where intensity based interfaces are expected all tests except for the Fisher test would be suitable, with the Difference of Boxes DoB and Student’s t-test test able to provide results that surpass the benchmark Canny method, especially when presented with levels of unwanted texture or image clutter. Where mean interfaces are not guaranteed and texture variance can be assumed then the non-parametric

                         and Fisher test are the most successful, with the

                         test capable of detecting edge interfaces where all other techniques fail. This is alongside being one of the most successful edge detection tests for mean based edge interfaces and therefore being one of the most robust edge detection tests overall. Where variability in edge interfaces are expected, for example varying levels of intensity, texture and clutter, then non-parametric tests would be the most suitable choice in being capable to detect all edge interfaces independent of the interface height or strength.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we present an analysis of statistical methods for edge detection which are particularly suited to textured edge interfaces or for edges where an intensity change cannot be guaranteed. The tests presented in this work represent common two-sample parametric and non-parametric statistical tests and are applied within a dual-region edge detection technique. Each test is assessed by applying the objective Pixel Correspondence Metric (PCM) within controlled experimental tests using a range of synthetic interface images which represent different texture interfaces against a pre-defined ideal ground truth. Comparisons are then drawn against the Canny method and visual results are contrasted for real histological data. Recommendations for the use of the statistical tests are discussed throughout the results and are summarised in Table 6.

                     ) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests offer the most general method for edge detection and the results presented in this work confirm how these methods of edge detection are the most successful where the statistical nature of the edge cannot be assumed a priori. Therefore in situations where both mean and variance changes cannot be guaranteed both of these non-parametric tests would be suitable edge detection methods. The results further confirm how the non-parametric tests act as edge normalisation filters, therefore giving a comparable output response to all strengths of edges. This makes them suitable for detecting faint, or difficult to detect low intensity edges where other techniques fail while also removing the need to threshold the output results at a subjectively defined level. This was confirmed further when applying the tests to a sample set of histological images taken from two typical datasets. This shows how the statistical methods give improved edge segmentation and generally gives a greater response to the textured interfaces, allowing continuous accurate edge detection with improved suppression of any unwanted inner texture detail where the Canny method fails. This was most notable in detecting continuous edge interfaces when both faint edges are required alongside heavily textured edges. The experimental results presented within this work therefore show the suitability of statistical parametric and non-parametric techniques for the suppression of unwanted image texture or clutter while giving continuous edges in complex images.

@&#FUTURE WORK@&#

While this work has presented an objective measurement of statistical edge detection and also indicated the suitable application domains for each, the subjective selection of each test is still required in practice to achieve the optimal results. Therefore, without prior knowledge of image statistics, the accurate selection of the ideal statistical edge detection test cannot be easily determined. Alongside the statistical test, selecting the correct mask scale is another parameter being difficult to determine a priori. We have shown how larger statistical masks can generally give the highest measured results and how the quality of the results is dependent on selecting the optimal scale. To overcome this problem in selecting both statistical test and mask scale our current work is looking to combine all the statistical tests presented within this work over various mask together into one edge detection method. This will be achieved by classifying the response from the various tests over all mask scales using trained Artificial Neural Networks to give the optimum response. This will give an edge detection method that can be applied across a general image set, or through appropriate training be able to classify edges into a bespoke application offering improved edge detection results while removing the subjective selection of edge detection method and scale.
