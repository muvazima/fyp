                  In the work presented here, a novel mathematical model was developed to explore the bi-directional communication between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and inflammatory cytokines in acute inflammation. The dynamic model consists of five delay differential equations 5D for two main pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and two hormones of the HPA axis (ACTH and cortisol) and LPS endotoxin. The model is an attempt to increase the understanding of the role of primary hormones and cytokines in this complex relationship by demonstrating the influence of different organs and hormones in the regulation of the inflammatory response. The model captures the main qualitative features of cytokine and hormone dynamics when a toxic challenge is introduced. Moreover, in this work a new simple delayed model of the HPA axis is introduced which supports the understanding of the ultradian rhythm of HPA hormones both in normal and infection conditions. Through simulations using the model, the role of key inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in transition from acute to persistent inflammation through stability analysis is investigated. Also, by employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, parameter uncertainty and the effects of parameter variations on each other are analyzed. This model confirms the important role of the HPA axis in acute and prolonged inflammation and can be a useful tool in further investigation of the role of stress on the immune response to infectious diseases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

For decades, the following general concept concerning the endocrine system has been accepted: the regulation of the immune system by the nervous system is achieved through an interaction between various hormones and cytokines in different organs of the body. Perhaps, the best known of the early studies was performed by Selye who noted the relation between stress and substantial decrease of circulating lymphocytes and shrinkage of the thymus and lymph nodes in rats [36]. Since then, the idea of bidirectional communication between the immune and the central nervous system and the role of hormones and cytokines in this interaction have been supported by various experiments and studies [40].

During the last decade, much attention has been given to the role of the interaction between the immune and nervous systems in immune diseases, such as autoimmune, allergy, inflammatory, and viral infections, or nervous system disorders such as major depression [22]. Although much has been done in identifying the different aspects of this network, the complex bidirectional communication system of the HPA is poorly understood [19].

During injury, disease, or infection, the immune system is activated and releases a group of proteins called cytokines, which act as mediators of the innate immune response. Inflammatory cytokines are a type of cytokines that are produced and secreted locally from different immune cells in the inflammatory area during the first phase of immune response. Some examples of these cytokines are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Among all cytokines, these three have the most modulating effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation associated with immune response [11], and as a result of which, cortisol and other glucocorticoid hormones are released by the adrenal glands. The HPA axis has an important role in regulating different organs of the body during exposure to threatening stress. The activation of the HPA axis involves the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, stimulating the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Secreted ACTH in the peripheral circulation stimulates the adrenal cortex, releasing glucocorticoids and, in particular, cortisol into the blood. It is commonly known that glucocorticoids inhibit the activity of the HPA axis by negative feedback on CRH and ACTH secretion [35].

During an infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced and released by immune cells such as macrophages, and T and B lymphocytes. They act on all three levels of the HPA axis (hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands) and through the activation of the HPA axis, stimulate the release of glucocorticoids, in turn suppressing further production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [37]. The effect of the HPA axis on inflammatory/immune response and the roles of the main parts of these systems in this interaction are illustrated in Fig. 1
                        .

Beside the stimulating effects of inflammatory cytokines in activating the HPA axis, a number of these cytokines may act differently in various situations. For example, IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and has been shown to elicit both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. It acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in activating of the HPA axis, but at the same time, inhibits the production of TNF-α and IL-1 [47]. As well, in contrast to the stimulating effect of TNF-α on the HPA axis [14] in humans, it has been shown in a series of animal experiments or human fetal cell experiments that TNF-α has an inhibitory effect on cortisol release [37,5,17,24]. These multifunctional properties and the complex communication between hormones and cells make understanding the interactions between the immune and nervous systems more difficult.

In the last decade, several mathematical models of the HPA axis and acute inflammation have been introduced. However, although various cell culture, animal or, human experiments have been carried out, no mathematical model has been proposed for modeling the bidirectional interaction between the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines in acute inflammation and, specifically, the effects of circadian and ultradian rhythms of the HPA axis in this interaction.

In the work presented here, a delay-differential equation model is proposed for the interaction between the immune system and the HPA axis through two main pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and two main endocrine hormones of the HPA axis (ACTH and cortisol). The authors demonstrate how the model correctly captures the ultradian rhythm of cortisol and ACTH in blood plasma and how it can be used to simulate the behavior of the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines in response to injected LPS. They also show how a few changes in the production rates of pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to a persistent inflammation in the body.

The proposed model is elaborated upon in two stages in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. In the first stage, a new simple 2-D delayed model of the HPA axis is developed. Using physiologically reasonable parameters, it is demonstrated in Section 3 that the model is able to capture ultradian and circadian rhythms of the HPA axis. In the next stage, the complete model of the inflammatory cytokines and the HPA axis with the addition of endotoxin to initiate the immune response is constructed. A number of parameters of the main model are extracted from the clinical published data, and others are estimated using a global optimization algorithm in Section 2.3. An analysis of uncertainty of the estimated parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is also presented. Finally a discussion on the physiological implications of a positive steady state of the model, and the role of cortisol on controlling the inflammation and robustness of the HPA model is described in Section 4.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

So far, no investigation of the interaction between the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines through mathematical models has been performed, but there are several works in the literature for which modeling has been proposed for each of the components of this interaction.

Different mathematical models of the HPA axis have been developed aiming to describe the interaction of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol and the role of the HPA axis in circadian and ultradian (short period) rhythms of cortisol concentration.

Usually, 3 or 4 main hormones of the axis have been utilized. Vinther et al. [42] introduced a simple model for the interaction of the three main hormones of the HPA axis, i.e. CRH, ACTH, and cortisol. Their mathematical analysis demonstrated that without considering delay equations, these hormones cannot exhibit periodic behavior by themselves. In order to simulate the ultradian behavior of the HPA axis, other models have added glucocorticoid receptors (GR) to the equations in addition to these hormones, and have exhibited that ultradian behavior can be expressed by including GR [16,1,13,39,44]. On the other hand, a number of studies have suggested delay equations for modeling of the HPA axis [3,21,44]. The delay parameter has been employed to various degrees in these models. For example, in [21] and [3], the delay parameters were applied at all three major levels of the axis. However, in the model proposed in [44], the delay parameter was only considered for the effects of ACTH on cortisol release. Applying delay in mathematical models results in instability and hence periodic behavior in the model.

In the previously described models of the HPA axis, the ultradian rhythm of the HPA axis has been modeled through at least three variables. This would result in increasing model complexity, more data for parameter estimation, and more difficulties in model analysis. Generally, low dimensional models are always preferable, especially, when the model is intended to be included in other models.

Mathematical modeling of acute and chronic inflammation has also been the subject of quite a few papers. In [9], a four-dimensional differential equations model of inflammation response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin was put forth. A two-variable model for the interaction between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines for rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is proposed in [4]. In addition, a review of mathematical and agent-based models of acute inflammation response is presented by Vodovotz et al. [43].

In the models of acute inflammation, the role of the HPA axis and, specifically the effects of circadian and ultradian rhythms of this axis have been mostly neglected. These works have primarily concentrated on the role of the different components of the immune system on the regulation of acute inflammation.

@&#METHODS@&#

The complete mathematical model is developed in two stages. First, a simple delayed model of the HPA axis is introduced. In the next stage, using the newly built HPA equations, the main model of the interaction between the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines is built.

This model was constructed to explore the interaction between the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines in humans. For this, evidences of the interactions between different parts of the model are extracted from human studies. Based on the lack of human studies validating several assumptions of the model, animal or cell studies to support them are included.

In the first stage, a new delayed mathematical model of the HPA axis is introduced. Given that the HPA model is included in the main immune-nervous model, it is desirable to keep the model simple and small. In the models of the HPA axis presented so far, at least three variables have been used in the modeling of the ultradian and circadian rhythms of the HPA axis. In this section, a 2-D delayed model is presented. In the model, only the dynamics of ACTH and cortisol are considered. It has been argued by others [44,45,10] that the pituitary-adrenal peripheral network is sufficient to produce cortisol ultradian rhythm. It seems that the CRH secretion variation effect on the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is much longer when compared with the effect of ACTH and cortisol on each other, with CRH not indicating any immediate or short effects on ACTH and cortisol blood level fluctuation. This may be related to the limited functional region of CRH and longer delays in signal transduction which lead to the reduction in secretion changes of CRH in the short-term. So, CRH is dropped as a variable from the HPA equations and a constant CRH stimulation value is assumed.

By considering a constant CRH stimulation, the HPA model can be reduced to two delayed differential equations. The 2-D mathematical model of the HPA axis is presented as follows:

The variables in this model are the plasma levels of: ACTH (A(t) 
                           pg
                           /
                           ml
                        ), and cortisol (C(t) 
                           μ
                           g
                           /
                           dl
                        ). The interaction of ACTH and cortisol is modeled by time-delayed feedback of cortisol and ACTH on each other. It has been shown that some time delay is required for the secreted cortisol to have negative feedback on the ACTH dynamics [35,3,21]. This delay is partly the result of spatial separation of the pituitary and adrenal glands, but it is mainly related to the time required for signal transduction, transcription actions in cells, and also translational delays from protein synthesis [27]. Similarly, there is a time delay for ACTH to stimulate the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands [27]. These delays can be incorporated by considering the delayed Hill functions of cortisol and ACTH in (1) and (2). Inclusion of time delay in the differential equation model has a destabilizing effect which may result in ACTH and cortisol oscillations. It can be seen in Section 3 that with this two-dimensional model of the HPA axis, using physiologically reasonable parameter values, the ultradian rhythm of cortisol and ACTH is obtained.

The stimulating effect of ACTH on cortisol dynamics is implemented through cortisol receptors in the adrenal cortex. As a result of the limited capacity of the receptors, one can assume the relevance of the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis in the rate of occupancy of the receptors. So, under the assumption of the law of mass action and the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis, the presented Hill function in (2) can be easily derived for the stimulating effects of ACTH. A complete description of the reaction equations and the derivation of the Hill function is presented in the Appendix A.

Cortisol plays the role of inhibiting mediators in ACTH dynamics [2]. Thus, by using a similar argument for the saturation of free receptors in the pituitary gland, the negative feedback of cortisol can be written by the down-regulating function presented in (1).

The rate of elimination of ACTH and cortisol are represented by the parameters e
                        
                           A
                         and e
                        
                           C
                        , respectively. They can be estimated from the half-lives of ACTH and cortisol. The half-life of a substance is the time it takes for its concentration to reach half of its initial value. Having the half-life of a hormone or cytokine, one can estimate the elimination rate of it using the following equation:

                         is the half-life of the substance.

The parameter h represents the positive stimulation of CRH on ACTH secretion.

In (2), the rate of production of cortisol from the release of ACTH is represented by parameter α. The positive feedback of ACTH on cortisol secretion is modeled by a Hill function for ACTH. Parameter m
                        1 is the number of cortisol molecules and m
                        2 is the number of ACTH molecules that bind to their respective free receptors in the adrenal and pituitary glands. Parameters a and c are the Hill half-maximum constants and represent the concentration of ACTH and cortisol occupying half of the their respective receptors in the adrenal and pituitary glands.

In Fig. 2
                        , a schematic diagram shows the proposed mathematical model of the interactions between inflammatory cytokines and the HPA axis when toxic insult is introduced.

The injected endotoxin activates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The presence of TNF-α exhibits positive feedback on the production of itself [7,28]. TNF-α activates the release of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines. For simplicity, additional pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-1) are omitted from the model, because they have similar roles as TNF-α and activate the production of hormones included in the model.

Although IL-6 is generally considered to be a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in this case, it acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator and has negative feedback on other cytokines and down-regulates the release of TNF-α 
                        [41]. Since all anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune response have similar actions in the model presented here, for simplicity, from all of them, the dynamics of IL-6 is selected as representative of this class of cytokines, and other anti-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-10) are omitted.

The production of both TNF-α and IL-6 has been shown to activate the HPA axis by inducing CRH and ACTH secretion [14]. It has been demonstrated in several studies that inflammatory cytokines act synergistically in HPA activation [7,25,34]. As noted in Section 1, in animal studies, TNF-α has been indicated to have a negative effect on the secretion of cortisol in the adrenal glands [37,5,17,24]. However, in human studies, it has been shown that TNF-α has a stimulating influence on cortisol release [14,15]. As a consequence of the model being constructed for humans, it is assumed there is a stimulating effect of TNF-α on cortisol secretion.

The dynamic model of TNF-α, IL-6, ACTH, and cortisol consists of five delay differential equations 5D). The proposed mathematical model is

Intravenous injection of an endotoxin initiates the production of cytokines. The dynamics of the endotoxin are presented in (4). The endotoxin concentration (with the initial condition 
                           P
                           (
                           0
                           )
                         equal to the injected dose level) decays exponentially with a constant rate equal to the half-life of the endotoxin in plasma [9,31]. e
                        
                           p
                         in (4) is the endotoxin elimination rate and can be set to a fixed value depending on the type of endotoxin and the experiment that is being performed. Inflammatory response accelerates the elimination process of the endotoxin. The degradation rate of the endotoxin based on the release of the inflammatory cytokines is represented by d
                        1. The initial condition for (4) is set according to the injected dose level of the endotoxin in the experiment.

TNF-α and IL-6 have an important role in the clearance of the endotoxin by stimulation of B cells and antibody secretion and activation of the complement system [23]. As a result of the limited capacity of receptors in B cells and other cells involved in endotoxin elimination, and by hypothesizing the law of mass action and the saturation of free receptors, one can derive the given terms of the Michaelis–Menten form in (4) for the effects of TNF-α and IL-6. Parameters x
                        1 and x
                        2 are Michaelis–Menten half-maximum constants for their respective equations and are the concentrations at which the Michaelis–Menten terms are at half their maximum saturation values.

TNF-α is the first cytokine that is activated by the injection of endotoxin [11]. The presence of TNF-α further contributes to the activation of itself [28,38]. IL-6 and cortisol down-regulate the inflammatory actions of the endotoxin and TNF-α.

The dynamics of TNF-α can be represented by (5). Parameter e
                        
                           T
                         defines the elimination rate and parameter k is the rate of production of TNF-α from the presence of the endotoxin. The effect of endotoxin injection on TNF-α production is modeled in Michaelis-Menten form by the second expression of (5).

The production and release of the endotoxin is not the only effector of TNF-α dynamics; the activation of TNF-α is also affected by the presence of IL-6 and cortisol which are down-regulating mediators. Each of these has its own inhibition effects that are represented in the third term of (5).

The inhibitory effects of IL-6 and cortisol on TNF-α are captured by two down-regulating functions of S and C. The negative effects of these terms increase, approaching unity, as the concentration of IL-6 or cortisol increase. Parameters x
                        3, x
                        4, x
                        5 and x
                        6 are the half-saturation constants. The inhibitory effects of cortisol and IL-6 on TNF-α production are adjusted by d
                        2 and d
                        3, respectively.

The dynamics of IL-6, the inflammatory cytokine that acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator in cytokine dynamics and a pro-inflammatory mediator in ACTH dynamics can be represented as (6). The elimination rate of IL-6 from blood plasma is a constant value and is represented by e
                        
                           S
                        . It is the rate at which the cytokine is removed from the body.

The dynamics of IL-6 are governed by the presence of TNF-α and cortisol, where TNF-α has an up-regulating effect and cortisol has a down-regulating effect on the production of IL-6. The effects of TNF-α and cortisol on IL-6 are formulated by Michaelis–Menten kinetics. These up- and down-regulating effects are represented in (6). Parameters x
                        7 and x
                        8 are half-saturation constants, and parameter d
                        4 fine tunes the stimulating and inhibitory effects of TNF-α and cortisol on IL-6 production.

The dynamics of ACTH and cortisol are based on Eqs. (1) and (2) and can be written as (7) and (8). The third component of (7) models the effects of TNF-α and IL-6 on the dynamics of ACTH. When the endotoxin insult is introduced, TNF-α and IL-6 act synergistically to up-regulate ACTH concentration [7,25,34].

The up-regulating effect of inflammatory cytokines on ACTH production is modeled by Michaelis-Menten kinetics for IL-6 and TNF-α. Parameter d
                        5 is the scaling parameter of the production of IL-6 and TNF-α and adjusts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the dynamics of ACTH.

The up-regulating effects of IL-6 and TNF-α on cortisol dynamics are also incorporated in the cortisol Eq. (8). Parameters x
                        9, x
                        10, x
                        11, and x
                        12 are also the Michaelis-Menten half-maximum constants for their respective equations, and parameters d
                        5 and d
                        6 adjust the impact of IL-6 and TNF-α on the production of ACTH and cortisol, respectively.

Many studies have suggested that the origin of the circadian rhythm of cortisol is not the inherent behavior of the HPA axis and should come from the generated signals by the central pace maker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) [18]. Therefore, as suggested by [16], an external time periodic function in ACTH dynamics to model the circadian rhythm of the HPA axis was included. The external circadian input is modeled by introducing a trigonometric function with a 24h period and is multiplied by the parameter h in (7). This external periodic function can be written as

Various parameters of the model can be found in the literature: The elimination rates of hormones can be estimated from the half-life of each protein for humans. The half-life value for TNF-α is 18.2min [32], for ACTH is 
                           19.9

                        , for IL-6 is 35.5min [46], and for cortisol is

                           P
                         can also be obtained from the literature which is estimated at a value of 3hr−1 
                        [9]. Having the half-life values, one can estimate the elimination rates e

The parameter h represents the positive stimulation of CRH on ACTH secretion and it is assumed that it is equal to the mean plasma CRH level. In [1]. the mean plasma CRH level for normal humans is stated to be 
                           7.66

                           ml
                        . Considering the clinical data for human subjects in different studies, it is estimated that there is a delay between 30 and 60min for ACTH and cortisol ultradian peaks [1,13]. As a result of the Hill functions introducing implicit delay in this model, the parameters τ
                        1 and τ
                        2 are not the only factors that produce delay in the model, and one should also consider this implicit delays. Therefore, these parameters should be chosen in a way that the final delay between ACTH and cortisol be kept between 30 and 60min. For an initial guess,

Parameters m
                        1 and m
                        2 are the number of cortisol and ACTH molecules that bind to their respective free receptors. It is physiologically unrealistic for these parameters to be larger than eight [29]. So, for a first guess, let 
                           m
                           =

Parameters c and a are the concentrations of cortisol and ACTH at which the binding rate is at half-maximum. It is assumed that the values of these parameters are equal to the mean values of their respective hormones [42]. For healthy individuals, the mean value of free cortisol is estimated to be

                        4 and x
                        6 should be chosen in a way that satisfy the condition (11).

For estimating the remaining parameters, an algorithm called real-coded estimation of distribution algorithm (RCEDA) was applied [33]. it is a specific case of a class of algorithms which are called estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) [26]. They are stochastic optimization methods where optimal solutions for each generation are obtained by building and sampling probabilistic models of the selected promising individuals in the current population.

The main advantage of EDAs is that they take into account the correlation between parameters, and one can utilize the obtained distribution of the solutions to produce more accurate parameter values. One important advantage of the EDA algorithms over genetic algorithms is that they have much less parameters to be tuned. Also, for this specific problem, we were able to achieve better fit for the model compared to genetic algorithm and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method employed for uncertainty analysis.

In RCEDA, it is assumed that the parameters are continuous and normally distributed. At each iteration, the mean and the covariance matrix of the most promising individuals are calculated, and by using Cholesky decomposition, the new offspring are generated. The algorithm is as follows

Plasma levels of cortisol, ACTH, TNF-α, and IL-6 were measured for each subject. In the model proposed here, data collected for ten subjects from LPS injection were employed in parameter estimation. The extracted data are expressed as means ± SD in Table B1 in Appendix B.

The algorithm ran for 200 generations, with population size = 50 and selecting 25 best individuals for calculating the means and covariance matrix.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The parameters of the model were estimated using the method described in Section 2.3 and the simulation of the associated system was compared to the curves of experimental data for each variable. This enabled determination whether or not the model can represent the dynamics of inflammatory cytokines and the HPA axis, and to capture the general structure of TNF-α, IL–6, ACTH, and cortisol production.

Estimated values of the parameters are provided in Table 1
                     . A number of them were obtained from the literature as described in Section 2.3. The remaining parameters were calculated by the mean of the resulting population in Algorithm 1.

Shown in Fig. 3
                      is the resulting curves of ACTH and cortisol generated by the model for placebo injection across 48h. The simulated model exhibits ultradian as well as circadian patterns. For the chosen set of parameters, a delay of 30min between ACTH and cortisol secretion is produced.

In the experiments involving placebo injection, the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines were almost equal to zero and the changes in TNF-α and IL-6 levels were negligible [8]; however, the plasma level of cortisol was seen to have both ultradian and the circadian rhythms. A comparison between experimental data for one human subject extracted from [1,6] and simulated curves of ACTH and cortisol is presented in Fig. 4
                     (a). Power spectrum for clinical and simulated curves are also presented in 4(b). As the ultradian rhythms can vary from one person to another, the model only captures the qualitative features of the data (ultradian and circadian rhythms). The extracted data used in this comparison are presented in Table B2 in Appendix B.

The resulting curves of TNF-α, IL-6, ACTH, and cortisol in the model simulation of immune-HPA interactions when endotoxin challenge is introduced is shown in Figure 5.

An injection of endotoxin initiated the inflammation cascade by activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-α was the first cytokine that peaked 60min after LPS (endotoxin) administration and activated the production of IL-6 which increased and peaked 50min later and was also sustained longer. The production of inflammatory cytokines stimulated the HPA axis which, as a result, increased ACTH and, later, cortisol production. This is shown in Fig. 5
                     . As also depicted in Fig. 5, the simulated model is in agreement with the experimental data collected for TNF-α, IL-6, ACTH, and cortisol [8] and qualitatively captures the structure of immune and HPA responses to endotoxin challenge.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

In the work presented here, a five-dimensional delay differential equation model for the interaction between the immune system and the nervous system through inflammatory cytokines and the HPA axis was developed. The model has 32 parameters which were estimated by finding the required parameter values from the literature for oscillatory behavior and necessary conditions for healthy inflammatory response and by using an EDA algorithm called RCEDA for minimizing the least square error between simulated values and experimental data. It was shown that the model mimics the qualitative structure of inflammatory cytokines and the HPA axis response to toxic challenge. A simple delayed model of the HPA axis in (1) and (2) was also introduced which captures the ultradian rhythms of cortisol and ACTH concentrations both in normal and infectious conditions.

This model can have a potential role in studying the processes involved in autoimmune diseases. Although autoimmune diseases are complex diseases with unknown etiology, there are increasing evidences for the role of bacteria or viruses infections in initiating these diseases [30]. The presented model is a useful tool in facilitating the process of quantifying the required cortisol level for inflammation suppression for different levels of LPS stimulation at different times of day. Also, the model can help in studying the effects of stress on the immune system. Under normal conditions, the activation of the HPA axis modulates the immune system activity. However, when acute stress becomes chronic, that may lead to a weak immune response. By combining this model with existing models of the immune system, the effects of stress on different aspects of the immune system can be predicted. In general, the agreement of the simulated model with the literature physiological observations suggest that the model is capable to become a useful tool in quantitative analysis of the interaction between the HPA axis and inflammatory cytokines in different physiological and pathological situations and generating ideas to design refined laboratory experiments or to evaluate the timing and dosage of drugs.

By employing this model, one can investigate the effects of changes in the concentrations and the rates of production and elimination of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol on the transition from acute to prolonged inflammation in the body and therefore generate ideas for designing new clinical trials [43]. This model is important in enabling further understanding of immune/nervous system interactions and is a useful addition in enabling a potential reduction in animal experimentation.

There are some important assumptions underlying the model which should be considered when the model is used in a certain experiment. The key assumption is that for simplicity, from all cytokines involved in the inflammation process, the dynamics of TNF-α and IL-6 have been selected as representatives. The overall effects of other cytokines and hormones can be incorporated through associated parameters of TNF-α and IL-6.

In order to have a healthy response, a stability condition was obtained in Section 2.3. Here, the simulation of the model when the stability condition of the inflammation model is not satisfied is examined. Using the estimated parameters in Table 1, the steady state of the model is

                        6) which divides the parameter space into two healthy and persistent inflammation states is also presented in Fig. 6(a).

In this inflammatory state, even though the pathogen is eliminated, the inflammatory response persists. This state is called non-infectious inflammation which can arise from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis where uncontrolled inflammation come about from infection [20]. The stability condition in (11) shows the essential role of the HPA axis and cortisol in the regulation of acute inflammatory response.

The parameter estimation process employed in Section 2.3 can provide the best optimal parameters set that fit the clinical data perfectly. However, as all measurements have errors and the collected data may have noise, it is important to incorporate the stochastic nature of events and parameters into the model and quantify the effect of the measurements error on parameter uncertainty. To that end, Bayesian inference can be employed by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The MCMC algorithm approximates the posterior distribution of the parameter probability for the given clinical data by drawing samples from the parameter sets. The algorithm constructs a Markov chain that has the posterior distribution as its unique limiting distribution.

In this work, Metropolis algorithm with parallel tempering as described in [12] to quantify uncertainty in the model was employed. The posterior probability for the given clinical data (D) can be obtained from Bayes׳s rule

The variance of the proposal density was tuned to an acceptance probability of 0.2–0.3 for the Markov chain. In order to avoid trapping in a local minimum, the Parallel Tempering method was applied. The Metropolis algorithm was executed in 5 chains with a different tempering parameter, β, chosen to be 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2. The algorithm was executed for

During the execution of the MCMC algorithm, the generated parameter sets for which the local stability condition in (11) is not satisfied were rejected. This reduced the chance of producing unhealthy responses in the model. Also, in order to minimize the effects of initial samples of the chain, the first half of the generated samples was dropped and the analysis was based on the second half of the chain.


                        Table 2
                         lists the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval of the marginal densities of the estimated parameters.

The correlation between the estimated parameters was also calculated from the second half of the generated samples. As shown in the correlation matrix (Fig. 7
                        ), there is a strong correlation between d
                        2 and x
                        6. This can be mainly originated from the extra rejection procedure in the MCMC algorithm which was included to drop the parameter sets for which the stability condition in (11) is not satisfied.

In order to analyze the robustness of the HPA oscillation to perturbations of the model parameters, a series of experiments were performed. In each experiment, one of the parameters h, c, α, a, m

                         were changed until the oscillations of ACTH or cortisol levels disappeared or deviated from their physiological range. Using these experiments, the tolerance ranges of each parameter were estimated. The resulting ranges are given in Table 3
                        .

The most sensitive parameters are τ
                        1 and τ
                        2. In order to observe oscillating behavior, the sum of the two time delays should be at least 17min. For longer time delays, the model produces lower frequency of ultradian pulses. The characteristic function of (1) and (2) which can be used for finding the conditions for the oscillating solution, can be written as

                     As the number of ACTH molecules is much larger than the free receptors, one can assume the relevance of the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis. Accordingly, the occupancy of receptors is very fast, and they work at maximum capacity. Therefore, it is near equilibrium, and it can be assumed that
