                  We model developable surfaces by wrapping a planar figure around cones and cylinders. Complicated developables can be constructed by successive mappings using cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes. We also propose an intuitive control mechanism, which allows a user to select an arbitrary point on the planar figure and move it to a new position. Numerical techniques are then used to find a cone or cylinder that produces the required mapping. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A developable surface is a special type of ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature which can be flattened on to a plane without distortion  [1,2]. Examples include simple surfaces such as cones and cylinders, as well as tangent or rectifying developables derived from spatial curves. Due to their isometric property, developable surfaces have been widely used in applications such as architecture, garment design, sheet metal and origami  [3–5].

Typical approaches include the representation of developable as ruled Bézier or B-spline surfaces with non-linear developability constraints  [6–9]. A dual-space approach is mathematically elegant, but it requires significant geometric expertise for an intuitive shape control  [2,6]. Many practical methods have been proposed for constructing developable surfaces from other representations, including point clouds  [10,11], boundary curves  [12,13] and polygonal meshes  [4,5,14,15].

Recently, a lot of research  [16–19] has been done on the modeling of paper-like surfaces and simulating their deformations. Kergosien et al.  [16] simulated the bending and creasing of paper-like sheets under external and internal forces. Hong et al.  [17] presented a method for simulating page turning for use in 3D electronic books (e-books). They use a cone of variable angle to simulate the bending of paper while maintaining its developability. However, their method only allows restricted deformations, and does not provide an interactive control mechanism. Bo and Wang  [18] modeled paper bending as a rectifying developable defined by one of its geodesics. More recently, Solomon et al.  [19] proposed a versatile method for constructing developable surfaces with folds, bends and curved folds from a planar fold configuration. For smoothly bent region, they subdivide the rulings and relax them by minimizing mean curvature bending energy.

In this paper, we also deal with the problem of paper bending, but take a different approach. We extend the technique of Hong et al.  [17] to a general modeling tool for constructing developable surfaces. We place cones and cylinders on a planar figure with an arbitrary boundary shape, and wrap them in the planar figure to generate a developable surface. Complicated surfaces can easily be obtained by introducing a succession of cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes. We also propose an intuitive control technique, in which a user selects an arbitrary point 
                        
                           p
                        
                      on the planar figure and moves it to a new position 
                        
                           q
                        
                     . Finding a cone or cylinder which maps 
                        
                           p
                        
                      to 
                        
                           q
                        
                      allows the subsequent development to appear as a direct manipulation. Selection of the cone or cylinder is formulated as a problem of root finding or optimization of non-linear functions, with only a few control parameters, which can be efficiently solved by a standard numerical technique.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 
                        
                           •
                           A simple and effective technique for modeling the bending of a sheet of paper using cones and cylinders.

A methodology for the successive application of cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes to produce complicated developable surfaces from an arbitrary planar figure.

Interactive control of bending by finding a cone or cylinder which corresponds to a specified displacement by the user.

Cones and cylinders are well-known developable surfaces. By using them as primitives for modeling paper bending, we can guarantee that the deformed paper is a developable surface.

                     Generation of ruling lines: In general, developable surfaces can be represented efficiently by ruling line segments which are straight. Since the paper deformed by cones and cylinders is developable, we compute the ruling line segments and use them to construct a tessellation consisting of strips. On the bending region, ruling lines are obtained by finding the intersections of lines passing through the origin with the paper boundary (see Fig. 4(a)), and the end-points of the resulting line segments are mapped on to a cone or cylinder as appropriate. To preserve the sharp corner of bending region, we force some ruling lines to pass through corner-points (see blue one in Fig. 4(a)). Regions where the paper remains flat are modeled by their transformed corner-points (shown in red in Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) shows how a bent piece of paper is modeled by ruling line segments and transformed planar regions. Fig. 4(c) shows the result of mapping a tiled texture on to a model of bent paper and we see that no distortion is apparent.

Our technique provides a compact representation as well as computational efficiency, because only a few intersection points are involved in transformation and tessellation, and the number of ruling line segments can interactively be controlled by the user at runtime. It would be quite inefficient if tessellation preceded transformation, as shown in Fig. 4(d).

                      shows how complicated deformations of paper can be modeled by successive mappings using several different cones and cylinders. Note that the planar parts are shown in dark gray and two deformed regions share the same tangent plane to achieve

                      continuity. Our technique can easily be applied to paper bending with non-convex curved boundary by subdividing it into a set of convex parts (see Fig. 11(a) and (b)).

Our technique provides various ways of controlling the model of paper bending. We can place a cone or a cylinder on to the paper to be deformed in any position and orientation, and choose the aperture of a cone or the radius of a cylinder. However, it is not particularly intuitive to adjust these parameters. In this section we propose a direct manipulation technique in which a user selects an arbitrary point

                     Fig. 6(a)–(c) show models of three bent sheets of paper generated by our technique, together with the cones determined by minimizing the objective function in Eq. (2). Our technique shows the similar results to real bent paper depending on the user’s displacements, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Moreover, the stiffness

                     Direct manipulation using a cylinder: Direct manipulation using a cylinder can be achieved by large stiffness (see Fig. 6(c)). However, we present a more efficient approach to this problem. Again we construct a coordinate system

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We implemented our technique in C++ on an Intel Core2 Duo 2.80 GHz CPU with a 4 GB main memory and an NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT video card. Our technique shows a real-time performance for modeling paper bending and its direct manipulation. Fig. 10(b) shows a pinwheel model which is generated by direct manipulation using cylinders (see the accompanying video, Appendix A). We subdivided a square sheet of paper into four triangles, as shown in Fig. 10(a) and selected a point near the corner of a triangle. By moving this point to the center of the paper, and repeating this process for each triangle, we created the pinwheel model shown in Fig. 10(b).


                     Fig. 10(c) shows some plane shapes which we made into the ornament model shown in Fig. 10(d). There are three nested squares of different colors; the red and green squares are hollow. We placed three cylinders with different radii on squares, two on the front and the other on the back. Then we wrapped the squares around the cylinders to produce an over-work ornament.

It is also possible to start with a planar figure with a non-convex curved boundary, as shown in Fig. 11(a). This is subdivided into a set of convex parts, some with curved boundaries, and each part is deformed separately using cones or cylinders while remaining smoothly joined to the other parts. Fig. 11(b) shows how the four deformed parts of this construction meet the planar part with

Direct manipulation can be used to simulate page turning. Fig. 9
                     
                     
                      shows a sequence of models of a turning page generated by our technique. A user selects an arbitrary point on the paper and moves it to a new position. Our system then finds a cone or cylinder which satisfies the required displacement and produces the appearance of naturally bent paper.

Although direct manipulation involves iterative root finding and function minimization, the procedures show a real-time performance due to the small number of control parameters: one for a cylinder and two for a cone.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have proposed simple mappings from a plane to a cone or a cylinder as an effective technique for producing surfaces which are guaranteed to be developable. Successive mappings using different cones and cylinders can produce complicated developable surface which represents bent paper realistically.

We have also introduced an intuitive real-time control mechanism, in which the user manipulates an arbitrary point and a cone or cylinder is found to match the specified displacement. This mechanism is formulated as root finding or minimization of non-linear functions derived from geometric constraints, and solved by numerical methods. We have presented a number of developable surfaces which demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.

In the current framework, we can only handle developables consisting of conical, cylindrical, and planar strips. In future work, we plan to extend our framework to include more flexible developables and also provide inverse mappings of a cone and a cylinder for unfolding existing bent paper.
