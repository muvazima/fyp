                  Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is one of the most popular reliability analysis tools for identifying, assessing and eliminating potential failure modes in a wide range of industries. In general, failure modes in FMEA are evaluated and ranked through the risk priority number (RPN), which is obtained by the multiplication of crisp values of the risk factors, such as the occurrence (O), severity (S), and detection (D) of each failure mode. However, the conventional RPN method has been considerably criticized for various reasons. To deal with the uncertainty and vagueness from humansâ€™ subjective perception and experience in risk evaluation process, this paper presents a novel approach for FMEA based on combination weighting and fuzzy VIKOR method. Integration of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy method is applied for risk factor weighting in this proposed approach. The risk priorities of the identified failure modes are obtained through next steps based on fuzzy VIKOR method. To demonstrate its potential applications, the new fuzzy FMEA is used for analyzing the risk of general anesthesia process. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to verify the robustness of the risk ranking and a comparison analysis is conducted to show the advantages of the proposed FMEA approach.
