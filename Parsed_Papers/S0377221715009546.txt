                  This paper develops a stochastic modeling framework to determine the location and capacities of distribution centers for emergency stockpiles to improve preparedness in the event of a disaster for which there is little to no forewarning. The proposed framework is applicable to emergency planning that must incorporate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the timing and severity of a potential event, as well as the resulting impact, while taking into consideration both disaster and region specific characteristics. To demonstrate the modeling approach, we apply it to a region prone to earthquakes. The model incorporates various uncertainties such as facility damage and casualty losses, based upon their severity and remaining survivability time, as a function of the magnitude of the earthquake. Given the computational complexity of the problem of interest, we develop an evolutionary optimization heuristic aided by an innovative mixed integer programming model that generates time efficient high quality solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic via a case study featuring the HAZUS-MH software from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Finally, given the uncertainty associated with the magnitude of the earthquake, we use a decision analysis approach to develop robust solutions while taking into account the geological characteristics of the region.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Natural disasters have the potential to result in significant economic and societal losses. For instance, in 2012, natural disasters affected more than 100 million people, causing more than 900 deaths in 115 countries (CRED, 2013). The economic damages alone were estimated to be 113billion dollars. To complicate matters, these disasters often disrupt normal supply chains, making it challenging for treatment centers, such as hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities, to obtain essential equipment, pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies. The resulting inability to provide the necessary care to those incapacitated as a result of the disaster could lead to long term health impacts and increased fatality rates. Therefore, the development of disaster preparedness and response plans that consider the public health consequences while incorporating the unique characteristics of a particular disaster within a robust decision making framework is of profound significance. One of the steps taken by the Federal government in this regard was the formation of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) (CDPH, 2013; NACCHO, 2013). As described by the CDC, the “SNS has large quantities of medicine and medical supplies to protect the American public if there is a public health emergency (terrorist attack, flu outbreak, earthquake) severe enough to cause local supplies to run out”. Specifically, once federal and state authorities come to a consensus that these supplies are needed, an immediate request is made to ensure they are deployed in a timely manner.

While the current SNS configuration can significantly improve response efforts via prepositioning of supplies for disasters such as hurricanes for which there is forewarning, such a privilege does not exist for unanticipated disasters. Hence the delivery of supplies under the current framework may turn out to be too little too late for these types of events. This issue can in part be attributed to the gaps that exist within the current research in developing strategic plans based upon a risk assessment for a given region. For example, existing models pertaining to the planning of the locations and capacities of emergency supplies in the event of an earthquake, which we devote specific attention to, do not account for the uncertainty due to topographic and geological characteristics of the region, uncertainty related to facility damage, nor the number, severity and medical condition of the resulting casualties. Other factors that could impact the location-allocation decisions include budgetary constraints, uncertainty in transport times, as well as facility costs as a function of capacity and building structure. Such investigations in the extant literature have been notably lacking. These questions form the motivation for this research endeavor.

To address this gap in the literature, we first propose a generic framework applicable to planning in the event of an unexpected disaster, particularly when the primary goal is to establish stockpiles of necessary medical supplies to minimize fatalities. We then demonstrate the proposed approach, developing a stochastic optimization model to determine the location and capacities of regional distribution centers (DC) for improved preparedness in the event of an earthquake. Our models incorporate facility and casualty losses as a function of the earthquake magnitude and its interaction with factors such as the population at demand nodes, building code (i.e. resistance to damage), transport time to a demand center, etc. We model the casualty numbers at the demand nodes as well as their mix in terms of severity and associated survivability time following Paul and Hariharan (2012). In addition, to address the issue of computational complexity associated with problems of realistic size, we develop a heuristic solution that builds on the principles of the Evolutionary Optimization (EV) algorithm. This is further aided by an innovative mixed integer programming (MIP) model that provides a high quality initial solution to the EV. Finally, we use a decision analysis model to generate solutions that are robust to the specific characteristics of the region. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our modeling approach via a case study featuring the Northridge region in California.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a review of the current literature. Section 3 presents a description of our generic framework, followed by a statement of the problem of interest as well as the model notations and the mathematical formulation. In Section 4 we develop the evolutionary optimization based heuristic, including an innovative MIP model that generates a high quality starting solution for the heuristic when solving large-scale problems. Section 5 demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristic in generating high quality time efficient solutions via a case study, in addition to discussing various key data considerations and the methodologies employed to derive them. We then employ decision analysis models to develop a solution that is robust to earthquake magnitude, taking into account the geological characteristics of the region. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and provides directions for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Determining the location and capacities of DCs for the prepositioning of supplies to support treatment centers in the delivery of care to those affected by a disaster is a multifaceted problem. This has resulted in a large body of literature that evaluates the various aspects and factors that impact the location-allocation problem. Within this review of the extant literature, we primarily focus on facility location, with a special emphasis on the prepositioning of supplies for humanitarian relief and decision making under uncertainty. Those interested in a broad overview of the recent advances in disaster operations management should refer to the article by Galindo and Batta (2013a). A summary of earlier work may also be found in Akkihal (2006). Altay and Green (2006) develop a mixed integer programming model for determination of the optimal locations of facilities to be used to preposition inventory for improved relief efforts. Jia, Ordonez, and Dessouky (2007) develop models to determine the optimal positioning of emergency medical service (EMS) facilities during large scale emergencies such as bioterrorist attacks. Balcik and Beamon (2008) find optimal locations and capacities of warehouses designed to store prepositioned relief supplies. An underlying assumption in their analysis is that demand for relief supplies can be met by the suppliers. Huang, Kim, and Menezes (2010) consider disruptions and access issues related to service facilities within a given demand center when determining the optimal facility locations in their study featuring large scale emergencies. Duran, Guitierrez, and Keskinocak (2011) develop an MIP model to determine the number and location of prepositioned warehouses that would enable a humanitarian organization (CARE International) to deliver necessary relief supplies in an optimal and timely manner to those impacted by a disaster. In contrast to the prior work by Balcik and Beamon (2008), they allow for multiple events to occur within a replenishment period, as well as for the probability of demand to depend on both local conditions and the type of natural disaster.

Determining the strategic location and capacities of DCs for the prepositioning of supplies within a region prone to a natural disaster is well suited to decision making under uncertainty. Lee et al. (2006) develop robust decision support tools for planning emergency dispensing clinics in their study featuring biological threats such as Anthrax and Smallpox. Determination of the required staffing levels to dispense the necessary supplies while considering the disaster uncertainty forms the primary focus of their models. Lodree and Taskin (2011) use a stochastic inventory control modeling approach to determine the locations and capacities of emergency shelters. The final location-allocation decision is based on the tradeoff between logistical cost efficiency and forecast accuracy. Li, Jin, and Zhang (2011) develop a two-stage stochastic programming model to handle both the evacuee flows and the distribution of resources that are required to support shelter operations. Specifically, the first stage determines the locations, capacities, and held resources for the new permanent shelters, while the second stage allocates evacuees as well as transports resources to individual shelters. Rawls and Turnquist (2010) develop models that determine the supply locations from a set of potential sites. Based upon a probabilistic scenario approach, they then develop a distribution plan that considers the possible loss of prepositioned supplies. In an extension of this work, Noyan (2012) introduces risk aversion measures in addition to the expectation criterion employed by Rawls and Turnquist (2010). In a follow-up to their previous study, Rawls and Turnquist (2012) develop a dynamic allocation model for prepositioning supplies at storage locations for meeting demands resulting from a disaster. Additionally, their models develop a distribution plan based upon a probabilistic scenario-based approach, wherein the loss of prepositioned supplies is considered as a possibility. In the context of a bio-terror attack, Murali, Ordonez, and Dessouky (2012) determine dispensing locations via a special case of a maximal covering location problem. Demand uncertainty is incorporated via chance constraints, with a loss function to address distance dependent demand.

In Salmeron and Apte (2010), the authors present a scenario analysis involving a two-stage stochastic optimization approach for the location, allocation and distribution decisions for the prepositioning of supplies. The first stage deals with establishing facilities with the goal of minimizing casualties. In the second stage, the model focuses on determination of both the distribution of supplies as well as the associated casualties, including possible evacuation, with the goal of minimizing the number of casualties that go without service. Paul and Hariharan (2012) develop models that incorporate both scenario planning and robust optimization for stockpile location and capacity allocation for regions prone to earthquake and hurricane disasters. In Davis, Samanlioglu, Qu, and Root (2013), the authors propose a stochastic programming model for the location and allocation of supplies for disaster relief involving a pending disaster. The model incorporates up to date forecasts as well as post event distribution.


                     Galindo and Batta (2013b) develop a model for prepositioning of supplies in preparation for hurricane disasters that have some forewarning, and allow for the possible damage or destruction of prepositioned supplies. The stochasticity of demand is taken into account through the use of amplifying factors. Kelle, Schneider, and Yi (2014) extend this by integrating the evacuation and sheltering phase into the supply problem. Their work builds on contributions by Li et al. (2011), by extending the expected value criterion to regret consideration, and the supply chain to a hierarchical network of suppliers. In an extension of their prior work focusing on prepositioning of hurricane supplies, Galindo and Batta (2015), utilizing decision theory and stochastic programming, develop a forecast-driven dynamic model to prepare for an upcoming hurricane. Specifically, they use forecast advisories to update the quantity and location of units to be prepositioned, including repositioning of previously prepositioned units. The model also determines the best time for initiating the prepositioning activities.

While the above models, in particular those pertaining to the prepositioning of supplies, are designed to improve planning in the event of a disaster, they are primarily applicable to events with forewarning or involving short term uncertainty. Though this may be reasonable for disasters such as hurricanes, it would not apply for unexpected disasters such as earthquakes, wherein there exists significant long term uncertainty, particularly regarding the severity and resulting impact of a disaster. The other major limitation of these models is that long-term uncertainty is strictly captured via scenario analysis, while our models explicitly incorporate the uncertainty with regard to the demand, supply locations, transportation network, etc. Specifically, we incorporate facility and casualty losses as a function of the earthquake magnitude while considering critical factors such as the population at demand nodes, building code (i.e. resistance to damage), transport time to a demand center, etc. We model not only the casualty numbers at the demand nodes but also the mix in terms of their severity and associated survivability time following Paul and Hariharan (2012). A major strength of our paper is the extensive discussion on how data can be appropriately derived for input into the model, and its application via a case study. To address the issue of computational complexity associated with problems of realistic size, we develop a heuristic solution that builds on the principles of the Evolutionary Optimization (EV) algorithm. This is further aided by an innovative MIP model that provides a high quality initial solution to the EV.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

When developing strategies aimed at minimizing fatalities in a region prone to disasters, decision makers are faced with several challenges. For instance, they are required to assess the risk of an event occurring along with the potential impacts, and use that to project specific supply and equipment needs across the affected region to mitigate the number of fatalities. Thus, planning of strategic stockpiles in the event of an unexpected disaster must consider multiple sources of uncertainty within any decision analysis framework. These can be related to the type of disaster, each of which may carry vastly different risks, as well as those related to specific regional characteristics. For example planners need to consider a host of relevant characteristics such as the size and density of the population as well as local geography and geological factors to accurately estimate the impacts in a given region and the resultant number, type and distribution of casualties. Further, as the disaster may impact the DCs as well, any planning must consider the uncertainty of facility damage to potential sites. Determination of these probabilities provides a basis for the evaluation of planning scenarios, such as an assessment of potential sites as well as their associated capacities and supply levels. Finally, while considering various constraints such as budget limitations, etc., decision makers can develop an optimal location-allocation plan for the region that minimizes all associated costs, including societal and fatality related costs. Fig. 1
                      presents an outline of the planning process for a given region. To demonstrate this approach, we apply it to an earthquake disaster and develop specific models for the same.

Prior to presenting our mathematical model and related notations, we first describe the problem of interest. Consider an earthquake prone region. For the decision-maker, neither the timing nor the magnitude of a potential earthquake is known. However, prudent planning, such as establishing permanent DCs while taking into account disaster characteristics and other relevant factors, can minimize the number of fatalities in the event a disaster were to occur. The goal of the models that follow is to determine the number, location and capacity of DCs to minimize total costs, which include the societal costs of the setup (construction) and initial supplies (as a function of severity), as well as the external costs associated with potential fatalities, while taking into account budgetary constraints.

For the study, a fatality is deemed to result from a shortage of required supplies at a demand node to treat arriving casualties of a particular severity type within their respective survivability time, either as a result of the transit time from supply nodes to the treatment center or resulting from a lack of capacity. FEMA classifies causalities into four severity levels (FEMA, 2007) based upon the time within which they need to be provided care. Level 1 is the least severe whereas level 4 is the fatal case and represents immediate death. Using the FEMA classifications, an individual classified as a severity 1 casualty can be prevented from becoming a fatality if they receive care within a period of 390 minutes of the initial trauma. Similarly, severity 2 requires treatment within 270 minutes and severity 3 casualties, being the most severe cases, need care within a period of 80 minutes (Paul et al., 2006 ; Paul & Hariharan, 2012). Following FEMA, the survivability time is defined as the time period for each casualty, based upon their severity level, within which he/she needs to receive treatment to prevent becoming a fatality. For our purposes, the remaining survivability time is then taken as a function of the severity level as well as the pre-treatment transport time of the casualty to a demand node. In the model, both remaining survivability time and supply transport time are considered to be random variables.

The distribution and number of casualties of each severity level is a function of the earthquake magnitude as well as the population and geological characteristics of the region. An important factor in determining the capacity of a DC is the differing supplies required to treat arriving casualties. We use the HAZUS-MH software developed by FEMA to simulate different disaster scenarios and determine the relevant parametric values such as the number of casualties and their severity. Another factor to be considered in determining initial capacities is the potential damage to the DCs resulting from the earthquake, which in turn affects the available supply levels. Therefore, our DC location-allocation model also considers potential facility damage, which is generated by the HAZUS-MH earthquake scenario simulations. Specifically, the HAZUS-MH software estimates the mean facility damage at a given location while taking into consideration the construction characteristics, based upon the construction code of the specific DC. While DCs built to a higher code are prone to less damage given a specific magnitude of earthquake, they also result in higher initial construction costs, thus resulting in a trade-off between building costs and the potential loss of supplies required to treat the resultant casualties.

A final consideration is the time to deliver supplies from a DC to a demand node. The rationale for locating supply nodes away from a given demand node is two-fold. First is the ability to supply multiple demand nodes from a single location, thus reducing the total number of required DCs. An additional consideration is the potential damage to the supply capacity at a specific location. However, these must be balanced with supply transport times, which may become excessive, particularly as it relates to the most severe casualties. This is discussed in more detail below.

Prior to developing the stochastic optimization model, we present the following list of model notations in Table 1.
                        
                     

The objective of the model is to minimize total expected costs (facilities, supplies and fatalities) by determining the capacity and location of DCs. The loss function for this objective is given as:

The objective function (Eq. (1)) is comprised of three separate components. The first considers the associated fatality costs given the expected fatalities, the estimation of which is discussed in detail below, and the cost of a statistical life (V). For all calculations we use the value employed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Latourrette & Willis, 2007). The second and third components give the associated supply costs, based upon severity, and the costs of construction of a DC based upon size (capacity) and building code. Eqs. (2)–(4) present the model constraints. Eq. (2) ensures that the cost of setting up and stocking the DCs is within the available budget. Eq. (3) makes sure that capacity is allocated only to where a DC has been established, while also ensuring it does not exceed the capacity for the specific facility. Finally, Eq. (4) ensures that at most only one facility type (by size) is constructed at each location.

A primary challenge in the above optimization is computation of the expected fatalities of severity i at each demand node m, E[Fatalities]
                           im
                        , and the resulting fatality cost. There are two conditions under which a fatality can occur. One involves the fatalities that arise when the time to transport supplies from a DC at k to a demand node m, given by tkm
                        ( · ), exceeds the remaining survivability time of casualties of severity i, i.e. τim
                        ( · ). The second occurs when there are insufficient supplies, given they arrive within the remaining survivability time, to treat the resulting casualties. As these two events or conditions are independent, they can be treated separately. Proposition 1 below provides the derivation for E[Fatalities]
                           im
                        , in which we first consider the fatalities associated with available supplies, and then extend it to include fatalities related to P(tkm
                        ( · ) > τim
                        ( · )).

To facilitate the derivation we made the following assumptions regarding the key distributions Fim
                        ( · ) and Gkz
                        ( · ). From HAZUS-MH, we first obtained the mean casualty and damage levels for each demand and supply node, denoted as μm
                         and μkz
                        , respectively. However, as only mean outputs are generated by the HAZUS software, it was necessary to make some assumptions regarding the distribution of these variables for input into the model. Given that the number of casualties are strongly correlated with building damage (Coburn, Spence, & Pomonis, 1992), an initial assumption was made that both variables would be modeled using the same probability distribution. Specifically it was assumed that both variables were from an exponential distribution, which minimizes the number of assumptions required while meeting other primary criteria. First, as the mean and variances are the same, we were not required to make additional assumptions regarding the values of additional parameters for the casualty and damage distributions. In addition, as we expect that the variance associated with the resulting damages and casualties will be positively correlated with their means, this provides a further complication for typical two parameter distributions, which would require additionally scaling the variance as the means increased. Finally, as it is anticipated that extreme values (those well above the mean) would have a lower probability of occurring, a right-skewed distribution such as the exponential distribution would appear to be appropriate.

Given n initial exponential distributions, let a subset r, where 1 ≤ r < n, contain dissimilar means. Without loss of generality, we can order the summation of probability distributions such that μi

f(z′) is as given in (10) with z replaced with z′. To implement the solution of the expected fatalities, we approximated the above by adjusting distributions with identical shape parameters by a small constant or delta (δ), with 
                           
                              δ

                        . The advantage of this approach is it allows for a consistent pdf via the repeated convolution of exponential distributions, specifically that given by (8). Substituting f(z′) from (8) into (11) and performing the required integration results in:

Thus having characterized the resulting expected delay and supply related fatalities, we can calculate the total cost function to be minimized based upon the location/allocation decisions.

Given that determination of the location and capacities of DCs for an earthquake prone region for any realistically sized problem could involve tens or even hundreds of demand and supply nodes, a global search optimization is not a feasible solution approach for the stochastic model developed in Section 3. This thus provides the motivation for the heuristic solution methodology depicted in Fig. 2
                     . The approach consists of an Evolutionary Algorithm, in which the initial inputs are determined via a two-step pre-optimization consisting of a newsvendor approach followed by an innovative MIP optimization. We begin by discussing the EV in Section 4.1, followed by the pre-optimization steps in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.

Selection of an EV approach is motivated by evidence in the extant literature of its effectiveness when dealing with non-smooth stochastic optimization problems (Srinivas and Rangaiah, 2007; Wang et al., 2006). The problem of interest in this study is therefore an ideal candidate for this methodology. The core model used in our EV algorithm is captured in Eq. (1) and is repeated below.

The values of the loss function (L) form the criteria for improvement of the solution quality for the algorithm, with the parameter settings for our EV optimizations are given in Table 2.
                        
                     

To enhance the computational effectiveness of the EV for large-scale size problems, we included the following modification to the initialization step. Specifically, we obtain the initial population, consisting of points in the search space, via a two-step pre-optimization as presented in Fig. 2. The steps are given as follows and are discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.

                           
                              
                                 Step 1:
                              
                              Determine the optimal quantity (Q*
                                 ) needed by severity type for each demand node using a newsvendor approach to compute the optimal quantity to satisfy demand, assuming zero facility damage.

Using the optimal quantity Q*
                                  obtained in Step 1, we apply a deterministic variant (MIP) of the model (see Section 4.3) to get a high quality solution as the initial input to the EV.

The newsvendor approach we employ to compute the optimal quantity to satisfy demand, assuming zero facility damage is captured via the following proposition.

                        ) and setting it equal to zero. Since we can interchange the derivative and the expectation operators, it follows that

In this section we present the MIP model, a deterministic variant of the model developed in Section 3, that we used to generate the initial solution for input into the EV. We first present the notations in Table 3.
                        
                     

The first step, prior to running the optimization is to determine the demand clusters, in which the study region is divided into k-clusters by applying a k-means clustering algorithm (MacQueen, 1967). Given the possibility that an inappropriate value for the total number of clusters (k) could lead to incorrect clustering of data points, we also apply a silhouette index for the determination of the best value of k. Silhouette features a method of interpretation and validation of clusters generated using a clustering algorithm similar to k-means. This method provides a concise graphical representation of how well each data point lies within its cluster (Rousseeuw, 1987). After establishing the appropriate number and location of demand clusters for a region, we then develop the MIP to determine both the location and capacity for the DCs, with the objective of minimizing the total cost, including fatality costs as well as the setup of the DCs and supply costs.

                        Eqs. (25)–(36) capture the constraints of the MIP model. Eq. (25) ensures that the DCs have the required capacity to satisfy the demand at each demand node m. Eq. (26) defines the total capacity available to serve casualties of severity i. Eq. (27) defines capacity for each severity i, demand node m available at site k regardless of building code. Eq. (28) makes sure that the total amount spent as construction cost and supply cost is within the available budget. Eq. (29) represents total supply available at site k. Eq. (30) ensures that the total supplies at site k are less than or equal to the capacity available. Eq. (31) computes the total construction cost for site k (excluding supply cost) for a DC of level n (size) and building code z. 
                        Eq. (32) ensures that supplies are only allocated to a site k if a DC exists at that location. Eq. (33) ensures that only one DC is built at node k and it can only have one building code and size. Eq. (34) computes the remaining survivability time by deducting the transport time from demand node m to DC at site k. In order to capture the uncertainty due to supply transport time and its impact on survivability time and resulting fatalities, we use a supply transport time that is T = three standard deviations above the mean. Eq. (35) computes the total resulting uncertainty (standard deviation) associated with the transport time of casualties to demand node m and that associated with the transport time of required supplies from supply node k to demand node m. Given the assumption that both transport times follow a normal distribution following the extant literature (Paul et al., 2006; Paul & Hariharan, 2012), the difference of these two random variables is also normally distributed, with the standard deviation as given in Eq. (35).

A key challenge, in addition to the computational complexity that we addressed in prior sections, is in obtaining the data to estimate the required parameters for our models. This step is critical as these parametric values have a significant impact on the validity of the optimal solution and therefore the proposed location-allocation decisions. We therefore expended considerable effort in reviewing the literature and online databases to derive these parameters. The discussion that follows is motivated by the same.

The first task was to get reliable casualty and facility damage data when a region is subject to an earthquake. For our case study, we selected the Northridge region in Los Angeles, California, which is located in a high risk area and has seen multiple earthquakes in its recent history. The epicenter was set at latitude 34.41000 and longitude 118.40002, corresponding to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As discussed earlier, we used the HAZUS-MH software (2008) to generate aggregate casualty and facility damage distributions. Due to the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of any potential earthquake in the region, we simulated multiple earthquake scenarios, with magnitudes ranging from 5 to 8.5 in increments of 0.5, which capture earthquakes ranging in magnitude from minor to major. We then applied the clustering methodology described in Section 4.3, which resulted in a total of 34 demand clusters for our region of study. For each scenario, we then determined the mean number of casualties by severity at each demand cluster, as well as the mean damage to the DCs constructed at both medium and high construction codes.

We initially considered 100 potential DC sites, based upon the location of fault lines, access to highways, geological and topological characteristics, proximity to hospitals and finally with the objective of distributing them throughout the region. As close proximity to the earthquake epicenter and resulting causalities may yield benefits from a survivability perspective when compared to more distant locations, we gave priority to these facilities when selecting potential sites. However, the possibility of significant damage is higher at these sites, thus potentially rendering them unusable. As these potential sites could be problematic, especially for high severity casualties given their remaining survivability time, we considered a reserve site within our solution set that can be reached within the survivability time limits for all casualties, but involves a premium cost for the related supplies. We feel this is a reasonable accommodation within the model given that if a casualty is air lifted for necessary care, then there is a premium cost for the same when compared to a scenario wherein a casualty transports themselves or is brought to a hospital using ground transportation.

In order to calculate the expected fatalities and the resultant total societal costs, in addition to determining the resulting casualty and facility losses, it was necessary to collect additional data to run the model, primarily related to the cost of the DCs as well as the related supply costs, along with both supply and casualty transport time distributions.

For the capacities of the DCs, we selected three sizes: small (3000 square feet), medium (6000 square feet) and large (12,000 square feet), with the large size based upon the approximate FEMA requirement of a 12,000 square feet facility to accommodate a 12-hour push package. The small and medium facilities were then scaled down at 50 percent intervals. The resultant capacity for each type was then estimated based upon a 12-hour push package being capable of treating 300,000 people, or a treatment capacity of 25 casualties per square feet. Thus our small, medium and large facilities were assigned capacities capable of treating 75,000, 150,000 and 300,000 casualties respectively.

To determine the construction costs for the DCs, we used RSMeansOnline, an online cost calculator (RSMeansOnline, 2013). The calculator allows the user to select not only the square footage of the planned facility, but also the proposed location, construction type and so on. The initial assumption was for a steel frame/concrete block construction (other building structures yielded similar cost estimates) for the three facility sizes listed above, with construction to occur in the Los Angeles county area. Also included was an approximate annual operating costs for the facilities of 60 dollars per square feet. To incorporate operating costs into the total cost estimate for each of the DCs, we selected a 30 year life expectancy with a 6 percent discount rate. The estimated total costs for the small, medium and large facilities were found to be 2,880,000, 5,800,000 and 11,700,000 dollars, respectively. Finally, a 20 percent premium to construct the identically sized facilities to higher earthquake resistant codes was assumed.

The costs of supplies, on a per unit basis for each severity level, were derived from data given in Hanfling (2006) on the required supplies and associated costs to treat moderate and high acuity casualties as well as basic supplies for treating low-severity casualties during a disaster. In the Hanfling paper, costs were determined for the treatment of 100 casualties in each category. These costs were then estimated on a per casualty basis, resulting in an approximate cost of 1500, 4000 and 9000 dollars for casualties of severities 1–3 respectively.

To establish the probability of the supply transport time exceeding the remaining survivability time for a casualty of a particular severity, i.e.
P(tkm
                           ( · ) > τim
                           ( · )), we needed to define the distributions for both variables. As previously discussed, FEMA classifies casualties and their associated survivability time as severity 1 (390 minutes), severity 2 (270 minutes) and severity 3 (80 minutes). Assuming casualty transport times are approximately normally distributed with an average of 30minutes and a variance of 10 minutes2 (Paul et al., 2006; Paul & Hariharan, 2012), this results in a remaining survivability distributions for severities 1–3 as ∼N(360,10), ∼N(240,10), and ∼N(50,10) respectively. For the supply transport times, the average time to transport supplies from node k to demand node m was determined using Google Maps®. Latitude and longitude coordinates for demand and supply nodes were input and the estimated travel time determined. All estimates were run mid-afternoon (between 2 and 3 p.m.) for consistency. We then applied the identical distribution characteristics for the casualty transport times, and assumed that all supply transport times were normally distributed with the same variance of 10 minutes2.

Prior to running the MIP, we screened the suitability of potential DC locations. The inclusion of this step was for both practical and rationale considerations. First, for large scale problems, the number of calculations involved in (5) rapidly becomes excessive from a computational perspective. In addition, supply nodes in which the probability of delay related deaths is high can be deemed as unacceptable as it results in excessive fatalities, particularly for severity 3 casualties who have the lowest remaining survivability time. Therefore, we restrict our subset of potential DC sites to those that, for a given severity at a specific demand node, the probability of delay related fatalities approach zero, i.e. Pikm
                         → 0. Based upon the transport and survivability distributions given in Section 5.1.2, and applying three standard deviations as the acceptable cut-off, or approximately 19 minutes for the difference in the distributions of tkm
                        ( · ) and τim
                        ( · ), resulted in a maximum travel times from any potential supply node to a given demand node of 346.5, 226.5 and 36.5 minutes for severities 1–3, respectively. In addition, for all problem scenarios, we assumed an unconstrained budget.

We first solved the problem by applying the MIP model discussed in Section 4, with these results presented in Table 4
                        . As can be noted from the table, the MIP generated a very high quality initial solution for the EV. Table 4 compares the expected fatalities for the region with no DCs to the optimal plan generated by the MIP. The results show a significant reduction in both fatalities as well as the overall costs, including the cost of fatalities within the optimization. Further, the MIP solution reduces the problem size from a potential supply node set of 100 facilities to a starting solution for the EV that consists of 8 nodes or less considering earthquakes of magnitude 8.5 or less. Overall these results provide a strong though indirect validation of the quality of solution generated by the MIP.

The output from the MIP model was then used as the initialization settings for the EV heuristic to determine the final location and capacity allocation for the DCs. These results are then compared to the results generated by the MIP. Fig. 3
                         compares the solution generated by the EV for the different earthquake magnitudes as the percentage improvement in total cost when compared to the MIP solution. The percentages were relatively small as the total costs, including fatality costs, are generally in the order of tens or hundreds of millions, and the total cost exponentially increases with earthquake magnitude.

To complete the Northridge case study, we applied a decision tree analysis to determine the final solutions based upon the probability of an earthquake of varying magnitude appropriate for the region. We first determined the costs that would be incurred if a region built DCs that were optimal as determined from the EV for a specific magnitude earthquake. This optimal solution was then substituted back into (5) for all other earthquake magnitudes to calculate the total costs. For example, if a region were to develop an optimal plan for a 6.5 magnitude earthquake, we would then apply those settings and estimate the total costs, including fatalities, for earthquakes ranging from magnitude 5 to 8.5, as well as if no earthquakes were experienced given that is a realistic possibility for most regions.

The next step in the analysis was to determine the associated probability of a region experiencing an earthquake of a particular magnitude. We first categorized regions as being prone to low, moderate and high intensity earthquakes respectively. We then used variants of the beta distribution with peak ground acceleration as it relates to earthquake magnitude (Mercalli, 2015) as the random variable to generate probabilities for the three classifications. Specifically, we chose the shape parameters (α
                        1, α
                        2) to be (1, 15), (2, 10) and (5, 5) respectively to represent low, moderate and high intensity earthquake regions. For simplicity, we considered any region affected with an earthquake magnitude less than 5 as equivalent to no earthquake event occurring. Similarly, we did not consider earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8.5 as we assumed that these would be very low probability events for a given region. To demonstrate, consider an earthquake of magnitude 7, for which the probability is found as follows:

Similarly, the probabilities for the moderate and high intensity regions employing the above were found to be 0.0806 and 0.1201 for respectively. The probability distributions for the three categories are depicted in Fig. 4
                         below.

Based on the above probability inputs, we applied a decision tree analysis to determine the optimal policy for Northridge based upon demographic and geological characteristics of the region. Specifically, the decision tree captures both whether to build DCs within a region, as well as the magnitude the region should plan for given the associated earthquake risk. If the decision maker decides not to build any DCs, the payoff was simply computed as the costs of the statistical fatalities, while all other scenarios included both the facility and fatality costs.

Given the Northridge region's history, for planning purposes we designated the region as high intensity for our case study. We found that the optimal policy for the Northridge region, with the associated earthquake risk based upon the probability distributions developed, is to build DCs that would be optimal for an 8.5 magnitude earthquake (see
Fig. 5
                        ). The analysis indicates that the optimal policy was to construct a total of 4 DCs, all at moderate building code. For comparison, we also evaluated the optimal policy assuming low and moderate intensity regions, with the results indicating that the optimal planning was for magnitudes of 6.5 and 7.5, respectively, all else being equal. The optimal supply levels across the DCs are given in Fig. 5 and are contrasted with those generated assuming a low and moderate intensity region. As expected, the optimal policy and the associated supply levels is a function of the intensity distribution and related earthquake risk that is characteristic of a region.

In addition to determining the specific earthquake magnitude to plan for as a function of the earthquake vulnerability of a region, the decision support models discussed above could also yield capacity and location insights that can have significant policy implications. For instance, the decision maker can study the spatial distribution and number of the DCs subject to earthquake vulnerability in a region. Second, it can help decision makers determine the required capacity distribution by severity and study its sensitivity to the earthquake vulnerability of a region (see
Fig. 6). This in turn can help with the necessary budgeting when implementing a strategic disaster plan.

To evaluate the impact of the cost premium associated with building a DC to high code, as well as the earthquake risk for a specific region, we consider premiums of 5percent
 and 10 percent, in addition to the initial assumption of a 20 percent premium, when compared to costs incurred for a building constructed to medium code. The results are summarized in Fig. 7
                        
                         for each of the three earthquake risk categories. We note that as vulnerability of a region to earthquakes increases, or as the probability of a region being prone to a high intensity earthquake increases, the building structure preference goes from medium to high code as the premium decreases. However, for both moderate and low intensity earthquake regions, the premium does not have a significant role, with all buildings constructed to medium code.

Finally, we note that in the current study we have not accounted for aftershocks (smaller earthquakes that occur in the same general area during the days to years following a mainshock; USGS, 2015), or in similar vein earthquake events known as foreshocks (earthquakes that precede mainshocks at the same location; USGS, 2015). Our focus in this study was primarily on mainshocks also referred to as the large earthquake event in the seismological literature. Aftershocks and foreshocks can both have an impact on the total damage and resulting casualties over a period of time before and after the mainshock, depending on the magnitude of these events. That said, it has been shown in literature (Felzer, Abercrombie, & Ekström, 2004) that while the number of aftershocks can be impacted by the magnitude of the mainshock, the magnitude of the aftershocks are independent of the mainshock magnitude. The same holds true for foreshocks, indicating that planning from a magnitude perspective (i.e. that the resultant damage is dependent on) these are independent events. In addition, as noted above, an aftershock can occur years after the mainshock. Further, given that the DCs we are proposing are permanent sites determined using a scenario analysis that takes into account the seismic vulnerability of a region as captured by the associated probability distributions, the essence of which is related to the frequency of all events (i.e. mainshocks as well as aftershocks and foreshocks) by magnitude, we are confident our models are robust to the above mentioned events.

In this article, we develop a stochastic optimization model to determine the locations and capacities of DCs that would prepare a region to deal with and minimize losses, both economic and societal in the event of a potential disaster. To demonstrate the application of the model, we use a specific case example involving an earthquake related disaster in the Northridge region of California. However, the modeling framework in and of itself is generic, and is applicable in planning for any unexpected disaster (with respect to the timing as well as the scope and resulting impact on the affected population), whether natural (earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, etc.) or man-made (for example, terrorist attacks).

The models consider a host of relevant factors such as facility and supply costs, as well as facility damage, the number and severity of casualties and their survivability time, etc. as a function of the associated risk, both with respect to the severity and scope in a probabilistic framework. Given the complexity of the problem, we develop an evolutionary optimization heuristic that produces time efficient high quality solution. This heuristic is aided by an innovative MIP model that builds on intuitive optimal order quantity news vendor theory. The MIP model provides a high quality initial solution to the EV heuristic which therefore allows the EV algorithm to converge to a final solution in a time efficient manner.

Unlike disasters such as a hurricane, wherein information regarding relevant factors such as the category or strength as well as the time to landfall are generally available, significant uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of an earthquake exists. To account for this, we utilize decision analysis to develop locations and capacities for the DCs that are robust to the potential magnitude of the earthquake, while also considering the geological characteristics of a region. The latter is of paramount importance as significant differences exist across regions in terms of probability or risk of an earthquake of a specific magnitude occurring. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models via a case study featuring inputs obtained from HAZUS-MH software by FEMA and real world data on supply and building costs, casualty survivability time obtained from various credible sources including the extant literature.

We believe that the approach developed is applicable to a range of disasters for which there is little or no forewarning. In this study, we specifically apply our modeling framework to a region vulnerable to earthquakes to demonstrate the capacity and allocation decisions for a disaster. It would however be of significant value from a policy maker's perspective if disaster models provided decision support in developing a plan that is robust to not just to a particular disaster, but rather to all that the region is potentially vulnerable to. This comprehensive approach would be one of the directions of future research. Further, within the earthquake study presented, we do not consider the specific needs for each casualty within the same severity, which is in part due to the difficulty in obtaining cost data on the same. In addition, we have not considered constraints that could be imposed due to limited budgets, again for similar reasons. It would be worthwhile to perform a sensitivity analysis subject to changes in such budgetary constraints and also be able to develop location-allocation solutions that consider the specific nature of supplies to be stored in a given DC.

Finally, as discussed earlier, while we are confident our models are robust to events such as aftershocks and foreshocks, we do have an interest in performing a more thorough investigation that focuses on the accurate estimation of probability distribution functions for a region that fully captures its vulnerability to these events as a function of the earthquake magnitude. While seismology is beyond our area of expertise, given our significant interest in this topic it is one research question we plan to consider in future extensions of this research effort. This includes forming an interdisciplinary research team with collaborators that have an expertise in seismology.
