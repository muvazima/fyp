               Abstract
               
                  The design stage represents one of the most critic steps for product development. Here, a great number of considerations have to be borne in mind, e.g., technical, functional, aesthetic or economic criteria. More recently, the increasing concerns on environmental aspects have added complexity to the process, known as ecodesign. In this respect, a framework to integrate the criteria provided by quantitative environmental indicators has been proposed on the basis of Fuzzy Preference Programming method features and fuzzy logic reasoning. As a result, an integrated Ecodesign Index (EcoInd) is obtained. This idea enables the decision making at process and product level taking into account different indicators at a time. The ecodesign of children's footwear was taken as case study and an ecodesign tool (decision support system) that included the estimation of environmental indicators and their integration was developed. Different models of shoes were analyzed to identify the most environmentally friendly design and to test the tool. In this case, the Ecological Footprint and two Environmental Risk Assessment indicators, namely Hazard Quotient and Cancer Risk, were selected as relevant environmental indicators and they were computed from data provided by a shoes manufacturer. Then, these indicators were integrated in the ecodesign tool and the EcoInd values were appraised for the children's footwear models analyzed. According to these figures, they were ranked as Red Leather>White Leather>White Synthetic>Pink Synthetic, from best to worst.
