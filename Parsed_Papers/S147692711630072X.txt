                  In recent years, computer aided redesigning methods based on genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) have played important roles in metabolic engineering studies; however, most of these methods are hindered by intractable computing times. In particular, methods that predict knockout strategies leading to overproduction of desired biochemical are generally unable to do high level prediction because the computational time will increase exponentially. In this study, we propose a new framework named IdealKnock, which is able to efficiently evaluate potentials of the production for different biochemical in a system by merely knocking out pathways. In addition, it is also capable of searching knockout strategies when combined with the OptKnock or OptGene framework. Furthermore, unlike other methods, IdealKnock suggests a series of mutants with targeted overproduction, which enables researchers to select the one of greatest interest for experimental validation. By testing the overproduction of a large number of native metabolites, IdealKnock showed its advantage in successfully breaking through the limitation of maximum knockout number in reasonable time and suggesting knockout strategies with better performance than other methods. In addition, gene–reaction relationship is well considered in the proposed framework.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During these years, increasing amounts of genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data are becoming available, and at the same time, many GEMs that serve as scaffolds for omic data integration have been reconstructed (Akesson et al., 2004; Borodina and Nielsen, 2005; Schwartz and Gaugain, 2011). These GEMs have triggered a new concept in metabolic engineering, termed ‘in silico metabolic engineering’. In silico metabolic engineering is less time-consuming and giving more systematic answer compared to traditional intuitive strategies. However, given the increasing complexity and scale of the metabolic network model, it is a great challenge to identify optimal strategies for redesigning the network leading to improved production of the desired biochemical.

In these years, many algorithms have been developed for redesigning or analyzing metabolic networks leading to overproducing of targeted products (Curran et al., 2012; Feist and Palsson, 2008; Osterlund et al., 2012). These redesign algorithms can be classified into four types by their suggested manipulations, which are knockout, up-regulation, down-regulation, and heterologous knock in. One of the earliest and most well-known algorithms is OptKnock (Burgard et al., 2003), which identifies knockout strategies that lead to the highest potential production based on bi-level optimization. Later, a derived algorithm of OptKnock, named RobustKnock (Tepper and Shlomi, 2010), was developed to search for knockout strategies that led to the highest minimum potential production, by accounting for the presence of competing pathways. Another derived method, OptReg (Pharkya and Maranas, 2006), extends the function of OptKnock to allow prediction of up- or down-regulation of reactions. However, OptReg is very complex and time-consuming. Later, OptStrain (Pharkya et al., 2004) further extends OptKnock to be able to suggest knock-in of non-native reactions or pathways combined with knockouts to achieve overproduction of the desired biochemical, based on the idea that introduce foreign pathways may enhance native production. Another two recently developed methods named ReacKnock and GDBB (Egen and Lun, 2012) challenged the inner dual transformation system of bi-level optimization in OptKnock, and greatly improved the searching efficiency (Xu et al., 2013). These methods are all based mainly on the flux balance analysis (FBA) method (Orth et al., 2010) and multi-level optimization (usually consisting of two optimization problems: inner optimization of cellular objective and outer optimization of production). Multi-level optimization requires global search, but global search essentially involves combinations for which the numbers increases exponentially when high-level manipulations are required. To reduce the computational cost, Kim et al. (2011) introduced several techniques that included screening candidates and imposing bounds on dual variables, and developed two algorithms named SimOptStrain and BiMOMA. The SimOptStrain framework was derived directly from OptStrain, and BiMOMA changed the OptKnock’s inner FBA optimization into an MOMA (minimization of metabolic adjustment) optimization (Segre et al., 2002). As the gene–reaction network in a biosystem is very complicated, almost all the methods mentioned above (including GDBB, which only considers the complicated relationship by deleting enzymes but not genes) have difficulties in dealing with the relationship properly and may give knockout strategies that are unrealistic in terms of gene manipulations. OptGene (Patil et al., 2005) is a previously developed method that directly searches gene knockout strategies using genetic algorithm. Compared with OptKnock, the calculation time of OptGene is reasonable and the calculation framework is flexible, since complex objective such as Biomass-Production Coupled Yield (BPCY) could be introduced as a screening criterion. However, OptGene has the problem of falling into local optimum solution rather than the global one. Another method named GDLS (Lun et al., 2009) further improved the computational efficiency, but would still miss the global optimal solution. Some of these algorithms, such as OptKnock and OptGene, have been applied to in vivo applications (Asadollahi et al., 2009; Fong et al., 2005), showing the great potential of in silico metabolic engineering. Recently, another algorithm named FastPros (Ohno et al., 2013) utilizing shadow price as a new screening criterion could further improve the performance in silico metabolic engineering. However, methods that identify up-regulations or down-regulations are still very rare, and OptForce (Ranganathan et al., 2010), FSEOF/FVSEOF (Choi et al., 2010; Park et al., 2012) and Redirector (Rockwell et al., 2013) are the outstanding ones among this type of methods.

Almost all the methods mentioned above have quite limited capability in searching for high level knockout strategies and cannot properly handle the gene–reaction relationship. Although some of them could identify 10 or more knockouts (i.e. OptGene, GDLS), it takes quite a long time (usually more than 10h for a medium sized GEM). In addition, their time expenses increase dramatically when searching for higher level knockout strategies. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, named IdealKnock, for identifying knockout strategies, which has significant advantages of reducing computation time, a non-restricted maximum knockout number, and properly handle the gene–reaction relationship. IdealKnock scans for thousands of mutants with potential positive production of desired chemicals by simply considering knockouts and hereafter, directly identifies knockout targets with the guidance of overproducing phenotypes of selected mutants in a way of iterative search. IdealKnock can identify strategies within a few minutes while the number of knockouts is not explicitly limited before searching, thus it allows for comprehensive/whole genomic metabolic engineering designs.

FBA is the most commonly used and validated method to determine flux distribution (Curran et al., 2012; Edwards et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2010), which assumes that organisms use substrates to maximize their growth rate and, thus, eventually to adapt to changes in the environment. The FBA method has been incorporated into COBRA Toolbox. In this study, we used FBA to calculate the flux distributions. In addition, flux variability analysis (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003), which has also been incorporated into COBRA Toolbox, was used to find out the potential maximal and minimal flux of each reaction. All optimization problems were solved in Matlab (version 7.12.0.635 (R2011a)) with COBRA Toolbox 2.0 incorporated. The solvers ‘glpk’ (version 4.35) and Tomlab/CPLEX (version 7.9) were used for FBA and OptKnock (which has also been incorporated into COBRA Toolbox), respectively. All procedures were implemented on a personal computer with 3.40GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600k and 16.0 GB RAM.

The Escherichia coli model iAF1260 (Feist et al., 2007), is a large and high-quality GEM. It is a comprehensive model that has been verified against large amounts of experimental data, such as growth phenotypes validations on different substrates and genetic conditions. All simulations were carried out under the condition of minimal glucose medium. The maximum glucose uptake rate was set to 10mmol/gDW/h.

It should be noticed that few existing methods can properly handle the gene–reaction relationship. One could better understand this by considering the situation below:

Reaction A is associated with a gene set (a and b), reaction B is associated with a gene set (a or c). Assume that gene b and c is essential for growth. Then, for methods like OptKnock and ReacKnock, they may give a knockout strategy involves reaction B. Apparently, the strategy involves disturbing the essential gene c, thus not feasible. For methods like GDBB, they may suggest a strategy including a gene set (a and b), which may mislead someone choose to disturb gene b in case of not realizing that b is essential. GDBB may also indicate knock out gene set of (a or c) while c is an essential gene. In our study, IdealKnock can directly give gene knockout strategies, yet also be able to suggest reaction knockout strategy and taking the gene–reaction relationship into consideration at the same time.

IdealKnock is a top-down framework which first scans for the mutants of interest, and then identifies a knockout strategy achieving it. The whole procedure of IdealKnock (as shown in Fig. 1
                        ) can be divided into two stages: (1) to design an ideal flux distribution which involves the steps of finding key reactions (denoted as KeyRxns in the flowchart), sampling and evaluating mutants; (2) to identify knockout targets based on the guidance of a designed ideal flux distribution which involves the step of iterative searching process.

Ideal-type flux distribution (ITF) is an important concept in IdealKnock since it directly guides the process of searching knockout targets from hundreds of candidates. For a specific strain, the ideal flux distribution (ideal-type) can be directly calculated by optimizing production rate with a minimum growth guaranteed (i.e. Vgrowth
                        >P×maximum growth rate, where 0<P<1). Thus, in the ITF, once the growth is guaranteed, the rest of resources are directed to the synthesis of desired product, which is the most ideal way to transform resources into biomass and production. Here an ideal point is defined by the growth rate and production rate of the ideal-type fluxes, i.e. ideal point=(growth rate, production rate).


                           ITF plays a key role in discovery of knockout targets In IdealKnock. For a specific strain, what kind of ITF is needed to get a knockout strategy with a high production rate? Intuitively, the ITF with the highest production rate is desired and this means that the lowest P is needed. Here, in the case of succinate production, we obtained 100 different ITFs with 100 P values ranging from 0 to 1 (step=0.01). In the following trials, ideally, all reactions carrying no fluxes in ITF were directly removed, and the flux distribution of the mutant was recalculated by optimizing biomass (see dot points in Fig. 2
                           ). Interestingly, according to the dot-line, we could see that the production ability of the 100 mutants decreased but not continuously with increasing P values. The phenomenon implies that the lower the P value is, the higher possibility there is for us to discover a near-global optimal engineering mutant. Thus, throughout this study, the value of P was set to 0.05 for IdealKnock.

For a specific strain, as described above, 100 samples of ideal flux distributions could be obtained together with 100 ideal points defined by the corresponding growth rates and production rates. Here an ideal production line (IPLine) is defined by a line joining these 100 ideal points. Apparently, not all the points on the IPLine can be reached by simply considering the knockout of reactions. To determine how many ideal points were reachable or could be approximately reached by deleting reactions only, the blocked reactions were first identified from the ideal flux distribution. Among these identified blocked reactions only those whose corresponding genes were not associated with other flux-carrying reactions in the ideal flux distribution were removed, and both growth rate and production rate were recalculated based on the optimization of cell growth. The point defined by the newly obtained growth and production (the production equals the fitness in Fig. 1) was considered reachable by knocking out reactions, and it generally located on or below the IPLine. Such a point is defined as a reachable ideal point, and higher reachable piont means higher production rate. In case of succinate production, only one reachable ideal point with positive production was obtained from 100 samples of the wild-type strain, as marked by ‘+’ in Fig. 3
                           .

A specific P value of 0.05 was used for sampling reachable ideal points throughout this study. Reachable ideal point of the wild-type strain does not necessarily have a positive production or the best production in terms of production rate or BPCY, thus thousands of reachable ideal points of mutants were also examined. Again, taking succinate production in the wild-type strain as an example, oxygen uptake rate was set to 18.5mmol/gDW/h. First, method FVA was applied to determine must reactions (denotes as 
                              MustRxns
                            in Fig. 1) which must carry fluxes when production was optimized and certain growth was maintained. Furthermore, reactions that must carry fluxes (denotes as 
                              BasicRxns
                            in Fig. 1) in order to maintain a certain percentage of maximum growth rate and maximum production rate were excluded from the MustRxns set, resulting in a key reaction set (denotes as 
                              KeyRxns
                            in Fig. 1). Then, a large number of mutants were obtained by knocking out a maximum of k reactions randomly selected from the key reaction set. Undoubtly, mutants derived in this way are likely to have different IPLines from that of the wild-type strain, and their reachable ideal points are likely close to the ideal point of the wild-type strain. Thus, sampling this kind of reachable points will greatly increase the chance to discover a near-global optimal knockout strategy, and this is important for IdealKnock to identify a good knockout strategy. It should be noted that a smaller k is likely (but not necessarily) to lead to a higher reachable ideal point since it corresponds to a higher IPLine. The default value for k was 2. According to our experience, a higher k value means a dramatically increased computing time, but does not necessarily result in a better solution. The IPLines of 12 mutants were shown in Fig. 1 as examples. Twelve reachable ideal points were identified (‘*’ in Fig. 1) for 12 mutants respectively. Generally, the mutant with the highest reachable ideal point in terms of production rate or BPCY could be selected for further identification of reaction knockouts. The ITF of this selected mutant is what we are looking for, and it will guide the iterative knockout search. The whole process of designing this ideal-type flux distribution only involves regular linear programming, which could be completed efficiently by using parallel computing toolbox in Matlab.


                        ITF represents an ideal-type strain which has great production potential, and it is quite difficult to find a concise strategy to transform the wild-type strain into the ideal-type strain. Here, in order to find knockout strategies to overproduce desired product, we designed an iterative searching process based on the ITF. The core process to identify knockout set is described below and visualized in the lower half of Fig. 1: (1) Wild-type flux distribution was calculated by optimizing biomass. (2) Determine knockout. Find out reactions carrying fluxes in the wild-type flux distribution while being blocked in ideal flux distribution. To reduce the size of final knockout set, these reactions or genes associated with these reactions will be ranked by positive score (descending order), potential positive score (descending order), and number of associated genes (ascending order). When a reaction or gene set is removed, the positive score equals the number of joint deleted reactions (as gene–reaction relationship is considered) that are members of the identified knockouts in this turn, and potential positive score equals number of reactions associated with the deleted genes meanwhile are members of the identified knockouts in this iterative turn. At last, the reaction which ranked first as well as its joint reactions would be knocked out (if knockout type is gene, the first ranked gene will be deleted). The resulted mutant is named mutantA, and a transition flux distribution is achieved by optimizing biomass. (3) Similar to (1) and (2), the role of wild-type flux distribution is replaced by transition flux distribution, and a new set of knockout candidates is identified. Again, the new mutant takes the role of mutantA later. (4) Iterative process. Perform (3) iteratively until no knockout candidates are identified. During the iterative process, the knocked reactions or genes are accumulated gradually, and consist a quite simplified final knockout set. Normally, the searching procedure can be completed within one minute.

IdealKnock identifies accumulated knockouts in an iterative searching way, thus in most cases, the final knockout set is redundant and needs to be refined. OptKnock and OptGene were then used as the primary tool to extract the most concise and effective knockout strategies from the final set. Because the number of the knockout candidates predicted by IdealKnock (usually <100) was quite small compared to the size of genome-scale model and deletion of all or part of the candidates can guarantee a production, OptKnock could be implemented very efficiently with calculation time ranging from only seconds to several minutes even when the maximum knockout number was assigned to be more than ten. Also, based on the result of IdealKncok, OptGene could also be performed within much more reasonable time. In addition, if someone is interested in obtaining the best mutants with a fixed knockout number, OptKnock could be implemented for all available mutants with different positive production. Therefore, the optimal mutants with the best production could be selected from the resulting strategies obtained by OptKnock. In this case, the computing time will increase to a few hours, which is still acceptable.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The abbreviations of reactions and metabolites in this study adhere to the original model definitions (refer to S1 Table). The theoretical maximum growth rate (TMG) was calculated under a specific condition: maximum glucose uptake rate 10mmol/gDW/h, and maximum oxygen uptake rate 18.5 or 5mmol/gDW/h. Theoretical maximum production rate (TMP) was also assigned a specific value while no cell growth was guaranteed. In this section, IdealKnock was widely tested and some comparisons were made between IdealKnock and several other methods.

To illustrate whether the IdealKnock framework has any bias towards the target metabolites, all existing exchange reactions in E. coli model system were examined and 82 metabolites with positive theoretical production rates were chosen for the test of IdealKnock framework. Though IdealKnock can predict both reaction knockout strategies and gene knockout strategies, here we mainly displayed the result of reaction knockout strategies for the convenience of comparison. The vector of the 82 exchange reactions and their corresponding TMP list were recorded in S2 Table. Note that the initial knockout candidates (also shown in S2 Table) were reactions with gene associations, and only one of the fully coupled reactions was considered (results of coupling analysis were in S2 Table). In addition, reactions encoded by the gapA, pgk, eno and gpmA genes were excluded from knockout candidates since these reactions were proven to be essential in vivo (Baba et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2010). To make a straight comparison with the results obtained with FastPros, the modeling condition was set to be the same as that given in the original paper (Ohno et al., 2013) except that the original model of iAF1260 was not simplified. However, this difference would not affect the final results except for reducing the final computational time of FastPros.

Key reaction sets for the 82 metabolites were fist obtained, and the sizes of the identified key reactions sets were quite similar with an average number of 83. The consistency of the sizes of key reaction sets might suggest similar searching scopes for designing ITFs for the overproduction of different metabolites. The computational expenses for this step were thus not varied significantly (∼700s for all cases in this study). Fifty-five metabolites among the 82 cases in this study could be produced based on IdealKnock prediction.

Based on the designed ITFs, the corresponding final knockout sets were identified by IdealKnock. The numbers of both reaction knockouts and corresponding gene set knockouts for the production of 82 metabolites were shown in Fig. 4
                        a, while the corresponding production yields were displayed in Fig. 4b. For most cases, sizes of reaction knockout sets were less than 60, while the numbers of the associated gene sets were generally smaller. Both minimum and maximum production rates (denoted by light bars and dark bars, respectively) obtained by deleting reactions involved in the identified final knockout sets were shown in Fig. 4b. Among 55 cases with metabolite production, equal minimum and maximum production rates could be observed for 39 metabolites, suggesting the robustness of the knockout strategies developed under IdealKnock framework.

Since redundant reaction knockouts might exist in the final knockout set identified by IdealKnock, OptKnock was further performed to extract the most effective knockout strategies. The minimum knockouts that led to the highest production were identified and, the corresponding knockout numbers and production rates for all cases were shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d. As expected, the knockout numbers reduced dramatically when OptKnock was used. In some cases, however, the robustness of knockout strategies has disappeared and the minimum production rate of a certain metabolite could not be guaranteed. It should be noted that the OptKnock-derived knockout strategies had been revised by considering gene association, i.e. reactions associated by the same gene were knocked out simultaneously. In addition, the combination of IdealKnock and OptKnock frameworks does not improve the production rate compared with the use of IdealKnock only.

Recently, a new and similar algorithm named FastPros, which showed better performance than that of OptGene and GDLS, was reported (Ohno et al., 2013). FastPros can also be well combined with OptKnock, and usually improves the predicted yield of product by FastPros alone. Here, comparison study of prediction results was then conducted between the IdealKnock and FastPros frameworks. In case IdealKnock was employed, it usually took about 0.3h for strategy searching and the knockout number was not necessarily restricted. In comparison, it took around 3h to obtain a strategy with 10 reaction knockouts by using FastPros. The comparison between IdealKnock and FastPros are detailed in S3 Table. The best production performances for 82 metabolites predicted by both FastPros and IdealKnock are depicted in the same figure (Fig. 5
                        ). The results showed that both frameworks could be well applied for the production of most metabolites, where IdealKnock exhibited a relatively better performance. In addition, the overproduction of 7 metabolites could be uniquely predicted by FastPros, while IdealKnock uniquely discovered the strategies for production of another 17 metabolites. In some cases, e.g. the production of 5-dehydro-d-gluconate, strategies with both higher production rate and higher growth rate, but lower knockout number could be identified by IdealKnock. Furthermore, for metabolite productions uniquely predicted with IdealKnock, the corresponding knockout strategies often involved more than ten reactions, suggesting the developed framework of IdealKnock is powerful in finding comprehensive reaction knockout strategies. Although the best strategies generated by IdealKnock usually included more knockouts than that obtained by FastPros or other algorithms, suboptimal solutions with fewer knockouts could be found by subsequently performing OptKnock. All prediction results for the production of 82 metabolites by IdealKnock combined with OptKnock are provided in supplementary S4 Table and S5 Table. IdealKnock was also implemented to directly search gene knockout strategies under the same modeling condition, and results showed that 60 of the 82 metabolites could be overproduced with knockout number generally less than 55 (see S6 Table).

Firstly, a direct comparison was made between OptKnock and IdealKnock, to show how close the local optimal results found by IdealKnock is to the global optimal one. Identification of high level knockout with OptKnock is very time consuming in genome scale models, and therefore, the E. coli core model was used. The maximum uptake rate of glucose was set to 10mmol/gDW/h. Here knockout candidates are all reactions associated with genes in the model, and succinate was the targeted product. To obtain the global optimal production rate suggested by OptKnock, the maximum knockout number was set to 69 (the number of candidates) and finally 20 reactions were listed in the knockout strategy. As there may be redundant knockouts, we implemented OptKnock with the maximum knockout number gradually increased and found that the optimal production rate can be achieved by knocking out 9 reactions (see Table 1
                        ). However, when all corresponding genes of the 9 knockouts were removed, no growth was observed. This strongly suggested that the 9 knockouts maybe unrealistic in terms of gene manipulation. Thus we focused on the sub-optimal knockout strategies with 8 knockouts which is feasible in terms of gene manipulation, and the production rate is 8.55–13.80mmol/gDW/h. In total, it took about 270s for OptKnock to find this feasible global knockout strategies. Later, IdealKnock was implemented independently, and resulted a knockout strategy with 11 reactions within 115seconds, with a yield of 12.86–12.86mmol/gDW/h and accounts for 93.2% of the optimal one found by OptKnock. In addition, the size of knockout strategy of IdealKnock can be reduced to 9 knockouts within seconds. With the 11 reactions as knockout candidates, OptKnock can also extract a knockout strategy with 8 knockouts, with a yield of 12.73–12.73mmol/gDW/h. Though IdealKnock missed the global optimal knockout strategy, it should be noticed that IdealKnock found a more robust one with a much higher minimum yield as well as a much better growth rate (see Table 1). As IdealKnock search knockouts with the guidance of ITF, it is reasonable to expect that IdealKnock inclined to find mutants that can fully transform resources into both biomass and production. Thus, we examined the by-products of mutants predicted by OptKnock and IdealKnock. As a result, mutants of OptKnock produced lots of by-products such as pyruvic acid and formic acid, while mutants obtained by IdealKnock seldom produced by-products. Overall, the results showed that IdealKnock can find near-optimal knockout strategies efficiently and tend to balance the biomass and production in the obtained mutants.

Later, A direct comparison between IdealKnock and OptGene based on the model of iAF1260 was made (OptGene cannot be implemented with the E. coli core model). Similarly, succinate and lactate were desired to be overproduced. Maximum oxygen uptake rate was set to 5mmol/gDW/h. With all deletable genes in this model as knockout candidates, OptGene was implemented with maximum knockout number set to ten. The maximum computational time of OptGene was set to 30h. Subsequently, IdealKnock was performed and OptGene was applied to extract knockout strategies with the final mutant of IdealKnock as initial strain. In case of succinate product, OptGene found no strategies as computing time exceeded, while IdealKnock combined with OptGene find a strategy that enhanced the succinate production greatly (as shown in see last second row of Table 2
                        ). In the case of lactate production, similar situation was observed (see last row of Table 2).

To further demonstrate the performance of IdealKnock, overproduction strategies for four selected metabolites (succinate, acetate, serine, and lycopene, located in either core metabolism or metabolic subsystems) were investigated. Several model based redesign methods have already been applied to succinate production and acetate production by E. coli, thus enabling a direct comparison. Lycopene is a high-value natural product that has received much attention in recent decades. Four heterogonous reactions (crtE, crtB, crtI, EX_lyco) were introduced into the original model to enable lycopene production in E. coli.

Here, overproduction of the four metabolites were evaluated under fully aerobic condition with a maximum O2 uptake rate of 18.5mmol/gDW/h, micro-aerobic condition with a maximum O2 uptake rate of 5mmol/gDW/h and anaerobic condition, respectively. The resulting strategies of IdealKnock and obtained from published papers are provided in Table 2. It should be mentioned that E. coli model iAF1260 was used for the prediction in all algorithms and the collected data were reexamined to make sure that all knockout strategies are feasible in terms of gene manipulations. The results obtained here implicated that IdealKnock could found better or similar strategies with more reasonable computational time. In addition, IdealKnock combined with OptKnock found an attractive robust knockout strategy with 60.0% TMP lycopene produced (see the last third line of Table 2), which further shown the potential power of IdealKnock to find knockout strategies for overproduction of heterogeneous metabolites. In S1 Text, we performed a simple analysis of a septuple knockout strategy identified by IdealKnock for anaerobic succinate production in E. coli. In this example, we clearly revealed the possible biological meanings of the high-level knockout strategy which contains three validated reactions.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, a novel iterative optimization-based algorithm termed IdealKnock is proposed. It can be employed to efficiently and successfully identify excellent knockout strategies for the overproduction of various products. Furthermore, it could also provide information on the overproduction mechanism by the analysis of shared knockout and activated reactions of sub-optimal overproducing mutants resulted from IdealKnock.

Compared with existing redesigning methods such as FastPros, and GDLS, IdealKnock displayed several other advantages in addition to a dramatic reduction in computational expense. Firstly, IdealKnock broke through the common bottleneck of knockout number limitation and gene–reaction relationship is well considered. Secondly, IdealKnock showed great potential to identify knockout strategies that keep a good balance between metabolite production and cell growth, while other methods such as OptKnock often gives a knockout strategies with extremely low growth rate in spite of high production rate (see Table 1). In addition, the knockout strategies given by IdealKnock are generally robust (which means the maximum and minimum production rate are close), while few other methods could achieve this merit. Although knockout strategies resulting in promising minimum production rates might be missed by OptKnock, methods like RobustKnock or tilted objective (Feist et al., 2010) could be an alternative algorithm to be combined with IdealKnock for generating knockout strategies with more robust production rates. Furthermore, unlike other methods, IdealKnock gave a series of overproducing mutants which enables users to choose a favorite one that is not necessarily related to the best production. Last but not least, IdealKnock can be implemented and developed easily without special constraints on the size and structure of the model system, while multi-level optimizing methods maybe difficult to be implemented once the structure of model significantly changed, such as a ME model (O’Brien et al., 2013). It is worth mentioning that gene–reaction association is well considered in the framework of IdealKnock.

Although the IdealKnock framework is time saving and the identified strategies are always revealing, the algorithm does not guarantee the global optimum. Actually, it is a common challenge faced by all methods applied for high level knockout strategy identification, such as OptGene, GDLS and FastPros. For IdealKnock, increase the sampling scope of reference strains could help to get a better strategy. The best strategy of IdealKnock is usually quite comprehensive, which may trigger arguments that too many interventions suggested by the identified knockout strategies make the redesigning of cell systems unfeasible and unrealistic. However, suboptimal solution with less knockouts could also be found, and many metabolic engineering successes have used a number of perturbations including reaction deletion, gene overexpression, to overproduce a certain metabolite (Atsumi et al., 2008; Causey et al., 2004). In addition, large combinatorial sets of metabolic engineering changes can be achieved using targeted genetic recombineering method such as MAGE and CRISPR (Cong et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2009).

IdealKnock and OptKnock are both based on the FBA framework, which could be used to predict flux distributions or production yields very well, as revealed by a study of laboratory adaptive evolution (Fong et al., 2005). However, FBA is not necessarily the most appropriate way to predict flux distributions of mutants (Schuster et al., 2008). The application of additional constrains based on transcriptomic or other omic information could further elevate the predictive power. Thus, in the next step, we will try to incorporate of multi omics data to improve IdealKnock’s accuracy in prediction.
