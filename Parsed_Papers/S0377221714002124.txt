                  We present in this paper a new model for robust combinatorial optimization with cost uncertainty that generalizes the classical budgeted uncertainty set. We suppose here that the budget of uncertainty is given by a function of the problem variables, yielding an uncertainty multifunction. The new model is less conservative than the classical model and approximates better Value-at-Risk objective functions, especially for vectors with few non-zero components. An example of budget function is constructed from the probabilistic bounds computed by Bertsimas and Sim. We provide an asymptotically tight bound for the cost reduction obtained with the new model. We turn then to the tractability of the resulting optimization problems. We show that when the budget function is affine, the resulting optimization problems can be solved by solving

We also adapt existing dynamic programming algorithms to solve faster the robust counterparts of optimization problems, which can be applied both to the traditional budgeted uncertainty model and to our new model. We evaluate numerically the reduction in the price of robustness obtained with the new model on the shortest path problem and on a survivable network design problem.

In contrast, robust optimization relaxes the knowledge about the components of c by only assuming that c belongs to a convex, closed, and bounded set

                     , the linear programming relaxation of problem (3) can be reformulated as a linear program, while the discrete problem (3) can be reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program. These approaches have made it possible to solve a large variety of robust combinatorial optimization problems. Recent works (Büsing & D’Andreagiovanni, 2012; Mattia, 2012) have independently extended the properties of

                      to richer classes of uncertainty polytopes.

Another advantage of robust optimization lies in its less specific assumptions on the uncertainty. In many applications, it is not realistic or not possible to describe the uncertainty on the parameters by unique probability distributions. In these settings, it is sometimes more convenient to restrict our knowledge to the description of the possible outcomes by providing an uncertainty set 
                        
                           U
                        
                      without providing any probability weight. There exist also intermediary models that assume partial knowledge on the distribution of the uncertain parameters. These models are usually cited as ambiguous chance constraints (Erdogan & Iyengar, 2006) or distributionally robust optimization problems (pioneered by Z̆ác̆ková (1966)).

Among the large literature on robust optimization, researchers have proposed uncertainty sets that allow a robust constraint to approximate a chance constraint or an ambiguous chance constraint in the following sense: any solution to the robust constraint will be feasible for the original chance constraint or ambiguous chance constraint. In particular, Bertsimas and Sim (2004) have proved that uncertainty set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 Γ
                              
                           
                        
                      approximates an ambiguous chance constraint where the coefficients are described by bounded random perturbations that are only assumed to be symmetrically and independently distributed around their means. Their result yields the following relation between problems (2) and (3): the optimal solution of problem (3) is an upper bound for the optimal solution of problem (2) when the coefficients of c can be any random variables symmetrically and independently distributed around their means.

In a recent work, Poss (2013) mentions that the bound provided by Bertsimas and Sim is too conservative for feasible solutions with few non-zero components. In fact, for problems whose optimal solutions have small cardinalities compared to n, the probabilistic bounds from Bertsimas and Sim can be meaningless because the bounds would prescribe values for 
                        
                           Γ
                        
                      that are greater than the solutions cardinalities. This motivates the introduction by Poss (2013) of a more general uncertainty model where the amount of uncertainty is not bound by a static number but by a non-negative function

In this paper, we apply uncertainty model

In view of the third property above, we sometimes commit an abuse of notation and denote 
                        
                           γ
                           (
                           k
                           )
                        
                      with 
                        
                           k
                           ∈
                           Z
                        
                     . These assumptions are natural in our context since the introduction of the function 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      should modulate the size of the uncertainty set according to the cardinality of x. In particular, the functions prescribed by the probabilistic bounds from Bertsimas and Sim (2004) and introduced in Section 2.1 satisfy these assumptions.

In addition to these results, our dynamic programming approach from Section 4 also applies to the classical robust model

                         studied by Bertsimas and Sim (2003). We show that when

                         from Bertsimas and Sim (2003). Hence, our result extends to a large class of dynamic programming algorithms the ideas proposed by Klopfenstein and Nace (2008) and Monaci, Pferschy, and Serafini (2013) for the robust knapsack problem, by using a more general description of dynamic programming.

In Section 5, we present a numerical comparison of models

                         on the shortest path problem and on the hop-constrained path diversified network design problem. The main objective of our experiments is to evaluate the cost reduction obtained by using the new model. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6, and present a MILP formulation

                         comes from the probabilistic bounds computed by Bertsimas and Sim (2004) and extended to variable uncertainty by Poss (2013). We recall below how the strongest of these bounds applies to the problem of minimizing the value-at-risk. Namely, we show that for a properly chosen function, denoted 
                           
                              β

                                    CO

                         provides a less conservative solution for the stochastic problem (2) than model

                        . We sketch next how to construct function 
                           
                              β
                           
                        , which does not have an analytical expression. The full details of the construction can be found in Poss (2013, Section 3), where the author also introduces another function,

                        , which has an analytical expression but leads to a more conservative model than

                        . This situation is illustrated in our numerical experiments. In contrast to this, model

                         provides a tighter bound by reducing the value of 
                           
                              Γ
                           
                         as the cardinality of x decreases.

Choosing function 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         according to the probabilistic guarantees computed by Bertsimas and Sim (2004) leads to using non-linear functions such as 
                           
                              β
                           
                         and 
                           
                              α
                           
                         described in Poss (2013). There exist different ways to avoid this non-linearity. Poss (2013) suggests to replace a non-linear function 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         by a piece-wise upper approximation. A better idea, which is used in our numerical experiments, relies on solving first model

                         with

We study in the next section a theoretical upper bound on the cost reduction provided by model

Once we have established that model

                         provides the same probabilistic guarantee as model

                        , it is natural to wonder how much cheaper the solution provided by model

                         mentioned in Theorem 2 has been introduced in Poss (2013) where the author shows how the function can also be used to decrease the conservatism of

                        . However, it is not an easy task to verify analytically the tightness of (15) for function 
                           
                              β
                           
                         given that the function does not have an analytical expression. Hence, we illustrate numerically in Fig. 1
                         the bounds provided by (15) for 
                           
                              β
                           
                        . Fig. 1 suggests that bound (15) is very tight already for relatively small values of n. One can hardly expect to witness such cost reductions with practical problems since the theoretical bounds consider extreme cases where

We study in this section the computational complexity of

                      belongs to same complexity class as the original problem CO. We show then that for more general functions

                      is essentially the same as the complexity of CO. The result below is an extension of Bertsimas and Sim (2003, Theorem 3) to the case of variable budgeted uncertainty. The proof is omitted because it is almost identical to the proof of Bertsimas and Sim (2003, Theorem 3). Without loss of generality, we suppose below that the coefficients of the variables are ordered by decreasing order of

The only difference between problem (17) and the problems solved in Bertsimas and Sim (2003, Theorem 3) lies in the costs coefficients of x. In problem (17), these coefficients depend on the components

                      structure of these problems inside algorithm A. Hence, unlike the results of Section 3, the results of this section also provide faster algorithms for solving the classical robust optimization problem

                     . Notice that not all DP algorithms can be used in our framework and, in fact, DP is a methodology that goes far beyond the scope of the static combinatorial optimization problems studied in this paper (Sniedovich, 2011). We define precisely in Section 4.1 the type of functional equations we consider in this paper, which include many well-known DP algorithms such as the Bellman–Ford algorithm and the DP approach to the knapsack problem. We show then in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 how the aforementioned DP algorithms extend naturally to robust problems

Consider an optimization problem CO with cost function c and suppose that there exists a DP algorithm A to solve CO. Hence, CO can be reformulated over a finite state space 
                           
                              S
                           
                        , which contains at least two special states: 0 is the initial state and N is the final state. For some problems, there exists several initial states, in which case

                         denotes the set of initial states. The main idea of many DP algorithms is to fix variables

                         to state N is equal to the optimal solution of problem CO. The interpretation of CO as a shortest path problem in the directed and acyclic graph defined by the state space is used in the next two sections to extend functional Eq. (23) to the robust cases.

We provide below a classical example of DP algorithm that follows Eq. (23): the Bellman–Ford algorithm. Other applications can be found in the literature, such as the constrained shortest path problem (Righini & Salani, 2008), the traveling salesman problem (Held & Karp, 1962), the capital budgeting problem (Cornuejols & Tutuncu, 2006), and scheduling problems (Brucker & Knust, 2006). Notice, however, that this is not the case for all DP algorithms used in combinatorial optimization, since, for instance, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does not select individual arcs iteratively.

In this section, we assess numerically our new model on two combinatorial optimization problems from the literature: the shortest path problem and the survivable network design problem. The main objective of our computational experiments is to evaluate the reduction of the price of robustness obtained from using

The value of 
                        
                           β
                        
                      was computed numerically with a precision of three decimals by solving problem (10) by enumeration. We could easily compute 
                        
                           β
                        
                      for k going up to 3000, which was enough for our computational experiments. These values are illustrated in Fig. 2
                      for three choices of

                     . The experiments have been run a computer equipped with a processor Intel Core i7-3520M at 2.90GHz and 8GB of RAM. All algorithms were coded in JAVA and CPLEX (2013) 12.4 was used as the MIP solver with standard parameter settings.

                         with nonnegative edge costs and node pairs Q, we consider the problem of selecting a minimum cost set of edges so that the induced subgraph contains at least K edge-disjoint paths containing at most L edges between each pair in Q. The problem is motivated by the need of developing survivable networks without loss of service quality, even in case of network failure (link or node failure). The problem has been a very active source of investigation in the last 10years and it is only recently that researchers have introduced formulations valid for any positive integers

These formulations use a small set of binary design variables, x, denoting which edges belong to the optimal solution, and a larger set of real flow variables defined on layered graphs.

For these two instances, the comparison from Mahjoub et al. (2013) and unreported results show that the fastest solution method for the deterministic problem is the formulation from Botton et al. (2013), without using the Benders’ decomposition algorithm. Based on this, we use the formulation from Botton et al. (2013) to compare the solution times required by the dualization of Theorem 8 and those required by the method that consists in solving several deterministic problems, see Theorem 3. The deterministic version of the problem is solved in 0.34seconds and 13seconds, respectively. For each of the robust instances, we set a time limit of 5000 multiplied by the deterministic solution time. We report in Table 4
                         the geometric averages of these solution times expressed as multiples of the deterministic solution times. Average solution times exceeding the time limit are denoted by T.

We have presented in this paper a new approach to robust combinatorial optimization with cost uncertainty where the budget of uncertainty is given by a function 
                        
                           γ
                        
                     , rather than a constant 
                        
                           Γ
                        
                      as in the classical model. The use of a budget function 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      allows us to better modulate the degree of conservatism required, according to cardinality of the optimal solution. Our theoretical and computational results suggest that in many situations the practical applicability of our new approach is comparable to the one of the classical model. While we stick to specific functions 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      that are motivated by the probabilistic bounds from Bertsimas and Sim, our results can be extended to other budget functions. This would allow us to use different budget functions in practice if they capture better the uncertainty arising from a specific context.
