                  In this manuscript, we present a computational model to approximate the solutions of a partial differential equation which describes the growth dynamics of microbial films. The numerical technique reported in this work is an explicit, nonlinear finite-difference methodology which is computationally implemented using Newton's method. Our scheme is compared numerically against an implicit, linear finite-difference discretization of the same partial differential equation, whose computer coding requires an implementation of the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method. Our numerical results evince that the nonlinear approach results in a more efficient approximation to the solutions of the biofilm model considered, and demands less computer memory. Moreover, the positivity of initial profiles is preserved in the practice by the nonlinear scheme proposed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest on the investigation of the growth dynamics of microbial biofilms, both to understand comprehensively the physical and the mathematical principles that govern biofilm growth, and to elucidate possible, relevant biomedical and biotechnological applications. Undoubtedly, biological films entail both an economic and a biological importance. Indeed, nowadays biofilms are considered a common cause of persistent infections; for instance, the Chinese National Institute of Health has estimated that at least 65% of all bacterial infections in humans are related to certain types of biological colonies (Chen et al., 2012). In addition, several nosocomial infections are presumed to be the result of the presence of pathogenic films in a wide range of medical devices, like catheters and probes used in different hospital services. It is worthwhile to recall that microbial colonies in general are highly organized structures integrated by communities which are surrounded by a protective extracellular matrix. This important feature makes them resistant to both antibiotic treatment and host defense systems.

On the other hand, microbial films can grow in many different natural and no-natural environments, and may be considered benign or detrimental depending upon its place of growth. Biological films may be conformed by a single or by multiple species with different metabolic mechanisms which, in many cases, function as cooperative consortia. Here, it is important to mention that these cooperative consortia have encountered useful practical applications in the treatment of polluted water (Cao et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011; Ellwood et al., 2011; Jiao et al., 2011), in the development of microbial fuel cells to produce electricity (Jain et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2008, 2010; Yang et al., 2011), in the design of biosensors (Checa et al., 2012; Velusamy et al., 2010), among other applications of practical relevance. However, there are also scenarios in which the formation of biological films results in the deterioration of surfaces due to the microbial-influenced corrosion (Upadhyayula and Gadhamshetty, 2010; Little et al., 2008). Despite the many efforts to simulate and understand the complex nature of microbial aggregates, there still exists the need to explore deeper into the many variables that accompany this mechanism. For instance, the influence of self-generated attractants on Escherichia coli clustering has been studied in Kim et al. (2007). In that report, a discrete model was used to investigate the role of parameters such as chemotaxis sensitivity, geometry and initial conditions, in order to describe the joint dynamics of bacteria and attractants.

From a more mathematical point of view, the models which describe the growth dynamics of biological film are mainly provided in the form of systems of partial differential equations with nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms (Efendiev et al., 2002). Some of these mathematical models take into account the most important features of biological films observed in the practice, like
                        
                           (a)
                           the presence of a sharp front of biomass at the fluid/solid transition,

the existence of a threshold of biomass density,

the fact that the biomass spreading is significant only when the biomass is close to the threshold,

the application of reaction kinetics mechanisms in the production of biomass,

the compatibility of the biomass spreading mechanism with hydrodynamics and with nutrient transfer/consumption models,

In view of such mathematical limitations, several computational approaches have been taken to simulate the growth dynamics of microbial colonies. For instance, some related techniques are based on stochastic computational modeling (McCollum et al., 2006). For deterministic models, the finite-difference approach has been proposed in works like Eberl et al. (2001), and some differential-discrete cellular automata have been employed with success in the growth of gel beads (Picioreanu et al., 1998, 1999). The finite-element and the finite-volume methodologies have proved fruitful, too, like in Duddu et al. (2008), Böl et al. (2008), Smith et al. (2007) or Gallo and Manzini (2003), Picioreanu et al. (2000), Szego et al. (1993), respectively.

In the present work, we employ a finite-difference approach to approximate solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation in the investigation of biological films. More concretely, our investigation is partly motivated by the results presented in Eberl et al. (2001), which reports on a successful finite-difference discretization of a nonlinear equation from mathematical ecology, which is capable of preserving the positivity of the approximations among other relevant mathematical characteristics of the solutions. The discretization introduced in that work is an implicit, linear approach whose implementation is provided in terms of a sparse matrix with number of rows equal to the discrete grid size. The preservation of the properties of positivity and boundedness is achieved using the theory of M-matrices, which are non-singular, real matrices for which the entries of their inverses are all positive numbers (Fujimoto and Ranade, 2004). The method works at the expense of large computational memory and lengthy simulation times. In the present work, however, we provide an explicit, nonlinear finite-difference technique to approximate the solutions of the same model investigated in Eberl et al. (2001) but, as the numerical simulations show, our approach is computationally faster and absorbs less computational resources.

The present manuscript is divided as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the mathematical model of interest in this work. We present therein some relevant results on the existence and uniqueness of positive and bounded solutions of the biofilm equation under investigation. In Section 3, we introduce the finite-difference discretization of our model. The method is an explicit, nonlinear technique whose computational realization requires a convenient implementation of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations. Section 4 presents some simulations that evince the fact that the method is capable of preserving the property of positivity in the practice. Finally, we close this manuscript with some discussions and some concluding remarks.

                        2 are all equal to zero. In such cases, the function s is clearly a constant, and system (3) reduces to the single equation (1) which, under the conditions provided by Theorem 1, has solutions which are bounded within [0, 1) almost everywhere.

It is convenient to rewrite (1) in an alternative form. To that end, let us represent the coordinate spatial variables by x

The proposed method is evidently explicit, though nonlinear as its continuous counterpart. Its computational implementation requires the use of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations. In order to avoid any computational indetermination and additional propagation of errors caused by divisions by relatively small numbers, we multiply Eq. (22) by the term

In the present section, we test the performance of the method in the modeling of the growth dynamics of biofilms. In particular, we would like to verify the capability of the method to preserve the positivity of solutions. Throughout, we will consider the mathematical model (1) with nonlinear reaction factor given by (2), where α
                     =
                     β
                     =2 and δ
                     =0.0001. For convenience, we explore the two-dimensional scenario in which Ω
                     =[0, 1]×[0, 1]; computationally, we set Δx
                     =Δy
                     =0.02 and Δt
                     =0.01, and we impose homogeneous Neumann conditions on the boundary of Ω. In the implementation of Newton's method, we fix a tolerance of 1×10−6, and a maximum number of iterations equal to 20.

                            presents the checkerboard plots of the approximate solution using (22), at six different times, namely, t
                           =5, 10, 15, 20. The quantitative results, as well as the qualitative ones, reflect the fact that the method preserves the positivity and the boundedness of the solutions. The merging of colonies is fully observed around the time t
                           =20, and the numerical results exhibit stability in this case, even when different colonies begin to coalesce. □

The following example establishes computationally the capacity of (22) to preserve the positivity of solutions when biomass is destroyed.

                           =(0.8, 0.3). The corresponding solutions are decreasing in time in view that the rate of change of mass creation is negative, and the approximate solutions, depicted in Fig. 2
                            as three-dimensional plots, reflect that behavior. It is worthwhile to observe that the solutions remain nonnegative at all time, even though the rate of change of biomass destruction is a negative constant at all times. This fact establishes the capability of the method to preserve the nonnegative character of meaningful solutions of (1). □

In our last example, we consider a function G which asymptotically converges to 0, typical of a biofilm system which runs out of resources.

The results are qualitatively similar, as showed by the graphs. However, even when the computational parameters are the same, the method (22) demanded an average time of 11.2548s (computed from a total of 20 performances of the method), while the method presented in Eberl et al. (2001) took an average of 71.1033s in identical circumstances. □

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It is important to mention that the linear method used in Example 4 for comparison purposes, requires solving a linear system of the form

                     where x
                     
                        k
                      contains, in vector form, the approximation to the exact solution at the time t
                     
                        k
                     . Meanwhile A
                     
                        k
                      is sparse matrix system of size (M
                     +1)(N
                     +1)×(M
                     +1)(N
                     +1), and each iteration requires the use of the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method to solve (26). For instance, the numerical results obtained in Example 4 using the method proposed in Eberl et al. (2001), demanded solving a linear system represented by a matrix of size 2601×2601. Evidently, in the three-dimensional scenario, the linear method would consider a matrix A
                     
                        k
                      whose size is equal to (M
                     +1)(N
                     +1)(P
                     +1)×(M
                     +1)(N
                     +1)(P
                     +1).

On the other hand, it is worthwhile to recall that the linear method in Eberl et al. (2001) has variable temporal step in order to guarantee the preservation of the positivity of solutions, as opposed to our discretization, whose time-step is fixed. In view of the singularity of (2) at u
                     =1, both methods have computational stability shortcomings for values of the solutions close to 1. This, in practice, is not a limitation, in view that some realistic problems strive to bound the growth of toxic or dangerous microbial films and, ultimately, to maintain the population density of the colonies at minimal values.

Finally, we must mention that the simulations were performed using © Matlab 7.12.0.635 (R2011a) on a © Sony Vaio PCG-5L1P laptop computer, with Kubuntu 12.04 as operating system. We are completely aware that better computational results may be obtained in more modern, high performance equipment and more modest Linux/Unix distributions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, we introduced a method to approximate solutions of a nonlinear, parabolic partial differential equation studied in the formation of microbial colonies. The proposed technique follows a nonstandard finite-difference methodology which results in an explicit nonlinear scheme. The computational coding requires of an implementation of Newton's method for approximating the roots of nonlinear algebraic equations. In this manuscript, we provided some computer simulations of the growth of biofilms. The numerical results evince that the computational model is capable of preserving the positivity and the boundedness of the approximations, which are highly desirable, physical characteristics that are present in some solutions of the mathematical model.

The method was tested against a previously reported linear discretization of the model under investigation. The linear model is represented in vector form through the multiplication of a matrix which, under suitable and flexible circumstances, is an M-matrix, a fact that guarantees the preservation of the positivity and the boundedness of the approximations. The simulations obtained with the nonlinear scheme are in agreement with the results obtained through the linear discretization. However, as the simulations show, the nonlinear approach is capable of approximating solutions at lower computational cost in terms of both time and memory. Moreover, while the linear method is pragmatically obsolete in the two- and the three-dimensional scenarios, the nonlinear method is more practical. This is due to the fact that the matrix represented the linear system is a matrix in which most of the entries are equal to zero. These matrices appear in many types of problems (Korenblat et al., 2012; Smith and Stein, 2009), and their computational implementation often results in the use of a considerable amount of computer memory.
