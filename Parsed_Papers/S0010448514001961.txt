                  Nowadays, all geometric modelers provide some tools for specifying geometric constraints. The 3D pentahedron problem is an example of a 3D Geometric Constraint Solving Problem (GCSP), composed of six vertices, nine edges, five faces (two triangles and three quadrilaterals), and defined by the lengths of its edges and the planarity of its quadrilateral faces. This problem seems to be the simplest non-trivial problem, as the methods used to solve the Stewart platform or octahedron problem fail to solve it. The naive algebraic formulation of the pentahedron yields an under-constrained system of twelve equations in eighteen unknowns. Even if the use of placement rules transforms the pentahedron into a well-constrained problem of twelve equations in twelve unknowns, the resulting system is still hard to solve for interval solvers. In this work, we focus on solving the pentahedron problem in a more efficient and robust way, by reducing it to a well-constrained system of three equations in three unknowns, which can be solved by any interval solver, avoiding by the way the use of placement rules since the new formulation is already well-constrained. Several experiments showing a considerable performance enhancement (

                        42
                     ) are reported in this paper to consolidate our theoretical findings. Throughout this paper, we also emphasize some interesting properties of the solution set, by showing that for a generic set of parameters, solutions in the form of 3D parallel edge pentahedra do exist almost all the time, and by providing a geometric construction for these solutions. The pentahedron problem also admits degenerate 2D solutions in finite number. This work also studies how these interesting properties generalize for other polyhedra.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Geometric Constraint Solving Problems (GCSPs) have retained much of the researchers attention since several decades  [1–7]. This attention may be justified by the advances in computing systems, in terms of both hardware capabilities and software facilities, which translated into a growing need for new CAD/CAM techniques and opened new perspectives for the implementation of researchers ideas. Although there exist a large number of GCSP-related works, expressing and solving geometric constraint systems is still an active research topic and much more effort has to be done in this direction.

This paper considers a particular GCSP problem: the 3D pentahedron. A pentahedron is a polyhedron in 3D, not necessarily convex, consisting of five faces (Fig. 1
                     ). Two faces are triangles, while the remaining three faces are planar quadrilaterals. The lengths of the nine edges are given in the problem formulation. Thus, the problem has twelve constraints: nine lengths of the nine edges, plus three coplanarity conditions of the three quadrilateral faces. Under mild assumptions, this problem is well-constrained modulo an isometry (rigid body motion and symmetry). The pentahedron may be concave and self-intersecting. As an example, two of its triangular faces may intersect each other (Fig. 1).

Why is the pentahedron problem so interesting? First, its statement is simple, but its resolution is difficult. We cannot solve it with computer algebra, even when the distance parameters are instantiated with numeric values. We cannot solve it with Cayley–Menger determinants or their generalizations  [8–10], though the pentahedron problem seems very close to the octahedron problem (also named the Stewart platform) as both polyhedra have six vertices, and Cayley–Menger determinants give an elegant solution to the octahedron problem.

The pentahedron problem is even unsolvable with the reparameterization method proposed by Gao et al.  [11] to solve many 3D simple problems similar to the pentahedron problem. In their work, Gao et al. detected or introduced one key unknown 
                        u
                      (an angle or a length) and expressed all the other unknowns of the problem as a function of 
                        u
                     . By construction, all the constraints of the problem, except one constraint called the ignored constraint, are satisfied. Therefore, it remains to only vary the key unknown 
                        u
                     , i.e., to plot or sample a curve parameterized by 
                        u
                     , and to detect when the ignored constraint is satisfied. Unfortunately, despite the apparent simplicity of the pentahedron, two key unknowns are needed to solve this problem.

The first reason behind our focus on the study of the pentahedron problem in this paper is that the latter has not yet been solved. To the best of our knowledge, no work in the literature has focused on this problem, though a recent Ph.D. thesis made an allusion to it  [12]. The main contribution of our paper is the first method of resolution of the pentahedron which exploits a geometric property of the 3D pentahedron. This permits to drastically reduce the number of unknowns and equations of the problem. At the end, we obtain a system of only three equations in three unknowns, that is much smaller than the naive version of twelve equations in twelve unknowns, and which is easily solvable with either a wide range of interval solvers, or with homotopic solvers. Our experiments showed that the interval analysis library ALIAS-C++  [13] achieved a performance gain of 
                        ×
                        42
                      for the reduced pentahedron formulation, compared to the naive one.

A second reason making the pentahedron problem very interesting is the structure of its solutions, which is unexpectedly rich. Up to an isometry, this problem admits three finite sets of solutions: (1) a first set of 3D generic solutions, (2) a finite set of 3D special solutions where three edges are parallel, and (3) a set of 2D solutions.

A third reason motivating our work is the opportunity given by this problem for studying some interesting issues on a simple but non-trivial problem. We only mention the following important issue: what are the rigidity or the flexibility conditions for the pentahedron problem? This issue is essential in many domains such as robotics and constitutes a challenge for computer algebra. Remember that the pentahedron, or any constrained object, is flexible when it can be continuously deformed, while fulfilling at the same time all the problem constraints during its deformation. For instance, it can be easily seen that when the two triangular faces of the pentahedron have equal lengths 
                        a
                     , 
                        b
                     , and 
                        c
                     , and the three edges linking these two faces have the same length 
                        h
                     , i.e., the three quadrilateral faces are parallelepipeds, then the pentahedron is flexible. More precisely, it has three degrees of freedom. For all possible directions of a 3D line, there exists a pentahedron solution, such that the equal-length edges of this pentahedron are oriented the same as that 3D line. It is easy to compute the degree of flexibility of a given pentahedron by simply computing the rank and co-rank of its Jacobian. However, computing the general algebraic conditions for flexibility or rigidity is a hard problem.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section  2 describes the classical formulation of the pentahedron problem, which results in a system of twelve equations in twelve unknowns. Section  3 presents our new and reduced formulation of the pentahedron problem that yields a systems of three equations in three unknowns, and compares the performance of the interval solver ALIAS-C++ on the two formulations. In Section  4, we show that for a generic set of length parameters, the corresponding pentahedron problem admits almost all the time solutions in the form of 3D pentahedra with parallel edges, and we provide a geometric construction for them. In Section  5, we consider planar solutions to the pentahedron problem. In Section  6, we discuss the degenerate case of 3D simple pentahedra and provide a solution for this configuration. Finally, in Section  7, we study how the interesting properties of the pentahedron problem and the proposed resolution method can extend or not to other simple polyhedra.

A GCSP is composed of a set of geometric objects, whose placement must fulfill a set of geometric constraints. The 3D pentahedron problem is composed of six points:

In the literature, the pentahedron is defined, modulo an isometry, by twelve constraints: nine distances between all the pairs of adjacent points

                      by their fixed values in Eq. (1), is well-constrained and has a finite number of solutions, under mild assumptions. Though correct, the well-constrained system derived from Eq. (1) is awkward. First, it is too big to be solved with interval solvers. It does not exploit geometric properties of the pentahedron. Also, it may have spurious roots, where all the pentahedron vertices are coplanar. Indeed, let us consider this problem in 2D (planar pentahedron). For this configuration, the three planarity constraints disappear and only nine 2D point to point distance constraints remain. It turns out that this system is well-constrained, as it is well known from rigidity theory (Appendix C) and Laman’s theorem (Appendix B) that

                     . In consequence, this 2D problem is well-constrained, so spurious roots are of finite number. To get rid of such spurious system roots and also to considerably reduce the system complexity, we propose in the next section a new formulation of the pentahedron problem.

One main observation about the well-constrained pentahedron system of twelve unknowns given by the classical formulation is that it misses an essential property, which is specific to non-degenerate solutions. This property consists in the fact that the three supporting lines of the pentahedron edges 
                           A
                           D

                           B

                        , and 
                           F
                           G
                         must be either concurrent or parallel. Indeed, the supporting planes

                         results in a well-constrained system of three equations in three unknowns

                        . This new algebraic system is much smaller than the classical one of Eq. (1). Moreover, the new system has no spurious root. Another advantage of our formulation consists in the avoidance of placement rules which are necessary in the original formulation to make the system well-constrained.

Finally, the solutions of the original system can be easily derived from the solutions

Regarding the new algebraic system of Eq. (3), we could not find a closed form solution, but this is not critical as this system can be efficiently solved by interval solvers.

For simplicity, we only considered the convex pentahedron case, where its points are ordered as 
                           I
                           D

                           A

@&#EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS@&#

We implemented the two pentahedron formulations in C++. We used ALIAS-C++ interval analysis library  [13] for solving the underlying algebraic systems of non-linear equations. Due to space limitations, we present only a subset of our experimentations, by providing a summary of our performance comparisons, without detailing other aspects. For the same reason, we also omit the presentation of other benchmarks performed with other interval solvers. Our results have been obtained on a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 computer, equipped with 16 GB of RAM, and running a 32 bits Linux version, with g++ 4.8.1.

In the current experiments, we used the general purpose interval solver of ALIAS-C++, which is implemented in the function Solve_General_int(). Other solving techniques that make use of the Jacobi and Hessian of the equations system are provided by ALIAS-C++ [17].

First of all, we shall note that on a sample of randomly generated 3D pentahedra systems, the general purpose solver of ALIAS-C++ failed to solve the twelve equations of the classical formulation, because of the high memory requirements of the default full bisection strategy combined with the number of unknowns that exceeds ten. When using a single bisection strategy, the average running time is 353.32 s. With the same systems sample and considering our new formulation of three equations, the general solver successfully computed all the solutions in an average time of 11.44 s with the full bisection method, which shows an advantage of our formulation that makes it more practical because it is smaller. When using single bisection, the running time dropped to 8.43 s, which represents a performance gain of 
                           ×
                           41.91
                         over classical formulation. Several experiments revealed that when decreasing the number of maximal boxes or 
                           n
                           D
                         intervals to be used with ALIAS-C++, our formulation is still solvable until a reasonable number, while the classical formulation becomes quickly unfeasible for the same number of boxes, thus revealing the memory footprint improvements of our formulation.

In this section, we consider 3D “parallel pentahedra”, where the 3 edges 
                        A
                        D
                        ,
                        B
                        E
                     , and 
                        C
                        F
                      (joining a vertex from each of the two triangular pentahedron faces 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      and 
                        D
                        E
                        F
                     ) are parallel.

Surprisingly, 3D parallel pentahedra do exist almost all the time as solutions of any given parameters of the pentahedron problem. The geometric construction which follows is a constructive proof of our claim. This geometric construction fails only when a triangular inequality or a tetrahedric inequality (cf. Appendix A) is violated.

For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the construction of a convex 3D pentahedron, where the vectors

                              ⃗
                           
                        
                        ,

                              E
                           
                           
                              ⃗
                           
                        
                        ,
                        
                           
                              C
                              F
                           
                           
                              ⃗
                           
                        
                      are parallel (Fig. 5
                     ). W.l.o.g., let us suppose that after some permutations, 
                        A
                        D
                      is the shortest edge and that 
                        C
                        F
                      is the longest one. Let us also assume that triangle 
                        A
                        B
                        C

                        x
                        y
                      and that points 
                        D
                        E
                        F
                      are located above triangle 
                        A
                        B
                        C

                        C
                      are already fixed through the three points placement rule.

                      so that edge

                        C
                      (Fig. 5). Consider the triangle 
                        E
                        F

This geometric construction consists a constructive proof of the existence of 3D parallel pentahedra as solutions for any given set of input parameters of the pentahedron problem. It may fail when either some triangular faces of the pentahedron are unrealizable or tetrahedron 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                        
                           
                              E
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                      is unrealizable (Appendix A).

To ease understanding, we supposed that the 3D parallel pentahedron is convex. In fact, the previous construction is also valid for concave parallel pentahedra. The difference in this case is that after performing the aforementioned translation, the two triangles 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      and 
                        D
                        E
                        F
                      intersect each other. This observation enables us to count the maximum number of such parallel pentahedra as follows: each of the respective points 
                        D
                        E
                        F
                      is either below or above the corresponding point 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     . Therefore, there exists at most eight distinct pentahedra with parallel edges. Moreover, there are two symmetric ways for embedding the triangle 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      in the plane 
                        O
                        x
                        y
                     . These two ways are symmetric and generically distinct. In conclusion, there exists at most sixteen parallel pentahedra for a given set of the lengths of the pentahedron edges.

This section considers the planar pentahedron. It turns out that all pentahedron problems have a finite number of degenerate solutions, which are planar pentahedra.

An important distinction of the 2D pentahedra case from the 3D counterpart is that for planar 2D pentahedra, edges 
                        A
                        D
                        ,
                        B
                        E
                        ,
                        C
                        F
                      are not necessarily concurrent nor parallel. This can be seen from Figs. 7–9 which illustrate three solutions of the same planar pentahedron problem with parameters

                        B
                        C

                        D
                        E
                        F
                      is counterclockwise oriented in Figs. 7 and 8, and clockwise oriented in Fig. 9. Of course, three other solutions may be obtained by symmetry.

There is a finite number of degenerate flat (planar) solutions to every 3D pentahedron problem because the flat pentahedron is a well-constrained 2D problem modulo an isometry, according to Laman’s theorem Appendix B.

The pentahedron problem has been studied and solved in Merlet’s book “Parallel Robots”  [18]: after fixing an orientation for one of the two triangles, say 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     , the pentahedron problem is equivalent to a planar 3-RPR robot assembly problem, so it is reduced to the numerical resolution of some sixth degree univariate algebraic equation. This solution is optimal, because some problems admit six distinct (real) solutions. These solutions are in bijection with the intersection points of a sextic curve (a coupler curve) and a circle. This sextic curve is illustrated in Fig. 6

                        C
                      is fixed in the plane. It is the empty triangle in the figure. An orientation for the second triangle 
                        D

                        E
                        F

To conclude this section, we can say that there is no degenerate 1D solution and no 0D solution for the pentahedron problem, when considering generic values of the length parameters.

A simple pentahedron, as illustrated in Fig. 10
                     , is obtained from a generic pentahedron by merging the two vertices of any edge incident to two quadrilateral faces, e.g.,  
                        A
                        =
                        D
                     . It still has five faces as the generic pentahedron, but only one of them is quadrilateral, while the remaining four are triangular. In contrast to the generic pentahedron composed of six vertices, the simple pentahedron has five vertices and degenerates to a pyramid with a quadrilateral base face and an apex, e.g., face 
                        B
                        C
                        F
                        E
                      and apex 
                        A
                      in Fig. 10.

The simple pentahedron problem can be reduced to solving a system of two equations in two unknowns 
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                     , as all the distances between the five vertices are known, except 
                        x
                        =
                        B
                        F
                      and 
                        y

                        B

                     ) determined by the lengths of their edges.

An important reason motivating the study of the pentahedron problem is the hope to generalize the discovered properties and the developed methods to other geometric problems.

In this section, we show that the existence of degenerate solutions also holds for other geometric problems. Better, we also show that some well-constrained, modulo an isometry, geometric 3D problems admit a continuum of degenerate 2D solutions.

First, let us consider the hexahedron problem. Our choice is natural because the hexahedron has one more face than the pentahedron. Some typical hexahedra are depicted in Fig. 11
                        . A hexahedron has eight vertices, six planar quadrilateral faces, and twelve edges. The platonic cube is a particular hexahedron. The hexahedron is specified by the lengths of its twelve edges and the planarity of its six quadrilateral faces. For generic lengths, there exist a finite number of 3D solutions (3D hexahedra). The eight vertices are represented by 
                           8
                           ×
                           3
                           =
                           24
                         Cartesian coordinates, six of which can be arbitrarily fixed by the three points placement rule already employed in the pentahedron case. Therefore, we are left with eighteen degrees of freedom and eighteen constraints (twelve lengths and six coplanarity constraints). The previous argument, which generalizes Laman’s theorem, is not a proof, but only a hint which permits to understand the rigidity of the 3D hexahedron under mild assumptions (roughly speaking, the genericity of the lengths of the twelve edges). Remark that the platonic cube is not rigid, as its square faces can be continuously deformed and still satisfy all the constraints. Parallelepipeds represent another example of non-rigid 3D hexahedra, where the faces are parallelograms which can be smoothly deformed without violating any constraint.

We have seen that the pentahedron problem admits a finite set of degenerate 2D pentahedra. What happens for the hexahedron? We will show that each hexahedron problem often admits a continuum of degenerate 2D solutions and that this set of solutions has dimension one. For this purpose, we will use Laman’s theorem  [14] (Appendix B). When taken as a 2D problem, the flat hexahedron has eight vertices, twelve edges, but only twelve lengths constraints, as the six coplanarity constraints become useless in 2D. If the twelve lengths were generic, then Laman’s theorem applies and for the hexahedron to be rigid, 
                           2
                           ×
                           8
                           −
                           3
                           =
                           13
                         distance constraints are needed. However, we only have twelve constraints, so the system has one degree of freedom. According to Laman’s theorem, it remains to check that no subset of 
                           
                              
                                 n

                           <
                           12
                         vertices is over-constrained by more than 
                           2
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                           −
                           3
                         distance constraints.

Now, consider the dodecahedron problem. Remember that the 3D platonic dodecahedron is composed of twelve pentagonal planar faces, twenty vertices, and thirty edges. The irregular dodecahedron is also called a pyritohedron. In 3D, the pyritohedron problem has 
                           3
                           ×
                           20
                           −
                           6
                           =
                           54
                         degrees of freedom or unknowns (3 times the number of vertices minus 6 parameters needed to describe the position and orientation), which are subject to fifty four constraints, thirty of which are distance constraints, and twenty four constraints representing the coplanarities of its twelve pentagonal faces (each coplanarity of five points is equivalent to two coplanarities of four points). The previously employed argument indicates that under mild assumptions, such as the genericity of its lengths, 3D pyritohedra should be rigid. When the pyritohedron is taken as a 2D problem, the twenty four coplanarity constraints are useless, and only thirty distance constraints for the twenty vertices are considered. By Laman’s theorem, 
                           2
                           ×
                           20
                           −
                           3
                           =
                           37
                         generic distance constraints are needed to rigidify the 2D pyritohedron. Seven constraints are missing, so we expect a continuum of flat pyritohedra with topological dimension seven as the set of solutions.

Let us consider the icosahedron problem. First, the 3D icosahedron has twelve vertices, twenty triangular faces, and thirty edges. Using usual mild assumptions and hints, the 3D icosahedron problem is rigid, as it has 
                           12
                           ×
                           3
                           −
                           6
                           =
                           30
                         degrees of freedom subject to thirty distance constraints. No coplanarity constraint is present, even in the 3D configuration. Seen as a 2D problem, the icosahedron has 
                           12
                           ×
                           2
                           −
                           3
                           =
                           21
                         degrees of freedom governed by thirty distance constraints. Therefore, the 2D icosahedron problem is over-constrained and in general, there is no flat solution for it.

Let us focus on the octahedron problem. The 3D octahedron has six vertices, eight triangular faces, and twelve edges. In 3D, the octahedron is composed of 
                           3
                           ×
                           6
                           −
                           6
                           =
                           12
                         degrees of freedom and twelve distance constraints. It is rigid in generic cases. Seen as a 2D problem, the octahedron has 
                           2
                           ×
                           6
                           −
                           3
                           =
                           9
                         degrees of freedom and twelve distance constraints. In consequence, the 2D octahedron problem is over-constrained and in general, there is no flat solution for the octahedron problem.

The reader can check that the tetrahedron problem is rigid in 3D and has one degree of over-constrainedness in 2D.

The previously discussed results are summarized in Table 1
                        , where 
                           V
                           ,
                           E
                        , and 
                           F
                         refer to the respective numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. The column named DoF indicates the degrees of freedom of each 2D problem, which are equal to 
                           2
                           V
                           −
                           3
                        , while the column named DoR provides the degrees of restriction, which are equal to 
                           E
                        . Finally, the status of these geometric problems is indicated in the last column as either well-constrained (a finite number of degenerate flat solutions), under-constrained (a continuum of solution with the expected topological dimension), or over-constrained (no flat solution), according to the value of DoF minus DoR, which equals 
                           2
                           V
                           −
                           3
                           −
                           E
                        .

The presence of a continuum of flat solutions has important bad consequences, especially for interval solvers. In other words, if nothing is done to remove such spurious solutions, then interval solvers will cover the continuums of solutions with an exponential number of small residual boxes. A box is said residual if it is not possible to prove that it contains no root, and impossible to prove that it contains only one regular root (the Jacobian has full rank at a regular root). We have already seen that, for the hexahedron problem, the dimension of the continuum is 1, and that for the dodecahedron, the dimension of the continuum is 7. Clearly, interval solvers cannot be used for the dodecahedron problem. We have performed several experiments with some interval solvers for the hexahedron problem, and observed that they are terribly slow. These experiments consolidate our theoretical discussion and this slowness can now be understood as previously discussed. Avoiding degenerate solutions is still an open question. The current work does not solve this problem, but at least it allows to detect the existence of degenerate solutions.

Unfortunately, we do not know how to extend the method proposed in this paper (for solving the pentahedron) to the polyhedron following it in terms of complexity, i.e., to the hexahedron. We observed that the 3D hexahedron can be seen as the difference between two pentahedra, i.e., the Boolean difference between a pentahedron and another one resulting from the first pentahedron by cutting both its triangular faces by one plane. We also observed that, if the vertices of two opposite hexahedron faces are named

                        . Unfortunately, these properties which generalize those of the pentahedron, do not seem to help for solving the 3D hexahedron, i.e., they do not induce a small size algebraic system.

A method which may be able to solve both the pentahedron and the hexahedron problems is an extension of the reparameterization method, first proposed by Gao et al. in their seminal paper  [11]. These authors have shown that several simple 3D problems can be solved by expressing all the unknowns of the problem as some implicit function of an unknown called a parameter. A system 
                           S

                           =
                           0
                         is reformulated as 
                           X
                           =
                           F
                           
                              (
                              u
                              )
                           
                           ,

                              )
                           
                           =
                           0
                        . By construction, 
                           X
                           =
                           F
                           
                              (
                              u
                              )
                           
                         satisfies all the constraints except one. The curve 
                           
                              (
                              u
                              ,
                              F

                                 u
                                 )
                              
                              )
                           
                         is either plotted or sampled and the values of 
                           u
                         for which 
                           g
                         vanishes or changes sign are detected. Then, some Newton iterations are used to polish the found root for parameter 
                           u
                        . The drawback of this method is that it does not apply when more than one parameter is involved, which is unfortunately the case of the pentahedron problem, where two parameters are needed. More precisely, we could not find a pentahedron solution with only one parameter. The same applies for the hexahedron, where three parameters are needed.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work we focused on the pentahedron problem which constitutes the simplest non-trivial GCSP that can be found in the literature. This problem is hard to solve for interval solvers, when considering its naive algebraic formulation of twelve equations in twelve unknowns, obtained after using a three points placement rule in 3D to resolve the original under-constrained formulation of twelve equations in eighteen unknowns. By harnessing Desargues’ theorem, we proposed a new reduced formulation for the pentahedron problem. We showed that the pentahedron admits unexpected solutions and that this property may extend to other GCSPs as well. The existence of solution manifolds with positive dimensions in the case of more complex polyhedra makes interval solvers unusable on such problems. In the current work, we failed to extend our method to the polyhedron following the pentahedron in terms of complexity: the hexahedron. Focusing on the hexahedron constitutes the continuation of this work and a future challenge.

                     , which is a variant of the classical Heron’s formula. So the condition 
                        
                           
                              V

                        0
                      is clearly equivalent to the triangular inequalities.

Clearly, if

This formula is credited to Piero della Francesca. It is not factorizable, as well as Cayley–Menger expressions for dimensions higher than three.

Clearly, if the volume of a tetrahedron is zero, then its Cayley–Menger determinant vanishes, and its four vertices are coplanar.

A tetrahedron is realizable in 
                        
                           
                              R

                      if and only if the square of its volume is non-negative, and its four triangles are realizable, i.e., their square areas are also non-negative.

Note that unrealizable tetrahedra composed of four triangular realizable faces do exist. For instance, when one face is an equilateral triangle with edge length

                     , while the remaining three edges of the tetrahedron have equal lengths greater than 
                        
                           
                              3

Laman’s theorem  [14] states that a 2D figure with 
                        n
                      vertices is rigid, i.e., well-constrained modulo isometry, if and only if it comprises

                      distance constraints. Here, “generic” means that the values of the distances are algebraically independent. This strong Laman’s condition of genericity may be weakened and made more practical as follows: “from the implicit function theorem, there exists some open ball centered at strongly generic parameter values, within which Laman’s theorem still holds”.

Laman’s theorem is often extended to 3D in a convenient but undue way, by replacing 
                        2
                        n
                        −
                        3
                      with 
                        3
                        n
                        −
                        6
                     . This only gives a rule of thumb or a weak characterization, used by combinatorial methods to decompose systems of constraints  [19]. A simple counterexample is given by the famous double banana in  [20,19]. Until now, the exact combinatorial characterization of rigidity in 3D and beyond is unknown, even in the simplest case where all the involved constraints are generic point to point distances.

Laman’s theorem is also usually extended to other kinds of constraints in 2D. Again, this extension is only a rule of thumb. It is invalidated by simple counterexamples. For instance, a triangle is well-constrained by its three lengths, but not by its three angles, although the latter is correct in spherical geometry.

Convex polyhedra satisfy Euler, or Euler–Poincaré, formula

                        F
                      are the respective numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron. Moreover, every platonic solid has the same number 
                        v
                      of vertices per face, which is given by the equation 
                        v
                        F
                        =

More generally, Gluck’s theorem  [20,21] proves that almost all Eulerian polyhedra are rigid, i.e., flexible polyhedra are rare. Raoul Bricard discovered and classified flexible octahedra and showed that they are all self-intersecting. Robert Connelly discovered the first flexible concave Eulerian polyhedron  [21].

The property used for the pentahedron is Desargues’ theorem  [15,16], which is the topic of this appendix. Let us first provide a formulation of Desargues’ theorem in 3D. Consider five planes 
                        1
                        ,
                        2
                        ,
                        3
                        ,
                        4
                     , and 5 at generic positions in 3D. This configuration implies that there are ten intersection lines between all the possible pairs of planes numbered in a natural way 
                        12
                        ,
                        13
                        ,
                        14
                        ,
                        15
                        ,
                        23
                        ,
                        24
                        ,
                        25
                        ,
                        34
                        ,
                        35
                     , and 45 (
                        a
                        b
                      refers to the intersection of planes 
                        a
                      and 
                        b
                     ), and ten intersection points between all the possible triple of planes 
                        123
                        ,
                        124
                        ,
                        125
                        ,
                        134
                        ,
                        135
                        ,
                        145
                        ,
                        234
                        ,
                        235
                     , 245, and 345. Each intersection line contains three points. For instance line 13 contains points 
                        123
                        ,
                        134
                     , and 135. The proof is straightforward.

The second formulation is often preferred. It holds in both 2D and 3D. Let 
                        a
                        b
                        c
                      and 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      be two perspective triangles. It follows that there exists a point 
                        E
                      (eye) so that 
                        E
                        a
                        A
                     , 
                        E
                        b
                        B
                     , and 
                        E
                        c
                        C
                      are collinear. Then, the homologous sides of triangles 
                        a
                        b
                        c
                      and 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      meet at three collinear points (possibly at infinity), i.e.,  
                        a
                        b
                        ∩
                        A
                        B
                     , 
                        b
                        c
                        ∩
                        B
                        C
                     , 
                        c
                        a
                        ∩
                        C
                        A
                      are collinear. In fact, in 3D, these sides lie on the intersection line of the planes 
                        a
                        b
                        c
                      and 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     , so we are dealing with the geometric configuration of five planes: 
                        a
                        b
                        c
                     , 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     , 
                        E
                        a
                        b
                        A
                        B
                     , 
                        E
                        b
                        c
                        B
                        C
                     , and 
                        E
                        c
                        a
                        C
                        A
                     . Desargues’ theorem also holds in 2D.
