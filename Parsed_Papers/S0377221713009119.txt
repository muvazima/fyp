                  Minimizing two different upper bounds of the matrix which generates search directions of the nonlinear conjugate gradient method proposed by Dai and Liao, two modified conjugate gradient methods are proposed. Under proper conditions, it is briefly shown that the methods are globally convergent when the line search fulfills the strong Wolfe conditions. Numerical comparisons between the implementations of the proposed methods and the conjugate gradient methods proposed by Hager and Zhang, and Dai and Kou, are made on a set of unconstrained optimization test problems of the CUTEr collection. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methods in the sense of the performance profile introduced by Dolan and Moré.

Conjugate gradient (CG) methods comprise a class of unconstrained optimization algorithms characterized by low memory requirements and strong global convergence properties (Dai et al., 1999) which made them popular for engineers and mathematicians engaged in solving large-scale problems in the following form:

Different choices for the CG parameter lead to different CG methods (Hager & Zhang, 2006b). Based on an extended conjugacy condition, one of the essential CG methods has been proposed by Dai and Liao (2001) (DL), with the following CG parameter:

The approach of Dai and Liao has been paid special attention to by many researches. In several efforts, modified secant equations have been applied to make modifications on the DL method. For example, Yabe and Takano (2004) used the modified secant equation proposed by Zhang, Deng, and Chen (1999). Also, Zhou and Zhang (2006) applied the modified secant equation proposed by Li and Fukushima (2001). Li, Tang, and Wei (2007) used the modified secant equation proposed by Wei, Li, and Qi (2006). Ford, Narushima, and Yabe (2008) employed the multi-step quasi-Newton equations proposed by Ford and Moghrabi (1994). Babaie-Kafaki, Ghanbari, and Mahdavi-Amiri (2010) applied a revised form of the modified secant equation proposed by Zhang et al. (1999) and the modified secant equation proposed by Yuan (1991). Furthermore, in several other attempts, the modified versions of

                                 DL
                              
                           
                        
                      suggested in (Babaie-Kafaki et al., 2010; Ford et al., 2008; Li et al., 2007; Yabe & Takano, 2004; Zhou & Zhang, 2006) have been used to achieve descent CG methods. Examples include the studies made by Narushima and Yabe (2012), Sugiki, Narushima, and Yabe (2012), and Livieris and Pintelas (2012).

Here, based on a singular value study on the DL method, two nonlinear CG methods are proposed. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2, the methods are suggested and their global convergence analysis is discussed. In Section 3, they are numerically compared with the CG methods proposed by Hager and Zhang, and Dai and Kou, and comparative testing results are reported. Finally, conclusions are made in Section 4.

Based on Perry’s point of view (Perry, 1976), it is notable that from (1.2) and (1.5), search directions of the DL method can be written as:

It is remarkable that numerical performance of the DL method is very dependent on the parameter t for which there is no any optimal choice (Andrei, 2011). Motivated by this, here, based on a singular value study, two upper bounds for the condition number of the matrix

                      are obtained and then, two optimal values for the parameter t are suggested. Now, we briefly discuss the singular value decomposition (SVD). For a more detailed discussion, see (Watkins, 2002, chap. 4).

                     is called the condition number of A. The matrix A with a large condition number is called an ill-conditioned matrix since the computations related to this matrix are potentially very sensitive to changes in the other data. Here, the following theorem is needed.

The codes were run on a computer with 3.2gigahertz of CPU, 1gigabytes of RAM and Centos 6.2 server Linux operation system. Furthermore, the experiments were performed on a set of 145 unconstrained optimization test problems of the CUTEr collection (Gould, Orban, & Toint, 2003), with default dimensions as given in Hager’s home page: ‘http://www.math.ufl.edu/∼hager/’, in which the C++ code of CG_Descent version 5.3 is also available freely. The test problems data have been clarified in Table 1
                     .

For the methods of M1, M2, HZ, DK and DK+, similar to the CG_Descent algorithm, we used the approximate Wolfe conditions proposed by Hager and Zhang (2005) in the line search procedure, with the same parameter values as considered in CG_Descent version 5.3. Although the descent property may not always hold for the methods of M1 and M2, uphill search direction seldom occurred in our experiments; when encountering, we restarted the algorithm with

The CG_Descent algorithm successfully solved all the test problems while the methods of M1, M2, HZ, DK and DK+ solved 144 out of 145 test problems. More exactly, these five methods failed to solve the VIBRBEAM function because of jamming, i.e. generating many short steps without making significant progress to the solution. Although these failures may cause the methods of M1, M2, HZ, DK and DK+ to seem slightly unpromising, it is interesting that for the VIBRBEAM function the CG_Descent algorithm achieved a solution with cost (objective function value) 5.19E+00 and precision (gradient infinite-norm) 9.47E−07, while the methods of M1, M2, HZ, DK and DK+ achieved five different solutions respectively with costs 4.63E+00, 2.72E+00, 1.75E+00, 1.56E−01, and 3.32E−01, and precisions 1.35E−05, 2.90E−05, 2.88E−05, 9.68E−05, and 1.20E−04. That is, with respect to the objective function value, for VIBRBEAM the methods of M1, M2, HZ, and in particular DK and DK+ achieved better solutions in contrast to the CG_Descent algorithm.

As shown by Fig. 1, in the perspective of the total number of function and gradient evaluations, M1 outperforms M2, HZ and DK while M2 slightly outperforms HZ, and HZ is slightly preferable to DK. Also, with respect to the CPU time, Fig. 2 shows that M1 is preferable to M2 and these two methods are top performer versus the methods of HZ and DK which are approximately competitive. Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows that with respect to the total number of function and gradient evaluations, M1 is often preferable to M2, CG_Descent and DK+ while DK+ slightly outperforms CG_Descent which is often preferable to M2. Also, with respect to the CPU time, Fig. 4 shows that M1 outperforms M2 while M2 and DK+ are approximately competitive and these two methods are often preferable to CG_Descent.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on a singular value study on the matrix which generates the search directions of the Dai–Liao nonlinear conjugate gradient method, two modified conjugate gradient methods have been suggested. Global convergence of the methods has been briefly discussed. Numerical comparisons have been made between the implementations of the proposed methods, and the conjugate gradient methods proposed by Hager and Zhang, and Dai and Kou, on a set of 145 unconstrained optimization test problems of the CUTEr collection. The results showed the efficiency of the proposed methods in the sense of the performance profile introduced by Dolan and Moré.
