                  Advanced medical diagnosing and research requires precise information which can be obtained from measured electrophysiological data, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiograph (ECG). However, they are often contaminated with noise and a variety of bioelectric signals called artefacts, e.g., electromyography (EMG). These noise and artefacts which need to be reduced make it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal physiological activity. Electromagnetic contamination of recorded signals represents a major source of noise in electrophysiology and impairs the use of recordings for research. In this paper we present an effective method for cancelling 50Hz (or 60Hz) interference using a radial basis function (RBF) Wiener hybrid filter. One of the main points of this paper is the hybridization of the RBF filter and a Wiener filter to make full use of both merits. The effectiveness and validity of those filters are verified by applying them to ECG and EEG recordings. The results show that the proposed method is able to reduce powerline interference (PLI) from the noisy ECG and EEG signals more accurately and consistently in comparison to some of the state of-the-art methods and this method can be efficiently used with very low signal-to-noise ratios, while preserving original signal waveform.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Noise reduction is a matter of considerable importance in biomedical signal processing applications, especially electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiograms (ECGs) analysis [1,2]. Non-cortical biological artefacts are the principal source of contamination in EEG recordings and they are generated primarily by movements, cardiac pulse, and muscle activity, particularly that of the face (especially the jaw) and neck. EEG experimental design is generally constrained by the desire to minimise the effect of these artefacts.

One useful categorization of artefacts is based on their origin: physiological (e.g., muscle and baseline noise) or technical, such as environmental interference caused by 50 or 60Hz power-supply lines, radiation from lights, and radio frequency emissions from nearby medical devices. This categorization is also applicable to other bioelectrical signals.

On the other hand, powerline interference (PLI) coupled to signal carrying cables is particularly troublesome in medical equipment such as ECGs and EEGs. Cables carrying ECG and EEG signals from the examination room to the monitoring equipment are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) of power frequency (50Hz or 60Hz) by ubiquitous supply lines and plugs so much so that sometimes the ECG and EEG recordings is totally masked by this type of noise. Filtering such PLI signal is a challenging problem given that the frequency of the time-varying powerline signal lies within the frequency range of the ECG and EEG signals [1,2].

As mentioned above, PLI is a significant source of noise during bio-potential measurements [1,2]. EMI degrades the signal quality and overwhelms tiny features that may be critical for clinical monitoring and diagnosis, and it can strongly distort biopotentials. Numerous biomedical signals, such as ECG and EEG, contain distinct features in the time-domain analysis. There are diverse techniques for minimizing the appearance of unwanted interference, such as interference rejection of preamplified electrodes by automated gain adaptation [3]; subtraction procedure (SP) [4]; a Kalman filter (KF) [5]; PLI reduction based on S-transform [6], noise filtering using wavelets [7,8] and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [9]. Another well-known method for cancelling the 50/60-Hz interference is using a notch 50/60-Hz filter [10,11]. The notch filter (NF) has two main traits. On the one hand, is able to reject a 50/60-Hz narrow frequency and, on the other, can maintain the remaining spectrum without hardly any change. However, this solution is not robust under frequency variations of the interfering signal, which happens unavoidably within a low-quality environment [12]. Therefore, although this solution is easy to be implemented at low cost, it produces undesirable signal distortion and cannot eliminate completely the interference [12]. Another method that is potentially capable of reducing the 50/60-Hz ECG interference is an adaptive filter (AF) [13–15]. This system is based on an adaptive filter that has the capability of automatically adjusting its parameters to obtain the best performance under a variable interference [1,2].

Radial basis function (RBFs) neural networks as a kind of powerful kernel methods have been applied to many areas with success [16–19]. The theoretical analysis of RBF structures and algorithms includes the orthogonal least square algorithm, the approximation capability analysis [17,18,20], the design of RBF structure using fuzzy clustering method, the optimization of RBF structure using kernel orthonormalization method or combined supervised and unsupervised learning method, and the use of Fisher separability ratio for the selection of RBF centres. The RBF is selected because of its compact support [17,18,20]. Regarding Wiener filter, it has been implemented with different structures for noise suppression applications as MEG signals, acoustic signals, etc. [21].

In this paper, a new PLI reduction method based on a RBF–Wiener hybrid filter (RBFWF), is proposed. The proposed filter is realized with a least mean square error scheme using higher order statistics of a target signal and a powerline interference. The proposed RBF network has been developed like a hierarchically layered structure. It starts with a small number of RBFs and then adds new RBFs if the approximation error is larger than some predetermined threshold and there is no existing RBF that can efficiently represent the current input. Computer experiments have demonstrated that the developed algorithm can improve the PLI reduction over the systems compared. Furthermore the results have shown that this new method can maintain the original shape of the EEG and ECG signals in very low SNR conditions in which the brain or heart signal is mixed with the noise. Several important advantages have been obtained with this system. Firstly a low distortion of the signal has been caused, clinical information has been maintained, and finally this system could be applied to a wide range of biomedical signals. Experiments with real and synthesized recordings have been discussed, and the results have shown the validity of the proposed method.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the materials used in this study. Section 3, presents our proposed approach. The description of the experiments and the discussion of the results are given in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. Finally, the conclusions of this paper are summarized in Section 6.

In order to check the effectiveness of the proposed denoising algorithm, several experiments with synthesized and real recordings were performed. On the one hand, real ECG signals from Physionet [22], they were composed of the MIT–BIH Noise Stress Test database, PAF Prediction Challenge database, the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm database, MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation database, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, Long-Term ST Database, etc. And, on the other, real EEG signals (Table 1
                     ), they were obtained from Psychiatric and Neurophysiology departments in the hospital Virgen de la Luz in Cuenca (Spain). The electrodes were placed according to the International 10–20 System. EEG data were recorded at 250Hz using Brain Vision with 32 channels. The vertical EOG (VEOG) signal was recorded from the right eye (2.5cm below and above the eyeball); the horizontal EOG (HEOG) signal was recorded from the outer canthus. Reference was located on A2 (right earlobe). Besides, sleep studies were also included. All these signals offered different kinds of noise that was acquired from the hospital recording equipment, such as artefacts, baseline and muscle noise. These signals were therefore filtered to remove such noise when needed [1,2,23].

The synthesized recordings for EEG and ECG were comprised of 100 EEGsignals that lasted 30–60min and 100 ECG signals that lasted 20–60min. 8 sleep testing of approximately eight hours, were also included in this study. Once this process was completed, PLI was sequentially added to the EEG and ECG signals as defined by Eq. (1), where 
                        
                           x
                           (
                           i

                      is the EEG or ECG recording, W is the amplitude of the added noise, and 
                        
                           n
                           (
                           i
                           )
                        
                      is the noise signal. The main aim was to estimate the clean signal 
                        
                           x
                           (
                           i
                           )
                        
                      from the noisy signal 
                        
                           p
                           (
                           i
                           )
                        
                     . In order to have each signal with one different interference, the powerline contamination added to each signal was generated randomly and each signal had a different interference added by a different noise realization.

The PLI was a simulated 50Hz sinusoidal in which the central frequency was randomly varied between 48.5Hz and 51.5Hz with a variation of 3% on its fundamental frequency [1,2]. The amplitude was changed to achieve signals under SNR variation that ranged between 
                        
                           -
                           10
                           
                           dB
                        
                      and 30dB.

Finally, all the signals were classified in three groups. The first group comprised 50% of the signals randomly selected, which were employed to network training. The second group (20%) helped to validate the proper RBF working. Finally, the third group (30%) was used to compare the RBF proposed system with other previously proposed systems deeply accepted by the scientific community.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a type of non-linear processing systems ideally suited to a wide range of tasks, especially those in which there is no existing algorithm for task completion. An ANN consists of a collection of highly interconnected processing elements that transform a set of inputs into a set of desired outputs [16]. The result of the transformation is determined by the characteristics of the elements and the weights associated with the interconnections among them. By modifying the connections between the nodes, the network is able to adapt to the desired outputs. The goal is to choose the weights of the network that achieve a desired input/output relationship, known as training the network [17,18]. RBF neural networks are function approximation models that can be trained by means of examples to implement a desired input–output mapping [16–18]. In fact, RBF models are closely related to function approximation models used to perform interpolation. Under certain mild conditions, RBF neural networks are capable of approximating arbitrarily well any function [17,18].

                        where the terms are the outputs of a RBF filter, and a Wiener filter respectively. Fig. 1 (3 and 4) shows the structures of the RBFWF and a Wiener filter. One of the main points of this paper is the hybridization of the RBFN filter and a linear Wiener filter to make full use of both merits. On one hand, the RBF is selected because of its nonlinearity and compact support [20]. The property of compact support enables much faster network’s training and output evaluation as the complexity of the network and the dimensionality of the input space increase [28]. And on the other hand, Wiener filter is also selected because it is an optimal filter for a Gaussian noise [24].

The synthesis of the proposed RBFWF is also achieved by adjusting the weights

                         similar to the RBF filter.

The proposed method was thoroughly tested and compared with the previously published noise reduction techniques, using the quantitative measures of performance that will be next described.

The interference reduction was computed by comparing the estimated and the original ECG in terms of the cross-correlation (CC) and mean square error (MSE). The cross-correlation index measures the similarities between two signals, and becomes 1 in the case of perfect matching and 0 in the case of completely different and unrelated signals

                        is the power-spectrum between 49 and 51Hz of the signal after power line interference reduction. High positive values of PSR will indicate good performance of the algorithm. Values close to zero are associated with poor performance and negative values indicate reduction errors because the peak spectrum is larger than before.

In this study, the best four RBF models were proposed for PLI reduction of ECG and EEG signals using MATLAB software package. Table 2
                         shows a summary of the structures that were studied. In them the number of neurons in the input layer were modified. The structure 3 get a lower error value. For this reason, this structure was chosen in order to remove PLI. The structure 4 produces a greater error due to over-training of the network which learns too many patterns and thereby increases the error. The structure 1 and 2 are unable to reach an optimum value [16].

On the other hand, the Wiener, RBF and RBFW filters were compared for powerline reduction of EEG and ECG signal. Tables 3 and 4
                        
                         show the test process summary of each method with the proposed systems. As shown in these tables, it can be seen that the RBFWF had a better filtering performance than the other methods. There are some cases with Gaussian noise where the Wiener filter has good behaviour [24]. Because the Wiener filter is an optimal filter for a Gaussian noise. As a consequence, we propose an RBFWF in order to combine the both merits of an RBF filter and a Wiener filter.

As indicated previously and in order to evaluate all the method’s performance, the third group in the database, comprising 30% of the signals, was used. As a guarantee for results, the whole procedure was repeated all over ECG and EEG recordings, where a different PLI

(ii) A PLI suppression framework combining the masking-signal-aided EMD and robust extended KF [5]. (iii) Notch filtering [10,11] in which the polynomial denominator of the IIR transfer function is determined by using an iterative scheme in which optimal pole placements are found by solving a standard quadratic programming problem. For stability, the pole radius in the single notch filter design is specified by the designer, and in the multiple notch filter design, is constrained by using the implications of Rouché’s theorem.

(iv) Adaptive filter (AF) based on notch filter [13–15] where a method for extracting information on the distance between the frequency of the input sinusoid and the zero of the notch was proposed. Five notches, namely, a main notch and four pilot notches were used. The pilot notches were used to analyze the gradient estimates at the same sampling instance but at several frequency points as the main notch. The weight update algorithm was the least mean power algorithm with

                     . The value of r was 0.9. At this point it has to be remarked that the network and the training were unique. In this respect, given that half of the analysed database was used to train the system with all the possible kinds of interference, the RBF is able to give a generalized response that can handle simultaneously the different kind of PLI present in real ECG and EEG recordings.

In order to analyse PLI reduction both in ECG recordings and EEG recordings, the parameters CC, SIR and PSR were calculated. Regarding ECG recordings, the RBFWF-based method was able to improve the results with respect to the other systems, as can be observed in Table 5
                        . The table shows average values ±standard deviation. As can be seen, the RBFWF is able to reach the closest result to 1 in CC. Furthermore, the SIR value achieved by the other methods is lower than the RBFWF. Therefore, the proposed system outperforms the results obtained by the other methods. Spectral correlation has been calculated by means of 8192 points within FFT.

The MSE was computed through Eq. (30) and the obtained results are plotted in Fig. 2
                        . As can be observed, the MSE is minimum for all the systems when the powerline frequency is exactly 50Hz. In the cases of SP, KF, NF, MSE increases notably when the sinusoid wanders its frequency away from 50Hz. In fact, this is the system with the highest error in this case. Regarding AF, the error is more controlled than for SP, KF and NF when the frequency is different from 50Hz. Finally, RBFWF presents the best behaviour, both for 50Hz and for the remaining frequencies. In this case, the MSE is quite small and remains nearly constant even in the case of significant variations of the powerline frequency. Fig. 2 also shows that MSE is larger when the bandwidth is increased for RBFWF and AF. On the contrary, it decreases slightly for NF because a wider bandwidth will overlap with the frequency of 50Hz.

In Fig. 3
                         (1), the results for PLI removal yielded by SP, KF, NF, AF, and the proposed RBFWF, have been represented making use of a real noisy signal with atrial fibrillation. As can be appreciated, the RBFWF strategy is able to follow the original signal very precisely. On the other hand, the AF method overcomes SP, KF and NF systems although AF introduces fluctuations near of QRS complex in the original recording (Fig. 3 (1)). Despite all, these last methods contain some waves which do not appear in the original ECG. Our RBFWF method followed the original signal when the value of that input was low. As can be observed, in Fig. 3 (1) the differences between the analysed methods are clearer in the interval of 5000–7000 samples. In this region RBFWF achieves an accurate noise reduction in comparison with the other methods that continue keeping some perturbations in the ECG signals.

On the other hand, Fig. 3 (2) shows the spectrum for the previous example. As shown, the proposed method obtains the best reduction of power spectrum between 49 and 51Hz and, at the same time, preserve the original signal waveform without distortion, as can be appreciated in that example. The reduction of the power spectrum for AF is bigger than SP, KF and NF but the most accurate decrease is achieved with the RBFWF method.

In the same way as for ECG recordings, the parameters CC, SIR and PSR were also calculated to analyse PLI reduction in EEG recordings. Table 6
                         shows the results of RBFWF-based method with respect to the other systems. As can be observed, our method obtains the closest results to 1 in CC value, and the biggest SIR value in comparison with the other methods. Spectral correlation has been also calculated by means of 8192 points within FFT.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the MSE results and this parameter is again minimum for all systems when the powerline frequency is 50Hz. Besides, this value is larger when the bandwidth is increased for RBFWF and AF. As is the case in EEG recordings, RBFWF presents the best behaviour both for 50Hz and for the remaining frequencies where the MSE is quite small and remains nearly constant even in the case of significant variations of the powerline frequency. AF has an error more controlled than for SP, KF and NF for frequencies different from 50Hz.

On the other hand, although AF method overcomes SP, KF and NF systems, the RBFWF is able to follow the original signal very precisely after PLI reduction as can be observed in Fig. 5
                         (1). As can be seen in Fig. 5 (1), the differences between the analysed methods are clearer again in the interval of 4000–10,000 samples where RBFWF achieves an accurate interference suppression in comparison with the other methods that continue keeping some perturbations in the brain signals.

Therefore, the proposed method obtains again the optimum reduction of power spectrum between 49 and 51Hz and, at the same time, preserve the original signal waveform without distortion, as can be appreciated in Fig. 5 (2). In this figure, the reduction of the power spectrum for AF is again bigger than SP, KF and NF but the most accurate decrease is achieved with the RBFWF method.

EEG techniques such as low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (LORETA) were developed in order to identify brain regions involved in neuro-psychiatric disorders. Since the progression of both neurological and cognitive impairment is slow, general categorization of EEG aberrations may not reach sufficient sensitivity for the detection and localization of abnormalities. EEG tomography allows a detection of dysfunction that is more sensitive than that provided by the common EEG. LORETA also offers new hypotheses on the location of higher cognitive functions in the brain [29]. Taken together, the advantages of LORETA over surface EEG analysis include the ability to visualize anomalies in the deeper brain structures, and to specify anomalies in frequency band and spatial location. LORETA technique has also been used to compare with AF method.

Finally, in order to evaluate the whole performance of the proposed RBFWF, a set of EEGs with all the types of PLI was selected. The AF systems were chosen as a function of their previous performance. Fig. 6
                         plots the interference effect in a EEG segment. The result after applying the LORETA technique is observed on the right. It is difficult to know the lobe in which neuronal activity has been generated. When a filtered AF is applied to this signal, LORETA technique improves and produces a further clarification of brain activity (Fig. 6 (3)) and as can been seen in Fig. 6 (2), NF achieves less accurate PLI reduction. Regarding the proposed method, Fig. 6 (4) shows a complete reduction of PLI producing a clearer images obtained by LORETA technique where the neuronal activity is located in the occipital and temporal lobes.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

During last years, numerous techniques have been proposed to reject PLI in biomedical signals, including SP, KF, NF and AF. However, optimized results have not yet been obtained. These conventional filtering techniques can contain ripples that do not correspond to the original ECG and EEG recordings. In addition, applications of SP, KF and NF are often not able to remove the 50/60Hz noise fully, and its peak persisted in power spectra, although with much lower power. Another disadvantage of SP, KF and NF are that they introduced filtering artefact into the original signal (Figs. 3 and 5) and changes the shape of the original waveform. The AF method is more effective in removing mains interference and its harmonic frequencies than the SP, KF and NF; however it is not remove the interference completely and it caused changes in spectral composition due to the removal of biological signal components. Besides, AF introduces artefacts into the processed signals, a problem that is exacerbated with sudden and fast changes in adaptive filter parameters. In fact, most bioelectric activities contain considerable power near or at the powerline frequency. In this study, a new RBFWF model to reduce PLI in biomedical signals has been proposed. The technique incorporates a RBF network architecture that can add or remove RBFs dynamically depending on the current approximation error. The structure of the RBF network varies over time in order to control the network complexity that is just sufficient for the approximation so that the computational efficiency is ensured. Furthermore, different experiments have demonstrated that RBFWF method maintains the clinical information and achieves an accurate power line reduction without distortion. Taken together, the presented results demonstrate that the proposed RBFWF approach can serve as a new framework for achieving an efficiently filtered biomedical signal which, obviously, could be used for later studies in the best conditions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The elimination of PLI in ECG and EEG signals is a challenging problem by virtue of the fact that the frequency of such PLI may change with time. This paper proposes a RBFWF to tackle this problem. Experimental results of both synthesized and real signals indicate that our robust denoising method can effectively track and suppress the PLI in both ECG and ECG recordings, regardless of the interference level. Furthermore, our system allows correct a large powerline frequency deviation (even up to 3Hz). RBFWF has obtained greater CC, SIR and PSR and lower MSE value than the other methods and RBFWF has provided outperforming results, thus facilitating a more proper clinical analysis for medical professional use. Besides this method has revealed to be an effective enhancement tool in all practical cases which have been studied, keeping clinical information in the brain signal and an excellent performance in mitigating PLI on the ECG and EEG signals is observed. As a way of conclusion, suffice is to say that the RBFWF based approach obtains both more signal reduction and low distortion of the signal results in comparison with the systems based on SP, KF, NF and AF. The system could also be applied to a wide range of biomedical signals with interfering noise of similar characteristics.
