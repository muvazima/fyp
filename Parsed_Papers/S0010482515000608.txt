                  Lymph nodes segmentation is a tedious process with large inter-user variability when performed manually. To facilitate lymph nodes assessment for lung cancer patient, we present an automatic and improved snake segmentation method for thoracic lymph nodes on CT images in this paper. We first investigated the performance of both edge-based and region-based snake algorithms for the segmentation task, using a B-spline contour parameterization. The effect of the number of B-spline control points on the snake performance was also examined. Both edge-based and region-based snakes were found to have their own advantages and disadvantages for lymph nodes segmentation. We further developed a method of region-based snake with edge constraint, which utilizes a self-adjusting mechanism to integrate both edge and region information in a constructive manner. The average Dice Similarity Coefficient obtained was 0.853±0.059 and 0.841±0.108 for the baseline and follow-up lymph nodes respectively using the proposed method. The method was found to be an effective lymph node segmentation method and would potentially be useful to help with treatment response evaluations in the clinical practice.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Lymph nodes assessment is important in clinical practice and drug trials as changes in lymph nodes often indicators of disease progression. In the newly revised RECIST 1.1 [1], uni-dimensional measurement in short axis of enlarged lymph nodes is required for treatment evaluation of cancer patient. Two dimensional (2D) measurement, which takes area into account, could be more revealing on the actual size of the structure. This requires segmentation of the lymph nodes in medical images such as computed tomography (CT) scans. However, manual segmentation is a very tedious process, which suffers from low reproducibility. Computer-aided lymph nodes segmentation tool could be valuable in the clinical practice. Nevertheless, automatic segmentation of lymph nodes is a very challenging problem. First, lymph nodes are very small structures whose boundaries can be obscured due to partial volume effect. Second, they often appear in various size and shape (from bean shape to circular shape and other irregular shapes). Third, they can be located adjacent to structures of similar intensity range, making threshold-based segmentation methods ineffective. Some lymph nodes even share part of the boundary with surrounding tissues. Fourth, high contrast structures such as blood vessels, which have prominent edge profiles, could suppress the expression of lymph node edges and potentially mislead model-driven algorithms based on edge information. Last but not least, central necrosis can occur and further disturb the interior homogeneity of the structure.

Several methods have been proposed to assist study of lymph nodes in CT scans in a semi-automatic or automatic manner. Rogowska et al. [2] in 1997 were the first to evaluate four elementary techniques for lymph nodes segmentation on CT images, namely manual tracing, semi-automatic local criteria threshold selection, Sobel/watershed technique, and interactive deformable contour algorithm. Results from phantom images showed that reliable lymph node segmentation is only possible with the use of model-based knowledge. Honea et al. [3] applied the original parametric snake model on phantom nodes and achieved promising segmentation results using information on both the shape of the object and its image properties in the energy formulation. Honea and Snyder [4] extended the 2D active contour model into three-dimensional active surface model. By deriving surface energy from 3D data and incorporating a balloon force, a single user-chosen point balloon will inflate until the object of interest is found. However, the usefulness of the algorithm on real medical images was not reported. Also based on active contour but in its level set representation, Yan [5] reported using fast marching method on lymph nodes in CT, in which they proposed a speed term which is based on both local image gradient and target region intensity features in dealing with the ‘boundary leaking’ problem. Due to disturbance of image noise, the detected lymph nodes may not be smooth enough and this is a limitation of using level set on structures with smooth boundaries. A stable 3D mass spring model (MSM) [6], which took the characteristic gray value range, directed contour information as well as shape knowledge into consideration, was employed by Dornheim et al. [7] for neck lymph node segmentation in 2007. However, a large number of parameters had to be adjusted carefully to ensure good performance and the varying size of the targeted structures would have a significant impact on the performance of the method. This drawback is partially addressed by Dornheim et al. [8] in another study using a multi-model strategy where each single model is specifically designed for a certain type of lymph nodes. Results improved from the original MSM. However, nodes with weak gradients at the border or deformed shape lead to worse results because of partly obscured border or shape information. The MSM model is further improved by Steger and Erdt [9] in 2010 using a size invariant mass spring model, which is less sensitive to the target structure’s size than its predecessors and achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.72 over 25 lymph nodes in head and neck region from 11 CT datasets. Besides size invariant MSM, Steger et al. [10] proposed another method in 2011 to segment lymph nodes in the same body region. The closed contour is found by minimizing an energy function, which depends on gradients, intensities and shape priors, using dynamic programming. The average DSC improved to 0.81 using the new method. The algorithm is adapted to radiologists’ behavior by including transition areas in intensity cost function. The DSC is further improved to 0.84. However, the method is highly heuristic and needs more investigation to claim for a general purpose.

Considering the above-mentioned challenges, snake model is the most suitable deformable method to accommodate lymph nodes variations in size and shape as well as to combine model-based formulations. In the literature, both Honea [4] and Yan [5] have reported using edge-based active contour for lymph node segmentation. But only results based on phantom images were examined and no quantitative measures were provided. In this paper, we investigated the performance of both edge-based and region-based snake in segmenting lymph nodes of the thoracic region on real CT images. We further developed a strategy to integrate both edge and region information in a constructive manner to improve its performance on lymph nodes segmentation. Section 2.2 explains in detail the implementation of B-spline snake models and the working of the new scheme. Section 3 reports our results. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the findings and draw conclusions.

Retrospective thoracic CT images from 8 lung cancer patients were included in the study, among which 18 pairs of suspicious lymph nodes growing over time were examined at both baseline and follow-up scans. In total, 36 lymph nodes were studied. The image was captured using Siemens Sensation Cardiac 64. Thorax routine protocol with source voltage 120kV, current 125mAs, rotation time 0.5s, slice collimation 16×1.5mm and slice width 5.0mm, was used in the scan. The cross-sectional images were of size 512×512pixel, with a voxel resolution 0.64mm×0.64mm×5mm. These are standard CT images acquired for monitoring lung cancer treatment response. The lymph nodes in the study ranged from 1 to 3cm in size and are of aortic, mediastinal, interlobar and hilar in their respective anatomic locations.

In order to accommodate large variations in lymph nodes’ morphology, snake models are considered to a suitable method for segmenting the structure. Given an image

Because of the smooth boundaries of lymph nodes, we choose the cubic B-spline for contour parameterization, which offers high flexibility, local control and computational efficiency [11]. A B-spline curve is a piecewise polynomial function defined as

An important parameter of B-spline contour is the number of B-spline control points, which corresponds to the same number of B-spline segments for closed contours. Degrees of freedom, which measure the flexibility of the underlying contour and can translate into the ability of delineating structures in finer details, increase with increased number of control points. To study the effect of the number of control points on lymph nodes segmentation and determine an optimal number, the use of various numbers of B-spline control points (ranging from 6 to 24) were examined for both edge-based and region-based snake.

                            is the edge- or gradient-driven energy landscape for snake to evolve. We made use of Canny edge detector, which was found effective in detecting lymph node boundaries [12], to derive partial lymph nodes edges. Distance transform of the edge map was calculated subsequently and used as the external energy to guide snake evolution.

Region-based snake was first proposed by Chan and Vese [13]. It assumes that the image has only two phases present, namely object and background. It attempts to separate the image into two different regions with maximum intensity separation.

Both edge-based and region-based snakes have their own strengths and limitations in their formulations. As pointed out by Munoz [14], the two approaches are not affected in the same way by a problem. The overall performance is expected to improve if we could find a way to integrate edge and region information in a constructive manner. Towards this end, a region-based snake with edge constraint is proposed as shown in 
                           Fig. 1.

Referring to Fig. 1, the contour will evolve using region-based snake formulation on gray level CT images while partial edge map of the lymph node is derived using Canny edge detector (examples of derived edge maps are presented in Fig. 4). The contour grows freely until any segment encounters the partial edges of lymph nodes. A hard constraint is imposed on the movement of those segments of the curve touching the edges. To do so, we make use of the locally controlled property of cubic B-spline curves. Out of the four control points responsible for any curve segment, the two middle control points are identified as principal control points since they have more influence over the curve segment than the other two. Thus the gradients of the two principal control points are set to zeros for that iteration, resulting in no movement of those segments which are in contact with edges of the lymph nodes. As a result, segments of the contour touching the edges will be stopped from growing but anchored at the respective edge locations.

Note that the movement of each control point is only suspended for the current iteration. Whenever evolution of the curve as the result of other free control points releases the previously paused segment of the curve from its anchored edge, the movement of the corresponding control points resumes; otherwise the movement of those control points will remain halted. This self-adjusting mechanism not only ensures the evolution of contour is confined to the inner side of edge segments but also allows the maximal fitting of the contour to the lymph nodes boundaries.

As the iteration continues, the portion of the curve which grows to the edge of the lymph nodes will gradually adapt to the edge profile while the rest of the curve continues to evolve based on region-based formulation. Because the movement of large number of control points could be constrained at each iteration when they come in touch with the edges, the whole curve evolution can become stagnant if the total number of control points is small. Thus, the number of control points used in region-based snake with edge-constraint is set to 18.

Two points across the short axis of the lymph node were used for initialization. Subsequently a circle was obtained by taking the distance between the two points as its diameter. The initial control points were obtained by fitting in least squares with the circle line.

The performance of B-spline snake segmentation was evaluated quantitatively using both the Hausdorff distance, which is a contour distance-based measure, and DSC, which measures the region agreement between manual segmentation and snake segmentation. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used as the statistical test to study the significance in the difference of the results from each segmentation method. Qualitative evaluation of segmentation results on representative nodes is presented as well.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The segmentation results using various numbers of control points (CPs) are compared in 
                        Fig. 2 in terms of average DSC for all the 36 nodes (including both baseline and follow-up). For both edge-based and region-based snake, the results appeared to stay constant with increasing number of control points. Though the average DSC of edge-based snake was higher than that of region-based snake for all numbers of control points used, there could be substantial overlap in their respective DSC range. Take using 6 control points as an example; the average DSC for edge-based formulation was 0.802±0.125 while the average DSC for region-based formulation was 0.741±0.199. And their difference was not statistically significant (p=0.322). Segmentation results with increasing number of control points are depicted in 
                        Fig. 3 for edge-based snake and region-based snake on a representative node. More segmentation results for edge-based and region-based snake are shown in 
                        Fig. 4.

The performance of region-based snake with edge constraint was evaluated and summarized in 
                        Table 1. The average DSC reached as high as 0.853±0.058 and 0.841±0.108 for the baseline and follow-up nodes, respectively. Comparing the performance of our proposed region-based snake with edge constraint with either edge-based or region-based snake (both using 6 control points), the improvement was highly significant with p-value of 0.011 and 0.001, respectively. Fig. 4 compares the segmentation results from the three snake methods on various lymph nodes qualitatively.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The average DSC stayed almost constant with increasing number of control points for both edge-based and region-based snake, with an inconspicuous minor trend of increasing or decreasing for each snake method. It implies that the added degrees of freedom from increased numbers of control points did not help improve node delineation quantitatively in a substantial manner as expected. For edge-based snake, even though the DSC values appeared slightly higher with increasing numbers of control points, there existed the problem of contour over-fitting with increased degrees of freedom, where unnatural cusp began to appear as shown in Fig. 3b and c. For region-based snake, contour overflow through small openings to other soft tissues of similar contrast (in this case the small blood vessels) became severe, as revealed in Fig. 3e and f. Both snake methods tend to generate unrealistic delineation of the smooth lymph node boundaries with increasing number of control points. It should be noted that with additional degrees of freedom, the finer details of nodes were indeed better characterized with 18 and 24 numbers of control points (in Fig. 3) for region-based snake, despite the concurrent overflow problem. The performance is expected to improve if the added degrees of freedom can be better channelled and utilized in a more effective manner. Overall, using 6 control points is considered optimal for both generic edge-based or region-based snake methods to depict the outline of lymph nodes, whose shapes are generally not complex and can be handled well with the inherent flexibility of B-spline contours.

A further note is in regard to the difference in the results between baseline and follow-up lymph nodes. The segmentation on baseline nodes performed almost consistently more accurate for both types of methods than follow-up nodes, implying segmentation using active contour on follow-up nodes is more challenging. This agrees with the observation made by Moltz [15] that lymph nodes growing over time are more difficult to delineate. This difficulty might be caused by the fact that follow-up nodes have developed into more complicated structures over time, either due to disease progression or effect of treatment. In our dataset, the follow-up lymph nodes indeed had more inhomogeneity inside the node region, which created more internal edges and small gradient, confusing the movement of the snake. Nonetheless, the segmentation results obtained in our study indicate that direct application of generic snake algorithm is not good enough for clinical use.

On the whole, edge-based snake achieved a higher average DCS than region-based snake. Both snake formulations have their own merits and weaknesses.

Edge-based snake relies on the edge map derived using Canny edge detector. Ideally the edge map should consist of lymph nodes edges alone and clear of false edges from other interfering structures. In practice, this is hardly attained. Even with Canny edge detector, which was found effective in depicting lymph nodes boundaries, the edges obtained were still highly fragmented and the degree of fragmentation depended on the anatomical location of the nodes. When a more complete edge profile of the node was detected (as in Fig. 4a), the algorithm was able to generate a satisfactory segmentation. However, when a considerable part of edge information was missing due to high edge profile of surrounding structures as in the case of Fig. 4b, edge-based snake converged to the false edges and results in an over-estimation. Further, in locations where double edges were present (Fig. 4c), the presence of other edges could mislead the contour evolution, which produced less accurate delineation at those locations. In a similar fashion, central necrosis, which is pathological condition resulted from patients’ chemo treatment, could give rise to numerous internal edges, which might confuse the contour further. In such cases, region-based methods would be better suited.

For region-based snake, when the node was well contrasted from nearby anatomical structures (in Fig. 4b), in which case one could vaguely identify a darker fringe of fat tissues surrounding the node, the algorithm worked extremely well in depicting lymph node intact. The high edge profile of blood vessels which caused problems to edge-based snake did not pose a challenge for region-based snake. Nevertheless, the major drawback of applying region-based formulation on lymph nodes is leaking through adjacent soft tissues of similar intensity range, as shown in Fig. 4c. Otherwise region-based snake offered comparable segmentation results to edge-based snake (Fig. 4a) and was less susceptible to the influence of strong edge profiles from adjacent anatomical structures (Fig. 4b). Thus it gave more precise delineation of nodes in regions where the edge information was missing or false.

One critical observation is that the edge and region information was complementary for lymph nodes. That is, at locations where region-based snake was leaking, there were at least partial edges of nodes available. Therefore, when the edge map of lymph nodes was utilized to serve as a ‘stopping criteria’ for region-based snake in the new scheme, the segmentation performance improved significantly from 0.760±0.172 to 0.853±0.059 for baseline nodes (p=0.028) and from 0.721±0.227 to 0.841±0.108 for follow-up nodes (p=0.005).

The superiority of region-based snake with edge constraint is revealed in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4b, where the contrast between the node and surrounding anatomical structures was high and leaking was not a problem, both region-based snake and region-based snake with edge constraint performed equally well. Furthermore, with more control points in the latter one, the morphological shape of the lymph node was outlined in better details. There were also lymph nodes located adjacent to structures of similar intensity range, where leaking did not pose a problem using 6 control points (due to its natural shape constraint with fewer degrees of freedom) but deteriorated using 18 control points for region-based snake (refer to Fig. 3e and f). With application of edge constraints, the increased degrees of freedom from using 18 control points were well channelled such that not only leaking did not occur, the node boundary was actually traced out with better precision. Last but not least, in Fig. 4c, where leaking was jeopardizing region-based snake even with using only 6 control points, not to mention with using 18 control points, the introduction of additional edge constraint successfully confined the contour to the precise boundary of the node. And the boundary delineation was more refined and delicate than when either edge-based or region-based snake was used alone.

The advantages of the newly proposed scheme of region-based snake with edge constraint are four-fold: (i) it draws on the strength of region-based snake to distinguish lymph nodes from the high contrast surroundings; (ii) edge constraint employing partial edge information prevents region-based snake from leaking through regions of similar intensity range; (iii) edge constraint on the movement of control points also serves as a hard constraint on the contour such that its behaviour is well regularized and the problem of over-fitting does not occur; (iv) the self-adjusting mechanism gradually channels the added degrees of freedom to adapt to the edge segments and consequently attains more precise boundary delineations. The main limitation for the current scheme is with the internal edges of lymph nodes in the case of central necrosis, which can result in under-segmentation due to pre-mature constraint on the movement of control points.

There have been works which utilized both edge and region at the same Snake model [16–18]. However, those methods mainly combine both edge and region terms in a linear manner and the weight between the two terms is determined heuristically. Our paper proposed a method which does not suffer from the compromise inherent in determining the weight between the two terms. Furthermore, since edge and region information has their own advantages in segmenting the same node, our method draws on the forte of both kinds of information such that they are utilized in a constructive manner. Therefore, the paper presents an alternative and novel way of combining information.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have investigated the performance of edge-based and region-based snake algorithms in lymph nodes segmentation for lung cancer patients, using a B-spline parameterization. Using 6 control points has been found to be optimal among various numbers of control points. Though edge-based snake achieved a high average DSC, region-based snake gave more precise delineation of the structure where edge information was missing or false. We further developed a new scheme, which introduces a self-adjusting mechanism to add edge constraint to region-based snake. The newly proposed scheme integrates both edge and region information in a constructive manner and improves the segmentation results significantly compared to generic snake methods. It is an effective lymph node segmentation method and has great potential to aid treatment response evaluations in the clinical practice.
