                  The predictions of a computerized decision-support system (CDSS) are compared to clinical data obtained from a group of premature infants. The infants were suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and were treated by the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. The predictions of the CDSS are found to be in general agreement with clinical measurements. The CDSS is also used to determine the effect of low level oxygen treatment on arterial oxygen pressure if the infant׳s oxygenation is low despite CPAP therapy. Based on the computational results, application of low levels of supplemental inspired fraction of oxygen (

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Neonatal respiratory care is an important area of critical care that is growing rapidly due to the increasing survival rate of premature infants. The most common complication among infants that are born prematurely is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The lungs of premature infants with RDS lack sufficient surfactant causing atelectasis and respiratory failure [1–5]. These infants are often treated with invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation during their first weeks of life. However, application of invasive mechanical ventilation can cause serious complications such as ventilator-induced pneumonia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia [6]. Therefore, application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation and in particular CPAP therapy for these infants has been steadily gaining more support and is gradually becoming the treatment of choice for this fragile patient group [7–10].

At the same time, application of computerized decision-support systems (CDSS) in medicine has been the focus of significant research in the past few decades and is becoming more accepted as the amount of clinical data on patients increases and making decisions based on such data becomes more crucial [11–14]. One such system that could be tailored to the needs of premature infants was introduced in 2012 [15]. By using this system, the required infant data could be provided manually through a keyboard and the computerized system could be used to predict the outcomes of different invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation treatments and display the results to the clinician.

The purpose of the present study was to perform a computer-aided analysis of ventilatory data on premature infants receiving CPAP treatment. One objective of this analysis was to assess the ability of the used CDSS in predicting the outcomes of the CPAP therapy. The measured data on a group of premature neonates on CPAP were input to the CDSS and the computational outcomes were compared to clinically measured data. The CDSS was further used to analyze and predict the outcome of low level supplemental oxygen treatment if the infant׳s oxygenation was low despite CPAP therapy. An overview of the system is provided and the results of the study are discussed in the sections that follow.

@&#METHODS@&#

The CDSS that has been used in this study was introduced in 2012 [15]. This system could be used for both adults and neonates. The version of the system that can be used for infants is based on a computer simulation model of neonate׳s respiratory system [16]. A block diagram of this model is shown in 
                        Fig. 1.

As can be seen in this Figure, the simulation model is divided into two parts; (1) a discrete controller and (2) a plant. The discrete controller represents the respiratory control center in the medulla which adjusts and provides the respiratory drive signal at the end of every breath, representing the Hering–Breuer reflex. The plant includes the lungs, body tissue, brain tissue, a cerebrospinal fluid compartment, peripheral and central respiratory receptors, and blood transport delays. The effects of an anatomic shunt in the lung due to prematurity and a varying dead space are included in the model.

This computer model is used in the CDSS of the present study. The CDSS uses only the “plant” of the model if it is used to predict the outcomes of invasive ventilation treatments to passive subjects. However, if the subject is breathing spontaneously on a ventilator, or is on non-invasive ventilation treatments such as CPAP therapy, the CDSS uses the complete mathematical model of Fig. 1 including both the plant and the controller. Further details of the CDSS and how it functions are provided elsewhere [15] and are not repeated here for brevity.

For the purpose of the present study, the complete model of Fig. 1 was used by the CDSS since the infants in the study were breathing spontaneously and were receiving the CPAP therapy.

The clinical data of a group of ten premature infants on CPAP therapy were used by the CDSS. The setting was the neonatal intensive care unit of the Pennsylvania Hospital which is a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital.

The infants whose data was used for this study were on CPAP ventilation and not on high frequency or invasive mechanical ventilation. The data on infants with the following conditions were not included in the study: sepsis, pneumothorax, thoracic deformity, or congenital heart disease. The characteristics of the infants included in this study are provided in 
                        Table 1.

As seen in Table 1, the weight of the infants ranged from 1050g to 2000g, 1564.1±96.84g, mean±SEM. The infants׳ gestational ages were between 29 weeks to 32 weeks and 4 days, with an average of 31 weeks and 1 day. The ages of the infants since birth ranged from 1 to 3 days with an average of 1.8 days. All the infants in the study suffered from RDS.

                     Table 2 shows the measured blood and ventilatory data of the infants along-with the predictions of the CDSS for blood gases. The measured infant ventilatory data shown in the table include the applied CPAP levels, the fraction of inspired oxygen (

                     ), the measured breathing rate and tidal volume.

Tidal volume measurements were performed by using Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP), which is a commercially available technology. RIP is developed based on a technique described by Konno and Mead who used mechanical motion transducers to measure chest wall movements in relation to respiratory volume changes [17]. In using RIP, two elastic inductance bands are placed around the thorax and abdomen of the infant. As the infant breathes, the inductances of the bands change and those changes reflect the changes in the thoracic and abdominal volumes. With the inductance signals recorded as rib cage (RC) and abdominal (ABD) signals, tidal volume is estimated as the weighted sum of those signals. The signals are analyzed to produce the weighing contribution factors of RC and ABD signals to the changes in lung volume, and by using airflow measurements at the infant׳s mouth through a face mask attached to a pneumotachometer (PNT), the RIP signals can be calibrated to actual tidal volume measurements [18–22].

@&#SUMMARY@&#

A computerized decision support system is used to analyze the clinical data of a group of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation. The results of the study show that with the disease conditions simulated, the predictions of the computerized system are in general agreement with the clinical data. The computerized system also predicts that application of low supplemental oxygen levels can lead to significant improvements in oxygenation of infants whose oxygen levels are still low despite the CPAP therapy. The results of this study show that; (a) computerized decision support systems can be used as helpful tools in the clinical settings to analyze ventilatory data of premature infants, and (b) low-level oxygen supplementation is warranted for infants on CPAP whose blood oxygen levels are low, provided their oxygenation can be carefully controlled to safeguard them against the hazardous effects of hyperoxemia and large fluctuations in their blood oxygen levels.
