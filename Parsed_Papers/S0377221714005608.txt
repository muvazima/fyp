                  Using a market share attraction structure of advertising competition and following a supermodular game approach, this article demonstrates for an asymmetric oligopoly, the directional impact of changes in model parameters on the marketing controlled variables of all rivals (advertising budgets) and the operations controlled variables of all rivals (ordered quantities). Importantly, the various changes are examined analytically, empirically and numerically in both non-dominated and dominated asymmetric oligopolies.
                  In this regard, the results indicate that firms in a dominated oligopoly (one firm of market share larger than or equal to 50%) behave differently compared to firms in a non-dominated oligopoly (each firm of market share less than 50%) in response to changes in model parameters. Furthermore, changes in model parameters are investigated in terms of their relative influential impact on a variety of equilibrium measures. In this regard, the findings indicate that for the analyzed model the marketing parameters exert much more influence on the equilibrium measures than the operations parameters.
                  Additionally, a change in the mode of competition from non-cooperation (oligopoly) to cooperation (joint ownership) dictates that strong asymmetric firms (of favorable marketing and operations parameters) continue advertising (but at lower levels) and weak asymmetric firms (of less favorable parameters) cease advertising altogether.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An important component in present-day modeling of marketing-mix effects is the accommodation of asymmetries in competition (Leeflang, Wittink, Wedel, & Neart, 2000, p. 286). The literature attributes unequal competition between brands in a product category to preference heterogeneity (Blattberg & Wisniewski, 1989), income effect (Allenby & Rossi, 1991), loss aversion (Hardie, Johnson, & Fader, 1993), or dominance effects (Heath et al., 2000). An assessment of alternative theories of asymmetry leads Neslin (2002, Chap. 13, p. 314) to conclude that market share is the key factor. Thus in today’s environment, the question is how, not whether, asymmetry in competition should be accommodated (Leeflang et al., 2000, p. 287). Because change is the only constant in today’s market environment, it is advantageous for a vigilant competitor to ascertain how to adapt its strategy in response to changes in the market to maintain or enhance its position (Mesak, 2003, p. 1792; Coughlan et al., 2010, p. 321).

Cross-functional interface encompasses the organizational structures, tactics and policies adopted by firms to manage the information flow, the conflicts and the mutual objectives between two distinct functional areas (Moenaert & Souder, 1996). Marketing and operations as functional areas represent the key value adding areas of the modern business enterprise. It is these areas that are influential in specifying what is produced, how it is produced and actually delivering goods and services to customers. Manifest interfunctional conflict (defined by Barclay 1991 as the degree to which managers in one functional group behave in a way that frustrates another functional group) between marketing and operations is common. Marketing often assumes that production can be increased (or decreased) instantly and, in turn, tends to provide imprecise forecasts and promise short lead times. But the production schedule, once made, can be significantly inflexible. Notable examples are provided below.

In early 1990, the Gillette Company (the dominant competitor in the Blades and Razors for Men category) spent millions of dollars advertising its new Sensor razor. The company underestimated the effect of its huge advertising launch, which resulted in poor volume forecasting. Retailers, faced with customers seeking the product, were unable to satisfy all of the demand. Furthermore, when customers they did find the product, they were subsequently unable to find replacement blades (Crittenden, Gardiner, & Stam, 1993). More recently, the Nintendo Wii was still hard to find almost a year after it was launched in 2006 since marketing failed to forecast such high demand. While operations attempted to triple the North American workforce and almost double the worldwide workforce to meet demand, marketing continued to advertise while the product remained in scarce supply – thus further exasperating the supply–demand imbalance.

Nintendo Wii continued to be in fierce competition with its two main competitors in the non-dominated video-game consoles category: Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s Play Station (Rusetski, 2012). The conflict between marketing and operations has been discussed in the literature in detail (Piercy, 2007; Shapiro, 1977) and how to reduce the conflict has been also addressed (Artz, Homberg, & Rajab, 2012; Omurgonulsen & Surucu, 2008; Piercy, 2010).

Since the publication of the pioneering article of Whitin (1955), several researchers developed different forms of operations-marketing interface models with the objective of integrating both functions. Eliashberg and Steinberg (1993, Chap. 18), Parente (1998), Yano and Gilbert (2004, Chap. 3), Chan, Shen, Simchi-Levi, and Swann (2004) and more recently Tang (2010) and Martinez-Costa, Mos-Machuca, and Lusa, 2013 provide lucid reviews of the literature on the subject. While several analytical models integrating the operations and the pricing and/or product assortment (product variety) in a competitive market have been published, published research integrating the operations and the advertising functions in a competitive market for which analytical findings supported by the empirical and numerical evidence are scarce.

According to the Statistical Abstract of the United States (2012), aggregate advertising expenditures in the U.S. has grown to $170 billion dollars in 2010 whereas according to an US Census Bureau (2011) report, American 2010year-end total manufacturing inventories were worth $534 billion dollars. Given that individual business enterprises commit significant resources on advertising and inventory, investigating better ways of investing such large sums of money would undoubtedly be fruitful.

Our investigation focuses on the development of a competitive inventory model with advertising-dependent demand. Asymmetry is accommodated by using a market share attraction model of advertising competition (Cooper & Nakanishi, 1988). The present study has three main objectives. The first objective is to investigate analytically how a firm would adapt an optimum advertising expenditure and optimum ordered quantity in response to changes in any of its own parameters, rival parameters, or the parameters that are common to all firms in an asymmetric oligopolistic market. The second objective attempts to answer a research question that has not been fully addressed before. In a dominated asymmetric oligopolistic market (where market share of one firm is larger than or equal to 50%), should rivals adjust their advertising expenditures and ordered quantities in a manner consistent or inconsistent with a non-dominated asymmetric oligopoly (where every market share is less than 50%)? The third objective is to examine the effect of the interaction between the mode of cooperation and asymmetry on the advertising policy of a given firm. A related literature review and the main contributions of the study are highlighted next.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Operations managers are often evaluated on cost performance while marketing managers are often rewarded based on revenues. However, actions that minimize costs or maximize revenue may not optimize profit. There is a stream of the literature that explicitly models the interactions between these two areas in order to maximize the profitability of a firm. Our research is part of this stream.

To meet customer demand, firms face conflicting pressure to keep inventories low enough to reduce the holding cost but high enough to reduce ordering and setup costs with the objective of minimizing the total cost of inventory (Stevenson, 2008). This is accomplished by determining the right quantity to be ordered. Several models are used for this purpose of which the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, along with its different variations have been studied intensively assuming a constant demand rate which is determined exogenously (Buzacott, 1975; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chung, 1989; Moon & Lee, 2000).


                        Whitin (1955) was the first to integrate purchasing and marketing decisions by incorporating the effect of price on demand within the inventory model where the retailer has to decide both the price and order quantity optimally. This article triggered much research with the objective of integrating price-dependent demand with inventory models or ordering policies (Abad, 1988; Arcelus, Shah, & Srinivasan, 2003; Lee, 1993; Ray, Gerchak, & Jewkes, 2005; Viswananthan & Wang, 2003). Additionally, the price-dependent demand model was extended by another stream of research to integrate the inventory model with advertising dependent demand (Freeland, 1980; Khouja & Robbins, 2003; Sana & Chaudhuri, 2008; Subramanyam & Kumaraswamy, 1981; Urban, 1992).

The research mentioned above strictly considers a single firm, and therefore, competition was beyond their scope. Yet, a few studies within a static (time-independent) framework do focus on advertising competition within a duopoly/oligopoly (Friedman, 1958; Gupta & Krishnan, 1967; Mesak, 2003; Mesak & Calloway, 1995, 1999; Mills, 1961). The above studies, however, do not consider inventory related costs in the modeling effort. (This literature review does not incorporate supply chain management models as such models are not relevant to the scope and purposes of the present research. While supply chain management models examine vertical integration among channel members representing different organizations, the present research primarily considers horizontal integration among members within the same firm. Readers interested in supply chain management models may refer to Aust & Buscher (2014) for a recent review).

While the above stated studies are primarily analytical in nature, some research provides empirical evidence related to the benefits of integrating marketing and operations. Notable examples include, but not limited to, Hausman, Montgomery, and Roth (2002), Sawhney and Piper (2002) and Kulp, Lee, and Ofek (2004). These studies use survey data.

The closest studies to the present research are Mesak (2003) and Min and Chen (1995). Mesak (2003), who has not explicitly considered inventory costs, employs a Nash equilibrium solution concept in conjunction with a market share attraction model for which the attraction function of a competitor depends upon its own advertising effort. In turn, similar to this study, Min and Chen (1995) who have not explicitly considered advertising, each firm aims at maximizing its profit in a situation for which all the assumptions of a traditional EOQ model hold. In contrast to Mesak (2003) and Min and Chen (1995) who only analyze symmetric competition, the present study is broader in scope as it analyzes asymmetric competition for which symmetric rivalry is a special case. The main contributions of the present study are highlighted below.
                           
                              (1)
                              Using ‘supermodular games approach’, considered as a novel application in the marketing-operations interface literature, this research derives a sensitivity analysis (comparative statics) related to an asymmetric competitive inventory model with advertising-dependent demand in an integrated setting. (The terms “sensitivity analysis”, mainly adopted by operations research practitioners, and “comparative statics”, mainly used by economists are employed interchangeably with the same meaning).

A comparison made between the behaviors of rivals in non-dominated oligopolies and their counterparts related to dominated oligopolies in response to changes in model parameters reveal that the behaviors are different.

Upon estimating a market share attraction model using real-life aggregate panel data, extensive numerical experiments are mainly conducted to examine the relative impact of changes in model parameters on the controlled marketing variables (advertising budgets) and the controlled operations variables (ordered quantities) together with other measures of performance such as market share and profit. The findings indicate that for the specific application under scrutiny, the studied marketing parameters exert much more influence on the examined equilibrium measures than the considered operations parameters.

The modeling effort is extended to compare the advertising strategy of a given firm in the presence and absence of competition and in the presence and absence of asymmetry. Related analytical findings reveal that for symmetric firms, none of the firms should advertise. For asymmetric firms, on the-other-hand, a strong firm (of favorable marketing and operations parameters) should advertise whereas a weak firm (of less favorable parameters) should not.

The present article uses a static framework and employs demand functions of rival firms that are deterministic. (Huang, Leng, & Parlar (2013) provide a recent review of demand functions in decision models). Hauser and Wernerfelt (1989, p. 393) argue that such a focus is appropriate for long-term strategic decisions involving competition. De Giovanni (2009, p. 556) believe that such orientation is desirable in games that involve multiple players. (Currently and to the best knowledge of the authors, except for the duopoly model of El Oughardighi and Pasin (2006) for horizontal competition, published dynamic (time dependent) models that deal with the advertising-operations interface are limited to the situation of a single firm [see Erickson (2011, 2012) for recent notable examples and Huang, Leng, and Liang (2012) for a related literature review]. Also, it is not uncustomary that for optimal control of dynamic models researchers conduct sensitivity analyses using steady-state conditions (see e.g., Naik & Raman, 2003, p. 386). The study is applicable to low priced frequently purchased consumer items in the mature stage of their product life cycles.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the theoretical model. Section 3 calibrates a market share attraction model using U.S. brewing industry data. Section 4 reports the results of numerical experiments aiming at examining the relative impact of changes in model parameters on the decision variables and a variety of performance measures. Section 5 models joint ownership advertising decisions whereas Section 6 concludes the study and Section 7 provides plausible directions for future research. To improve exposition, derivation of key formulas is relegated to Appendix A. Proofs of five propositions are found in Appendix B. Additional details related to the empirical work to complement the discussion in the main text is included in Appendix C. All appendices are available in a separate supplement component.

This paper considers N competing suppliers (vendors), each striving to meet a deterministic advertising-dependent demand of potential customers. In doing so, the inventory replenishment process of each supplier of a differentiated product is represented by an EOQ model for which its classical assumptions are satisfied (mainly, the demand rate is deterministic and constant, shortages are not allowed, the ordered quantity is the same for each order, no capacity or selling amount limit). Furthermore, the study considers the situation in which the marketing department determinines the advertising budget and the operation department controls the ordered quantity. Each firm aims to maximize its profit per unit time non-cooperatively with other firms.

Asymmetric competition is accommodated through the usage of a market share attraction model of advertising competition. The model described in this section and the one to follow considers first, as in Little (1979), Monahan (1987) and Mesak (2003), a market-share attraction model in an oligopolistic market, with one advertising spending variable x

                     For the decentralized scenario, the operations department aims at minimizing the total inventory costs depicted in (3), whereas the marketing department aims at maximizing expression (2), excluding the costs included in expression (3). For the coordinated scenario, on the other hand, firm j aims at the joint maximization of expression (2) in its entirety.


                     Proposition 1, for which the proof is found in Appendix B, compares the performance of a firm when its marketing and operations functions work in a decentralized mode to the performance when the two functions coordinate their efforts to serve the interest of the firm as a whole. In the considered scenarios, the marketing function of the firm controls the advertising budget whereas the operations function of the firm controls the size of the ordered quantity. The analysis is based on the Nash equilibrium solution concept of game theory.

                      for both the situations of coordination and decentralization. Result (iv) is produced on the premise that there is an incentive for each decentralized firm to get coordinated to boost its own profit. For symmetric competition on the other hand, parts (i) and (iv) of the proposition remain applicable. However, parts (ii) and (iii) of the proposition would imply that the ordered quantities and related total inventory costs are equal under both coordination and decentralization.

According to the empirical research of Maltz and Kohli (2000), the conflict between marketing and operations is most significant in the presence of “internal volatility”. Internal volatility refers to the rate of change within an organization in terms of personnel, structure, and procedures (Maltz & Kohli, 1996). Managers in organizations with high internal volatility are likely to be unsure of their current and future standing in the firm. They tend to defend and even expand their influence and resources allocated to their respective functions. This, in turn, is likely to lead to a higher conflict. Maltz and Kohli (2000) also empirically show that “cross-functional team use” is an effective integrating mechanism in alleviating the conflict between the two departments. Cross-functional team use refers to the extent to which teams composed of members from multiple functions are used to address organizational threats and opportunities. Members of such teams learn the language of both departments, and later act as “translators” for others in their home functions. This reduces the language barriers across functions in the organization and, in turn, reduces the conflict (Griffin & Hauser, 1996). In addition, the use of cross-functional teams emphasizes the importance of superordinate goals (Pinto, Pinto, & Prescott, 1993). That is, managers in teams are likely to focus more on organization-wide goals (rather than purely functional goals), thereby reducing latent conflict between functions due to differences in goal orientations (Maltz & Kohli, 2000). The above discussion implies the feasibility of integrating the marketing and operations departments under dysfunctional conflict circumstances thus enhancing performance according to Proposition 1 (iv). It is further shown in Appendix A that decentralized firms in an asymmetric oligopoly, upon a minor change in the goal of their marketing departments, could be integrated to achieve the profit of centralized firms. The remainder of the paper, therefore, will be confined to studying integrated firms.

Ease of use and flexibility in solving for comparative statics in game-theory problems have made monotone methods popular in the economics literature (Amir, 2005; Tremblay & Tremblay, 2010); however, such methods are still absent from the marketing-operations interface literature. For that matter, a supermodular games approach to comparative statics is briefly discussed below.

One can think of this as a game of super-complementarity, which implies that there is complementarity among all strategies and a policy parameter. The important things to notice are that this specification implies that there are increasing marginal returns between all possible pairs of choice variables and the policy parameter. Under these conditions and assuming a unique Nash equilibrium, the following comparative static results hold for all firms (Milgrom & Roberts, 1990, Theorem 6 and its Corollary):

                     That is, when conditions (Cond.1)–(Cond.4) are met, an increase in parameter θ will have a non-negative effect on the Nash advertising budget and size of the ordered quantity.

Now, employing a supermodular games approach to sensitivity analysis, the obtained comparative statics are summarized in Propositions 2 and 3 (see Appendix B for related proofs).
                        Proposition 2
                        
                           For a centralized (coordinated) non-dominated asymmetric oligopoly

                                    An increase in either of the parameters γ, or β of a rival should be responded to by no decrease in both the equilibrium advertising x and ordered quantity Q of its own. Also, an increase in the parameter δ of a rival should be responded to by no decrease in both x
                                    
                                       δ
                                    
                                    and the equilibrium ordered quantity Q of its own.
                                 


                                    An increase in either of the parameters d or ε of a rival should be responded to by no increase in both the equilibrium advertising and ordered quantity of its own.
                                 


                                    An increase in parameter C

                                    of a rival should be responded to by no increase in both the equilibrium advertising and ordered quantity of its own.
                                 


                                    An increase in parameter C

                                    of a rival should be responded to by no increase in the equilibrium advertising and by no decrease in the equilibrium ordered quantity of its own.
                                 


                                    An increase in parameter m should be responded to by a no decrease in the equilibrium advertising and ordered quantity of all rivals.
                                 

Part (i) of the above proposition rejects the idea that improvements in the stated parameters of a firm would favor reducing its advertising spending and ordered quantity to achieve the same sales level as before and a simultaneous reduction in total inventory costs, as it would be suboptimal. The firm instead would make more profit by investing more on advertising and inventory. It should be noted, however, that an increase in x
                        δ
                      due to an increase in δ would make the direction of change of the equilibrium advertising x a numerical question. Part (ii) implies that if the parameters associated with the advertising cost function increase, an optimal response for the firm is to decrease its advertising spending and ordered quantity to mitigate the impact on its advertising cost and reduce its total inventory costs. Part (iii) indicates that if the inventory holding cost of a firm increases, the firm should decrease its advertising expenditure and ordered quantity for an optimal response. However, if the ordering cost of a firm increases, as dictated in part (iv), the firm should respond by decreasing the advertising expenditure and increasing the ordered quantity to mitigate the impact on profit. The case associated with part (v) argues that if the market size increases, it would be optimal for all competitors to increase their advertising spending as supported by the empirical findings (Metwally, 1992) and ordered quantity to increase their profit. It is worthy to note that the signs of the comparative statics relating the changes in the marketing parameters (γ, β, δ, d, ε and m) to changes in optimal advertising are similar to those reported by Mesak (2003) which deals exclusively with symmetric competition, though it does not consider inventory related costs.

Having demonstrated in Proposition 2 that the behaviors of all rivals of a non-dominated asymmetric oligopoly in response to changes in their own parameters are generally symmetric, one may ask: Are the behaviors of rivals in a dominated oligopoly similar to those of a non-dominated oligopoly? The answers to the above question are documented in Proposition 3.
                        Proposition 3

                                    Proposition 2.

                     Proposition 3, unlike Proposition 2, implies that the behaviors of rivals (non-dominant firms in part (i) compared to the dominant firm in part (iii)) in response to changes in their own parameters are generally asymmetric as manifested in the study of Sivakumar (2004). The sign of the comparative static related to β of the dominant firm in part (iii) is inconsistent with that reported by Mesak (2003) which deals exclusively with symmetric firms.

It is important to mention that a supermodular games approach to sensitivity analysis provides only the direction of change but not its magnitude and has the disadvantage of its inability to shedding light on the impact of changes in one firm’s parameter on x
                     ∗
                     ∗ and/or Q
                     ∗
                     ∗ of its rivals (cross-sensitivity analysis). The above shortcomings could be overcome, in principle, through the classical approach of the implicit function theorem IFT (see Bertsekas, 1999). However, when each rival controls more than one decision variable and the number of asymmetric competitors N
                     ⩾2, the application of IFT becomes rather tedious (if not impossible because of the curse of dimensionality) and one would adhere to numerical experiments instead. In conducting such experiments, each of the relevant marketing and operations parameters takes on discrete values over a certain range (this subject is discussed in more detail in Section 4). To guide the process of assigning values to such parameters, data related to the U.S. brewing industry is used in Section 3 to estimate the marketing parameters (mainly γ

                     ) and the operations parameters (C

                      and C
                     
                        oj
                     ). In such an application, it is assumed that the advertising cost functions are linear, so that parameters d
                     
                        j

                     s are equal provides a better empirical fit with the data than the unrestricted version. The market share attraction model for an oligopoly as given in Eq. (4) is empirically estimated using actual data related to U.S. brewing industry. Nelson (2005) provides firm specific sales and advertising data for Anheuser-Busch (firm 1), SAB-Miller (firm 2), Coors (firm 3) and an aggregate of other small brewers (firm 4). The same data set has been recently analyzed, but in a different research context, by Erickson (2009). The current study employs brewing industry data for years 1994 through 2003. The above time interval was chosen for the analysis as there were no changes in brand ownership during such period except for SAB-Miller near the end of its time series. SAB bought Miller from Philip Morris in 2002. Though the analyzed data are related to a process industry, it is shown in Appendix A that expression (2) is applicable to such an industry as well. Prior to analysis, the advertising expense data for the brewing industry were converted to 1989 dollars. Defining,

Descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table 1
                     . The table indicates that all variables MSHR
                     
                        j
                      and x
                     
                        j
                      assume considerable variability during the studied period. Each firm had a market share less than 50% for each year.

The market-share attraction model (4) is calibrated by ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression after log-centering formulation of the data for each period t. Cooper and Nakanishi (1988, p. 128) mention that the OLS procedure appears satisfactory in many market-share model applications.

                      lists the parameter estimates and their statistical significance levels (p-values) as obtained from linear regression. All parameters are statistically different from zero at better than the 0.05 level.

The calibrated model has face validity as the value of δ lies between 0 and 1 suggesting a concave advertising attraction function which is supported by the literature (Friedman, 1983; Simon & Arndt, 1980) and favors constant advertising spending over time for all rivals (Mesak, 1999). Finally, the large values of R
                     2 indicate that the models fit the data fairly well. The reported R-square values in Table 2 are consistent with Mesak (2003) and Mesak and Means (1998) who estimate similar market-share attraction models. The R-square obtained by Mesak (2003, p. 1797) who examines the ready-to-eat cereal industry in the U.S. is 0.9644 while those of Mesak and Means (1998, p. 1266) who analyze a different data set for the same industry using two versions of the model are 0.9545 and 0.9438. It is worthy to mention that an extended version of model (5) that allows for the heterogeneity in parameter δ has been also calibrated (see expression (5.15) in Cooper & Nakanishi, 1988, p. 128). The results of the calibration exercise are reported in Table 2. While parameters δ in both models are comparable, parameters α are not (see Cooper & Nakanishi, 1988, p. 129 for a related discussion). Only three out of eight parameters are significant. An F-test (see Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, & Li, 2005, expression (2.7), p. 73) failed to show that the simple and the extended market-share attraction models are statistically different from each other at the 0.01 level of significance (calculated F3,32
                     =3.349 is smaller than the related tabulated statistic).

Research suggests that firms often make decisions about advertising and other marketing mix variables based on their sales or market share (Bass, 1969; Rust, 1986; Lilien & Rasngaswamy, 2004). In fact, some firms follow a very simplistic rule: next year’s advertising budget for a brand is set as a percentage of sales or market share of the brand for the current year. Thus the advertising becomes an endogenous decision by the firm (Kalyanaram, 2009, p. 141). To account for the endogeneity of advertising competition, the first order necessary conditions of optimality for an interior solution (∂π

The two-step estimators are reported in Table 2 and they appear different from those obtained upon the estimation of the demand equation of model (5) alone. The two-step estimation procedure appears plausible. Ramsey’s (1969) RESET test for misspecification reveals that the second equation is not misspecified.

Before concluding that the shape of the attraction functions are concave based on the above analysis of annual data, monthly or quarterly advertising figures may also need to be analyzed to insure that such data are free from systematic variations (see Mesak & Darrat, 1992, p. 552 for a detailed discussion). For that matter quarterly advertising data related to Anheuser-Busch and Coors were analyzed using the nonparametric runs test of randomness for large samples (quarterly advertising data for Miller were unavailable to the authors). Each data set was converted to series of positive and negative signs. A positive (negative) sign indicates that the advertising for the quarter is larger (smaller) than that for the previous quarter. The calculated Z test statistics were 0.89 and 1.26 for Anheuser-Busch and Coors, respectively and each is less than Z0.025 = 1.96. The null hypothesis of randomness could not be rejected implying that the advertising attraction functions are indeed concave (Further details on the runs test are found in statistics textbooks such as Aczel, 2007).

The conducted numerical experiments reported in this section aims at (i) providing illustrative examples to gain additional insight into the statements of Proposition 1, (ii) investigating the directional impact of changes in firm’s marketing and operations parameters, considered one at a time, on the decision variables x
                     ∗∗ (advertising budget) and Q
                     ∗∗(size of the ordered quantity) together with the performance measures of market share (MSHR
                     ∗∗), total inventory cost (TC
                     ∗∗), and profit (π
                     ∗∗) of its own (self-sensitivity analysis) for coordinated non-dominated and dominated asymmetric oligopolies, (iii) investigating the directional impact of changes in firm’s parameters, considered one at a time, on the above decision variables and performance measures of its rivals (cross–sensitivity analysis) for coordinated non-dominated and dominated asymmetric oligopolies and (iv) assessing the relative impact of changes in model parameters on the above quantities. In conducting the numerical experiments, changes in parameters are allowed within a setting of a triopoly of three rival firms 1, 2 and 3. This research chooses three rivals because ‘three’ is the minimum complexity above a duopoly that still allows examination of comparative statics in an oligopoly. Incorporating a larger number of competitors is not believed to provide sufficient incremental insight to justify the additional complexity.

Generally, the empirical findings of the present study together with the empirical results of the relevant literature have been considered when determining the ranges of the parameters used in the numerical analysis reported herein. Specifically, the determination of parameters γ, C
                     
                        h
                      and C
                     
                        o
                      for all rivals was influenced by the empirical findings previously reported in this research. The determination of the range of parameter β for all rivals was influenced by the empirical findings previously reported in this research together with the empirical results of Mesak (2003) and Mesak and Means (1998). The determination of the range of parameter δ was influenced by the empirical findings previously reported in this research together with the empirical results of Erickson (1992, 1997). Though Erickson (1992, 1997) estimates Lanchester models of advertising competition, his empirical findings are relevant to this research since the market-share attraction model employed in this research embraces the steady-state response of Erickson’s models. Although several empirical studies related to the Lanchester model of advertising competition assume δ
                     =0.50 for all competitors (e.g., Chintagunta & Vilcassim, 1992; Breton, Jarrar, & Zaccour, 2006), Wang and Wu (2007) show that different common δ values are more appropriate using annual data related to three different industries. Finally, only one value for the market potential m is assigned since that parameter is common to all firms. In conclusion, the following ranges of different parameters are adopted:


                     γ: From 1.500 to 3.000,


                     β: From 0.500 to 3.000,


                     δ: From 0.050 to 0.750,


                     C
                     
                        h
                     : From 0.200 to 0.300,


                     C
                     
                        o
                     : From 1.000 to 8.000,


                     m: 10000.

Employing the parameters related to the two scenarios depicted in the upper part of Table 3
                        , the equilibrium quantities x
                        ∗, Q
                        ∗, TC
                        ∗ and π
                        ∗ are obtained through the operationalization of expressions (B.3), (B.5), (B.6) and (B.9) in Appendix B related to asymmetric decentralized oligopolies. Similarly, the equilibrium quantities x
                        ∗∗, Q
                        ∗∗, TC
                        ∗∗ and π

The reported findings included in the lower part of Table 3 are consistent with the statements of Proposition 1 (

                                  of a non-dominant rival should be responded to by an increase in the equilibrium size of the ordered quantity of its own as well as that of the dominant competitor but by a decrease in the same equilibrium quantities of the other non-dominant rivals.

The above conclusions taken together, imply that the behaviors of rivals in a non-dominated oligopoly are symmetric while their behaviors in a dominated oligopoly are asymmetric.

In this subsection and apart from a single value assigned to market potential parameter m, extensive numerical experiments are performed to examine the relative impact of changes in model parameters γ

                         for non-dominated and dominated triopolies. In this regard, five levels for each parameter related to the non-dominated competitive setting are assigned as shown in Table 5

A full factorial design for a triopoly requires computing the above equilibrium measures related to nearly 30.5 billion numerical experiments/runs (or 515
                        =3.051757813×1010 to be exact). Because such a design is computationally prohibitive, one would adhere to a fractional factorial design instead (Kutner et al., 2005). For that matter, model parameters are classified into two groups. The first group includes the parameters γ
                        
                           i
                        , β
                        
                           i, and δ
                        
                           i
                         and the second group includes the parameters C
                        
                           hi
                         and C
                        
                           oi
                        . Parameters of each group when taken together, can take on three levels: low, medium, or high resulting in 32
                        =9 basic configurations of parameter assignments. The nine configurations associated with the non-dominated triopoly are shown in the lower part of Table 5. In the first configuration (low–high) for example, the values assigned to the first group of parameters for the three firms are the three smallest levels for γ, β and δ. The values assigned to the second group of parameters for the three firms are the largest levels for C
                        
                           h
                         and C
                        
                           o
                        . Other configurations can be described in the same manner. For the dominated competitive setting, the parameter values are the same as those for the non-dominated setting except that parameter δ takes on the following values reported in a descending order [0.750 0.575 0.400 0.225 0.050]. So that, a low level assignment of parameter δ to the three firms would be [0.400 0.225 0.050], a medium level assignment would be [0.575 0.400 0.225], and a high level assignment would be [0.750 0.575 0.400].

To conduct a sensitivity analysis in conjunction with a certain parameter for a particular scenario, the parameter is allowed to vary over its assigned range of levels, while keeping the remaining 14 parameters at their previous levels unchanged. The new equilibrium measures, EM, are then obtained for each of the quantities

                        .

An examination of the average SI’s reported in Tables 6 and 7 leads to the following main conclusions:
                           
                              (i)
                              For both competitive settings and in terms of magnitude, changes in a parameter of a rival have much more impact on the equilibrium measures of its own than on those of its competitors.

For both competitive settings, changes in the parameters of the first group related to a given firm have influential impact on the performance measures of market share and profitability of all firms whereas changes in the parameters of the second group exercise nearly negligible influence on the same.

For both competitive settings, changes in the parameters of the first group related to a given firm have influential impact on the decision variables x
                                 ∗∗ and Q
                                 ∗∗ together with the performance measure TC
                                 ∗∗ of all rivals.

For both competitive settings, changes in the parameters of the second group related to a given firm have influential impact only on the decision variable Q
                                 ∗∗ and the performance measure TC
                                 ∗∗ of its own, but nearly negligible influential impact on the decision variable x
                                 ∗∗ of any rival.

The above conclusions, taken together, imply that the parameters of the first group (γ
                        
                           i

                           i
                        ) exert much more influence on the studied equilibrium measures than the parameters of the second group (C
                        
                           hi
                         and C
                        
                           oi

In previous sections, non-cooperative games of advertising-inventory competition are discussed. In this section, we investigate how the marketing-operations interface influences the advertising strategies of asymmetric firms upon a change in the mode of competition from non-cooperation (oligopoly) to cooperation (joint ownership). This situation resembles a case in which one firm takes over its competition through mergers and acquisitions, or a monopolist that abandons its brand management strategy in favor of a strategy of category management (Zenor, 1994; Nevo, 2000; Hall, Kopalle, & Krishna, 2010). In this regard, joint ownership implies that the monopolist aims at the determination of

                     . This is attributed primarily to advertising cost savings by all firms. The results of Proposition 4 are in harmony with the literature. For example, the results of a survey of 75 CFOs suggest that the primary motive of mergers and acquisitions is to achieve operating synergies associated with improved productivity and/or other cost reductions (Mukherjee, Kiymaz, & Baker, 2004, p. 14).


                     Proposition 5 sheds light on the role of asymmetry in setting the advertising budgets of different firms upon a change to a joint ownership. For that matter, let us introduce the following terms at optimality prior to introducing that proposition:

                           Considering a joint ownership of N firms

                                    For asymmetric firms, firm j would advertise if CS
                                    
                                       j

                                    WMS, otherwise it would not advertise.
                                 


                                    For symmetric firms, none of the firms would advertise.
                                 

Part (i) of the proposition implies that for N
                     ⩾2, there exists at least one firm that would advertise and there exists at least one other firm that would not advertise as Σ MSHR
                        i
                     
                     =1. The intuition here is that strong firms (of large CS
                     
                        j
                     ) are usually more profitable than weak ones (of smaller CS
                     
                        j
                     ), so that the parent enterprise (holding company) would like to drive demand towards them through advertising. For part (ii) of the proposition, however, each symmetric firm would have a market share=1/N no matter how much each firm would advertise so that the holding company would have no incentive to let any firm advertise in order to enhance joint profit at large. For asymmetric firms, the ordered quantities

The improved performance reported in Propositions 4 and 5 attributed to joint ownership, is consistent with the findings of Bass, Krishnamoorthy, Prasad, and Sethi (2005). The above study, however, is limited in scope to two firms and does not consider inventory costs nor derive the conditions under which a firm would (would not) advertise.

Scenario 1 is related to an asymmetric triopoly whereas Scenario 2 is related to a symmetric one. For each scenario, both coordinated competition and joint ownership are considered. Details of the studied scenarios together with related optimal numerical findings are depicted in Table 8

                      for a monopolist as asserted. Furthermore, for a symmetric triopoly (Scenario 2) the joint ownership profit together with each firm profit under monopoly are larger than their counterparts under coordinated competition as expected. For an asymmetric triopoly (Scenario 1), on the other hand, the joint ownership profit and only Firm 3 profit are larger.

The findings reported in Section 5, taken together, assert that asymmetry plays an important role in dictating not only whether a firm would (or would not) advertise under a joint ownership arrangement, but also on whether the firm’s profit would be higher/lower than its counterpart under competition.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

One main objective of this research is to examine how a firm would adapt its optimal advertising budget and the size of its ordered quantity in response to changes in its own relevant parameters and rival parameters to enhance performance in an asymmetric dominated and non-dominated competitive settings. A second main objective is to examine how the marketing-operations interface influences the advertising strategies of asymmetric firms upon a change in the mode of competition from non-cooperation (oligopoly) to cooperation (joint ownership).

The analysis reveals many interesting findings compared to prior studies that impose the symmetric assumption on firms when deriving the equilibrium. From the analytical side, using a “supermodular games approach”, considered a novel application in the marketing-operations interface literature, this research derives sensitivity analyses (comparative statics) related to an asymmetric competitive inventory model with advertising-dependent demand in a coordinated setting. For non-dominated oligopolies, the behaviors of all rivals in response to changes in model parameters are shown to be symmetric. On the other hand, for dominated oligopolies the behavior of the dominant firm compared to the behaviors of its non-dominant rivals as manifested in the study of Sivakumar (2004) are shown to be asymmetric (Propositions 2 and 3).

In addition, a change in the mode of competition from non-cooperation (oligopoly) to cooperation (joint ownership) dictates that strong asymmetric firms (of favorable marketing and operations parameters) continue advertising (but at lower levels) and weak asymmetric firms (of less favorable parameters) cease advertising altogether (Proposition 5). The contents of Proposition 5 (aided with the findings of Table 8) provide simple rules based on the marketing-operations interface according to which a category manager or a holding company that owns firms in the same line of business would rationalize related advertising decisions.

From the empirical and numerical sides, upon estimating a market-share attraction model that accounts for advertising endogeneity using panel data related to the U.S. brewing industry, extensive numerical experiments are primarily conducted to examine the relative impact of changes in model parameters on the controlled marketing variables (advertising budgets) and the controlled operations variables (ordered quantities) together with the performance measures of market share, total inventory cost and profitability. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that changes in the unit inventory holding cost per unit time, C
                     
                        h
                     , and the ordering cost per order, C
                     
                        o
                     , parameters of a firm have only significant impact on the ordered quantity and the total inventory cost of its own whereas changes in the profit margin per unit sold, γ, advertising effectiveness, β, and degree of concavity, δ, parameters of a firm possess significant impact on all of the controlled variables and the performance measures mentioned above of its own as well as its rivals. Such important findings imply that management, as a first priority, would make efforts to change parameters γ, β and δ as dictated by Table 4 in directions that would enhance performance. Therefore, managers need to be aware of circumstances that may affect the model parameters (Mesak, 2003). Notable examples are provided below.

The profit margin of a competitor, γ, could change due to adoption of new technology, improved efficiency in production/operations, purchasing policies, etc. The parameters associated with the attraction function, namely advertising effectiveness, β and the attraction function shaping parameter, δ, of a competitor can be affected in two distinct manners as identified by Little (1979). In the event a firm changes its advertising copy with the objective to communicate the same information better or provide a better demonstration of their product, parameter β is likely to be affected. However, if the goal is to reposition the product and appeal to a different group of consumers, parameter δ is likely to change. Stevenson (2008) mentions that holding or carrying costs include opportunity costs associated with having funds which could be used elsewhere tied up in inventory, insurance, taxes (in some jurisdictions), depreciation, obsolescence, deterioration, spoilage, pilferage, breakage, and warehouse costs (heat, light, rent, security). A change in one or more of the above cost items would result in a change of the C
                     
                        h
                      parameter. Also, Stevenson (2008) mentions that ordering costs include determining how much is needed, preparing invoices, shipping costs, inspecting goods upon arrival for quality and quantity, and moving the goods to temporary storage. A change in one or more of the above cost items would cause a change in the C
                     
                        o
                      parameter. Finally, the market potential m can be affected by factors like population, average income per capita, and other factors that may influence the demand for the product (Lilien, Kotler, & Moorthy, 1992).

Furthermore, coordination of the functional areas of marketing and operations by using cross-functional teams (particularly to encounter the dysfunctional effect of internal volatility) is pivotal to performance enhancement (see discussion related to Proposition 1). Management should be aware that internal volatility for high-technology firms (e.g., producers of computer related technologies) is at levels much higher than low-technology firms (e.g., producers of brewing products). Therefore, the frequency of usage of cross-functional teams in the former firms should be much higher than that for the later firms. In both types of organizations, however, firms should rely on a relatively stable formal organizational structure to promote the efficacy of cross-functional teams (Bahrami, 1992; Maltz & Kohli, 2000) as well as enhance the reliability of performance measures (Artz et al., 2012).

Studying the advertising–operations interface in a competitive setting is challenging. A particular challenge for the authors has been to construct a model theoretically rich enough to capture the essential features of the situation, yet sufficiently simple to conduct reasonable rigorous theoretical, empirical and numerical analyses. Gupta, Verma, and Victorino (2006, p. 443) emphasize that the combined use of analytical, empirical and numerical research techniques offers greater insights into the issues being studied. In this regard, the model in the present study offers a framework for further research in the future.

First, future research could investigate the linkage between the statements of the propositions derived analytically and empirical firms’ behaviors for several industries.

Second, the present study has arrived at several results based on profit as a performance measure. Indeed, other performance measures have been used in the literature such as maximizing profit subject to market share, or subject to a certain level of consumer surplus to avoid antitrust activities (Kadiyali, Sudhir, & Rao, 2001, p. 175). Thus a plausible direction for future research would be to examine the robustness of our research findings when alternative performance measures are employed.

Third, in this research work we have aggregated advertising across all media. An interesting area for future research would be to consider different advertising media of different effectiveness and examine synergy effects among them (Naik & Raman, 2003).

Fourth, the current study employs a basic EOQ model within a profit maximizing framework which can be extended to incorporate inflation and taxes into account. Studies by Chandra and Bahner (1985) and Biddle and Martin (1985) could be instructional in this regard.

Fifth, the present inquiry considers a deterministic market-share attraction model of advertising competition. Relaxing such an assumption by introducing a stochastic mechanism (e.g., Monahan & Sobel, 1994) would offer a plausible direction for future research.

Sixth, future research would consider including other marketing variables such as price in the attraction function. In addition, the analysis could be enriched by incorporating other functions in the modeling effort such as finance (capital structure), human resources (employee turnover), research and development (new product introduction) etc.

Seventh, the modeling framework developed in Section 5 could be enlarged in scope by considering the risk attitude and the bargaining power of the participating parties.

Finally, the present study promotes the creation of a conducive atmosphere by which entities within and between departments of a firm would be convinced to cooperate together to make joint decisions to serve the same and higher objective (Kaplan & Norton, 2001a, 2001b).
