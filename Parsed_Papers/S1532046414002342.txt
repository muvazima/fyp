                  Identifying candidate disease genes is important to improve medical care. However, this task is challenging in the post-genomic era. Several computational approaches have been proposed to prioritize potential candidate genes relying on protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, the experimental PPI network is usually liable to contain a number of spurious interactions. In this paper, we construct a reliable heterogeneous network by fusing multiple networks, a PPI network reconstructed by topological similarity, a phenotype similarity network and known associations between diseases and genes. We then devise a random walk-based algorithm on the reliable heterogeneous network called RWRHN to prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation experiments show that the RWRHN algorithm has better performance than the RWRH and CIPHER methods in inferring disease genes. Furthermore, RWRHN is used to predict novel causal genes for 16 diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prostate cancer, as well as to detect disease-related protein complexes. The top predictions are supported by literature evidence.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms basis of diseases has become increasingly important in disease prevention, diagnosis, and drug design. Understanding the relationship between causal genes and their associated genetic diseases is an important topic in systems biology. Candidate gene prioritization is the process of identifying new genes as potential candidates of being associated with a phenotype or a disease. This process is an important issue in current biomedical research.

Many approaches have been developed to identify candidate genes [1]. A common approach is the analysis of inherent sequence characteristics and similarities between candidate genes and known disease causal genes based on characteristics such as protein sequence properties [2], gene expression data [3], functional annotations [4], and relevant biomedical literature [5]. However, these approaches suffer from inherent limitations. That is, these methods rely on the quality and completeness of biological information.

Network-based approaches have been recently developed and applied to candidate gene prioritization [6–9]. Studies on the properties of disease genes in molecular networks have shown that two genes sharing higher-order topological similarities are likely to interact with each other and may be associated with the same or similar phenotypes [10–12]. In addition, disease phenotypic data can help increase the gene prediction accuracy for less-studied disease phenotypes. These findings have become the basis for the development of computational approaches to predict and prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases. Dezso et al. [6] applied an adapted version of shortest path betweenness to prioritize candidate genes in PPI networks. A candidate gene was scored more relevant to the disease of interest if it laid more on significantly shorter paths connecting nodes of known disease genes than other genes in the network. Wu et al. [7] established a regression model that measures the correlation between gene closeness and phenotype similarities in the PPI network to prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases on the basis of correlation scores. Li and Patra [8] proposed a new method to prioritize disease genes by extending the random walk with restart algorithm on a heterogeneous network constructed by connecting the gene network and the phenotype similarity network using known gene-phenotype relationships. Yang et al. [9] recently exploited known gene–phenotype associations to represent higher-level complex phenotype associations on the basis of the modular nature of complex diseases. They then prioritized potential candidate disease genes for disease phenotypes through network propagation on the complex interaction network. Of these network approaches, the random walk with restart algorithm is a state-of-the-art approach. Tong et al. [13] proposed fast solutions to the problem in which random walk with restart did not scale for large graphs. Zhu et al. [14] proposed a method to prioritize potential candidate disease genes based on the linear correlation coefficient and cosine angle of corresponding diffusion profiles. The diffusion profile of a disease was defined as the stationary distribution of all genes under a random walk with restart on the phenotype similarity network. The diffusion profile of a gene was obtained by smoothing the probability distribution over the PPI network when starting a walk from this gene.

However, the experimental PPI network usually contains spurious interactions. Therefore, combining the topological similarities of the PPI network with gene–phenotype relationship information is essential to accurately predict disease genes. PPI network reconstruction is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of disease genes further. Gene–gene interactions are measured according to topological similarity, after which the phenotype similarity network is connected with the use of known gene–phenotype relationships to construct a reliable heterogeneous network. The novel algorithm RWRHN (Random Walker on the Reliable Heterogeneous Network) is proposed to predict and prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases on such a heterogeneous network. Comparisons of RWRHN with CIPHER [7] and RWRH [8] show that the novel algorithm has better performance. Furthermore, RWRHN is used to predict novel causal genes for 16 diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prostate cancer, and to detect disease-related protein complexes. The top predictions are supported by literature evidence.

The protein–protein interaction (PPI) data were downloaded from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) [15]. The phenotype similarity network which was a k nearest neighbor (KNN) graph presentation of the phenotypic similarity matrix constructed by van Driel et al. [16] was downloaded from MimMiner [17]. Gene–phenotype relationships were obtained from the OMIM database [18] and extracted using BioMart [19]. The data sources are available in the Supplementary Material.

Two genes that share higher-order topological similarities are likely to interact with each other and may be associated with the same or similar phenotypes [10–12]. The RWRHN method is predicated on the basis of this simple observation together along with a novel link prediction algorithm [20]. The topological profile is calculated for each gene to measure the “distances” between the target gene and all other genes in the network. Then, the similarities of topological profiles are calculated between each gene pair. Finally, interactions are created to connect topologically similar genes. The PPI network is reconstructed from the topological similarity matrix by connecting pairs of genes whose similarities are above a certain threshold. Then, a reliable heterogeneous network is constructed by fusing a PPI network reconstructed by topological similarity with a phenotype similarity network and known associations between diseases and genes. Finally, the random walk with restart on the heterogeneous network model [8] is used to prioritize candidate genes. Fig. 1
                         shows the overall framework of the RWRHN algorithm.

The experimental PPI network usually contains spurious interactions. Thus, a novel link prediction algorithm [20] consisting of the random walk with resistance algorithm (RWS) and using the Pearson correlation coefficient to compute similarity is used to reconstruct the network. This algorithm combines the simple common neighbor-based method with ideas from the distance-based method. The PPI network is reconstructed from the topological similarity matrix by connecting pairs of genes whose similarities are above a certain threshold. Compared with the original data, the reconstructed data contain some new edges with high topological similarities and lack edges with low topological similarities. Lei et al. have reported that the new protein–protein interactions have high functional relevance and are likely bona fide physical interactions [20]. The PPI network can be regarded as an undirected graph G(V, E), where V is the set of genes and E is the set of interactions. For v
                        ∊
                        V, N(v)={u
                        ∊
                        V|(v, u)∊
                        E} is the set of neighbors of v and d(v)=|N(v)| is the degree of v.


                        RWS is used to compute the topological profiles for each gene. With the basic random walk idea, the probability of an initial gene i to move to its neighbor gene j in the next step is Pij
                        
                        =1/d(i) for (i, j)∊
                        E. When the random walker initiates at a gene v, then the probability of the random walker sitting at gene i at a discrete time point k is

                                    v
                                    ,
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    k
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The stationary probability distribution obtained from the simple random walk cannot be directly used to measure the distance between nodes [21]. Thus, RWS uses two resistances, ε and β. The former is used to differentiate the final convergence status from each gene based on its topology within the PPI network. The latter is used to control the depth of a random walk and avoid the hub gene effect. The probability of a random walker initiating from gene v to take the interaction (i, j) at time point k

In our method, ε and β are set to |V|/|E|
                        2 and 1/|E|, respectively. The topological profiles are obtained for each gene when the RWS algorithm is applied to the original PPI network.

The Pearson correlation coefficients of the topological profiles between all pairs of genes are calculated to represent the topological similarity between two genes. The pairs of genes with similarities that are above a certain threshold are connected to retain the same number of interactions as in the original network in our method. The PPI network is reconstructed from the topological similarity matrix.

A reliable heterogeneous network is then constructed. This network is composed of a PPI network U

The random walk with restart (RWR) [22] algorithm is a common approach to prioritize candidate genes. This algorithm mimics a walker that moves from a seed gene to a randomly selected neighbor gene or returns to seed genes with a probability γ. All genes in the network are ranked by the probability of the random walker reaching this gene. Formally, the random walk with restart can be given by:

@&#RESULTS@&#

Leave-one-out cross-validation is used to compare the proposed algorithm with different algorithms. In each round of cross-validation, one gene–phenotype association is removed. The phenotype and the rest of the genes associated with this phenotype are used as seed nodes. Except for seed nodes, the genes in the PPI network are used as candidate genes. The proposed algorithm is then executed to rank the genes. A disease gene ranked as top 1 is considered a successful prediction. The number of overall successful predictions is used to evaluate the performance of different algorithms. Depending on the genes involved in the ranking, the cross-validation experiment can be categorized into two classes, whole genome evaluation and ab initio evaluation [9]. Whole genome evaluation considers all genes that are unassociated with the query phenotype and then checks how many known disease genes are still ranked as top 1 in the cross-validation. Ab initio evaluation identifies disease genes without any known disease genes for those query phenotypes. For each phenotype entity, all of its gene–phenotype associations are removed. A prediction is considered successful if one of the known causal genes related to the phenotype is ranked as top 1.

Two measures are also used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Assuming N validations, we collect the same number of ranking lists and calculate the number of disease genes ranking first in their corresponding list. Then, we divide this number by N to obtain the fraction of disease genes ranking first and call this fraction precision (PRE). Finally, we calculate the area under the curve (AUC) value below the area of the fraction of disease genes ranking above a particular threshold and the fraction of control genes ranking below this threshold.

In this section, we compare RWRHN with CIPHER [7] and RWRH [8]. Then, we evaluate the performance of RWRHN and test the sensitivities of the parameters. Furthermore, RWRHN is used to predict novel causal genes for 16 diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prostate cancer, and to detect disease-related protein complexes.

The experimental data that we use are the same as the RWRH algorithm. The PPI network contains 34,364 interactions among 8919 genes. The phenotype similarity network includes phenotype similarities for 5080 diseases. In total, 1428 gene–phenotype associations are found between 937 genes and 1216 phenotype entities.

The same number of edges is retained to reconstruct the PPI network in RWRHN. This process adds some new edges with high topological similarities to the PPI network and removes some edges with low topological similarities from the network. The group of edges present in the original PPI network is called the “before group”, and that in the reconstructed PPI network is called the “after group”. Thus, new edges are in the “after group” but not in the before one, and removed edges are in the “before group” but not in the after one. Another version of RWRHN called RWRHN-RE is proposed to further highlight the importance of constructing a reliable heterogeneous network combined with the topological similarity. RWRHN-RE adds the removed edges to the “after group” to reconstruct a new PPI network.

We compare the performance of RWRHN with those of CIPHER and RWRH using whole genome evaluation and ab initio evaluation (γ

                           η
                           =0.5). CIPHER-DN and CIPHER-SP are two versions of CIPHER. Two definitions of topological distance are explored on the basis of two different neighborhood systems: shortest path (SP) and direct neighbor (DN). The overall comparison results of the different algorithms are shown in Table 1
                           . In whole genome evaluation, RWRHN-RE and RWRHN successfully rank 255 disease genes and 247 disease genes as top 1, respectively. By contrast, RWRH, CIPHER-DN, and CIPHER-SP only rank 245, 165, and 153 disease genes at the top, respectively. In ab initio evaluation, RWRHN-RE and RWRHN can predict 204 and 207 disease genes, respectively. Meanwhile, RWRH, CIPHER-DN and CIPHER-SP successfully predict 201, 157, and 140 genes, respectively.

To further highlight the importance of the reliable heterogeneous network, the proposed evaluation criteria in RWRHN and RWRH are calculated (γ
                           =0.7, λ
                           =0.8, η
                           =0.5). These results show that RWRHN-RE, RWRHN, and RWRH achieve the average fraction precision (PRE) rates of 22.05%, 20.67%, and 19.83%, respectively. RWRHN-RE and RWRHN obtain average AUC values of 91.54% and 85.63%, respectively. Although the AUC value is not considerably improved, the fraction precision of potential candidate genes for inherited diseases is improved by the RWRHN algorithm. The PRE and AUC value curves are shown in Fig. 2
                           .

RWRHN has three parameters, namely, γ, λ, and η. The parameter γ is the restart probability. This parameter only slightly affects the results [20]. In this work, γ is fixed at 0.7.

The parameter η controls the impact of seed phenotypes and seed genes. We investigate how this parameter affects the performance of the algorithm. RWRHN is executed with η values ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1, whereas λ is fixed as 0.5 by using leave-one-out cross-validation. As shown in Fig. 3
                           , the performance of the algorithm is measured through whole genome evaluation and ab initio evaluation. The algorithm performs slightly better when η is above 0.5. This result shows that phenotype data functions in prioritizing potential candidate genes for inherited diseases.

The parameter λ is the jumping probability. This parameter controls the reinforcement between the PPI network and the phenotype network. To investigate the effect of this parameter, RWRHN is also executed with λ values ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1, whereas η is fixed as 0.5 by using leave-one-out cross-validation. As shown in Fig. 3, the performance of the algorithm is measured by using whole genome evaluation and ab initio evaluation. The number of successful predictions for both whole genome evaluation and ab initio evaluation increases with increasing λ. Therefore, the optimal values of λ are suggested to be within the wide range of 0.5–0.9. The performance of RWRH is comparatively poor when λ
                           <0.5. In addition, RWRHN is considerably better than RWRH when λ
                           <0.5 (Fig. 3). These results suggest that RWRHN has better stability and accuracy in prioritizing potential candidate genes for inherited diseases.

After validating the algorithm, RWRHN is executed to predict new causing genes for 16 diseases (γ
                           =0.7, λ
                           =0.8, η
                           =0.5). The results are shown in Table 2
                           . The target disease phenotype is used as the seed node. The resulting candidate genes are ranked over the whole genome. The top 10 predictions for each disease are shown in Table 2. The top 20 ranked genes associated with breast cancer (MIM: 114480), diabetes mellitus type 2 (MIM: 125853), and prostate cancer (MIM: 176807) are selected as case studies.

Breast cancer originates from breast tissue, particularly from the inner lining of milk ducts or thelobules that supply milk to the ducts. Table 3
                            shows the prediction results for breast cancer (MIM: 114480). Of the top 10 predicted disease genes, nine genes (BRCA1, PIK3CA, NBN, BRCA2, RAD51, BRIP1, TP53, MSH2, and RB1) associate with breast cancer. The correctness is as high as 90%. However, we investigate whether or not the predicted novel susceptible genes are associated with disease. The novel susceptible genes, which are predicted to be associated with breast cancer by RWRHN, are supported by literature and the GENECARDS database [23]. For MDC1, the tenth ranked gene is expressed as a prognostic marker for nodal recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients [24]. Bonache et al. [25] reported that SHFM1 is bound in mammalian cells to the region of the BRCA2 gene and associated with breast cancer. C11orf30 (EMSY gene) links the BRCA2 pathway to sporadic breast and ovarian cancer [26]. Finally, RNASEL [27] and PTEN [28] genes are found to be related to breast cancer.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by a high blood sugar. Table 3 shows our prediction results for diabetes mellitus type 2 (MIM: 125853). Of the top 10 predicted disease genes, six genes (IPF1, NEUROD1, IRS1, MAPK8IP1, SLC2A4, and IRS2) associate with the phenotype. MAFA, implicated in animal models of type 2 diabetes, is markedly decreased in humans with type 2 diabetes [29]. MAPK8IP2, the IB2 gene, is a novel candidate gene for diabetes [30]. SOCS2, which is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, has been found to contribute to susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population [31]. Finally, INSR [32] and PPP1R3A [33] genes are found to be related to diabetes mellitus.

Prostate cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Table 3 shows our prediction results for prostate cancer (MIM: 176807). Two genes (PTEN and BRCA2) associate with the phenotype. RET, the seventh ranked gene, is involved in the growth of prostate epithelial cells and is overexpressed in prostate cancer [34]. RING1 is associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer [35]. CBX7, as a novel PcG protein controlling the growth of normal cells, is highly expressed in three prostate cancer cell lines and is upregulated in the normal prostate [36]. Finally, the RNASEL [37], ELAC2 [38], ABCE1 [39], CBX4 [40], BMI1 [41], CTBP2 [42], BRCA1 [43], NBN [44], and BRIP1 [45] genes are reported to be related to prostate cancer. These data show that our predictive method can discover novel disease genes beyond the original disease gene set.

Genes sharing some higher-order topological similarities are likely to interact with each other. Combining network-based disease studies, we conclude that genes associated with a particular disease tend to exhibit high connectivity and cluster together [10,46,47]. Many of the highly ranked genes predicted by RWRHN have high-order topological similarities and are likely to cluster together. In addition, these genes may originate from the same disease-related protein complexes. Based on the gene ranking list from Table 4
                           , we investigate three protein complexes, namely, gamma-secretase complex, RUNX1-CBF-beta-DNA complex, and Pex26-Pex6-Pex1 complex, which were extracted from the CORUM database [48]. These complexes are composed of top-ranked genes.

The gamma-secretase complex contains four genes: APH1A, NCSTN, PSEN1, and PSENEN. These four genes are all ranked at top 20 in predicting Alzheimer’s disease (MIM: 104300) by the RWRHN algorithm. The four membrane genes comprise the limiting components of gamma-secretase and co-assemble to form the active enzyme in mammalian cells. These data suggest that the gamma-secretase complex is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [49].

Similarly, the RUNX1-CBF-beta-DNA complex contains two genes: RUNX1 and CBFB. These genes are respectively ranked at top 1 and top 6 in inferring leukemia (MIM: 601626). The RUNX1-CBF-beta-DNA complex is the most common target for mutations in human leukemia [50]. Its structure reveals that the Runt domain DNA binding mechanism is unique within the p53 family of transcription factors. This result indicates that the RUNX1-CBF-beta-DNA complex is a consequence of human disease-associated mutations in leukemogenesis and cleidocranial dysplasia.

The Pex26–Pex6–Pex1 complex contains three genes: Pex26, Pex6, and Pex1. These genes are ranked at top 10 in inferring Zellweger syndrome (MIM: 214100). This result suggests that the Pex26–Pex6–Pex1 complex is involved in peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which include the Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD-ZSD) and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 [51].

These data show that our predicted disease genes and disease-related protein complexes indeed map significantly with complex genetic diseases that are extracted from literature or databases. Combining the network topological similarity with disease phenotype data will facilitate the detection of disease-related protein complexes and will contribute to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the future.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we devise a random walk-based algorithm on the reliable heterogeneous network called RWRHN to prioritize potential candidate genes for inherited diseases. The reliable heterogeneous network is composed of a PPI network reconstructed by topological similarity, a phenotype similarity network and known associations between diseases and genes. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation experiments show that the performance of RWRHN is better than those of CIPHER and RWRH. Another advantage of the RWRHN algorithm is that it is still in good performance when λ
                     <0.5. Finally, RWRHN is used to predict new causal genes for 16 diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prostate cancer and to detect disease-related protein complexes. The top predictions are supported by literature evidence. These data suggest that constructing a reliable heterogeneous network is an effective basis for the prioritization of potential candidate genes for inherited diseases and for the detection of disease-related protein complexes, which is important to improve medical care in the future biomedical research.

The computational methods are highly dependent on the quality of the underlying protein interaction data. These data are often associated with high false positive and false negative rates, which may have a negative impact on the performance in inferring disease genes. It can be integrated some other information with topological similarity to further improve our method, such as protein sequences, molecular function, motif protein localization, biological process, gene expression profiles and so on. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments should also be conducted to validate the novel causal genes, which can assist the treatment of inherited diseases in the future.
