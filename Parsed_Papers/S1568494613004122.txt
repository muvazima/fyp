               Abstract
               
                  After electricity energy market clearing, the network may be operated with a low transient stability margin because of hitting security limits or increasing the contribution of risky participants. Therefore, a new multi-objective model for electricity energy market clearing, considering dynamic security aspect of the power system, is proposed. Indeed, in addition to the economical aspects of electricity markets, i.e. offer cost of generating units, linearized Corrected Transient Energy Margin (CTEM) of system is also considered as new objective function of market clearing problem. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is utilized to solve the multi-objective market clearing problem. The New England test system is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.
