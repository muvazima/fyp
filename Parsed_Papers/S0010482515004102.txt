                  A coding measure scheme numerically translates the DNA sequence to a time domain signal for protein coding regions identification. A number of coding measure schemes based on numerology, geometry, fixed mapping, statistical characteristics and chemical attributes of nucleotides have been proposed in recent decades. Such coding measure schemes lack the biologically meaningful aspects of nucleotide data and hence do not significantly discriminate coding regions from non-coding regions.
                  This paper presents a novel fuzzy semantic similarity measure (FSSM) coding scheme centering on FSSM codons׳ clustering and genetic code context of nucleotides. Certain natural characteristics of nucleotides i.e. appearance as a unique combination of triplets, preserving special structure and occurrence, and ability to own and share density distributions in codons have been exploited in FSSM. The nucleotides׳ fuzzy behaviors, semantic similarities and defuzzification based on the center of gravity of nucleotides revealed a strong correlation between nucleotides in codons. The proposed FSSM coding scheme attains a significant enhancement in coding regions identification i.e. 36–133% as compared to other existing coding measure schemes tested over more than 250 benchmarked and randomly taken DNA datasets of different organisms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is considered as a core material in living species responsible for growth and genetic transfer of traits [1,2]. Genes are the segments of DNA sequence that encode protein. Protein performs most of the functions in organisms. The coding regions (exons) are sequence of nucleotides that actually code for protein while non-coding regions (introns) do not code for protein [3,4]. The coding regions identification is tightly coupled with 1/f background noise which diffuses the boundaries of two regions in such a way that viable discernment of coding regions from non-coding regions is overly hindered. Digital signal processing (DSP) approaches have been widely used in genome sequence analysis especially in area of protein coding regions identification [5,6]. The solutions relying on DSP approaches require the representation of nucleotide bases to numerical values and translation of nucleotides׳ sequences into time domain signals [7–9]. It has been deeply observed [10–12] that coding measure scheme holds a significant contribution in efficient identification of protein coding regions from non-coding regions by suppressing 1/f noise. A large number of such schemes have been proposed by researchers in recent decade.

The first coding measure scheme was proposed by Silverman et al. [13] called as "Tetrahedron mapping scheme". Later Voss [7] presented another coding measure scheme called as "Binary indictor sequence". This scheme was objectively employed [14–16] in DNA sequence analysis using digital signal processing approaches. Later certain drawbacks that appeared as a frequency leakage by application of Voss coding scheme [7] were addressed by Nair et al. [8] proposing a coding measure scheme by replacing the four binary indicator sequences by just one sequence called as "EIIP indicator sequence". The energy of delocalized electrons in amino acids and nucleotides had been calculated as the Electron–ion interaction pseudo potential (EIIP). This coding measure was popularly employed [9,17] for addressing issues involved in DNA sequence analysis and coding regions identification. The significant results shown by the authors [8] based on EIIP indicator sequence was further improved by MK. Hota and VK Srivastava [17] by proposing a new indicator sequence named "Complex indicator sequence". This coding measure scheme has been reviewed as equally significant coding measure scheme [10–12] like EIIP in terms of reducing computational overhead involved in adopting Voss coding scheme for coding regions identification.

Various coding measure schemes proposed so far are mainly based on fixed mapping methods [18–20] chemical property based methods [21,22] and statistical property based [23–25]. Researchers now observe the need to address the inter-nucleotide distance and genetic code context (e.g. nucleotide/amino acid information, compositions and densities of nucleotides, their relevant positions and orders in codons etc.) to propose DNA coding measure schemes. Yin et al. [10] introduced numerical representation of DNA sequences based on the genetic code context in the sequences. The authors mapped 20 amino acids to 20 unique complex numbers. The real parts and imaginary parts of these complex numbers were aided from the specific characteristics of amino acids and a coding measure scheme was proposed. In the same direction, the most recent work has been done by Mujiono et al. [26] to consider inter-nucleotide distance with hierarchical clustering to identify the fractal patterns in DNA sequences. The authors have employed numerical mapping of DNA sequence to digital signal for calculation of inter-nucleotide distance.

Coding measure schemes based on genetic code context would significantly help for DNA sequence analysis and coding regions identification [12]. We could not find a satisfactory work done in the context of DNA coding measure scheme based on genetic code context. Similarly, despite an exhaustive review of literature to seek clustering approaches used for codons׳ clustering, only a few numbers of publications that employed clustering algorithms were noticed. Such approaches (a few examples are [27–39]) were based on distance as a similarity measure to cluster DNA/RNA sequences (none of the approach addresses codon׳s clustering). Mostly hierarchical or K-Means algorithms with their variations have been used to address classification/clustering sequences. The clustering approaches based on such algorithms compute the distance (Euclidean/Edit/Minkowski) between datum and centroid of cluster. Since nucleotides in codons own special biological properties and they preserve their unique structure, the common clustering algorithms based on distance as a similarity measure do not provide gainful applications in codons׳ clustering.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

We propose a novel fuzzy semantic similarity measure (FSSM) coding scheme centering FSSM codons׳ clustering and genetic code context of nucleotides. FSSM owns genetically meaningful characteristics of nucleotides in codons i.e. nucleotides׳ density distribution, specific positions of nucleotides in codons and nucleotides׳ usage in terms of their distribution.

In proposed FSSM, fuzzy rules are applied along with semantic similarity measure of nucleotides in codons. The flowchart of the FSSM is shown in

Defuzzify the center of gravity (COG) for each disjoint cluster given by the expression

A codon is a tri-nucleotide structure based on Adenine, Guanine, Thymine and Cytosine. Naturally, the codons depict fuzzy behavior since the membership values of nucleotides in codons differ depending on density of nucleotides. Some nucleotides express themselves more in one codon cluster while the same nucleotide may have weaker or no strength in other clusters. Such variations can only be described by z-shaped membership in cluster space and Manhattan distance matrix contains the similarity association between heterogeneous and disjoint clusters. Let us consider n codon clusters in a cluster space P (represented in 
                        Fig. 2) defined as P={
                           Cj | j=1, …, s}, where 
                           Cj ∈ ℜ and s≤n.

Natural characteristics of codons in cluster space depict that probability p (r

                        ) of codon C

                           q
                        , C
                        
                           t
                         ∈ P and q, t are repeated segments of length "3" for A⌵T⌵G⌵C and q≠t. Mostly C
                        
                           j
                         contribute a membership factor that helps to find the overlap of density distribution among C
                        
                           j
                         ∈ P. The nature of codon clusters reveal that some of the clusters are totally disjoint while the others share some common density distribution. All clusters other than disjoint clusters in cluster space share some common density distribution. We can define membership values for clusters that share certain densities. For instance, the clusters with nucleotides sharing twice distribution achieve a membership value of "2/3" while those having single contribution achieve a membership of "1/3". The nucleotide which owns no physical contribution for a cluster, receives a membership value "0".

It can be observed that nucleotides in totally disjoint clusters of this matrix have highest membership value "1" in their respective clusters in cluster space while other clusters contain nucleotides with variant correlation factors. For instance, clusters C
                        
                           j
                         {2≤j≤7, j=29, 36} contain 2nd highest membership in cluster space for "Adenine", similarly clusters C
                        
                           k
                         {9≤k≤28, 30≤k≤35, k=61, 63} depict 3rd highest values and clusters C
                        
                           t
                         {37≤t≤60, t=62, 64} hold no membership values for nucleotides in clusters for "Adenine". Similar correlations could be defined for other clusters in cluster space for "Thymine" "Guanine" and "Cytosine",

Further, we investigate membership values, frequency, membership strength, Z-shaped membership factors and nucleotide strength for the sets of major clusters which carry the higher density distribution of nucleotides Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine.


                        
                        Table 2 shows the calculations of nucleotide strength of individual nucleotides with respect to their Z-membership factor and nucleotide density. Binary representation of nucleotide clusters helped to approximate the probabilities of nucleotides as per contributing membership factor. We observed that the product of Z-membership contribution factor with density of nucleotide bestowed the strength of nucleotides for clusters in terms of probability distribution and their membership factors.


                        
                        Fig. 3 presents a comparative analysis between major clusters in terms of correlation membership of nucleotides in corresponding clusters. It was observed that highest concentration of correlation was found in nucleotide patterns (X**, where X ∈ T and T represents portion of all the four clusters for Adenine, Thymine, guanine and Cytosine in the defined cluster space P). An average and weak correlation was noticed for patterns (**X) and (X) in P respectively. Some clusters were found to share same correlation concentration in terms of membership strength and density distribution.


                        
                        Fig. 4 depicts a comparative analysis of fuzzy membership relations among the four nucleotides in terms of contributing fuzzy strength. In these relations, it can be observed that Cluster C
                        1, C
                        2 and C
                        3 carry the same membership strengths for the four nucleotides. Cluster C
                        4, C
                        5, C
                        6 and C
                        7 have diverse strength. Since the fuzzy contributing relationship for these clusters is same for all nucleotides, we need to remove such clusters in cluster space so that our cluster space contains clusters owning dissimilar membership strength.

In this context, applying defuzzification to the center of gravity (COG) (as described in Eq. (4)) for each disjoint cluster yields the coding measure scheme (FSSM) as,

Here Discrimination measure (D) 
                     [8,40–42] represents the ratio between lowest amplitude (peak height) of coding region to the highest amplitude (peak height) of non-coding region in power spectral density estimation of coding and non-coding regions. A prediction method for coding regions identification that depicts higher value of discrimination measure is considered as more accurate than other prediction methods.


                     Sensitivity (Sn) (also called as true positive rate) measures the proportion of the regions correctly identified as coding regions (exons) while Specificity (Sp) (also called as true negative rate) measures the proportion of regions correctly identified as non-coding regions (introns) [15,43–45].


                     Prediction accuracy (P) is another good evaluation measure taken as combination of Sensitivity (Sn) and Specificity (Sp) [46] while approximate correlation (AC) [43] is equally employed as a suitable evaluation measure since sometimes the Prediction accuracy (P) may not ideally discriminate coding regions from non-coding regions due to higher Sensitivity (Sn) of regions against lower Specificity (Sp) and vice versa. Further,

TP (True positive): Number of coding nucleotides correctly identified as coding.

TN (True negative): Number of non-coding nucleotides correctly identified as non-coding.

FP (False positive): Number of non-coding nucleotides falsely identified as coding.

FN (False negative): Number of coding nucleotides falsely identified as non-coding.

We evaluated the performance of different coding measure schemes using two kinds of datasets i.e. benchmarked and randomly taken DNA sequences of various organisms.


                     
                     Table 3 describes the datasets used for performance evaluation of different coding measure schemes. The benchmarked DNA datasets used for experiments are HMR195, S.cerevisiae chromosome III) 
                     [17,43,44,47] and HUMHBB (Human beta globin) [15]. Randomly taken DNA sequences of organisms include Homo sapiens, Serinus canaria, Nicotiana sylvestris, Limulus polyphemus, Felis catus, Vicugna pacos, Meleagris gallopavo, Tursiops truncates, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Cricetulus griseus, Galeopterus variegatus and Nicotiana tomentosiformis. Further, we added certain 1/f noise thresholds (3–5% of signal power) to all datasets for observing coding regions prediction tendency of different coding measure schemes against significant noise suppression. We have compared results between proposed FSSM 
                     [7] and most popular prevailing coding measure schemes i.e. Voss coding measure scheme , EIIP coding measure scheme 
                     [8] and Complex coding measure scheme 
                     [17].

The performance evaluation parameters i.e. discrimination measure, mean values for False Positive rate, specificity, prediction accuracy and approximate correlation have been calculated against different sequences. The proposed FSSM coding scheme depicts a significant discrimination measure that reveals 36–133% gain in identification accuracy as compared with Complex, EIIP and Voss coding measure schemes. A significant minimization of False Positive rate i.e. 87–300% has been achieved against Complex, EIIP and Voss schemes respectively. Similarly, specificity, prediction accuracy and approximate correlations have been considerably increased as compared to existing coding schemes. For instance,


                     
                     Fig. 5 describes the locations of exons found by FSSM coding measure scheme. The NCBI range for these exons is 928–1039, 2528–2857, 4114–4377, 5465–5644 and 7255–7605. FSSM correctly identified these exons in the range as specified by NCBI. Since enhanced identification in protein coding regions is directly related to DNA signal noise suppression and spectral leakage, it is viable that proposed coding measure scheme greatly reduces the noise for a better discrimination in two regions.


                     
                     Fig. 6 shows an optimum discrimination achieved by FSSM coding measure scheme than other existing coding measure schemes. It leads to fact that coding measure schemes based on fixed mapping or statistical property based methods have mostly been developed without taking into account the genetic code context, the nucleotides Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine have been mapped without addressing their proper biological nature and characteristics. On contrary, FSSM coding measure scheme is based on genetic code context and significantly contributes for genome sequence analysis and protein coding regions identification.


                     
                     Fig. 7 describes the performance evaluation of different coding measure schemes. For instance, Fig. 7(A) depicts the mean False Positive rate of coding schemes, Fig. 7(B) shows mean specificity, Fig. 7(C) and (D) presents mean prediction accuracy and mean approximate correlation. It can be observed that the proposed FSSM coding measure scheme outperforms by revealing significant noise suppresison and hence enhances the idnetificiton of coding regions as compared to existing coding measure schemes.

We also estimated false prediction rate to test the performance of coding measure schemes at randomly taken pure long intergenic sequences of organisms H. sapiens (accession: D86244, D86256, D86249) and Mus musculus (accession: BC057046, AJ867251, BC118974).


                     
                     Fig. 8 presents the average false prediction rate for intronic sequences of H. sapiens and Mus Musculus. We can observe a significant reduction in false prediction results achieved by FSSM as compared to other coding measure schemes. Further, a 1/f background noise with a noise threshold (5% of signal power) was added to some selected coding enriched DNA sequences of HMR195 and HUMHBB dataset. An average performance analysis of coding measure schemes in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) was estimated against these noisy sequences.


                     
                     Fig. 9 describes a comparative analysis of different coding measure schemes in view of signal to noise ratio (SNR). It is viable to notice a significant SNR magnitude for proposed FSSM coding measure shceme against other existing coding measure schemes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presented a novel fuzzy semantic similarity measure (FSSM) codons׳ clustering algorithm for DNA coding measure scheme. The FSSM algorithm exploited nucleotides׳ fuzzy membership and their natural characteristics in terms of fuzzy behaviors and semantic similarities revealing a strong correlation between them. The FSSM coding measure scheme achieved significant enhancement in coding regions identification as compared to other existing coding measure schemes. More than 250 benchmarked and randomly taken DNA datasets of different organisms were employed for performance evaluation of coding measure schemes. Since the proposed method outperformed than existing methods in context of coding regions identification, the functions of the codons could be analyzed and utilized significantly for other purposes such as judging the pathogenicity of the single nucleotide variations.
