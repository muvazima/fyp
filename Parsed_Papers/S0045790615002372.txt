                     . Designing such versatile multipliers encounters a number of difficulties. First of all, the element sizes of the supported fields are different from each other, and thus the elements are represented with different number of bits for each field. To deal with different sized elements, designs with left or right justified operands are investigated. Secondly, each field multiplication involves modular reduction with a different irreducible polynomial, and thus the complexity can increase rapidly with the number of supported fields

                     . To prevent this, two methods are studied: Using sparse irreducible polynomials and unifying the modular reduction computation of the fields by choosing the irreducible polynomials suitably. Our work shows that multiple fields can be supported at the cost of an

                     . The digit serial multipliers keep the coefficients of each polynomial operand in an array of digits. One of the operands is multiplied by the digits of the other operand, one digit at a time. Each of these partial product computations is interleaved with a modular reduction step and an accumulation step.

There are several works studying polynomial basis digit serial multipliers in the literature [7–13] but these multipliers have been developed to support a particular field size m. The work in [7] introduces efficient digit serial multipliers using polynomial basis. The work in [11] investigates optimum digit sizes and the effects of using multiple accumulators. The work in [12] proposes using T flip flops in the accumulators instead of D flip flops to reduce the area complexity.

The versatility is an important feature for hardware designs since the ASIC circuits cannot be altered after fabrication. Flexible implementations are possible with reconfigurable FPGA devices but FPGAs cannot compete with the ASIC in terms of performance, cost and power consumption. Naturally, customizable elliptic curve systems [14] and versatile multipliers [15–19] have been proposed in the literature but the proposed multipliers are all bit serial and there is not much work about versatile digit serial multipliers.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic polynomial basis digit serial multipliers supporting a single field size and presents a detailed analysis of their complexities. Section 3 proposes digit serial multiplier architectures supporting multiple field sizes. Some of these work with right justified operands and some of them work with left justified operands. Also, some of these employ separate reduction circuits and some of them employ unified reduction circuits. Section 4 studies the complexities of the proposed multipliers. Section 5 presents a discussion of our results.

                            in general case as seen from Table 1. On the other hand, a t-nomial is a constant coefficient polynomial with t nonzero terms. Since the coefficients are constant, they do not need to be stored. Also, reduction with a t-nomial requires only hardwiring and XORing. This computation is very efficient when t is small. Note that the fast modular reduction in (4) becomes

                           Table 2 gives the time complexities of the multipliers. The delay of the partial product computation dominates the delay of the modular reduction as seen from (5) and (6). Thus, using sparse t-nomial generator polynomials cannot decrease the critical path delay here.

In this section, MSD first multipliers supporting multiple fields are proposed. MSD first multiplication is preferred to LSD first multiplication in the proposed design because the former requires less area than the latter as seen from Table 1.

In this section, the MSD first multiplier in Fig. 1 is modified to support multiple field sizes. The modified multiplier has left justified inputs and output as illustrated in Fig. 3.

When the left justified operands are used instead of the right justified ones, the circuit in Fig. 5 must be replaced with the one in Fig. 7

When the generators are pentanomials, the area requirement and worst case critical path delay can be found as follows.

                         terms (pentanomial). The complexity of the multiplier supporting single field is obtained from Table 1. The complexities of the multipliers supporting multiple fields are obtained by adding the complexities of the three main computations shown in Fig. 4. These three computations and their area requirements are as follows.

                        Table 4 shows that supporting multiple fields instead of a single field does not increase the cost much and working with the left justified operands is slightly advantageous. Also, because the number of the fields 
                           
                              λ

                         is small for the NIST case, using a separate reduction circuit for each field is affordable. The delay of the multipliers supporting the NIST fields can be obtained from (23) by substituting 
                           
                              λ

                        Table 5
                         gives the space and time complexities of several digit serial multipliers. The space complexities of the proposed architectures in the table are obtained from Table 3 by substituting 
                           
                              τ
                           
                         with the upper bounds in (15) and (21). As seen, the complexities of the multipliers supporting a single field are very similar and the usual MSD first multiplier shows one of the best performances.

                        Table 6
                         gives the FPGA implementation results of the usual MSD first multiplier and proposed multipliers. These results were synthesized using Xilinx ISE Webpack version 14.7 for the Xilinx Virtex xc5vlx50-11ff1153. As seen, the areas of the proposed multipliers are not significantly larger than the area of the usual MSD first multiplier, even though they support five NIST fields. However, there is a considerable increase in the minimum clock period. Also, the area needed for the multipliers using unified reduction strategy is larger than the area needed for the ones using separate reduction strategy. This is because the number of the supported fields

                      and 
                        
                           w
                        
                     .

When the multiplication is performed with left justified operands, 
                        
                           w
                           λ
                        
                      AND gates can be saved. However, this is a minor improvement, compared to the overall area requirements. The improvement is obtained because the left justified alignment eases the modular reduction.

Also, unifying the modular reductions of the supported fields decreases the area requirements for large 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     . To unify the modular reductions, the modulus polynomials are chosen so that their trailing coefficients can be nonzero only for the same 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      terms. Then, the modular reduction involves only these 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      terms, and thus gets easier. However, 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      must be large enough so that the irreducible modulus polynomials can be found for the chosen 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      terms easily. For this, 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      must be at least as large as the logarithms of the supported field sizes as shown in this work.
