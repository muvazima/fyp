                  The determination of security returns will be associated with the validity of the corresponding portfolio selection models. The complexity of real financial market inevitably leads to diversity of types of security returns. For example, they are considered as random variables when available data are enough, or they are considered as uncertain variables when lack of data. This paper is devoted to solving such a hybrid portfolio selection problem in the simultaneous presence of random and uncertain returns. The variances of portfolio returns are first given and proved based on uncertainty theory. Then the corresponding mean-variance models are introduced and the analytical solutions are obtained in the case with no more than two newly listed securities. In the general case, the proposed models can be effectively solved by Matlab and a numerical experiment is illustrated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Portfolio selection problem is to consider how to allocate the fund among the candidate set of risky securities to maximize return and to minimize risk. Since it was originated by Markowitz (1952), there has been a large number of literature to be devoted to developing the problem. Same as the framework of Markowitz’s mean-variance model, most of the works are undertaken to measure the investment return and risk by expected value and variance of return of an portfolio, respectively. In spite of the computational difficulty, the model is still successfully applied in reality and stimulate the development of finance.

In portfolio theory, the security returns are considered as random variables and their characteristics such as expected value and variance are calculated based on the sample of available historical data. It remains valid when there are plenty of data such as in the developed financial market. However, there may be lack of enough transaction data in some emerging markets. In the situation, some researchers regarded security returns as fuzzy variables estimated by experienced experts, and developed fuzzy portfolio optimization theory. More specifically, fuzzy portfolio optimization has been studied based on three different methods: fuzzy set theory (Gupta, Mehlawat, & Saxena, 2008), possibility theory (Carlsson, Fullér, & Majlender, 2002; Zhang, Wang, Chen, & Nie, 2007) and credibility theory (Huang, 2006; Qin, Li, & Ji, 2009).

Although fuzzy portfolio optimization provided alternatives to estimate security returns when lack of data, fuzzy theory suffers from criticism since a paradox will appear when fuzzy variable is used to describe the security returns (see Huang & Ying, 2013). In order to better describe the subjective imprecise quantity, Liu (2007) established uncertainty theory as another alternative way to estimate indeterministic quantities subject to experts’ estimations. Based on this framework, much works are undertaken to develop the theory (Chen & Dai, 2011; Gao, 2009; Yao, 2012; You, 2009) and related practical applications (Li, Peng, & Zhang, 2013; Liu, 2010b; 2013; Qin & Kar, 2013). In particular, uncertainty theory is also applied to model portfolio selection. Qin, Kar, and Li (2015) first considers mean-variance model in uncertain environment. After that, Huang (2012) established a risk index model for uncertain portfolio selection, and Huang and Ying (2013) further employed the criterion to consider portfolio adjusting problem. Different from risk index model, Liu and Qin (2012) presented semiabsolute deviation of uncertain variable to measure risk and formulated the corresponding return-risk models, and Qin, Kar, and Zheng (In Press) employed the concept to describe and model portfolio adjusting problem. In addition to these single-period optimization models, Huang and Qiao (2012) also modeled the multi-period problem, and Zhu (2010) founded the uncertain optimal control and applied it to solve a continuous-time uncertain portfolio selection problem.

Whether the classical portfolio selection or fuzzy/uncertain one, security returns are considered as the same type of variables. In other words, security returns are assumed to be either random variables or fuzzy/uncertain variables. As stated above, the former makes use of the historical data and the latter makes use of the experiences of experts. However, the actual situation is that the securities having been listed for a long time have yielded a great deal of transaction data. For these “existing” securities, statistical methods are employed to estimate their returns, which implies that it is reasonable to assume that security returns are random variables. For some newly listed securities, there are lack of data or there are only insufficient data which cannot be used to effectively estimate the returns. Therefore, the returns of these newly listed securities need to be estimated by experts and thus are considered as uncertain variables. If an investor faces as such complex situation with simultaneous appearance of random and uncertain returns, how should he/she select a desirable portfolio to achieve some objectives? This paper attempts to consider the hybrid portfolio selection problem and establish mathematical models by means of uncertain random variable which was proposed by Liu (2013a) for modeling complex systems with not only uncertainty but also randomness. Based on this spirit, uncertain random programming is studied by Liu (2013b) and extended by Zhou, Yang, and Wang (2014), also applied to graph and network (Liu, 2014), risk analysis (Liu & Ralescu, 2014) and so on.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the necessary preliminaries related to uncertain measure, uncertain variable and uncertain random variable. Section 3 in detail describes the problem and notations and then gives two assumptions which are commonly used in portfolio analysis. Further, the formulas of variances of portfolio returns are given and proved. Section 4 considers the formulations of mean-variance models and discusses the solution procedures. A numerical experiment is illustrated to the application of the proposed models in Section 5. Finally, some conclusions are given in Section 6.

In this section, uncertain measure, uncertain variable and uncertain random variable are introduced for the completeness of the paper. More details about existing measures of uncertainties the readers may consult (Liu, 2012). In 2007, Liu (2007) proposed the concept of uncertain measure to indicate the belief degree that a possible event happens. Let

                      be a σ-algebra on a nonempty set Γ.

                           −1(α) is called the inverse uncertainty distribution of ξ if it exists and is unique for each α ∈ (0, 1).

Inverse uncertainty distribution plays a crucial role in the operations of independent uncertain variables. Next we introduce some commonly used uncertainty distributions. An uncertain variable is called linear if it has a linear uncertainty distribution

It follows from Definition 6 that random variables and uncertain variables are special cases of uncertain random variables. If η is a random variable and τ is an uncertain variable, then the sum η + τ and the product ητ are both uncertain random variables.

                           the number of existing risky securities which have enough historical data

the number of newly listed risky securities which are lack of historical data

Mean-variance model aims at finding out the most desirable portfolio only by the first two moments. Expected value of the total return is regarded as the investment return, and the variance is used to measure the investment risk. A typical mean-variance model is to compromise between risk and return. For example, we may choose a portfolio with minimum investment risk on the condition that the acceptable return level is given. Suppose that

                     0 is the acceptable return level and the second constraint ensures that the net expected return is exactly equal to the return level μ
                     0.

We may also choose a portfolio with maximum investment return on the condition that the tolerable risk level is given. The detailed formulation is as follows,

In practice, the investor does not always know how to set μ
                     0 and ν
                     0. An alternative is to provide a factor representing the risk aversion by trading off return and risk. Thus, we can establish the following compromise model,

Next, we consider the solution procedures of the proposed models. We first give the third assumption.

                        Assumption 3
                        The covariance matrix Σ is positive definite and the expectation 
                              μ
                            is not a multiple of 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 m
                                 ′
                              
                           .


                           Assumption 3 guarantees a nondegenerate situation and implies that all the existing securities are indeed risky. The detailed remark can be found in Steinbach (2001). Based on Assumption 3, we write

                           2, i.e., the variances are same for two newly listed securities. Then investors generally prefer the security with larger expected return. Therefore, the security with smaller expected return is naturally not considered and the problem is reduced to the one in Example 1.

Let m = 1. That is, we consider a simplified portfolio selection problem with one existing security and two newly listed ones with different risks.

                           which implies that the existing security is not selected if it has the same expected return with the newly listed securities regardless of its variance.

Next we consider the case that the number n of newly listed securities is more than 2. First note that the rank of matrix 
                        pp
                     ′ is no more than 1 which implies that the solution of simultaneous Eqs. (13)–(15) is either no solution or infinitely many solutions. In the latter case, we may find the stationary point to further obtain the optimal solution because of the convexity of the proposed models. We also may directly solve the original problem since the proposed models are convex quadratic programmings, which can be solved by available softwares such as Matlab.

In this section, a numerical experiment is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed models. The existing securities are from Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the codes of randomly chosen 20 stocks are shown in Table 1
                     . The analyzed transaction data of the 20 stocks are from January 29, 2010 to April 1, 2014 and 51 monthly return rates are obtained for each stock. From these data, the sample mean vector 
                        μ
                      and covariance matrix Σ are computed and they are shown in Tables 1 and 2
                     , respectively. Suppose that there are five newly listed stocks and their monthly return rates are estimated by experts based on the available information. Without loss of generality, suppose that the return rates are denoted by zigzag uncertain variables. The simulated data are shown in Table 3
                      including their expected values and variances.

Next, we consider Model (9). In many security markets, short selling is not allowed. In this case, we need to added the constraint of nonnegativity. Model (9) is reformulated as follows,

                      can be found in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Obviously, it is a convex quadratic programming. We employ the function “quadprog” function in Matlab to solve it. The computational results are listed in Table 4
                      which shows the investment proportions of the selected stocks for each given return level μ
                     0. The last column of Table 4 refers to the minimum variance of all possible portfolios for each given return level. Further, the efficient frontier is obtained and depicted in a solid line in Fig. 2
                     . In this figure, the vertical axis represents the given return level and the horizontal axis represents the corresponding minimum variance.

We also employ Model (12) to construct the desirable portfolio by changing the factor of risk aversion. In fact, we can obtain the same optimal portfolio by adjusting the selections of parameters μ
                     0 and ϕ. In order to highlight it, we solve Model (12) by using quadprog function for different values of ϕ. From Fig. 2, it is easy to see that the efficient frontier of Model (12) is the same as that of Model (20).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Different from separate indeterministic environment such as stochastic or fuzzy/uncertain situation, this paper considered the complex situation in which some securities possess a great deal of transaction data and the others are newly listed with insufficient data. The corresponding returns were assumed to be random variables and uncertain variables, respectively. This paper first deduced the formulas of variances of hybrid portfolio returns based on two assumptions, and then formulated mean-variance models. The analytical solutions were given in the case of no more than two newly listed securities. Other cases could be solved by using Matlab such as quadprog function. A numerical experiment was illustrated to the application of the proposed method. The computational results indicate that the proposed models are meaningful and able to be applied in reality.
