                  In order to simulate the uncertainty associated with impression or vagueness, a decision maker may give her/his judgments by means of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in the process of decision making. The study of their consistency becomes a very important aspect to avoid a misleading solution. Based on the reciprocity property, this paper proposes a new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. The new definition is different from that reduced by consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations proposed by Buckley (1985). The properties of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in the light of the new definition are studied in detail. In addition, the shortcomings of the proof procedure of the proposition given by Wang and Chen (2008) are pointed out. And the proposition is reproved by using the new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. Finally, using the (n
                     −1) restricted comparison ratios, a method for obtaining consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations is proposed, and an algorithm is shown to make a consistent decision ranking. Numerical results are further calculated to illustrate the new definition and the obtained algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the extensively used multi-criteria decision making methods (Golden, Wasil, & Harker, 1989; Vaidya & Kumar, 2006). A number of scholars have paid their attention to the theoretical study of AHP (Carlos, Costa, & Vansnick, 2008; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, 2009, 2009; Fan & Zhang, 2010; Herrera-Viedma, Chiclana, Herrera, & Alonso, 2007; Prez, Cabrerizo, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010; Saaty & Shang, 2011; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012; Wang & Chin, 2011). It is seen that the conventional AHP cannot process imprecise or vague knowledge. Zadeh (1965) introduced fuzzy set theory, to rationalize uncertainty associated with impression or vagueness in a manner analogous to human thought. The conventional AHP was extended to deal with the hierarchical problem, where a decision maker may express his/her opinions by means of triangular fuzzy numbers (Van Laarhoven & Pedrycz, 1983; Wagenknecht & Hartmann, 1983). Buckley (1985) proposed trapezoidal judgments in the AHP method to model subjective uncertainty. Saaty and Vargas (1987) made the elements in preference relations be interval numbers. Recently, the Fuzzy AHP, a fuzzy extension of AHP, has been widely studied by many researchers, such as Mikhailov (2003), Ohnishi, Dubois, Prade, and Yamanoi (2006), Entani and Sugihara (2012), Liu, Zhang, and Wang (2012), Rezaei, Ortt, and Scholten (2013), and Rezaei and Ortt (2013).

As shown in the above mentioned works, the key to a reasonable decision is how to obtain the reliable weights or rankings from preference relations. Consequently it is very important to study the consistency of the corresponding preference relations. That is to say, one should know how to define, check and improve their consistency. Consistency is a cardinal transitivity in the strength of preferences. It represents the idea that the comparison ratio of two alternatives (criteria) obtained through a direct comparison should be equivalent to that obtained by using an indirect comparison of a chain of alternatives (criteria). As a part of the AHP procedure, a consistency check is required to ensure the decision making be reasonable. When a preference relation fails to pass the consistency test, the decision maker has to redo the ratios or adjust the given preference relation. Along this line, Saaty (1980) gave a definition of a consistent reciprocal preference relation, and proposed a consistency index and a consistency ratio to measure the level of inconsistency of reciprocal preference relations. A convergent iterative algorithm was developed by Xu and Wei (1999) to improve the consistency of a reciprocal preference relation. On the other hand, the definitions of multiplicative and additive consistent complementary preference relations have been given in Tanino (1984). Herrera-Viedma, Herrera, Chiclana, and Luque (2004) further addressed a method to construct an additive consistent complementary preference relation by using a set of (n
                     −1) preference data. In addition, the internal consistency of complementary preference relations was studied in Chiclana, Herrera, and Herrera-Viedma (2002). An analysis method was presented in Ma, Fan, Jiang, Mao, and Ma (2006) to identify the inconsistency and weak transitivity of a complementary preference relation and to repair its inconsistency to reach weak transitivity. In the Fuzzy AHP, Buckley (1985) first defined a consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relation, which was a direct extension of the definition of consistent reciprocal preference relations (Saaty, 1980). Furthermore, when there exists a set of crisp relative weights within the feasible region, a preference relation with fuzzy numbers was considered to be consistent (Arbel, 1989; Leung & Cao, 2000; Salo, 1996; Wang, Yang, & Xu, 2005; Xu & Chen, 2008). It was followed that linear and non-linear fuzzy preference programming methods were applied to obtain optimal crisp priorities from triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations (Mikhailov, 2003). This non-linear method was further improved by considering the reciprocity property of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Rezaei et al. (2013). Additionally, Liu (2009) proposed the definitions of consistent and acceptably consistent interval multiplicative preference relations and compared them with that given in Wang et al. (2005). A consistent interval complementary preference relation was further defined in Liu, Zhang, and Fu (2012), which was compared with that shown in Xu and Chen (2008). Moreover, based on the definition of consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Buckley (1985), the proposition of the additive consistent property was further given in Wang and Chen (2008).

This paper focuses on the consistency of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. We first analyze the proposition given by Wang and Chen (2008), which is based on the definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations (Buckley, 1985). It is found that some shortcomings are existing in the proof procedure of the proposition (Wang & Chen, 2008). But the numerical results in Wang and Chen (2008) are identical with those given in Kahraman, Ruan, and Dogan (2003). The above phenomenon makes us further study the definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations reduced by the consistent fuzzy ones in Buckley (1985). As shown in Dubois (2011), the definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations cannot be obtained by using a direct extension of consistent reciprocal preference relations in Saaty (1980). From the consistency definition in Buckley (1985), one can see that the consistency is valid among the upper triangular elements of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations and among the lower triangular ones, respectively. Moreover, we find that the consistency is invalid between the lower triangular elements and the upper triangular ones. And we point out that the consistency should be based on the reciprocity property, which is similar to the definition of consistent reciprocal preference relations in Saaty (1980). Then, a new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations is further proposed, and the corresponding properties are studied in detail. It is interesting to find that based on the new definition, the proposition given in Wang and Chen (2008) is satisfied. A new method for constructing a triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation with consistency is further proposed by making use of the (n
                     −1) restricted comparison ratios, and a new algorithm is given to make a consistent decision ranking. As compared with those in Buckley (1985) and Wang and Chen (2007, 2008), the main novelties of the present work have the following three aspects. First, we propose a new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, which overcomes the shortcomings of the definition of consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Buckley (1985). The drawbacks in the proof procedure of the proposition in Wang and Chen (2008) are shown and the proposition is reproved correctly. Second, based on the new definition, the properties of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations are studied in detail. Third, we further give a new definition of consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, and the similar properties can be also obtained.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the preliminaries. In Section 3, we analyze the definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations and the proposition in Wang and Chen (2008). New definitions of consistent triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations are proposed and the properties are studied in detail in Section 4. Section 5 shows a method of constructing a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation from the (n
                     −1) restricted pairwise comparisons and an algorithm of making consistent decision rankings. In Section 6, an example is carried out to illustrate the new definition and algorithm. The main conclusions are given in Section 7.

In the process of decision making, especially in the AHP, a preference relation is the most common representation of information, because it is a useful tool in modeling decision processes. A preference relation implies that a decision maker is required to compare every pair of alternatives (criteria) to give a preference ratio. In what follows, let us firstly recall the reciprocal preference relation given by Saaty (1980).

A reciprocal preference relation A on a set of alternatives (criteria) X
                     ={x
                     1,
                     x
                     2,…,
                     x
                     
                        n
                     } is presented by a matrix A
                     ⊂
                     X
                     ×
                     X, A
                     =(a
                     
                        ij
                     )
                        n×n
                     , where a
                     
                        ij
                      is the comparison ratio of the alternatives (criteria) x
                     
                        i
                      to x
                     
                        j
                     . Saaty (1980) suggested that one may measure a
                     
                        ij
                      by using the (1−9) scale. That is, a
                     
                        ij
                     
                     =1 indicates that x
                     
                        i
                      is equivalent to x
                     
                        j
                     ; a
                     
                        ij
                     
                     =9 means that x
                     
                        i
                      is absolutely preferred to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           ;
                           
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 ij
                              
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 1
                              
                              
                                 9
                              
                           
                        
                      implies that x
                     
                        j
                      is absolutely preferred to x
                     
                        i
                     . The preference relation A is typically assumed to have the reciprocity property of a
                     
                        ij
                     
                     ·
                     a
                     
                        ji
                     
                     =1 for ∀i, j
                     =1,2,…,
                     n. Moreover, the definition of consistent reciprocal preference relations is stated as follows:
                        Definition 1
                        A reciprocal preference relation A
                           =(a
                           
                              ij
                           )
                              n×n
                            is consistent if a
                           
                              ij
                           
                           =
                           a
                           
                              ik
                           
                           a
                           
                              kj
                            for ∀i, j, k
                           =1,…,
                           n.

On the other hand, in modeling imprecise judgments, reciprocal preference relations cannot perfectly reflect the expert opinions. To rationalize uncertainty associated with impression or vagueness, fuzzy set theory is feasible (Zadeh, 1965). Fuzzy set theory treats vague data as possibility distributions in terms of set memberships, such as interval numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and so on. Triangular fuzzy numbers are one of the major components. A decision maker will give the possible maximum point, the maximum possible point and the possible minimum point in comparing each pair of alternatives (criteria) (Van Laarhoven & Pedrycz, 1983). They are corresponding to the upper bound, the median value and the lower bound of a triangular fuzzy number, respectively. Triangular fuzzy numbers can be given by using some known methods (Zhang, Zhang, & Xu, 2010) and they possess the following basic features (Dubois & Prade, 1980).

It is important to study the consistency of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in decision making in order to avoid a misleading solution. In the next section, the consistent definition in Buckley (1985) and the proposition given in Wang and Chen (2008) will be analyzed.

Now we pay attention to the consistency of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. Note that a consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relation has been defined as follows (Buckley, 1985):

                      are triangular fuzzy numbers. If some flat fuzzy numbers are employed, then the fuzzy hierarchical analysis is an extension of the classical hierarchical analysis. Definition 2 is considered to be a definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Wang and Chen (2008). Comparing Definitions 2 with 1, one can easily find that Definition 2 is an apparent extension of Definition 1. However, as pointed out by Dubois (2011), one cannot obtain the definition of consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relation by using a direct extension of consistent reciprocal preference relation. Furthermore, since consistency is a cardinal transitivity in the strength of preferences, the consistent relations of

Now we pay attention to the consistent relations between the upper triangular elements and the lower triangular ones. Making use of the operation laws of triangular fuzzy numbers, Eq.

Consequently based on Definition 2, Proposition 4 is defective in theory. In what follows, we further explain the drawbacks of the proof procedure of Proposition 4 in Wang and Chen (2008). It is attributed to the fact that the inverse of triangular fuzzy number subtraction is not its addition, which is different from the operation laws of crisp values. For example, according to the operation laws of triangular fuzzy numbers, application of

From the above analyses, one can see that there exist some shortcomings in the definition of consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations proposed by Buckley (1985) and the proof procedure of Proposition 4 in Wang and Chen (2008). It is further pointed out that the definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations should be based on the reciprocity property. Consequently, it is requisite to propose a new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations and study the corresponding properties.

In this section, by using the reciprocity property, consistent triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations will be defined respectively. Moreover, the properties of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations will be studied in detail.

Now we propose a new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. Prior to the consideration, it is convenient to construct three preference relations A

                        Definition 3 is based on the following several considerations. First, since consistency is a cardinal transitivity and means that the judgements of the decision maker are perfect, Definition 3 shows the transitivity of the triangular elements by utilizing the transitivity of the lower bounds, the median values and the upper bounds. Second, Definition 3 naturally reflects the reciprocity property of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation, which has been used successfully in Rezaei et al. (2013) to improve the non-linear fuzzy preference programming method proposed by Mikhailov (2003). Third, the new definition is closely related to the typical one of consistent reciprocal preference relations given by Saaty (1980). Fourth, applying Definition 3, it is seen that a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation can be easily checked.

As shown in Definition 3, a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation can be reduced to a consistent reciprocal preference relation when all triangular fuzzy numbers become real numbers.

Moreover, to compare with those definitions of consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Arbel (1989), Leung and Cao (2000) and Salo (1996), it is also found that a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation obtained from Definition 3 must satisfy the conditions of the consistent definitions based on the feasible region method. If the feasible region is empty, triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations must be inconsistent by using Definition 3.

Furthermore, one can give a new definition of consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations as follows.

                               is said to be a consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relation.

In the next subsection, we will mainly focus on the properties of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. The similar properties of consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations can be also given and omitted here for saving spaces.

Using the new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, we further study the properties in detail.

                         is consistent. It presents that the consistency of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation has the property of robustness.

                        , constructed through (16) from two consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, has the consistent property. Additionally, Theorem 3 can be extended to the following general theorem:

In the above section, the new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations and their properties have been studied. However, it is very difficult to obtain a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation in decision making. The reason is that establishing a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation, one should make 
                        
                           
                              
                                 n
                                 ×
                                 (
                                 n
                                 -
                                 1

                      consistent judgments for a level with n alternatives. And the number of consistent judgments will increase greatly when the number of alternatives (criteria) is rising. Due to the limitations of human thinking, one always cannot make all the judgements be consistent, especially when the number of alternatives (criteria) is large. Consequently, a triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation generated in decision making is usually inconsistent. In order to make a consistent decision, one of the valid methods is to reduce the number of evaluating the judgements. Here we propose a method of constructing a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation from (n
                     −1) restricted comparison ratios, which is similar to those given in Harker (1987), Herrera-Viedma et al. (2004) and Wang and Chen (2007, 2008).

                     −1) pairwise comparisons. In such a way, we can facilitate a decision maker to give the expression of a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation in decision making. It should be pointed out that, as shown in the above procedure, the given (n
                     −1) pairwise comparisons are random and should form a complete comparison chain of n alternatives. Moreover, the obtained consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation is independent of the selected particular pairs when the decision maker’s judgments are consistent.

In the end, based on the method of constructing a consistency triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation, a new algorithm of obtaining the ranking of alternatives is expressed as follows:
                        
                           
                              Step 1: Hierarchical structure construction. Place the goal of the desired problem on the top layer of the hierarchical structure, the evaluation criterion on the second layer {c
                              1,c
                              2,…,
                              c
                              
                                 m
                              }, and the alternatives on the bottom layer X
                              ={x
                              1,
                              x
                              2,…,
                              x
                              
                                 n
                              }.


                              Step 2: Proposing the ratios of the pairwise comparison. According to every evaluation criteria or the goal of desired problem, a decision maker compares among alternatives or criteria to give (n
                              −1) values or (m
                              −1) in every triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation.

                              Step 6: Ranking alternatives. The final weight values of alternatives are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers. Note that many researchers have proposed the methods of ranking fuzzy numbers, such as, the fuzzy mean and spread method (Lee & Li, 1988), the Fuzzy critical path method (Yao & Lin, 2000), the centroid index ranking approach (Yager, 1980; Yager & Dimitar, 1999), the context-dependent method (Yager, Detyniecki, & Meunier, 2001). Obviously, the above methods can all be used in the present study. Here the fuzzy mean and spread method (Lee & Li, 1988) is adopted to obtain a formula of ranking triangular fuzzy numbers as follows:

As shown in the above algorithm, the new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations is applied to make a consistent decision-making. Different from those in Wang and Chen (2007, 2008), here we point out that the given (n
                     −1) pairwise comparisons are random and they should form a complete comparison chain of n alternatives. And we construct a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation by using Definition 3. Moreover, we have found that the proof procedure of Proposition 4 in Wang and Chen (2008) has some shortcomings, and Proposition 4 has been reproved correctly. By the way, based on Definition 4, an algorithm for obtaining the ranking of alternatives can be determined similarly when the decision maker evaluates her/his judgements by using the (n
                     −1) restricted trapezoidal comparisons.

In order to illustrate the proposed algorithm, in this section we carry out a numerical examples and compare with the results by using the existing procedures. As shown in Kahraman et al. (2003) and Wang and Chen (2008), an automobile manufacturer NEKYEK is considering to invest a new factory and must select the optimum location from various alternatives. The criteria considered in this decision are environmental regulation (ER), host community (HC), competitive advantage (CA) and political risk (PR). The location alternatives are Istanbul (P1), Ankara (P2) and Izmir (P3). Fig. 1
                      shows the hierarchy structure. The triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations for the four criterion with respect to the best facility (BF) and all the alternatives with respect to ER, HC, CA and PR are given by a decision maker as follows respectively:

As given in Table 1
                     , the triangular fuzzy weights are obtained by utilizing (18). And the global triangular fuzzy weights of alternatives are determined from (19). One can see from the defuzzification values that the ranking of three alternatives is P3≻
                     P2≻
                     P1. The obtained result is in accordance with those given by Kahraman et al. (2003) and Wang and Chen (2008). Obviously, the selected pairwise comparisons are random and the method is different from that in Wang and Chen (2008). In the end, it is very important to point out that one can obtain five consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the process of decision making, a decision maker may give her/his judgments by means of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, which is suitable to simulate uncertainty associated with impression or vagueness. This paper focuses on the consistency analysis of triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. We have pointed out the drawbacks of the definition of consistent fuzzy reciprocal preference relations in Buckley (1985). A new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations has been presented, and the properties have been studied in detail. It is interesting to find that the proof procedure of Proposition 4 in Wang and Chen (2008) exists some shortcomings. And Proposition 4 has been further reproved by using the new definition of consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. A method has been given to obtain a consistent triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation from the (n
                     −1) restricted pairwise comparisons. An algorithm has been proposed to make consistent decision rankings. Numerical results have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the new definition and the proposed algorithm. By the way, the new definition of consistent trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations has been given, and the similar properties and algorithm can be obtained similarly.

In the future, we will study the acceptable consistency of triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy reciprocal preference relations. And we will also address its applications in different practical problems with a group of experts.
