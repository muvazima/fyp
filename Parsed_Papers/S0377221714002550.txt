                  We consider parallel machine scheduling problems where the processing of the jobs on the machines involves two types of objectives. The first type is one of two classical objective functions in scheduling theory: either the total completion time or the makespan. The second type involves an actual cost associated with the processing of a specific job on a given machine; each job-machine combination may have a different cost. Two bi-criteria scheduling problems are considered: (1) minimize the maximum machine cost subject to the total completion time being at its minimum, and (2) minimize the total machine cost subject to the makespan being at its minimum. Since both problems are strongly NP-hard, we propose fast heuristics and establish their worst-case performance bounds.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In traditional scheduling theory, most problems are concerned with the minimization of certain functions of the completion times of the jobs. This type of objectives relate in certain ways to customer satisfaction since they tend to result in schedules that have either early completion times or on-time completions of the jobs. In reality, there are other important aspects in the evaluation of schedules, namely, aspects that are related to the machines themselves. When a job is assigned to a machine, the assignment results in a cost (or profit) that depends on the job as well as on the machine. The machines’ objective may be the minimization of the total cost incurred by all the machines or the maximum cost incurred by any machine.

This type of multi-criteria scheduling problem occurs nowadays quite often in manufacturing as well as in services industries. Consider, for example, a manufacturing company with multiple plants in different locations. The production cost of a customer order at one plant may be completely different from the production cost at another plant. The company has to worry about the timing of the production (in order to provide good customer service) as well as the production cost (in order for the company to remain profitable).

In the services industries also, such multi-criteria scheduling problems have become more and more important in recent years. Consider, for example, an organization that provides professional services and has, say, m service providers (e.g., medical doctors, teams of consultants, lawyers, etc.) and n tasks (e.g., patients, projects, legal cases, etc.). Each task has to be handled by one of the service providers. A service provider could be regarded as a “machine” and a task may be regarded as a “job”. The service providers in such an environment are typically not identical, i.e., different providers have different skill sets and different experience levels and charge therefore differently. The tasks may also be different in such a way that each may require a provider with a specific skill set. From the organization’s point of view (e.g., a clinic, a consulting company, a legal firm, etc.), the objective is to minimize the total completion time of the tasks or to minimize the latest completion time so as to increase the clients’ satisfaction levels, while at the same time minimize the total service providers’ cost in order to maximize the organization’s profit or minimize the maximum profit of any service provider in order to balance the profits over the service providers. Balancing the profits of the service providers is an important goal in maintaining the morale of the employees in the company.

Clearly, the framework considered in this paper applies to any organization that has to assign a resource to a specific task or project while taking into account objectives related to customer satisfaction levels as well as objectives related to the costs of utilization of resources.

In this paper we consider such bi-criteria scheduling problems with the second objective (either maximum machine cost or total machine cost) to be minimized subject to the constraint that the first objective (either makespan or total completion time) is at its minimum.

Many papers have dealt with bi- or multi-objective scheduling problems and there are several survey papers in this area. T’kindt and Billaut (2001) and T’kindt and Billaut (2006) presented a review on scheduling problems with various different machine environments including single machine, parallel machines, and flowshop environments. Hoogeveen (2005) paid more attention to due-date related objectives and scheduling with controllable processing times. Lei (2009) provided a more recent review. Nonetheless, most research initiatives focused on two or more scheduling objectives that are all related to the customers’ perspectives. Thus, all the objectives are typically functions of the completion times.

Typical examples are papers that focus on minimizing two traditional scheduling objectives. Smith (1956) considered a single machine scheduling problem to minimize the total completion time subject to the constraint that all jobs should be completed at their due dates or before. Leung and Young (1989) studied a parallel machine scheduling problem to minimize the makespan subject to the constraint that the total completion time is at its minimum. Leung and Pinedo (2003) considered a parallel machine scheduling problem to minimize the total completion time subject to the constraint that the makespan is at its minimum.

Multi-objective scheduling can be found in many different settings. There are studies on agent scheduling problems that focus on multiple objectives which agents selfishly optimize; see, for example, Agnetis, Mirchandani, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2004), Agnetis, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2007), Lee, Choi, Leung, and Pinedo (2009) and Leung, Pinedo, and Wan (2010). Distributed scheduling can also lead to multi-objective scheduling problems in which each job’s objective as well as the overall objective function are optimized at the same time. Several other papers focus on coordination mechanisms; see, for example, Lee, Leung, and Pinedo (2011) and Lee, Leung, and Pinedo (2012).

In the scheduling literature, there are two streams of research that deal with service providers’ objectives. The first and most popular stream involves a machine activation cost. The number of machines used is a variable and the overall objective is to minimize the sum of a traditional scheduling objective (e.g., makespan) and the cost of activating machines; see, for example, Imreh and Noga (1999) and Dòsa and He (2004).

Another approach assumes a machine assignment cost. When a job is scheduled on a machine, a machine assignment cost is incurred. In most cases, the objective is either the sum of a scheduling objective and the total machine assignment cost or a prioritization of the two objectives; see, for example, Shmoys and Tardos (1993), Vignier, Sonntag, and Portmann (1999), T’kindt, Billaut, and Proust (2001), Khuller, Li, and Saha (2010), and Leung, Lee, and Pinedo (2012). Khuller et al. (2010) considered a problem with machine activation cost as well as machine assignment cost. Shmoys and Tardos (1993) formulated a general bi-objective scheduling problem with machine assignment costs as a generalized assignment problem. They considered a prioritization of the two objectives and provided an approximation approach by combining a linear programming algorithm with a rounding technique. Leung et al. (2012) described a bi-objective scheduling problem to minimize the scheduling objective and the total machine assignment cost at the same time. The makespan and the total completion time were considered as scheduling objectives and both non-preemptive and preemptive versions were dealt with. They considered weighted combinations of the two objectives as well as prioritizations of the two objectives. They restricted themselves to an analysis of the problems in terms of their time complexity under different assumptions; they proved NP-hardness for some cases and presented polynomial time algorithms for other cases.

In this paper, we will follow in our problem formulations the framework presented in Leung et al. (2012). However, we consider several aspects that are different. Unlike Leung et al. (2012), we only focus on a prioritization of objectives, which implies that we try to optimize one objective first and then try to optimize the second one with the first one being at its minimum. Also, we develop approximation algorithms with their worst-case performance analyses.

In Section 2, we formally describe the problem and introduce notations. We provide in Section 3 approximation algorithms for the problem in which the total completion time and maximum machine cost have to be minimized. We present in Section 4 approximation algorithms for minimizing the makespan and the total machine cost. We conclude the paper in the last section with a discussion on future research directions.

                     Shmoys and Tardos (1993) consider a bi-objective scheduling problem that is more general than those we consider; they assume processing times

                                 ij
                              
                           
                        
                      (i.e., the processing time depends on the job as well as on the machine), and assignment costs

                      (i.e., the assignment costs depend also on the job as well as on the machine). They do develop a polynomial time approximation algorithm for this framework; however, their algorithm has a higher time complexity than ours. Moreover their algorithm seems to be hard to implement, since it depends on the solution of a Linear Program, followed by the solution of a matching problem. We will compare our results with their results in the conclusion section.

The analysis of the performance bound for heuristic H1 is similar to the analysis of a list scheduling algorithm for the classical 
                           
                              P

                         problem. Before we prove the bound for heuristic H1, we need to prove the following lemma.

                              denote the total cost of jobs assigned to machine i after assigning the jobs in rank r by heuristic 
                              H1

We consider the third heuristic, H3, which is similar to heuristic H1. Again, jobs are ordered according to the SPT rule, rank by rank. Jobs within the same rank are assigned to machines as follows: Jobs are considered in descending order of their cost

                        . When job j is being assigned, we consider all the eligible machines and assign job j to that machine i that results in the smallest total cost on machine i. After job j is assigned to machine i, machine i becomes ineligible until we deal with the jobs in the next rank. The heuristic is described as follows.

Even though heuristic H3 looks reasonable, its theoretical bound may be poor. We can derive a lower bound of the ratio from the literature. Cho and Sahni (1980) considered a list scheduling algorithm for a uniform parallel machine scheduling problem to minimize the makespan. They showed that the worst case performance ratio of the list scheduling algorithm is at least

                         is large, we need to assign jobs with small costs to machine m within the structure of SPT schedules. However, if we fix ranks by Setup Ranks like heuristics H1, H2 and H3, it might be impossible to assign jobs with small costs to machine m. Therefore, we first consider a procedure to assign a job from each rank to machine m to minimize the total cost of jobs assigned to machine m among all possible rank compositions. The algorithm can be described as follows:

                     , we will obtain an upper bound of the optimal makespan by the following steps. We first order the n jobs on the m machines according to the Largest-Processing-Time (LPT) rule, ignoring the cost of the jobs. The LPT rule schedules the jobs in descending order of their processing times. The next job will be assigned to the machine that finishes the earliest. The makespan of the LPT schedule is denoted by L and is used as an upper bound for the optimal makespan. It is well known that

Since the primary objective, the makespan, is hard to optimize, we may consider using LPT to optimize the primary objective. Unfortunately, such an algorithm can perform very poorly with regard to the secondary objective for both cost functions

However, to find such an approximation, it is necessary to apply two procedures (which determine the overall time complexity), namely, a linear programming algorithm in order to obtain a fractional matching solution (in Step 2) and a weighted bipartite matching algorithm for the rounding (in Step 3). This LP is considered a fractional packing problem and thus can be solved in

We consider bi-criteria scheduling problems where customers’ objectives as well as service providers’ objectives have to be optimized at the same time. As a customers’ objective, we consider either the total completion time or the makespan and as a service providers’ objective, we consider either the total assignment cost or the maximum assignment cost. The primary objective is the customers’ objective and the secondary objective is the service providers’ objective. For three machine assignment cost functions (

Our models are all special cases of the more general model considered by Shmoys and Tardos (1993), who did provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm that is applicable to all models within their framework. However, their approximation scheme is clearly computationally slower than those we propose and it does not provide any intuitive insights into the respective problems. Our schemes are based on prioritization and are therefore more intuitive and easier to implement (see Table 1
                     ). All the heuristics proposed in this paper run in

We have considered only traditional scheduling objectives that are functions of completion times as the primary objective. However, considering MMC or TMC as the primary objective may lead to different approximation ratios. We have only considered cases where either

For SPT schedules, we sort the jobs in non-decreasing order of their processing times and in case of a tie we sort the jobs in non-decreasing order of their costs. When there are jobs with identical processing times, those jobs may be eligible to multiple consecutive ranks. Thus, we define
