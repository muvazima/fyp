                  Image segmentation is a very important step in image analysis, and performance evaluation of segmentation algorithms plays a key role both in developing efficient algorithms and in selecting suitable methods for the given tasks. Although a number of publications have appeared on segmentation methodology and segmentation performance evaluation, little attention has been given to statistically bounding the performance of image segmentation algorithms. In this paper, to determine the performance limits of image segmentation algorithms, a modified Cramér–Rao bound combined with the Affine bias model is employed. A fuzzy segmentation formulation is considered, of which hard segmentation is a special case. Experimental results are obtained where we compare the performance of several representative image segmentation algorithms with the derived bound on both synthetic and real-world image data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Image segmentation plays a critical role in image analysis. It subdivides an image into its constituent parts in order to extract information regarding objects of interest, and has an impact on all the subsequent image analysis tasks, such as object classification and scene interpretation [1]. Image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision, and a wide variety of methodologies for it have been presented. Surveys of image segmentation techniques can be found in [1,2]. Based on the image information being employed for the segmentation task, image segmentation algorithms can be classified into four categories: region-based segmentation [3–9], boundary- or edge-based segmentation [10–16], methods combining both region and boundary (edge) information [17–23], and thresholding (multi-thresholding) methods [24–28].

While the development of efficient segmentation algorithms is highly desirable, the assessment of their performance is also very important. There are basically three groups of methods for segmentation evaluation [1]. Surveys of the evaluation techniques for image segmentation can be found in [1,29,30], where one can observe that much progress has been made recently in evaluating the segmentation results, but performance of such methods tends to vary as widely as the techniques themselves. As a result, the performance of the evaluation methods is far from being satisfactory. In [1], the authors listed some of the factors which limit the advancement of evaluation methods and, in turn, the performance improvement of segmentation algorithms. These factors include a lack of common mathematical models or general strategy for evaluation, the challenges in defining wide-ranging performance metrics and statistics, the difficulties in defining the ground truth, large costs in performing comprehensive evaluations and the fact that the testing data are not representative enough for actual applications.

We note that given a specific image, among all the factors possibly affecting the performance assessment of segmentation algorithms, the most important factor is the image content. Therefore, an investigation of the performance bound, which is only associated with the available image data and is independent of the segmentation algorithms, will be very helpful to evaluate the efficiency of image segmentation techniques. A tight performance bound can tell us what the best achievable performance of any image segmentation algorithm is for the specific image content. Thus, performance bounds can serve as benchmarks for the image dataset and segmentation algorithms. They can also be used to study how the image content or image preprocessing operations affect segmentation performance. The gap between the actual segmentation error of an approach and a tight bound can provide us with the efficiency of that segmentation approach and available room for improvement.

There do exist efforts on bounding the segmentation performance from a statistical perspective. The work in [31] was based on the finite normal mixture (FNM) model assumption, where the model parameters, means and variances, were estimated using Expectation–Maximization (EM) and Classification-Maximization (CM) algorithms. Cramér–Rao bounds (CRB) on the variances of these estimates were derived. However, the use of the FNM model may limit the application of the presented bound to many image segmentation scenarios where FNM does not represent the image contents accurately. Also, the unbiased estimator assumption made in [31] does not hold for many real-world segmentation algorithms, which will be seen in our experimental results. While studying multi-spectral image segmentation [65], the performance of the Markov random fields (MRFs)-based segmentation algorithms was predicted using false alarm rate which was based on Rissanen’s minimum description length (MDL) criterion. The analysis in [65] covered many detailed scenarios of segmentation, which, however, was mainly focused on the MRF image segmentation criteria. Besides, the computational complexity and the use of multi-spectral image data are additional factors which constrain its application.

In this paper, we formulate image segmentation as a statistical parameter estimation problem and derive the CRB on the performance measure, namely on the mean square error (MSE) of the resulting pixel labels, based on the biased estimator assumption [32] and Affine bias model [47]. Here, by “biased estimator” we mean that the expectation of the segmentation result, i.e., the pixel label values, is not equal to the true pixel label values. In addition, while deriving the bound, an approximation is made when computing the expectation of the inverse Fisher information matrix to reduce the computational burden. Bootstrapping technique and empirical approximation to the second-order statistics are employed to overcome the difficulty that the probability distribution of the images is unknown. Our final goal is to derive a tight performance bound for the image segmentation problem and compare the bound with the performance of various segmentation algorithms when applied to different image datasets. The effect of the factors, such as the intensity contrast in an image on the segmentation result, are investigated via the bound, which give us insights into the achievable accuracy of a segmentation algorithm in segmenting a specific image.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the image segmentation problem is shown to fit the varying coefficient model (VCM) [33] and image segmentation is formulated as a parameter estimation problem. In order to derive the biased bound in Section 4, the CRB based on the unbiased estimator assumption is discussed in Section 3 as a necessary intermediate step. In Section 4, the biased bound and the optimum parameters for the Affine bias model are determined, where the methods used to calculate the bound are also discussed. In Section 5, the derived biased bound is compared with several representative image segmentation algorithms using synthetic and real-world image data. We also show in Section 5 the comparison of these segmentation algorithms with the unbiased bound, and demonstrate the unsuitability of the unbiasedness assumption. Concluding remarks and suggestions for future work are provided in Section 6.

The fundamental question asked in this paper is whether there exists a theoretical limit to image segmentation performance and, more importantly, how much room do we have to improve the existing algorithms. In this section, as a first step to attempt to answer this question, we model the image segmentation problem as a linear estimation problem using a VCM, where the parameters of interest, i.e., the pixel labels indicating which region a pixel belongs to, are considered to be the coefficients of the VCM.

Consider a random variable s whose distribution is dependent on a parameter η. In the VCM, η can be expressed as

In this subsection, we model the image segmentation problem using VCM. Suppose we have an image with N pixels whose observed intensity values are y(x), where x are pixel indices and ordered through zig-scanning, starting from the top-left to bottom-right in an image, and x
                        =1, 2, …, N. The image segmentation problem can be formulated, based on the Gaussian model (2), as

                         for every x. In the rest of the paper, the terms “label value” and “membership function value” will be used interchangeably.

The above definition enables the model to represent a general image segmentation scenario, i.e., fuzzy segmentation [34] where each pixel can belong to different basic regions at the same time. As a special case of fuzzy segmentation, a pixel in hard or crisp segmentation has the membership function h
                        
                           i
                        (x)∈{0, 1}, that is, its intensity is only contributed by one of the basic regions. In addition to providing a more general formulation, another important reason to study fuzzy segmentation is that the CRB fails to bound the MSE if the space of a parameter becomes finite [35], i.e., the hard segmentation case. We will show an illustrative example in Fig. 1
                         to explain the model (3) in more details.

From the above definitions, we can see that the basic regions can be overlapping but the segmented regions, i.e., fuzzy or hard regions obtained after segmentation is carried out, may not. The segmented regions might be different from the basic regions. The method used to calculate the bound in this paper is based on the basic regions, not on the segmented regions, in that we will discuss the estimation of the pixel labels h
                        
                           i
                        (x) for each basic region.

Going beyond the above definitions given in the image processing context, we notice that (3) is actually a very general model, which may be applicable to several related problems, such as unmixing [36], blind source separation [37] and image matting [38]. In this paper, we focus on the discussion of (3) in the image segmentation context.

We assume that we have a powerful algorithm and the fitting error is very small compared with the additive noise, so the image noise dominates the noise term, i.e., w(x)=
                        ε
                        +
                        w′(x)≈
                        w′(x). (To some extent, the fitting error might be controllable by varying the factors such as fitting functions and knot deployment. This assumption has been justified by our experiments.) In this work, the noise is considered to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance σ
                        2. We have investigated the distributions of a large number of real-world images, and found that many of them satisfy the Gaussian assumption and, therefore, the bound derived from this assumption is applicable to them. When the Gaussian assumption is not valid, it is not straightforward to find the bound but the bound based on the Gaussian assumption is still a useful bound albeit not a tight bound due to the fact that the Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy among all distributions with the same mean and variance. Thus, the bound obtained here based on the Gaussian assumption is still valuable under non-Gaussian distributions. In our work, F

                        Fig. 1 shows an illustrative example of the models described in (3) and (4), where an image consists of two basic regions. These two basic regions are composed of two hard segmented regions and one fuzzy segmented region. For simplicity, we assume that the pixel intensities in the two basic regions are constant, and the two constants are different from each other. Also, there is no noise.

In Fig. 1(a), the left-most image is the original one consisting of two basic regions, Basic Region 1 and Basic Region 2, marked by the oblique lines with different directions. The rectangle, marked by the cross lines, in the middle of this image is the overlapping area of the two basic regions, which represents the fuzzy segmented region. It includes the information from the two basic regions and is formed by weighing the pixel intensities of the two basic regions with different membership values. The two rectangles at the two sides of the fuzzy region in the original image represent two hard segmented regions. Conceptually, this original image can be considered as the weighted summation of two layers. The two images on the right hand side of the equality sign in Fig. 1(a) are the two layers corresponding to Basic Region 1 and Basic Region 2, respectively. More specifically, the layer corresponding to Basic Region 1 is formed by expanding the size of the Basic Region 1 to be the same as that of the original image, keeping the original pixel intensities of the Basic Region 1 fixed, and filling out the extended area with zero intensity values. The dark areas in the two layers consist of the pixels with the zero intensity values. The layer corresponding to Basic Region 2 is constructed in a similar manner.

Given that a hard region is a special case of a fuzzy region, Fig. 1(a) can also be considered as being composed of two fuzzy regions (with membership values 0 and 1, respectively) and a transition region. In the transition region, the membership values of a pixel are between 0 and 1. For simplicity, in the rest of this paper, we will still call the special cases of fuzzy regions, where the membership value is 0 or 1, the hard regions, and call the regions, with membership values between 0 and 1, the fuzzy regions.

A 2-D image can be considered as a 3-D object in Euclidean space, where two orthogonal axes form the pixel coordinate plane and the third axis corresponds to pixel intensity. In this paper, we index the pixel using a scalar x, instead of a 2-D coordinate vector, and denote the intensity of pixel x with y(x). Based on the 3-D abstraction, Fig. 1(b) shows the transverse surface along the dot-dashed horizontal line in the middle of the original image in Fig. 1(a). Equivalently, the original image can be considered as the aerial view of Fig. 1(b). The pixels x
                        1 and x
                        3 are in the two hard segmented regions with the intensities of y(x
                        1) and y(x
                        3), respectively. x
                        2 denotes the index of a pixel in the fuzzy segmented region with the intensity of y(x
                        2). Fig. 1(c) denotes the knot deployment of the layer corresponding to Basic Region 2. y(x
                        2) is the weighted summation of the pixel intensities of Basic Regions 1 and 2. As mentioned before, we represent the image using the fitting coefficients 
                           B
                        , instead of using the original pixel intensity information. Formally, we have

                           T
                        , and 
                           h
                        (x
                        3)=[h

                        =[0, 1]
                           T
                        .

We notice that a similar formulation has been used in [39,40] for developing image segmentation algorithms. In [39,40], h
                        
                           i
                        (x) is considered to be equal to or very close to 0 or 1, that is, hard segmentation, while in our formulation we consider a more general segmentation configuration, i.e., fuzzy segmentation where h
                        
                           i
                        (x) lies in [0, 1]. Also, in our work we consider the basic regions to be different from the segmented regions, while there is no such a distinction in [39,40]. Additionally, in [39,40] it was argued that the pixel label, with the given Gibbsian distribution as the prior, is independent of the image content represented by 
                           B
                        . In contrast, we do not make any assumptions on the dependence or the prior distribution.

There are several advantages to represent the image using the fitting coefficients 
                           B
                        , instead of the original pixel intensity information: (i) we can denote basic regions with various shapes and sizes, i.e., different number of pixels, using a “uniform” representation, i.e., the basis 
                           ς
                        (x) and the fitting coefficients 
                           β
                        
                        
                           i
                         with known or controllable dimensions. Thus, the segmentation problem can be conveniently represented by linear models, like VCM, and the analysis can be simplified; (ii) fitting can reduce the impact of a small number of pixels with large difference in intensity from their neighboring pixels, i.e., outliers, so as to enhance the homogeneity of the image regions. It is also helpful in reducing the possibility of yielding regions with very small size, i.e., region with very few pixels; (iii) spatially varying intensity and interactions between the neighboring image areas can be taken into consideration by the fitted representation to some extent; (iv) the fitting procedure can represent the image content using much smaller number of coefficients compared with the number of original image pixels, and, therefore, simplifies the computation.

From (4), we can see that there are two sets of parameters 
                           h
                        (x) and 
                           B
                         in the model, but we are only interested in the estimation of 
                           h
                        (x). We pack 
                           h
                        (x) into a large vector 
                           h
                         and obtain 
                           h
                        
                        =[h
                        1(1), h
                        2(1), …, h
                        
                           M
                        (1), h
                        1(2), h
                        2(2), …, h
                        
                           M
                        (2), …, h
                        1(N), h
                        2(N), …, h
                        
                           M
                        (N)]
                           T
                        . In this paper, we assume that the segmentation algorithms are biased estimators, that is, the output, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                        , of a segmentation algorithm is a biased estimator of the true pixel label 
                           h
                        (x). More details about this assumption as well as its justification are provided in Section 4 and Appendix B.

In this section, we derive the Fisher information matrix and the Cramér–Rao bound under the unbiased estimator assumption. For an estimation problem with two unknown parameters, like 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                      in our work, one parameter, say, 
                        h
                     , can be considered to be the wanted parameter and the other one, 
                        B
                     , can be considered as the unwanted one. Both of them are assumed to be random. Based on this formulation, the performance of four variations of the Bayesian bound for estimating the wanted parameter were compared in [41,42]. However, determination of all of the bounds requires either the computation of derivatives and expectation over the joint probability distributions of the observation 
                        y
                      and the wanted parameter, or the observation and the whole parameter set, i.e., p(
                        y
                     , 
                        h
                     ) or p(
                        y
                     , 
                        h
                     , 
                        B
                     ), which is a very challenging task given the variety of image contents. Here 
                        y
                     
                     =[y(1), …, y(N)]
                        T
                     .

In our work, we assume 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                      to be random so as to find a bound with reasonable complexity. We first determine the conditional CRB given 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                     , and then find the expectation of the conditional bound with respect to 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                      to obtain the global one. We will see during the computation of expectation that it is not necessary to determine the joint probability p(
                        h
                     , 
                        B
                     ) and even to consider the potential dependence between 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                     . Admittedly, the CRB is not a stretch bound for low SNRs [41]. In these situations, other bounds, like Barankin bound [60], could perform better. In this paper, we mainly focus on the discussion of CRB and its applications to the image segmentation problems in general. The Fisher information matrix is first derived in Subsection 3.1, which forms the basis of the CRB for the unbiased estimator (Subsection 3.2) and the biased estimator (Section 4).

In this subsection, we derive the Fisher information matrix conditioned on 
                           h
                         and 
                           B
                        , and propose a scheme to deal with the singularity of the matrix which may exist in the image segmentation scenario. Assume that the noise w(x) is i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance σ
                        2, and the observed pixel intensity is also i.i.d. given the membership function 
                           h
                         and the fitting coefficient 
                           B
                        . Then the conditional pdf of the observation is

                           J
                        
                        
                           F
                        (
                           h
                        ) could be singular. This can be verified by multiplying the first row of 
                           J
                        
                        
                           F
                        (
                           h
                        ) by 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    β
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    T
                                 
                              
                              ς
                              (
                              1
                              )
                           
                         and the second row by 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    β
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                                 
                                    T
                                 
                              
                              ς
                              (
                              1
                              )
                           
                        , and the resulting two rows will be equivalent to each other. The reason behind it is that the dimension of 
                           h
                         is usually higher than the available observation 
                           y
                        , especially for the case of single image segmentation, which can be seen more clearly from (4).

We need a non-singular matrix in order to compute the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. To achieve this goal, we transform the multiple basic region segmentation problem, where M
                        >2, to a binary basic region segmentation problem, i.e., M
                        =2, by maintaining the information regarding the basic region of interest, say, the ith basic region, and by considering the remaining regions as a single “super” basic region. That is, when we are studying the pixel labels for the ith basic region, the membership functions and the fitting coefficients corresponding to the ith basic region remain fixed, and the rest of the basic regions are merged to form a “super” basic region whose membership functions and the fitting coefficients are recalculated based on the image contents of the “super” basic region. Thus, the segmentation model (4) can be written as

We discuss the invertibility of the Fisher information matrix in a more general case in the next subsection.

In this subsection, we derive the CRB under the unbiased estimator assumption, and employ Jensen’s inequality for matrix measures [44] to simplify the expectation determination procedure, where we assume that the segmentation algorithms yield unbiased estimates of the pixel labels. Based on the formulation in Section 3.1, the unbiased bound of multiple basic region segmentation can be calculated in a region by region manner. For the ith basic region, we calculate the Fisher information matrix

                        . Repeating the procedure for all the basic regions and averaging the resulting bounds, we obtain the average unbiased bound for the entire image. In this way, we decompose the estimation problem with the dimensionality equal to MN into M sub-problems, each of which has the dimensionality N, the same size as the number of observations (the total number of pixels in an image). Therefore, we overcome the ambiguity due to the insufficient number of observations and can find unique solutions to the problem.

Now, we study the bound on the covariance of the estimate

However, if we do not incorporate the expectation operation when calculating the bound, the performance of the resulting bound might deteriorate when the above two basic regions have similar intensities at pixel x, which can be seen in the experimental results shown in Figs. 2

                         actually measures the square of the difference between the intensities at pixel x contributed by the basic region of interest and the “super” basic region. It indicates the interaction between different basic regions at pixel x. A smaller difference means a higher similarity between the two basic regions. This result corresponds to the image content which is more difficult to be segmented apart, and the variance of the segmentation label is larger. Here, the intensity difference evaluation is carried out by using the spline coefficients and the expectation operation, and, thus, the effect of the contribution of the neighboring pixels to the intensity at x, i.e., the correlation between neighboring pixels, is also taken into account. It is also interesting to notice that the separability of the two basic regions, which is reflected by the segmentation variance, is independent of the membership values and only related to the contrast between the intensities of the basic regions overlapping at a pixel. Additionally, a larger noise energy, i.e., larger σ
                        2, has a bigger negative influence on the segmentation result, which corresponds to a higher value of the bound. We can see that the bound calculated from (15) and (16) is consistent with these intuitions.

The bound (16) has been obtained under the unbiasedness assumption, and the calculation of it includes the determination of the expectation operation, E

                        )], which will be discussed in Subsection 4.3 and Appendix D. However, as we will see in the next section, a biased estimator is a more reasonable assumption for real-world image segmentation algorithms. Therefore, the result obtained in this section is not applicable in practice. However, it will be very useful in deriving the bound for the biased estimator case, as discussed in next section.

In this section, we assume the estimator of 
                        h
                      to be biased, and derive the bound on the MSE of the segmentation results. We continue to consider the transformed binary segmentation problem here.

From both theoretical and practical points of views, unbiased estimators do not often exist. Moreover, biased estimators often have the advantage of lower MSE over unbiased ones if they do exist [45]. MSE actually includes the tradeoff between bias and covariance. In addition, unbiased estimators tend to yield very large variance, especially for some ill-posed problems, such as image segmentation. Regularization is widely used to solve ill-posed problems and the resulting estimators are often biased [46]. Many state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are designed under a regularization framework, in which an objective function consisting of both a fidelity term and a penalty term is optimized, resulting in biased estimators.

Following the same steps as when deriving the average bound for the unbiased estimators in the last section, we first write the expression of the conditional MSE in terms of bias and covariance,

In our work, we assume that the behavior of the bias model can be approximated by an Affine function. The Affine model has been justified and employed to study the MSE bound for estimation problems in [47]. The details of the justification of the Affine bias assumption in image segmentation context can be found in Appendix B. Formally, we have

We notice from (27) that the decomposition of the terms containing 
                           h
                         and 
                           B
                         makes the solution easily computable and no explicit expression of the joint probability p(
                           h
                        , 
                           B
                        ) is required. It also avoids the study of the dependence between 
                           h
                         and

In this section, we verify the efficiency of the presented MSE bound by comparing it with the segmentation results of several representative image segmentation algorithms using both synthetic and real-world image data.

The two synthetic images considered here include one image with hard labels and one with hybrid labels. Hybrid here means that some pixels have hard labels and others have fuzzy labels. The real-world images are considered to belong to hard segmentation since the ground truths are given in terms of hard labels. The real-world images include the medical images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) [52], and the natural images from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark [66]. The medical images are the mammograms containing micro-calcifications whose locations are identified by the radiologists and used as the ground-truth in our work. Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark provides several segmentation results by different human subjects for each image. To consider the subjective factors when a human segments an image and to obtain a uniform performance evaluation, for each image we first calculate the bound, MSEs and variances based on the segmentation result by one human subject, and then average these values across all the human subjects. The averaged bound, MSEs and variances are employed as the final performance indicator when a specific image is segmented. To save the space, we only show two typical experimental results of medical image and natural image in this paper.

When calculating the empirical second-order statistics, we employ the SSIM index [49] to find similar image patches centered at each knot and with a fixed size, as mentioned before. SSIM measures the similarity between two images using structure information, as shown in (28)

Admittedly, the patch size, the number of similar patches found for one coefficient, the spline type and the distance between two neighboring knots have slight impacts on the resulting bound value. We have carried out the tests by varying these parameters over reasonable ranges and found that the following configuration yields most robust and efficient bounds for different image contents in our experiments. The patch size is 13 by 13 pixels, and the knots are deployed every 8 pixels in both horizontal and vertical directions, which results in overlapping patches. The spline function is cubic B-spline. There are two constraints to determine the number of patches: (i) the patches with the SSIM index larger than 0.7 are considered as patches similar to the underlying patch; (ii) the first 20 patches with the largest index values are considered as similar patches if the number of patches selected by (i) exceeds 20. In our experimental setting averagely it takes no more than 2min to determine the bound value for each basic region when we run it using Matlab on a machine with a Intel Pentium 4 CPU. The most time-consuming parts are the computation of the expectation of

As a further verification of the biased estimator assumption and Affine bias model, the unbiased bound discussed in Section 3 and the one obtained by excluding the expectation operation with respect to 
                           B
                         are also calculated for comparison purposes.

The algorithms for hard image segmentation include the MRF-based algorithm [53], Otsu thresholding [24,25], dynamic clustering [54], the region-based active contour model (RACM) [55], and the multi-scale normalized cuts-based segmentation (MNCut) [56], where RACM and MNCut are more recent and can be considered as the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Those for fuzzy image segmentation include fuzzy C-means [57], fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (fuzzy k-NN) [58], and the Gath-Geva algorithm [59]. Due to the space limit, we will not describe these algorithms in this paper.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 2(a) shows a synthetic hard segmented image which includes 4 non-overlapping basic regions with three different intensity values: the square in the upper-left corner has the intensity 90, the central arc has intensity 88, and the rest has intensity 80. White Gaussian noise is added into the image with zero mean and variance σ
                        2. The bounds, MSEs and variances are calculated for the particular image of Fig. 2(a) under different noise strengths, i.e., different SNRs. At each SNR, the MSE and variance of each segmentation algorithm are the averages of 100 segmentation results. This number is determined by experiment, based on the efficiency and robustness of the calculated bounds. This procedure is used for all the experiments in this paper. Fig. 3 shows a typical result when calculating the bounds, MSEs and variances using several real-world mammogram images. Here, Fig. 3(a) is the original mammogram data, and we consider the hard segmentation based on the ground-truth. We also carried out the experiments using different natural images from [66]. A typical result is shown in Fig. 4, where Fig. 4(a) is the original image.


                        Figs. 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) show the MSE curves of the segmentation results using the above five hard image segmentation algorithms as well as the bounds calculated using (27) based on the biased estimator assumption and Affine bias model. Figs. 2(c), 3(c) and 4(c) shows the variance curves of these segmentation algorithms and the bound calculated using (16) based on unbiased estimator assumption. In these three figures, we also show the “bounds” calculated by ignoring the expectation operations with respect to

                         directly from the pixel intensity and ignoring the expectation operation with respect to 
                           B
                        . Moreover, in Figs. 2(c), 3(c) and 4(c) we use the bound values of 0.5 to represent the invalid cases where the variances calculated from the unbiased estimator assumption are very large (The variance should have a smaller value, given that the value of the pixel membership function lies in a small range of [0, 1]).

From Figs. 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b) we can see that the MSE bounds (the bold dashed-dot line in the lower part of each figure) derived under the biased estimator assumption bound the MSEs of these algorithms from bottom. With the increase of SNR, the bounds and the MSEs decrease. When the SNR is very high, the MSEs converge to the bounds. These expected results show that the bound in (27) provides a valid performance prediction of the segmentation algorithms and a benchmark of the segmentation results. In comparison, the bounds in Figs. 2(c), 3(c) and 4(c) based on the unbiased estimator assumption, i.e., the bold dashed line in each figure, fail to bound the variance of these algorithms, which again verifies the reasonability of the biased estimator and the Affine model assumptions.

From these results we can also see that the MRF-based segmentation algorithm and the RACM algorithm yield better results in terms of smaller MSE, especially in the relatively higher SNR cases, e.g., SNRs larger than 18dB. The MRF-based segmentation algorithm exploits the correlation between neighboring pixels through Gibbs distribution, and the RACM algorithm takes into account the correlation via a region-scalable fitting energy based on the kernel function in a local region. Both of the algorithms perform better than those which consider pixels to be independent when carrying out segmentation, such as dynamic clustering. These also show the reasonability of our representation of the image using fitting coefficients and the expectation operation with respect to 
                           B
                         when calculating the bound, which take into account the correlation information contained in an image. As a further verification, in Figs. 2(c), 3(c) and 4(c) we draw the “bound” curves, the dotted lines at the right hand side of the unbiased bound in each figure, which are based on the unbiased estimator assumption but without the expectation operation with respect to 
                           B
                        . We can see that not using the expectation yields an even worse result and fails to bound the variance of these algorithms from bottom. Similar result can also be seen in Fig. 5(c).


                        Fig. 5 deals with hybrid image segmentation for the synthetic image shown in Fig. 5(a). There are 4 basic regions with the intensity values of 120, 90, 60 and 20, respectively. The three arc regions at the left side of the diagonal curves are the constructed fuzzy regions, denoted as Regions A, B, and C, and have membership values of [0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1], [0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1] and [0, 0, 0.8, 0.2], respectively. The rest of the four regions are hard ones with the intensity values of 120, 90, 60 and 20, as mentioned above. Once again white Gaussian noise is added into the image with zero mean and variance σ
                        2. Fig. 5(b) shows the MSE curves of the segmentation results using the three fuzzy image segmentation algorithms when the biased estimator assumption and Affine bias model are employed. Fig. 5(c) shows the variance curves of the segmentation algorithms, the bound calculated using (16) for the unbiased estimator assumption and the “bound” determined by ignoring the expectation operation. We can see from the figures that the bound based on biased estimator assumption is valid but those based on unbiased estimator assumption fail again.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Image segmentation is a very important but challenging problem for computer vision and image analysis. However, performance limits of segmentation algorithms are seldom studied from a statistical perspective. This paper developed a systematic method to estimate a lower bound on the MSE of segmentation algorithms under a statistical estimation framework. The bound was based on the biased estimator assumption and Affine bias model, where an approximation was employed to simplify the computation when determining the expectation on the inverse of the Fisher information matrix. Additionally, non-local searching and bootstrapping techniques were used to approximate the unknown second-order statistics during the computation of the bound. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the presented bound is efficient and robust in bounding the performance of the segmentation algorithms and providing a benchmark for the segmentation problem.

There are many future research directions that are worth pursuing. An investigation on the probability distribution estimation techniques may be helpful to improve the computation of the expectation involved in the bound, where statistical learning methods may be helpful. In our current work, we mainly discussed the problem of segmenting a single image, but did not consider multi-spectral and 3-D image segmentation. Future research on the extension of the developed bound to these two types of images will be an interesting research topic. When developing the bound, the ground truth information about the noise-free image, the basic regions and the membership value of each pixel label is required. Research on approaches which can reduce the dependence of the bound on such information will be both theoretically and practically useful. Perhaps image denoising and linear regression techniques will be helpful in handling it. Finally, the presented bound may also be useful in color images, which could be an excellent extension of our work to more real-world applications.

Assume that the noise w(x) is i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance σ
                     2, and the observed pixel intensity is also i.i.d. given the membership 
                        h
                      and the coefficient 
                        B
                     . Then the conditional pdf of the observation is

We are only interested in estimating 
                        h
                      and assume that the information about 
                        B
                      is available. The information about 
                        B
                      can be obtained from the image contents and the ground-truth segmentation results, which is discussed in Subsection 4.3 and Appendix D. This assumption regarding the availability of 
                        B
                      is helpful in simplifying the determination of the bound and also in eliminating the ambiguity in model (4) due to the multiplication of 
                        h
                      and

In this section, we discuss the reasonability of the biased estimator assumption and the affine bias model used in the conditional MSE bound in (21), and the global bound can be obtained by determining the expectation of the conditional bound with respect to 
                        h
                      and 
                        B
                     , as illustrated in (22) (or (27)).

                      is a model matrix, and 
                        n
                      is zero-mean random vector. The estimator of 
                        θ
                      is assumed to be linear, i.e.,

                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                           =
                           Gy
                        
                     , which estimates 
                        θ
                      by performing a weighted average operation over the observation. Linear estimators are quite frequently used for least squire estimation problems, whose forms have been established by solving optimization problems, with the constraints put on 
                        ξ
                     , 
                        θ
                      and even 
                        n
                     . For example, 
                        θ
                     
                     
                        T
                     
                     Ξθ
                     
                     ⩽Δ, where Ξ is a positive definite matrix and Δ is a constant [61,62]. These constraints can be considered as the prior information on these parameters and the penalties under the regularization framework.

Similarly, image segmentation can also be modeled as a constrained linear estimation problem, as shown in (4)

                              ,
                           
                        
                     where φ(x; 
                        B
                     )
                        T
                      can be considered as the model matrix and 
                        h
                     (x) is the label parameter vector to be estimated. During the segmentation procedure, some prior information about φ(x; 
                        B
                     )
                        T
                     , 
                        h
                     (x) and w(x) is usually employed as the penalty terms of the objective functions for segmentation, to reduce the solution space under regularization framework. For example, the smoothness assumption is often made on the labels of the neighboring pixels, like that used in the MRF-based algorithms, which equivalently brings the constraint on 
                        h
                     (x). Besides, we consider the above weighted norm constraint on 
                        h
                     (x) since the value of the pixel label can only vary in a limited range, i.e., 
                        h
                     (x)
                        T
                     Ξ
                        h
                     (x)⩽Δ. Moreover, local information is often used during the estimation procedure, that is, 
                        h
                     (x) is often estimated by using the observation 
                        y
                      around the pixel x.

Based on the above discussion, we assume that many image segmentation algorithms perform the label estimation using constrained linear estimators 
                        
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                           =
                           Gy
                        
                     , where 
                        G
                      is a function of Ξ, Δ, the intensities of the basic regions and the noise strengths. We can refer to [63,64] for the calculation of 
                        G
                     .

Here, by considering the penalty or prior information resulting from the label smoothness assumption, we assume that 
                        h
                      forms Gaussian MRF

So it is not compulsory for two neighboring pixels to be deployed in a way that one is followed immediately by another spatially. In Eq.

With the neighboring information incorporated in the segmentation procedure, the linear estimator finds the weighted average over the observation in a local window. We can also consider that the weighted average is carried out over the whole set of observations in an image, but the weights decrease with the increase of the distance between the coordinates of the observations and the pixel of interest. Here, we only consider the observations which are neighbors of the pixel of interest. We have

                        j
                      is the neighbor of pixel x, then pixel x is the neighbor of pixel x

From the above analysis, we can see that in many segmentation problems, the bias of the segmentation label is an affine function of the true label.

There are basically two methods to find the solution of the optimization problem posed in (24). The first one is to assume that

Ignoring the approximation error, the fitting coefficients and the pixels are two ways to represent the same image content. We use pixel level features to search for similar fitting coefficients because usually the number of pixels is much larger than the coefficients and, therefore, the statistics of the pixel level features are more reliable. For example, when we search for similar fitting coefficients to 
                           β
                        
                        
                           iq
                        , we divide the image into patches centered at each knot and with a fixed size, that is, each fitting coefficient is located at the center of the patch. A suitable metric is employed to find the patches with a similar structure to the patch centered at 
                           β
                        
                        
                           iq
                        , and the corresponding fitting coefficients is put in the ensemble of 
                           β
                        
                        
                           iq
                        . As seen in Section 5, we use a metric called structural similarity (SSIM) index [49]. In other words, we use the similarity of the patches to represent the similarity of the fitting coefficients.

                           i

                           i
                         which is unknown and also not easy to find. Therefore, we use the bootstrapping technique [50] in our work. Bootstrapping is an approach for statistical inference, and used to estimate the properties of an estimator (Cov(
                           h
                        
                        
                           i
                        ) in our work) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution. It generates the empirical distribution of the observed data by constructing a number of resamples of the observed dataset, i.e., 
                           h
                        
                        
                           i
                         in our work, with the same size as the observed dataset. These resamples are obtained by random sampling with replacement from the original dataset. Bootstrapping procedure is independent of the distribution, and provides an indirect method to assess the properties of the distribution which determines the sample and the parameters of interest [51]. Besides, bootstrapping is robust with respect to possibly small number of samples.

In our work, random sampling with replacement is carried out Z times on 
                           h
                        
                        
                           i
                        , and we obtain Z bootstrap samples, from which the covariance matrix is calculated. This procedure is repeated R times, and the resulting R calculated covariance matrices represent an empirical bootstrap distribution of
