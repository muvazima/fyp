                  Link unidirectionality is a commonly encountered phenomenon in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which is a natural result of various properties of wireless transceivers as well as the environment. Transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities are important factors that create unidirectional links. Majority of the inter-node data transfer mechanisms are designed to work on bidirectional links (i.e., due to the lack of a direct reverse path, handshaking cannot be performed between a transmitter and receiver) which render the use of unidirectional links infeasible. Yet, there are some data transfer mechanisms designed specifically to operate on unidirectional links which employ distributed handshaking mechanisms (i.e., instead of using a direct reverse path, a multi-hop reverse path is used for the handshake). In this study, we investigate the impact of both transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities on the lifetime of WSNs through a novel linear programming (LP) framework both for networks that utilize only bidirectional links and for those that can use bidirectional links as well as unidirectional links.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In wireless communications electromagnetic propagation medium between a transceiver pair is, often, abstracted as a bidirectional link, which implies that both entities can transmit packets to and receive packets from each other. However, in many practical network deployments the assumption of link bidirectionality is questionable. In fact, it is shown on various wireless network testbeds that a significant portion of the links are unidirectional [1,2] (e.g., it is reported in [2] that more than 45.0% of the links are unidirectional in their testbed).

The existence of unidirectional links can be attributed to several physical factors including transceiver characteristics as well as other environmental phenomena. Hardware components of wireless radios (e.g., antenna, RF circuits) determine the maximum transmission range of the radios [3]. Unavoidable variations in individual component characteristics lead to non-homogeneous maximum transmission ranges for different nodes [3–5]. Transmission power heterogeneity is an important paradigm that leads to unidirectionality (i.e., a high transmission power node can reach a low transmission power node, however, communication in the reverse direction is not possible) [6,3,7]. Random irregularities due to ambient factors (e.g., noise, interference) affecting the signal propagation path is another phenomena creating unidirectional links [1].

Since most medium access control (MAC) layer protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11 in unicast mode) are designed to operate on bidirectional links (e.g., handshaking mechanism dictates that data transmission by a transmitter should be replied back with an acknowledgment transmission by the receiver), any routing protocol utilizing such a MAC protocol has no other option but to use only bidirectional links in the routing operations [4]. However, if the MAC protocol is used in broadcast mode then, a node can transmit over a unidirectional link, hence, it is possible to employ a routing protocol that can use unidirectional links on top of a MAC protocol operating in broadcast mode [6]. Yet, it is highly desirable to have a MAC layer that can perform handshaking over unidirectional links in unicast flows both for performance optimization and for avoiding network partitioning (i.e., it is possible that some nodes can only be reached by unidirectional links). Indeed, there are several MAC protocols designed to perform handshaking over unidirectional links (i.e., acknowledgment packets are relayed back to the transmitter in a multi-hop fashion by using one or more relay nodes) [1,8,5,9].

Lifetime optimization of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most important design objectives because WSNs are envisioned to be operating in hostile and harsh environments where human intervention is risky or costly [10]. In such environments, battery replenishment is not possible or highly challenging. In WSNs, nodes share the burden of relaying data from sensor nodes to the base station. To avoid premature exhaustion of the any sensor nodes batteries relaying energy dissipation should be evenly shared throughout the network which can be achieved by optimally balancing the flows. Link unidirectionality limits the options available for balancing energy dissipation when compared to a network without unidirectionality.

The impact of any relevant paradigm affecting the energy dissipation characteristics of WSNs is worth investigating [11,12], yet, a systematic characterization of the impact of link unidirectionality on WSN lifetime has not been performed, hence, our goal in this study is to investigate the energy dissipation characteristics of data transfer in WSNs with unidirectional links induced by both transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities.

Energy overhead due to unidirectional links in WSNs can be categorized into two main types: (i) energy overhead to establish and maintain routes in the presence of unidirectional links and (ii) energy overhead to route data in such a network. The latter is more significant because it is applicable not only for a limited period of network operation but also during the entire network lifetime (i.e., since WSNs generally exhibit stationary topology and connectivity behavior, route updates are infrequent). On the other hand, data transport is a continuous operation spanning the entire network lifetime.

Although it is tempting to conjecture that the energy overhead due to unidirectionality is high, there is no systematic analysis to support such a conjecture. Given the fact that without a proper analysis it is not possible to quantify or even give a rough estimate on the energy cost of unidirectionality, in this study we perform an analysis on this subject by building a framework using linear programming (LP). In the context of WSNs, LP approach has previously been applied in many studies to model the unique characteristics of WSNs and to determine the optimal solutions to problems that are specific to WSNs [13–20]. Choosing an LP based analysis method has a number of advantages. One of them is the abstraction from a specific protocol which enables us to investigate energy cost in ideal conditions with optimal routing decisions. Secondly, due to global knowledge in the optimization problem solver, the results can be obtained in an efficient and consistent manner.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is presented in Section 2. System model, and LP formulations are presented in Section 3. Analysis based on LP models are presented in Section 4. Concluding remarks are made in Section 5.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

In this section, we present a brief overview of the literature on unidirectionality in wireless networks. We also provide a brief overview of literature on studies using LP to analyze WSNs. The effects of unidirectional links on network performance are investigated in [7,21]. In [7], the effects of unidirectional links on the performance of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are explored through simulations. Three techniques to mitigate the effects of link asymmetry in routing are considered. Blacklisting and Hello techniques eliminate unidirectional links while ReversePathSearch technique exploits the greater network connectivity due to the presence of multiple paths between nodes. The results of simulations show that ReversePathSearch is the most effective technique for a wide unidirectionality range. In [21], a set of metrics (e.g., neighbor-related metrics, node-reachability metrics, path characteristics metrics, link and path change metrics) for describing routing characteristics of MANET protocols in the presence of unidirectional links is proposed. Analysis of networks with various transmission power heterogeneity levels through simulations spanning a wide range of scenarios and parameters is performed.

Providing mechanisms to be able to route data over unidirectional links in MANETs is a challenging task that necessitates cross layer solutions [1,3,6,8,5,9]. In [1], a framework called BRA that provides improved connectivity and routing performance in MANETs with asymmetric links is presented. BRA is built to operate in conjunction with any general purpose routing protocol designed to operate on bidirectional links (i.e., BRA operates as a sub-layer between the network and MAC layers). BRA transforms unidirectional links into bidirectional link abstractions by providing multi-hop reverse paths. In [3], design and evaluation of a MAC layer protocol called AsyMAC is presented. AsyMAC relies on a proxy node in the three-party proxy set (sender, receiver, proxy) to relay acknowledgments back to the sender for reliability assurance in case the sender cannot hear the receiver due to unidirectionality (i.e., four way handshake of IEEE 802.11 is performed in multi-hop fashion). In [6], a multicast routing protocol (ODMRP-ASYM) that can operate in networks with unidirectional links is proposed. The main idea of ODMRP-ASYM is rerouting the Join Reply packet when a unidirectional link is detected on the Join Query path (i.e., detour the Join Reply packet once a unidirectional link is encountered). In [8], a cross layer approach for handling link asymmetry due to transmission power heterogeneity is presented. Unidirectional links are converted into bidirectional abstractions by using multi-hop reverse path acknowledgments. Multi-hop reverse path MAC packets are embedded into IP packets (i.e., a tunneled bi-directional link). Furthermore, high transmission power nodes are informed of an ongoing four way handshake between low transmission power nodes by using multi-hop bandwidth reservation messages. In [5], a virtual coordinate assignment protocol (ABVCap-Uni) is introduced to build an abstraction of unidirectional links as bidirectional links. The main idea of ABVCap-Uni is to organize nodes with unidirectional links into ring topology clusters. These rings are treated as extended nodes and the virtual network consisting of extended nodes includes only bidirectional logical links. In [9], a power-aware routing protocol (DELAR) is presented which uses transmission power heterogeneity, residual energy information, and local traffic load level information to save energy. Furthermore, a MAC protocol (A-MAC) to support reverse path acknowledgment over asymmetric links is proposed. A-MAC integrates multi-hop reverse path concept into MAC layer handshaking (mini-routing is the term used for MAC layer multi-hop control packet routing).

All aforementioned studies address unidirectionality for MANETs, however, there are also a few studies addressing link asymmetry in WSNs [4,22]. In [4], a link management scheme (DEAL) to discover and exploit asymmetric links efficiently in dense WSNs is proposed. By using a novel feedback mechanism, DEAL dynamically adapts its link maintenance mechanism based on the estimated link quality. Through direct experimentation it is shown that a link considered to be asymmetric for large size data packets can effectively be used for short acknowledgment packets. In [22], two MAC protocols (MLMAC-UL and ECTS-MAC) for WSNs which are able to transmit data over unidirectional links and receive acknowledgments using a neighborhood discovery protocol are introduced. MLMAC-UL is a TDMA based MAC protocol which can handle heavy traffic load whereas ECTS-MAC is a contention based protocol designed specifically for sparsely populated networks.

LP is the subclass of mathematical programming models which uses linear functions both for objective and constraints. There are a wide variety of applications where LP is used such as transportation, production scheduling, and network flow problems [23]. LP is a powerful tool utilized in many studies for modeling and analyzing WSNs [13–20,24,25]. In [13], WSN lifetime is investigated by using two multi-hop routing schemes through an LP approach. In [14], the maximum lifetime routing problem is formulated as an LP problem and it is shown that in a WSN when all packets are relayed on the same route, energy of the nodes on that path drains out more quickly than the others. In [15], using LP, a general model for evaluating and maximizing the lifetime of WSNs is proposed. Mitigating the problem of hot spots using different deployment strategies is investigated. In [16], the maximal lifetime scheduling problem in sensor surveillance systems by using an LP framework is investigated. The problem is defined as the maximization of the lifetime of a surveillance system given a set of sensors monitoring certain targets in an area. In [17], flow-jamming attacks which enable adversaries to selectively jam packets in network traffic flows are investigated. Evaluation metrics of jamming impact, efficiency, and resource variation are proposed. By using the proposed metrics the optimal flow-jamming attacks are formulated through an LP framework. In [18], the problem of WSN lifetime optimization is investigated through an LP model by considering the energy dissipations of both data communication and computation. A joint routing and compression optimization strategy is proposed which is shown to prolong the network lifetime when compared to no compression or full compression strategies. Using a more sophisticated LP model, the effects of multi-level data compression in conjunction to flow balancing are also investigated [19]. In [20], a novel method to enhance contextual privacy in WSNs is proposed. Tradeoffs in limiting the transmission ranges of sensor nodes and unobservability margins are investigated using an LP framework. In [24,25], both topology insensitive lifetime bounds for non-aggregating WSNs and topology sensitive lifetime bounds for aggregating networks with specified topologies are derived. The concept of feasible role assignment formalism is an important feature utilized in the derivations. As one of the main results of these studies, it is shown that a class of role assignment problems can be transformed into LP models.

In this study, our main goal is to characterize the effects of unidirectional links induced by transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities on the network lifetime. In this section we define our system model, clarify the assumptions, and formulate the optimization problem.

In our system model, energy consumption of sensor nodes is dominated by communication energy dissipation rather than sensing and processing energy dissipations. This assumption is supported by the results of experiments in actual WSN testbeds (e.g., communication energy dissipation constitutes 91.00% of the total energy dissipation in Telos sensor nodes [26]). Our communication energy dissipation model is a widely accepted model introduced in [27]. In this model, the amount of energy to transmit one bit of data is E

                         and to receive one bit of data is Erx
                        
                        =
                        ρ, where ρ represents the energy dissipated in the electronic circuitry, ε denotes the transmitters efficiency, α represents the path loss, and dij
                         is the distance between node-i (transmitting node) and node-j (receiving node).

In our framework, we assume that there is a single base station and N sensor nodes. Time is organized into rounds with duration Trnd
                        . Each sensor node-i creates the same amount of traffic (si
                        ) at each round to be conveyed to the base station (i.e., sensor nodes create CBR flows).

Traffic generated at each node terminates at the base station either by direct transfer or through other sensors acting as relays. The network topology is represented by a directed graph G
                        =(V,A). V is the set of all nodes, including the base station as node-1. We also define set W, which includes all the nodes except the base station (i.e., W
                        =
                        V\{1}). A
                        ={(i,j): i
                        ∈
                        W, j

                        V
                        −
                        i} is the set of arcs (links). Note that the definition of A implies that no node sends traffic to itself and the base station does not send out any traffic to the sensor nodes. The amount of traffic that flows from node-i to node-j is represented as fij
                        .

We used two different unidirectionality models to create networks with unidirectional links: transmission power heterogeneity model (D-model) and random irregularity model (P-model). Most of the studies on link unidirectionality use transmission power heterogeneity (nodes have unequal transmission ranges) to create link asymmetry [1,3,7,6,8,9,21,28]. Yet, the majority of the models use finite transmission power levels (e.g., two power levels — some of the nodes have high transmission power and the rest of the nodes have low transmission power). In D-model, the nominal maximum transmission range of nodes is denoted as Rnom
                        . Deviation from the nominal maximum transmission range leading to transmission power heterogeneity is modeled as a uniform random distribution in [−

                        , Rhet
                        ] range (i.e., each node-i has a maximum transmission range of R
                        
                           max,i
                        
                        =

                        R
                        
                           dev,i
                        , where R
                        
                           dev,i
                         is an instance of random variable in [−
                        Rhet
                        , Rhet
                        ] interval). Thus, node-i's maximum transmission range can, at most, be Rmax
                        ,
                           i
                        
                        =
                        Rnom
                        
                        +
                        Rhet
                         and can, at least, be Rmax
                        ,
                           i
                        
                        =
                        Rnom
                        
                        −
                        Rhet
                        . Random irregularity model is also used to model networks with unidirectional links [1,5,29]. In P-model, N sensor nodes are randomly distributed over a predetermined network area. All sensor nodes have the same maximum transmission range (Rnom
                        ), thus, all node pairs with an inter-node distance lower than Rnom
                         are connected via bidirectional links. By using the created bidirectional topology, each link between any connected node pair is converted to a unidirectional link with probability pl
                         to obtain a unidirectional network topology. Conversion to unidirectionality is achieved by randomly deleting one of the arcs between node-i to node-j (i.e., either arc (i, j) or (j, i) is deleted but not both). All system variables with their acronyms and descriptions are presented in Table 1
                        .

The optimization problem is formulated as an LP problem, presented in Fig. 1
                        . Since the objective is to maximize network lifetime (L), our problem is the maximization of the minimum lifetime in the network by finding the fij
                        's (flows) that satisfy the constraints. Note that variable L gives the network lifetime in terms of number of rounds and the actual network lifetime can be expressed by the product L
                        ×
                        Trnd
                        . The number of rounds the network survives (L) is a unitless quantity.

Eq. (1) states that all flows are non-negative. Eq. (2) is used for flow balancing at the sensor nodes. The sum of flows relayed to sensor node-i (from all the other sensor nodes) plus the traffic generated at sensor node-i is equal to the sum of flows relayed out from sensor node-i to the rest of the network (to other sensor nodes acting as relays or directly to the base station). Note that L
                        ×
                        si
                         gives the total amount of traffic generated at sensor node-i (si
                         is the amount of traffic generated at sensor node-i in each round which is a constant). Eq. (3) guarantees that all data generated at the sensor nodes terminate at the base station. In many WSN applications sensor nodes acquire data periodically and captured data have a predetermined constant size [27,12]. Eq. (4) states that for all nodes except the base station energy dissipation for communication is bounded by the energy stored in batteries (ei
                        ). Eq. (5) is used to assign equal battery energy to all sensor nodes. To take channel bandwidth (ς) limitations into consideration in a broadcast medium, we need to make sure that the bandwidth required to transmit and receive at each node is limited by the channel bandwidth. Such a constraint should take the shared capacity into consideration. We refer to the flows around node-i which are not flowing into or flowing out of node-i and affect the available bandwidth to node-i as interfering flows. Eq. (6) guarantees that for all nodes including the base station the aggregate rate of incoming flows, outgoing flows, and interfering flows is upper bounded by the channel bandwidth. This constraint is a modified version of the sufficient condition given in [30]. Interference function (I
                        
                           jl
                        
                        
                           i
                        ) is presented in Eq. (7). If node-i is in the interference region of the transmission from node-j to node-l, then the value of interference function for node-i (I
                        
                           jl
                        
                        
                           i
                        ) takes the value of total amount of bits carried from node-j to node-l, otherwise it is zero. Generally speaking, interference range is equal to or greater than transmission range (i.e., γ
                        ≥1). This means depending on the value of γ, node-j's transmission to node-l can interfere with node-i even if the distance between node-j and node-l is less than the distance between node-j and node-i.

Note that the model presented in Fig. 1 is the basic model for flow balancing (i.e., all data generated at the sensor nodes eventually terminate at the base station) and lifetime maximization. Lifetime of a network ends when the first node exhausts its energy. However, this definition should not be misinterpreted — when we examine the framework carefully it can be seen that to maximize the minimum lifetime, all nodes are forced to dissipate their energies in a balanced fashion, hence, sensor nodes in the network collaborate to avoid premature death of any sensor node due to overutilization of its energy source.

The basic model lacks any constraints that limit a node's transmission range (i.e., any node can communicate with any other node in the network). Eq. (8) is used to limit the maximum transmission range of nodes to Rnom
                         (i.e., any node pair separated by more than Rnom
                         cannot communicate directly, however, multi-hop communication option is not blocked). Since there is neither transmission power heterogeneity (all nodes have the same transmission range) nor random irregularities (pl
                        
                        =0.0) there are no unidirectional links in such a network. The basic model and Eq. (8) is used to model our baseline case.

To model the flow of bits only on bidirectional links in D-model we introduce Eq. (9), which states that unless both transmitter's (node-i) and receiver's (node-j) maximum transmission ranges are larger than or equal to the distance between them (dij
                        ) there cannot be any flow on arc fij
                        . Recall that R
                        
                           max,i
                         is in [Rnom
                        
                        −

                        , Rnom

                        Rhet
                        ] interval. Hence, the basic LP model presented in Fig. 1 conjunction with Eq. (9) models a network where only bidirectional links can be used for D-model.

In P-model, if the link from node-i to node-j is deleted (i.e., removed from the set of arcs) then the flow on the reverse link is zeroed to allow flows on only bidirectional links. To model the deletion of links we define set Ad
                        , which is the set of deleted links. The remaining set of links is denoted as Ap
                         (i.e., Ap
                        
                        =
                        A\Ad
                        ). The baseline case, which uses set Ap
                         instead of set A, plus Eq. (10) is used to model the case where only bidirectional links can be used to transfer data for P-model.

Eq. (11) is used to model routing on both unidirectional and bidirectional links for D-model. Flow fij
                         is zero if the distance between a transmitter and a receiver (dij
                        ) is larger than the maximum transmission range of node-i (R
                        
                           max,i
                        ). This equation allows flow of bits between a transmitter and a receiver even if the link between them is unidirectional (R
                        
                           max,i

For P-model, modeling the utilization of both unidirectional and bidirectional links is achieved by using the baseline case only (i.e., Eq. (10) is not employed), however, set A is replaced by set Ap
                        . In other words, if a link exists then existence of a flow on that link is not blocked.

Note that we assume existence of a perfect MAC layer protocol which dissipates energy only on data transmission and reception (i.e., zero energy dissipation in sleep mode). However, the LP framework could easily be modified to incorporate other energy dissipation terms. For example, by using Eqs. (12), (13), and (14) energy dissipation in sleep mode can be modeled (t
                        
                           busy,i
                         is the total amount of time used for transmission and reception for node-i, t
                        
                           sleep,i
                         is the total sleep time for node-i, and Psleep
                         is the power consumption in sleep mode). Such modifications do not increase the computational complexity of the LP model, substantially. Yet, we opt to keep our model as simple as possible. Our main motivation in this study is to analyze the link unidirectionality paradigm from the energy efficiency perspective within a general framework and without going into the details of specific protocols or algorithms. In fact, a high level analysis is necessary to grasp the main trends in energy dissipation characteristics of link asymmetry in WSNs. Such an analysis necessitates the use of certain abstractions and assumptions to eliminate the shadowing effects of implementation details not specifically related to the concept under investigation, per se.

Implementation details including finite packet size and packet header can easily be integrated into our framework by changing the units of generated data from number of bits to number of packets and using transmission/reception energy dissipation values in terms of J/packet instead of J/bit, however, in this study, our focus is on lifetime ratios (not absolute values) and the effects of such constraints are insignificant. For example, assuming a single predetermined packet size for all flows and a large L
                        ×
                        si
                         then the ratio of the lifetime obtained for homogenous transmission power case and any other case is virtually unaffected by the packet size or header size because energy dissipation of all nodes will increase with the same ratio (e.g., if the packet size is 100bytes and header size is 20bytes then the actual cost of transmitting or receiving one data bit will increase by 25% in all cases, hence, the ratio of their lifetimes stays constant and will be equal to the case where packet header size is taken as zero).

WSNs are assumed to be consisting of stationary sensor nodes and unlike MANETs topology changes are not frequent. Thus, topology discovery and route creation are one-time operations — for substantial amount of time (epochs) these functions are not repeated [27]. If the network reorganization period is long enough then, the energy costs of these operations constitute a small fraction (less than 1%) of the total network energy dissipation [31]. Hence, routing overhead can be neglected in stationary WSNs without leading to significant underestimation of total energy dissipation.

LP models whose variables take continuous values are relatively easier to solve. This is due to the special geometry of the set of feasible solutions (called the feasible set) of LPs. The vertices of the feasible set are defined by the constraints of the model and it is known that, given a nonempty feasible set, there is always a vertex solution which is optimal. Hence the well-known simplex algorithm, which searches the optimal solution among the vertices greedily, is a quite effective solution method for LPs, on the average.

We use GAMS [32,33] for the numerical analysis of the developed LP model. Table 2
                      presents the parameters used in the analysis. In the following subsections we systematically explore the effects of transmission power heterogeneity in WSNs.

In this subsection, we solve the optimization problem using example topology presented in Fig. 2
                         to illustrate graphically the effects of limiting the number of links. For Rnom
                        
                        →∞ all nodes except node-2 divide the data they transmit in two parts and relay one part to the closest node and the rest to the base station directly (Fig. 2(a)). When the transmission ranges are limited (Rnom
                        
                        =300m) without any transmission power heterogeneity (Rhet
                        
                        =0) or random irregularities (pl
                        
                        =0.0) there is a 3.00% reduction in the normalized network lifetime because some of the optimal load balancing routes are not available any more (e.g., node-6 cannot directly relay some of its data directly to the base station). As the level of transmission power heterogeneity increases network lifetimes decrease (e.g., lifetimes with Rhet
                        
                        =75m and Rhet
                        
                        =225m are 0.94 and 0.84, respectively, when only bidirectional links are used). Network lifetime decreases dramatically with increasing pl
                        . For example, network lifetime for pl
                        
                        =0.75 (Fig. 2(n)) is less than one third of the lifetime obtained with pl
                        
                        =0.0 (Fig. 2(b)). The use of both bidirectional and unidirectional links leads to larger network lifetimes when compared to the network lifetimes obtained with only bidirectional links, in general. For instance, network lifetimes with Rhet
                        
                        =225m for only bidirectional links and for both bidirectional and unidirectional links are 0.84 and 0.87, respectively, and lifetimes with pl
                        
                        =0.50 are 0.60 (uni
                        +
                        bi) and 0.39 (bi). Hence, performance is better with richer routing options in terms of energy efficiency.

In this subsection, we present a detailed investigation of network characteristics by using a large scale network (a 1000m×1000m square network with 100 sensor nodes and Rnom
                        
                        =200). The data points presented in Fig. 3
                         and the subsequent figures and tables are the averages of 1000 independent runs (i.e., we solved the LP framework for 1000 randomly generated node locations, randomly selected maximum transmission ranges for each node, and randomly assigned unidirectionality probability for each link). Fig. 3 shows normalized network lifetime (normalization is achieved by dividing all network lifetime values with the lifetime obtained for Rhet
                        
                        =0) as a function of Rhet
                         for routing with only bidirectional links and for routing with both bidirectional and unidirectional links. As the level of transmission power heterogeneity increases network lifetime decreases monotonically due to the fact that network wide energy balancing with non-homogeneous transmission ranges becomes increasingly inefficient for higher levels of heterogeneity. For larger Rhet
                         values some nodes have transmission ranges much lower than the nominal transmission range and those nodes can transfer data to only a few nodes, which creates energy imbalances among the sensor nodes and leads to shorter network lifetime. Utilization of unidirectional links improves the network lifetime and the benefits of employing unidirectional links in conjunction with bidirectional links increase as the level of heterogeneity increases.

Furthermore, as Rhet
                         increases, disconnection probability of the network also increases (see Fig. 4
                        ). A network is disconnected if at least one sensor node does not have any paths to the base station. For example, for Rhet
                        
                        =20m 12.20% of the randomly generated topologies have at least one sensor node that cannot reach the base station when only bidirectional links used in communication. Utilization of both unidirectional and bidirectional links reduces disconnection probability, which is less than 0.02 for Rhet
                        
                        =20m. The number of bidirectional links and unidirectional links is presented in Fig. 5
                        , which shows that as the level of heterogeneity increases so does the number of unidirectional links. However, the number of bidirectional links is higher than the number of unidirectional links unless the level of heterogeneity is not extremely high (i.e., Rhet
                        
                        >120m).


                        Fig. 6
                         shows normalized network lifetime as a function of pl
                         for routing with only bidirectional links and for routing with both bidirectional and unidirectional links. Normalization is achieved by dividing all network lifetime values with the lifetime obtained for pl
                        
                        =0. Utilization of unidirectional links improves the network lifetime more significantly in random irregularities model when compared to the lifetime increases in transmission power heterogeneity model. The reason for such behavior is that in P-model all links can be unidirectional with equal probability (short links and long links), however, in D-model the probability of a long link being unidirectional is more than the probability of short link being unidirectional. The optimal routing decision, generally, tends to be the heavy utilization of short links due to energy efficiency. If these links are eliminated then energy efficiency is sacrificed and network lifetime rapidly decreases as pl
                         increases. For example, when only bidirectional links are utilized in D-model normalized network lifetime never drops below 0.7, however, in P-model network lifetime is zero for pl
                        
                        ≥0.8. On the other hand, when both unidirectional links and bidirectional links are utilized normalized network lifetimes are greater than 0.85 and 0.65 for D-model and P-model, respectively. Disconnection probability reaches one for pl
                        
                        ≥0.8 in P-model when only bidirectional links are utilized (Fig. 7
                        ). When both unidirectional and bidirectional links are utilized disconnection probability never exceeds 0.8 for P-model, however, for D-model disconnection probability can be larger than 0.9. We do not present a figure for the average number of unidirectional and bidirectional links because in P-model the average number of links is determined directly by the pl
                         value (e.g., if pl
                        
                        =0.2 then 20.00% of the links are unidirectional and 80.00% of the links are bidirectional).

In the previous subsection we investigated the network lifetime for a single nominal transmission range value and a single value of number of nodes in the network, however both of these parameters affect the network lifetime. Fig. 8
                         presents the normalized network lifetime as a function of Rnom
                        . Network lifetime increases as Rnom
                         increases because increasing the transmission range increases the number of links and routes available in the network which results in better energy balancing. The rate of lifetime increase by increasing Rnom
                         is monotonically decreasing because direct transmission to large distances is energy inefficient (i.e., the benefit of using extra paths created due to transmission range increase is limited by the energy inefficiency of transmission to large distances). In this subsection, we explore the design space by varying N, Rnom
                        , Rhet
                        , and pl
                         values to sample the design space. The deployment area is again a 1000m×1000m square network.

We first analyze the effects of transmission power heterogeneity. In Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6
                        
                        
                        
                        , network lifetime, aggregate number of links in the network, average link length, and disconnection probability for various N, Rnom
                        , and Rhet
                         values are presented, respectively. In Tables 3 and 4, the numbers in parenthesis give the ratio of the absolute (lifetime and number of links) values with non-zero Rhet
                         to the values for Rhet
                        
                        =0 (e.g., for N
                        =50 and Rnom
                        
                        =300m lifetime with Rhet
                        
                        =0.50×
                        Rnom
                         in uni
                        +
                        bi case is 87% of the lifetime with Rhet
                        
                        =0 in bi case). In Table 5, the values in parenthesis give the ratio of the corresponding average link lengths to the nominal maximum transmission range (Rnom
                        ).

Network lifetime increases as N and Rnom
                         increase because increasing the transmission range and/or node density increases the number of links and routes available in the network which results in better energy balancing. The effects of increasing Rnom
                         are presented in Fig. 8. For all N and Rnom
                         values network lifetime decreases as Rhet
                         increases. Furthermore, for the same set of parameters the lifetime values obtained when both bidirectional and unidirectional links are used are larger than the lifetimes obtained when only bidirectional links are used. The decrease in network lifetime is larger in sparser networks with lower Rnom
                         values. As the node density and Rnom
                         increase the impact of transmission power heterogeneity on the network lifetime decreases. For example, with N
                        =150 and Rnom
                        
                        =400m network lifetimes decrease less than 1% for Rhet
                        
                        ≤0.50×
                        Rnom
                        . The reason for such behavior is that the number of links within the network is so high (see Table 4) that elimination of a certain portion of them due to transmission power heterogeneity does not prevent the network to create flows with the available links that balance the energy dissipation throughout the network without deteriorating the network lifetime significantly. However, for larger Rhet
                         values the decrease in network lifetime increases considerably.

Average length of unidirectional links is significantly higher than the average length of bidirectional links under all circumstances. Because the occurrence of a unidirectional link instead of a bidirectional link between two nodes is more probable if the nodes have large inter-node separation. For example, assume two nodes are separated by 400m, Rnom
                        
                        =300m, and Rhet
                        
                        =0.50×
                        Rnom
                        . The occurrence of a bidirectional link under these circumstances is possible if both nodes have maximum transmission ranges larger than 400m, which has a probability of 
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 36
                              
                           
                        . A unidirectional link is created if only one of them has a maximum transmission range larger than 400m, which has a probability of 
                           
                              
                                 10
                                 36
                              
                           
                        . For lower Rnom
                         especially in sparser networks considerable decreases in disconnection probability due to the utilization of unidirectional links are observed, however, utilization of unidirectional links in conjunction with bidirectional links does not reduce disconnection probability significantly for most of the parameter sets.

The effects of random irregularities are presented in Table 7
                         (network lifetime) and Table 8
                         (disconnection probability). In Table 7, the numbers in parenthesis give the ratio of the absolute lifetime values with non-zero pl
                         to the values for pl

There are many protocols and algorithms designed to address unidirectionality in wireless networks. Furthermore, several studies investigate the effects of unidirectional links on the performance of wireless networks. However, a systematic characterization of the impact of unidirectional links on the lifetime of wireless networks, in general, and WSNs, in particular, has not been performed. In this study, we built a novel LP framework to model the energy dissipation characteristics of WSNs in the presence of unidirectional links induced by transmission power heterogeneity and random irregularities. Our framework creates the optimal flow patterns that maximize the network lifetime for routing using both (i) only bidirectional links and (ii) bidirectional links together with unidirectional links. The results we report in this study represent optimistic performance bounds and they are useful in understanding the energy dissipation trends in WSNs. We systematically explore the parameter spanning a wide range of unidirectionality scenarios (from mild to extreme unidirectionality). The reason for covering extreme unidirectionality levels is to be able to give a complete picture of the effects of unidirectionality on WSN lifetime. Furthermore, it is observed that high levels of unidirectionality exist in real life WSN deployments [1,2]. A summary of our results is itemized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           For D-model, in high node density networks, the decrease in network lifetime due to transmission power heterogeneity is negligible for large nominal transmission ranges provided that the level of heterogeneity is not extremely high and utilization of unidirectional links brings only marginal lifetime gains. For low transmission ranges and high levels of heterogeneity relative decrease in network lifetime is considerable and the benefits of utilizing unidirectional links are not negligible.

The impact of transmission power heterogeneity on the network lifetime is most severe in low node density networks with relatively lower nominal transmission ranges, especially, for high levels of heterogeneity in D-model. In such networks, utilization of unidirectional links improves the network lifetime significantly.

For P-model, utilization of unidirectional links improves the network lifetime in almost every scenario and especially for large pl
                               network lifetimes obtained by utilizing only bidirectional links are always lower than one third of the lifetimes obtained by using both unidirectional and bidirectional links.

The aggregate number of bidirectional links in the network is always higher than the aggregate number of unidirectional links for D-model unless the level of transmission power heterogeneity is extremely high. Furthermore, the average length of unidirectional links is larger than that of bidirectional links for all network settings.

Disconnection probability increases as the level of heterogeneity increases for D-model. In low node density networks with low nominal transmission ranges extreme levels of heterogeneity lead to very high network disconnection probability and utilization of unidirectional links is not effective in improving the network connectivity. For other heterogeneity levels utilization of unidirectional links brings some improvements in connectivity. In high node density networks with large nominal transmission ranges disconnection probabilities are low provided that level of heterogeneity is not extremely high.

For P-model, utilization of unidirectional links decreases disconnection probability in most of the scenarios. Especially for large pl
                               values an order of magnitude decreases in disconnection probabilities are observed. Nevertheless, in high node density networks with large nominal transmission ranges the disconnection probability is negligible either unidirectional links are utilized or not.

In general, utilization of unidirectional links improves the performance (increasing lifetime and decreasing disconnection probability) more in P-model than it does in D-model.

In strongly connected networks (i.e., each node has direct links to plenty of other nodes), deterioration of network lifetime and network connectivity due to the utilization of only bidirectional links is insignificant.

For networks which are not strongly connected, utilization of unidirectional links in conjunction with bidirectional links improves the network lifetime as well as network connectivity, considerably (e.g., more than 200% increase in network lifetime and/or an order of magnitude decrease in disconnection probability is possible by utilizing unidirectional links together with bidirectional links).
