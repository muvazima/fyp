                  In this paper, a low-complexity algorithm SAGE-USL is presented for 3-dimensional (3-D) localization of multiple acoustic sources in a shallow ocean with non-Gaussian ambient noise, using a vertical and a horizontal linear array of sensors. In the proposed method, noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Initial estimates of the unknown parameters (source coordinates, signal waveforms and noise parameters) are obtained by known/conventional methods, and a generalized expectation maximization algorithm is used to update the initial estimates iteratively. Simulation results indicate that convergence is reached in a small number of (≤10) iterations. Initialization requires one 2-D search and one 1-D search, and the iterative updates require a sequence of 1-D searches. Therefore the computational complexity of the SAGE-USL algorithm is lower than that of conventional techniques such as 3-D MUSIC by several orders of magnitude. We also derive the Cramér–Rao Bound (CRB) for 3-D localization of multiple sources in a range-independent ocean. Simulation results are presented to show that the root-mean-square localization errors of SAGE-USL are close to the corresponding CRBs and significantly lower than those of 3-D MUSIC.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Three-dimensional (3-D) localization of acoustic sources in shallow ocean is an interesting albeit challenging problem. Conventional methods of 3-D localization include several versions of the matched field processing (MFP) technique such as Bartlett, Capon, and MUSIC processors [1–3]. In the simplest and most robust version, viz., the Bartlett processor, an ambiguity function is computed by correlating the data vector measured by a horizontal linear array (HLA) with replicas of the signal vector on a 3-D grid over the search region. The resultant ambiguity function has a broad peak and a low peak-to-sidelobe ratio. Consequently, the Bartlett processor is susceptible to interference and has a low resolution. The Capon and MUSIC processors provide higher resolution. However, all these methods perform localization through a 3-D search which entails a high degree of computational complexity.

Also, an HLA does not provide good estimates of range and depth since the signal vector at an HLA is not very sensitive to variation of source range and depth. An alternative approach is to use a hybrid 2-D array composed of an HLA and a vertical linear array (VLA). The VLA data may be used to perform multiple-source range–depth estimation by any of the MFP methods [1–3] mentioned above. The HLA data may then be used in conjunction with the estimated range–depth of each source to estimate the bearing of that source through a 1-D search. This approach provides better range–depth estimates. The computational complexity is also reduced since the hybrid array requires one 2-D search for range–depth estimation and J 1-D searches for bearing estimation of J sources.

In recent years, some methods have been developed for bearing estimation of multiple sources in the ocean without prior knowledge of their ranges and depths [4–7]. These methods include subspace intersection method (SIM) [4,5], Rayleigh MUSIC (R-MUSIC) [6], and modified R-MUSIC (R-MUSIC-mdf) [7]. These methods exploit the fact that the N-dimensional signal vector at an array of N sensors belongs to an M-dimensional modal subspace if 
                        N
                        >
                        M
                     , where M is the number of normal modes supported by the underwater acoustic channel. Thus it is now possible to localize J sources through one 2-D search and one 1-D search if a hybrid array is employed.

None of the above-mentioned localization methods make any assumption about the probability distribution of the additive noise. Hence, these methods can be employed with equal facility in all types of environmental noise. However, none of these methods has any claims to optimality in the statistical sense. It is known that the best statistical performance is provided by the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator which is asymptotically efficient and unbiased. Tabrikian and Messer [8] have investigated the problem of ML localization of a monochromatic source in a range-independent ocean in the presence of Gaussian noise using a hybrid array. However, it is known that ambient noise in the ocean is often non-Gaussian with a heavy-tailed probability density function (PDF) due to the impulsive nature of several noise sources such as shipping traffic, snapping shrimp, rain, etc. [9–11]. Extension of Tabrikian and Messer's approach to the problem of localization in non-Gaussian noise is a highly complex task. ML localization involves estimation of not only the 3J coordinates of J sources but also a large number of nuisance parameters associated with the signals and noise. Fessler and Hero [12] have proposed space-alternating generalized expectation–maximization (SAGE) algorithm to decrease the complexity of ML estimation. Kozick and Sadler [13] have applied the SAGE algorithm to the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOA) and signal waveform of plane waves in non-Gaussian noise represented by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Due to the universal approximation property of the GM distribution [14], any heavy-tailed noise PDF in the ocean can be modeled as a GM with a small number of components. In this paper we present an adaptation of the Kozick and Sadler algorithm [13] for 3-D localization of multiple acoustic sources in a range-independent ocean with non-Gaussian noise.

The localization algorithm proposed in this paper will be designated space-alternating generalized expectation–maximization for underwater source localization (SAGE-USL). The proposed algorithm uses data from a hybrid array consisting of an HLA and a VLA. The signals are modeled as complex exponentials with slowly varying amplitudes. Noise is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian mixture (GM) since a wide class of non-Gaussian heavy-tailed noise distributions, including those encountered in the marine environment, can be well approximated by a GM distribution with a small number of components. The unknown parameters may be divided into two groups: (1) the desired parameters, consisting of the number of sources and their coordinates, and (2) the nuisance parameters, consisting of the signal envelopes and the parameters required to model the Gaussian mixture noise PDF. The algorithm involves initial estimation of all parameters using known methods, followed by an iterative procedure based on a modified version of the SAGE algorithm for updating the estimates sequentially. The noise parameters are initialized using a procedure similar to that of Kozick and Sadler [13]. The number of sources is estimated using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion [15]. Initial estimates of source ranges and depths are obtained from the VLA data using 2-D MUSIC algorithm [3], and initial bearing estimates are obtained from HLA data using the R-MUSIC-mdf algorithm [7]. A simple search-maximize-discard algorithm, described in Section 3 is used to determine the pairings of the range–depth and bearing estimates. The full hybrid array data and the estimated source locations are used to obtain initial estimates of the source envelopes. A modified version of the SAGE algorithm is then used to update the initial estimates. This paper is an extension of our earlier work [16] on localization of a single source in shallow ocean with non-Gaussian noise using a hybrid array.

In this paper, we have also derived expressions for Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) for 3-D localization of underwater acoustic sources in non-Gaussian noise with symmetric PDF. We have compared the root mean square localization errors of the proposed SAGE-USL algorithm and the classical 3-D MUSIC algorithm [3] with the CRB. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of 3-D MUSIC.

The paper is organized as follows. The data model is presented in Section 2. Details of the proposed 3-D localization algorithm are presented in Section 3. Derivation of the CRB is presented in Section 4. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in Section 5. Simulation results and conclusions are presented in Sections 6 and 7 respectively.

According to the normal mode theory of sound propagation in a waveguide [18], the acoustic pressure due to a point source in the far-field region can be expressed as the sum of a discrete set of normal modes. Under the far-field approximation, the signal vector at the HLA due to the jth source can be expressed as [18]

                      denote respectively the associated wavenumber and attenuation coefficient. The normal modes effectively account for multipath propagation in the waveguide. The number of propagating normal modes M is roughly proportional to the ocean depth h and the angular frequency ω. The signal vectors at the VLA are independent of the bearings because of the cylindrical symmetry of the range independent ocean, and hence we have

                      The first step in this algorithm is an initialization procedure that produces rough estimates of the unknown parameters, and it is followed by a SAGE based approach for updating the initial estimates iteratively. These two steps are explained in the following subsections.

Initial estimates of the noise parameters are obtained using the expressions proposed by Kozick and Sadler [13]. Data

The number of sources J is estimated using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion [15]. This approach involves estimation of the array data correlation matrix from a finite number of snapshots. When the noise is heavy-tailed, the estimate of the correlation matrix is prone to large errors due to the occurrence of large noise impulses. The correlation matrix estimation can be rendered robust by preprocessing the data so as to suppress the effect of the large impulses. The data-adaptive zero-memory nonlinear preprocessor (DA-ZMNL) used in [13] is therefore employed to process each sample of transformed data

                         The DA-ZMNL in (16) incorporates an initial linear part and an exponentially decaying tail. Any received sample below the threshold τ is assumed to contain no impulsive component and is passed unchanged. Samples above the threshold are assumed to be corrupted by a large noise impulse and are suppressed (bounded on Gaussian tails). Let

                         Initial estimates of the source positions are obtained using a subspace based approach. Initial range–depth estimates of all sources are obtained by applying the 2-D MUSIC algorithm to the VLA data. The 2-D MUSIC spectrum is defined as [3]

Initial bearing estimates are obtained from the HLA data using the R-MUSIC-mdf algorithm developed recently by Xu and Liu [7]. Conventional methods of bearing estimation in non-Gaussian noise, such as the Bartlett, Capon, and MUSIC processors [1–3], require either a computationally expensive 3-D search or prior knowledge of range and depth of the sources. R-MUSIC-mdf belongs to the class of bearing estimation methods using a 1-D search without prior knowledge of source ranges and depths. Other methods in this class include SIM [4] and R-MUSIC [6]. These methods exploit the normal mode structure of the acoustic field generated by the sources, and the fact that the

                         points remain. By finding the location of the largest peak of (22) among the remaining points, the location of the second source is obtained and its coordinates are removed from the original set. This procedure is continued until the association for J sources is complete.

The initial estimates are updated iteratively using the SAGE algorithm. While the basic approach is the same as that adopted by Kozick and Sadler [13] to solve the one-dimensional problem of DOA estimation, several variations have been introduced to cater to the complexities arising out of the higher dimensionality of the present problem and the use of a hybrid array. Details of the algorithm are described below.

A sequential updating procedure is used, wherein estimates of parameters in one subset are updated at a time while the values of all other parameters are held fixed at their current estimated values. The current estimate of an unknown parameter ϕ is denoted by

In the EM-algorithm (and also the SAGE algorithm), the observed data is regarded as an incomplete data set. This incomplete data set D is augmented by some hidden data (unobservable data) to generate a complete data set

                        . The hidden data is chosen so that maximization of the likelihood function of the complete data

                           , since the VLA signal vector is insensitive to change in bearing. Range–depth estimates are updated before updating the bearing estimates for the following reason. The VLA plays the dominant role in range–depth estimation, and the VLA signal vector is not sensitive to variations in bearing. On the other hand, only the HLA data plays a role in bearing estimation, and the HLA signal vector is sensitive to variations in range–depth. Hence, availability of better range–depth estimates reduces the updated bearing estimation error. Consequently, updating the range–depth estimates prior to updating the bearing estimates leads to faster convergence of the algorithm. The updated estimates of signal envelopes in (45) and the source coordinates in (48)–(50) are used to update the conditional probabilities

Estimates of the signal envelopes and noise parameters are updated by using the closed form expressions in (45) and (51)–(53). But updating the estimates of source-coordinates involves maximization of the objective functions in (48)–(50) through a search procedure. To reduce the computational complexity of the search we use the algorithm for adaptive shrinkage of the search space proposed by Chung and Bohme [21]. Let

Some remarks on the convergence of the SAGE-USL algorithm are given here. In a multi-parameter estimation problem such as the present one, generalized EM algorithms (e.g. SAGE) are preferred to the pure EM algorithm because the former involve updating of parameters in smaller groups rather than updating all the parameters simultaneously [22]. In general, the complete data set required for estimating each group of parameters is smaller than the complete data set required for estimating the entire set of unknown parameters. The likelihood function in a generalized EM algorithm is non-decreasing for all estimates of each unknown parameter [23], no matter whether they are obtained from separate complete data sets or from one single complete data set. In the SAGE-USL algorithm, we have used two complete data sets, viz., the less informative data set

                         and the more informative data set

                        ) has been analyzed and demonstrated in [12,24,25]. It has been shown in [22] that the use of a less informative complete data set leads to faster convergence. In view of the foregoing remarks, the SAGE-USL algorithm is expected to have good convergence properties. A detailed evaluation of convergence of the SAGE-USL algorithm is presented in Section 6.

Complexity of an algorithm is measured in terms of number of elementary operations used in the algorithm. We shall compare the complexities of the SAGE-USL algorithm and the 3-D MUSIC algorithm in terms of the O-notation [26]. The SAGE-USL algorithm includes an initialization stage to obtain initial estimates of all unknown parameters followed by a SAGE based algorithm to update the initial estimates. To compute the complexity of SAGE-USL algorithm, we consider the following computations which are the relatively more time consuming steps in the algorithm:

In the first experiment, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SAGE-USL algorithm by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE) of range, depth and bearing estimates with those of 3-D MUSIC and CRBs. In all the figures, CRB denotes the lower bound on the standard deviation (STD) of the estimation error. 3-D MUSIC algorithm is applied to the data after applying DA-ZMNL preprocessor to ensure a fair comparison with the SAGE-USL algorithm. In this experiment, we have considered two point sources of the same frequency

                     . RMSEs of the initial range–depth estimate by 2D-MUSIC (19) using the VLA, and the initial bearing estimate by R-MUSIC-mdf ((20)–(21)) using the HLA are also plotted in this figure to demonstrate the improvement in performance due to the iterative updates performed by the SAGE-USL algorithm. It is seen that the SAGE-USL algorithm provides a significant reduction in RMSE not only over 3-D MUSIC but also over the initial estimates provided by 2-D MUSIC and R-MUSIC-mdf. CRBs of source coordinates are also presented in Fig. 3 for comparison. It is observed that the range, depth and bearing RMSEs are close to the corresponding CRBs.

In the second simulation (Figs. 4–5
                     
                     ), we study the effect of variation of the GM noise parameters on the performance of the SAGE-USL algorithm. As indicated by Fig. 2, non-Gaussianity may be varied either by varying the frequency

                      is increased. This initial trend may be predicted from Fig. 2(b) which shows an initial increase in kurtosis at small values of

It is also of interest to compare the 3-D localization performance of SAGE-USL for different array configurations (viz. HLA, VLA, and hybrid array), and to study the dependence of the localization errors on the source coordinates. For this study, we consider a hybrid array and an HLA of 29 sensors each and a VLA of 10 sensors. Inter-sensor spacing is

                      shows the plots of CRB versus range. Similar plots of CRB versus source depth and CRB versus bearing are shown in Figs. 7 and 8
                     
                     . In view of the closeness between the RMSEs and the corresponding CRBs observed in Figs. 3–5, we can expect the variation of RMSEs with range, source depth and bearing to closely follow the trend of the CRBs. We draw the following conclusions from Figs. 6–8. Variations in range, source depth, or bearing have very little effect on the 3-D localization performance of the hybrid array. The range–depth estimation performance of the 10-sensor VLA is almost as good as that of the 30-sensor hybrid array. Improvement in the range–depth estimation performance due to the addition of the 20-sensor HLA to the 10-sensor VLA is negligible. But the VLA cannot estimate bearing whereas the hybrid array can. The HLA has poor range–depth estimation performance for sources near the broadside direction (
                        θ
                        =
                        90
                        °
                     ) and poor bearing estimation performance for sources near the endfire direction (
                        θ
                        =
                        0
                        °
                      or 180°). In general, the CRBs and RMSEs for the HLA are larger respectively than the corresponding CRBs and RMSEs for the hybrid array. It is also seen that changes in source range and depth cause fluctuations in the CRBs for the HLA, unlike the CRBs for the hybrid array. The poorer performance of the HLA may be explained as follows. The signal vector at an HLA has much lower sensitivity to variations of range and depth of a source as compared to the signal vector at a VLA. Therefore, the range–depth estimates provided by the HLA are less accurate than those provided by a VLA. But a VLA cannot be used for bearing estimation due to the cylindrical symmetry of the oceanic waveguide. A hybrid array combines the advantages of the VLA and the HLA. Therefore, the 3-D localization performance of a hybrid array is better than that of the HLA.

In the last experiment, we study the convergence rate of SAGE-USL algorithm by computing the average number of iterations required for convergence. Convergence is said to have occurred if the difference between the updated estimates and the previous estimates is below a prescribed threshold (

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented an EM algorithm, called SAGE-USL, for 3-D localization of multiple narrowband acoustic sources in a shallow ocean with heavy-tailed non-Gaussian ambient noise. Noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Acoustic pressure field measurements are made by a hybrid array composed of an HLA and a VLA. Multiple source localization by direct implementation of the maximum likelihood estimation method is a highly computation-intensive task since the set of unknown parameters, consisting of source coordinates, signal waveforms and noise parameters, is very large. In the proposed algorithm the unknown parameter set is divided into five subsets. Initial estimates of the parameters are obtained using subspace-based methods and other conventional techniques, and the estimates are updated iteratively using an EM algorithm until convergence is reached. Simulation results indicate that localization of two sources requires 6–7 iterations. Each iteration involves a sequential estimation of all the unknown parameters. The computational complexity of the SAGE-USL algorithm is significantly lower than that of the 3-D MUSIC algorithm. The MUSIC algorithm requires a 3-D search. The SAGE-USL algorithm requires one 2-D search and one 1-D search for initialization, and

We have also derived a general expression for CRB for 3-D localization of multiple acoustic sources in a shallow ocean. This expression for CRBs can be used for different circularly symmetric noise PDFs (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) and different array configuration in different channels.

We have shown that (1) SAGE-USL provides a significantly better performance than 3-D MUSIC for multiple source localization, (2) the performance of SAGE-USL improves when noise PDF becomes more heavy-tailed (a similar trend has been observed for the corresponding CRBs), and (3) the SAGE-USL algorithm converges very fast and the RMSEs of the final estimates are very close to the corresponding CRBs.
