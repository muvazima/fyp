                  Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the most powerful stochastic real parameter optimizers. An alternative adaptive DE algorithm called Expected Improvement (EI)-High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR)-DE is suggested. The EI criterion and the Kriging-HDMR are used to adjust scale factor F and crossover constant Cr
                     , respectively. Considering the expensive computational cost of evaluation, the Kriging is integrated to evaluate the objective function when an accuracy criterion is met. To compare the performance, the suggested method, it has been compared with four popular adaptive DE algorithms over 25 standard numerical benchmarks derived from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005 competition. To verify the feasibility of the suggested algorithm, a real-world application, time-dependent variable Blank Hold Force (BHF) optimization problem is also carried out by the EI-HDMR-DE. The results show that the EI-HDMR-DE improves the performance of adaptive DE and has potential capability to solve some complicated real-world applications.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Differential Evolution (DE), proposed by Storn and Price [1] is well known as an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for solving global optimization problems. Owing to its simplicity and powerful search ability, the DE has received a wide variety of real-world applications and showed excellent performance on multiplier problems in multidiscipline. For the DE, there are several strategies trial vector generation and different problems may be suitable for different strategies [2]. Additionally, control parameter settings have great influence on DE's performance [3]. For these reasons, when the DE is applied to a particular problem, it is commonly necessary to try various strategies and different combinations of control parameters. Obviously, such a trial-and-error strategy is commonly time-consuming. To address this issue, numerous DE variants have been proposed in the past years.

For the DE, there are three main control parameters: mutation scale factor F, crossover constant Cr
                     , and population size NP. Storn and Price [4] indicated that a reasonable value for NP might be assigned between 5n and 10n (n denotes the dimensionality of a problem), and an initial choice of F is 0.5. The effective range of F is commonly between 0.4 and 1. The parameter Cr
                      is utilized to control how many parameters should be changed in a population member. When the value of Cr
                      is small, only few number of parameters should be altered in each generation. Moreover, the stepwise movement tends to be orthogonal to the present coordinate axes. Conversely, most of the directions of the mutant vectors should be inherited preventing the generation of axis orthogonal trends. In extremity, when the value of Cr
                      is set to 1, the trail vector becomes a pure mutant operation. The lower value Cr
                      makes search change in each direction independently. It suggests that the lower Cr
                      value should be more suitable for the low coupled functions, such as 
                        
                           f
                           
                              (
                              X
                              )
                           
                           =
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 i
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                 1
                              
                              n
                           
                           
                              
                                 f
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    x
                                    i
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                        
                     . As mentioned by Ronkkonen and Kukkonen [11], Cr
                      should lie in (0, 0.2) when the function is separable, while in (0.9, 1) when the parameters of the function are coupled. Actually, several suggestions have been reported concerning the rules for tuning the control parameters and such kinds of settings might potentially confuse users. For example, Kenneth [12] recommended to use the trial vector generation strategy DE/current-to-rand/1 and parameter setting. Gämperle et al. [3] examined different parameter settings for the DE. Their experimental results showed that the searching capability and convergence ratio are sensitive to the selection of the control parameters. They also suggested that NP be between [3n, 8n], F equals 0.6, and Cr
                      be between [0.3, 0.9]. However, most of these settings lack sufficient experiments and theoretical foundation. Therefore, it is urgent to build an appropriate strategy to update an optimal set of control parameters in each cycle for the DE. Zaharie [13] proposed a parameter Adaptation strategy for the DE (ADE) based on controlling the population diversity, and implemented a multi-population approach. Liu and Lampinen [14] developed a Fuzzy Adaptive Differential Evolution (FADE) by using fuzzy logic controllers whose inputs incorporate the relative function values and individuals of successive generations to tune the control parameters F and Cr
                     . Brest et al. [15] suggested a self-adaptation scheme called jDE. They encoded control parameters F and Cr
                      into the individual and adjusted them by introducing two additional control parameters τ
                     1 and τ
                     2
                     . In the jDE, a set of F and Cr
                      values should be assigned to each individual population. Brest and Maučec [16] also proposed a method for reduction of population size of the DE. The method improves the efficiency and the robustness of the DE and can be applied to any DE variant. Qin et al. [2] developed a Self-adaptive DE (SaDE) algorithm, in which both trial vector generation strategies and control parameters F and Cr
                      are self-adapted by learning from previous experiences. The major feature is to use a normal distribution to approximate F. A set of F values should be randomly sampled according to pre-defined normal distribution and applied to each target vector in the present population. Similarly, the SaDE adjusts the range of Cr
                      for a given problem according to previous Cr
                      values which have generated trial vectors successfully. The JADE proposed by Zhang and Sanderson [17] generates new F values according to a truncated Cauchy distribution and new Cr values according to a normal distribution. The parameters of the Cauchy distribution and the normal distribution are updated by using new F and Cr values at each generation. The SaNSDE developed by Yang et al. [18] can be considered as a multi-distribution version of the SaDE. In the SaNSDE, two different distributions are used to generate the new F values. The fitness improvement related to each successful Cr is also considered in the SaNSDE in updating the mean of the Gaussian distribution for generation of new Cr. Because various mutation strategies with different parameter settings might be suitable for different stages of the DE. Mallepeddi et al. [24] proposed the EPSDE (Ensemble of mutation strategies and Parameters in the DE) for selecting a combination of mutation strategy and parameter setting. In the EPSDE, combinations of mutation strategy and parameter setting are generated at the individual level and better combinations should be propagated to the next iteration. Elsayed et al. [25] proposed a differential evolution algorithm with Self-Adaptive multi-combination Strategies (SAS-DE), in which four mutation strategies, two crossover strategies, and two constraint handling techniques are used. Fan and Xuefeng [26] suggested a Discrete Mutation Control Parameters Self Adaptive DE (DMPSADE). Wang et al. [27] suggested a hybrid approach that combines the adaptive DE algorithm with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), called ADE-BPNN. In the ADE-BPNN, ADE is implemented to search the global initial connection weights and thresholds of BPNN. The BPNN is utilized to thoroughly search the optimal weights and thresholds. Yi et al. [28] implemented pbest roulette wheel selection and retention to develop a new adaptive DE.

In this study, an alternative adaptive DE is suggested. Compared with the other adaptive DEs, the distinctive characteristics of the suggested method is to use the Expected Improvement (EI) criterion to tune the F and employ the High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) to determine the Cr
                      . The rest of paper is organized as follows. The DE is briefly introduced in Section 2. The details of suggested new DE algorithm are described in Section 3. Numerical tests and an application by the suggested algorithm are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

                        . Sequentially, the DE iteratively uses the trial vector generation strategy and the selection operator to generate populations until a stopping criterion is met. The framework of the classical DE can be demonstrated in Table 1.
                        
                     

For the mutation operator, five commonly used mutation strategies for generating a mutant vector are described as shown in Table 2
                        . After the mutation operation, crossover operation should be applied to each pair of the target vector

Generally, the performance of the DE largely depends on the values of the control parameters, F and Cr
                        . Similar to other search algorithms, the exploration and exploitation of a design space should be addressed. As mentioned in Črepinšek‘s literature (2013), exploration is the process of visiting entirely new regions of a search space, whilst exploitation is the process of visiting those regions of a search space within the neighborhood of previously visited points. In the previous developed DEs, the SaDE Qin et al. [2] used various DEs for each individual to maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation. In our opinion, exploitation and exploration can be adjusted by F. Moreover, another important parameter Cr
                         commonly is determined by the separable and dependent characteristics of given problems. Therefore, the performance of DE might be further improved in these two issues. In the proposed algorithm, the EI criterion is used to tune the mutation scale parameter F and the HDMR expansion is used to update the crossover constant Cr
                        
                        , respectively. The framework of EI-HDMR-DE is briefly demonstrated in Table 3 and details of the EI-HDMR-DE should be described in this section.

As mentioned before, some theoretical studies on the DEs have indicated that the scale factor F is a key role in controlling the population diversity and the explorative power of the DE. Generally, a higher value of F accounts for larger perturbation to the target vectors, thus avoiding premature convergence at local optima. Considering the characteristic of F, the EI criterion is imported to determine the mutation scale factor F. In this study, two alternative mutation strategies, called DE/current-to-sbest and DE/current-to-umost are suggested.

In DE/current-to-sbest, a mutation vector is generated as following form:

Compared with other mutation strategies, the most attractive characteristic of the suggested strategy considers the exploitation of optima and the exploration of uncertain areas explicitly. In Eq. (6), the second term (Eq. (4)) is to find the potential best population and the third one (Eq. (5)) is to locate the uncertain areas. To make the mathematical meaning clearly, the EI criterion and its Fi
                            prediction procedure are briefly introduced in Section 3.2.2.

The EI criterion is used to add new sample (population) to the present sample set upon the Present Best Sample (PBS) y*, the improvement at the sample

                           denotes the difference between the present minimum and the predicted value multiplied by the probability that predicted response value is smaller than y*. Therefore, this term is large where 
                              
                                 y

                            is likely smaller than y*. It enhances the accuracy of a surrogate model solely in the region of the present minimum, and performs the capability of the exploitation. Therefore, for DE/current-to-sbest, top 50 best individuals can be obtained by Kriging model according to Eq. (9).

Commonly, the value of the EI is predicted by the Kriging model in a famous Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) Jones et al. [5]. Kriging models the response of the response of Y(

HDMR introduced by Rabitz et al. [6] is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for recognizing the high dimensional relationships between input variables and output responses. Similar to Taylor expansion, a HDMR expresses a high dimension function as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the input variables, which can efficiently reduce sampling effort for learning the behavior of high dimension systems and intelligently identify the correlated relationship amongst variables. Shorter et al. [7] used the HDMR to build an efficient chemical kinetics solver. Li et al. [9] proposed a HDMR-based random sampling method and developed an approach to approximate its different component functions. Recently, Shan and Wang [21] combined the Radial Basis Function (RBF) with the cut-HDMR for high dimension expensive underlying problems. Wang et al. [22] used Moving Least Square (MLS) as a basis function for the HDMR and applied to high dimensional problems. In this study, because the EI is predicted by the Kriging method, the Kriging-HDMR is utilized to disclose the correlative relationship for given problems.

In this study, the cut-HDMR based Kriging interpolation procedure is used to construct a surrogate. Using the cut-HDMR method, a cut point 
                           x
                        
                        
                           c
                         is defined in the design space. In the convergence limit, the cut-HDMR is invariant to the choice of cut point 
                           x
                        
                        
                           c
                        . In this study, 
                           x
                        
                        
                           c
                         is selected as the center point of Hypercube. Response functions are determined by evaluating the input–output responses of the system relative to the defined cut point 
                           x
                        
                        
                           c
                         along associated lines, planes, sub volumes, etc. (i.e. cuts) in the input variable space. This procedure reduces to the optimal functions of cut-HDMR in Eq. (19) possess the following form.

                        ), and (xi, xj, xk
                        ). The higher order terms are evaluated as cuts in the design space through a cut point. Therefore, each first-order term fi
                        (xi
                        ) is evaluated along its variable axis through the center point. Each second-order term fij
                        (xi, xj
                        ) is evaluated in a plane defined by the binary set of input variables (xi, xj
                        ) through the cut point; etc. The procedure of subtracting the lower order expansion functions removes their dependence to assure a unique contribution from the new expansion function. The last term presented as Eq. (24) is determined by the difference between and all other component functions in Eq. (25). Finally, substituting the Kriging expression into the HDMR, a simple expression can be given as follow.

                         is sum of all coefficient values of independent terms. According to Eq. (27), the Cr
                         used in the suggested algorithm is essentially the proportion of correlative terms. Generally, Cr
                         should be 0 when the function is completely separable, while Cr
                         is 1 when the function's parameters are full coupled. Obviously, Eq. (27) is accord with Ronkkonen and Kukkonen [11] deduction.

To assess the performance of the suggested method, we have carried out different experiments using a test suite proposed in the CEC2005 special session on real-parameter optimization. The test suite consists of 25 benchmark functions, involving:

                           
                              ➢

                                 5

Expanded multimodal function f
                                 13 and f

The details of these test functions can be found in KanGAL report (2005). All functions are tested in 30n and some of test functions are tested in 50n. Considering the limited computational resource, all algorithms in this test are assigned to 6e+04 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs) and NP is set to 5n. For each algorithm, the mean and STD of the minimum function error values should be given. The number of independent runs for each test is 50. As recommended in CEC2005, the NFEs should be set to 1.0e+04n. However, considering the limited computational cost in practice, the NFEs is set to 6.0e+04 in this test. In our opinion, such setting is more feasible for practical problems, especially for simulation-based problems.

Because the suggested method can be categorized as an adaptive DE, 4 popular self-adaptive DE variants, involving jDE, SaDE, JADE and EPSDE are employed to compare the suggested method as: jDE with Flower
                        
                        =0.1, Fupper
                        
                        =0.9 and τ
                        1
                        =
                        τ
                        2
                        =0.1, SaDE, JADE with c
                        =0.1, p
                        =0.05 and Cr
                        
                        =0.9, EPSDE. All tested DE variants start from the same initial populations in each run so that any difference in their performances may be attributed to their internal search operators only. However, because the suggested EI-HDMR-DE uses the HDMR to update Cr
                        , there are additional 60 populations (for 30n problems) and 100 populations (for 50n problems) generated by 2-level FF. As mentioned before, these initial populations should be on the each variable axis and used to construct the initial cut-HDMR model and check the correlative relationships among the design variables.

Moreover, as mentioned before, R
                        2 is used to determine whether the surrogate-based evaluation strategy is activated by using the LOOCV. In this test, the R
                        2 is set to 0.9.

                        Table 4
                         shows the mean and the STD of the best-of-run errors for 50 independent runs of each of 5 adaptive DE variants on 25 numerical benchmarks for 30n problems. For unimodal functions f
                        1–f
                        5, for f
                        1, f
                        2 and f
                        4, all methods achieve the nearly global optima. To observe convergence ratio of the suggested algorithm, the convergence curves of some functions which are commonly difficult to be solved are illustrated. For Fig. 1
                        , median runs of (where the runs were sorted according to the final best error values) for all adaptive DE variants are demonstrated. For unimodal functions, convergence curves of f
                        3 and f
                        5 are showed in Fig. 1. To observe the early stage of optimization procedure of each test clearly, the convergence curves limited in 1.00e+04 NFEs are also illustrated. According to Table 4 and Fig. 1, it is easy to observe that the EI-HDMR-DE is easier to converge compared with others. For basic multimodal functions, the EI-HDMR-DE also outperforms others as shown in Table 4. The convergence curve of f
                        12 is shown in Fig. 2
                        . According to Fig. 2(a), the JADE is easier to converge compared with others in the early stage. However, when the scale of the vertical axis is limited to 5.00e+05, only convergence curves of the JADE and the EI-HDMR-DE can be observed. Moreover, it can be found the convergence ratio of the EI-HDMR-DE is faster than the JADE after 4.00e+03 NFEs. After 6.00e+04 NFEs, the EI-HDMR-DE converges to over 80. Additionally, it is important to note that the surrogate assisted evaluation is activated for only f
                        1, f
                        2 and f
                        4 after about 5.00e+03 runs based on the exact function evaluations. For f
                        3 and f
                        5, the surrogate evaluation strategy is actually not activated because R
                        2 is less than 0.9 during the entire optimization procedure.

For expanded multimodal function f
                        13 and f
                        14 and hybrid composition functions f
                        15–f
                        25, the EI-HDMR-DE outperformed other algorithms in a statistically significant fashion (as revealed by Table 5
                        ) over most of test functions. It also manages to remain second best for functions f
                        16 and f
                        19 being outperformed by the JADE and the EPSDE, respectively. For f
                        25, the performance of the EI-HDMR-DE is similar to the jDE and remains the second stable. To observe the convergence ratio further, the corresponding curve of f
                        25 is also illustrated in Fig. 3
                        . It can be found that the performances of the EI-HDMR-DE and the EPSDE are similar. However, the EI-HDMR-DE is easier to converge as shown in Fig. 3(b). Similar to previous unimodal function test, for f
                        9, f
                        10, f
                        13, the surrogate assisted evaluation is activated. To further investigate the performance of the surrogate model, the NFEs of satisfying the accuracy criterion for these functions are also listed in Table 6
                        . For f
                        1, f
                        2, and f
                        19, the mean of NFEs is controlled with 1.50e+04, the computationally cost can be reduced significantly. The other functions listed in Table 6 cost more evaluations to arrive the accuracy criterion. It suggests that the Kriging might not be suitable for some complicated high dimensional problems.

To investigate the convergence ratio of the suggested method for higher dimensional problems, comparative results of all mentioned algorithms in functions f
                        1 to f
                        14, f
                        25 in 50n problems are also given. The last 9 hybrid composition functions are neglected except f
                        25 because most of them incur huge computational time in 50n. Considering the curse of dimensionality, the maximum NFEs is reset to 1.00e+05 for 50n problems. According to Table 7
                        , for most of test functions, the performance of the EI-HDMR-DE is better than others. To observe the convergence history, convergence curve of f
                        25 in the limited iterations is also demonstrated in Fig. 4
                        . Similar to Fig. 3(b), performances of the EPSDE and the EI-HDMR-DE are nearly the same. However, for other functions, stability and convergence ratio are obviously better.

Generally, performance of the EI-HDMR-DE outperforms others for most of test functions. Moreover, because the surrogate model is used, the efficiency of the EI-HDMR-DE can be improved significantly if the surrogate evaluation is activated. Theoretically, efficiency of surrogate assisted DE should be improved significantly if the accuracy of surrogate is high enough. Therefore, some other surrogate modeling method, such as RBF, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), MLS and HDMR might obtain better performance. Additionally, the different accuracy criteria setting also lead to various solutions. Although this is not the key issue in this paper, these issues is worth studying further later.

In this section, the EI-HDMR-DE is applied to optimization of time-dependent BHF in sheet forming design. This case is derived from NUMISHEET 2014. Considering the expensive computational cost, the comparison with other adaptive DE methods is not carried out and the accuracy criterion for Kriging model is set to 0.8.

In recent 20 years, the sheet forming optimization, especially optimization of BHF, is attracting more attention (Chengzhi [10], Zhang and Shivpuri [19], Wang et al. [20]). It was well known, wrinkling and fracture are the main failure modes in sheet forming process. They can be reduced or eliminated by manipulating a suitable BHF at different locations. If the BHF is too low, wrinkling will probably occur at the start of punch stroke; otherwise fracture will occur at the end of the stroke. Therefore, wisely selecting sensitive areas at which different modes of failure will occur and reasonably changing BHF at these sensitive locations are both very important to achieve a part of quality. To optimize the variable BHF, entire time period of entire forming procedure should be decomposed into several stages and given according to experience. However, these given time periods might not be the most suitable setting for improving the quality of blank. Therefore, the boundary of each time period is considered in this work. Obviously, the number of design of this problem should be increased significantly. This is why we hope to apply the EI-HDMR-DE to such problem.

This case is derived from benchmark 2 of NUMISHEET2014. The geometry of the tools and mesh is presented in Figs. 5

Details about tool materials and blank material can be found in NUMISHEET2014 benchmark2. A numerical simulation is carried out by using the FE code DYNAFORM.

The blank of FE model is initially meshed with 18,204 nodes and 17,881 quadratic elements. The stamping speed is taken into account for the forming process with a constant. It is set to 5mm/s. The entire forming procedure is set to 100ms.

In this work, beside the BHF in each time period, the key point of each time region is another kind of design variable. Initially, 168 initial samples (will be discussed in Section 5.4) are evaluated first. Then, the average thickness variation can be obtained as shown in Fig. 7
                        . The entire time period can be divided into 6 sections according to the local peak points of the curve. The large changes in thickness variation have been selected when a relatively small time increased in each of these 6 regions. As a result, it is wise to choose this 6 regions as sensitive time areas in this work. The bounds and the initial values of design variables with key time points are listed in Table 8.
                        
                     

Furthermore, another type of design variable, the BHF can be expressed as

Therefore, the number of design variables is 14.

To evaluate the possibility of wrinkling and cracking, the strains in the formed blank elements are analyzed and compared against in the Forming Limit Diagram (FLD, shown as Fig. 8
                        ). As a result, the following function describing the possibility of wrinkling and cracking is taken as the objective function.

Latin Hypercube Design (LHD) and the 2-level FF are used to generate initial 140(14*10) populations (samples) and 28 (14*2) populations on each design variable axis. The entire optimization procedure (the maximum NFE is limited to 200) is about 132 hours. The convergence curves of the EI-HDMR-DE for the optimization of time dependent variable BHF in the rectangular box forming process are presented in Fig. 9
                        . Values of the design variables of before and after optimization by the EI-HDMR-DE are listed in Table 9
                         and the corresponding curves are illustrated in Fig. 10
                        . The comparison of the resulting FLDs and the blank forming quality at initial and optimal design is shown in Fig. 11
                        . It should be noted that the initial design is the best one from 168 initial samples. According to Fig. 11(a), although all elements are far from the crack bound, the blank is not fully extruded. Therefore, the quality of the blank cannot be promised. As shown in Fig. 11(b), compared with the result before optimization, the blank has been fully extruded. Obviously, the quality of the blank is improved.

In this study, an alternative adaptive DE algorithm called EI-HDMR-DE is suggested. According to the 30n and 50n test results, the suggested method outperforms some popular adaptive DE methods for most of test functions. Furthermore, a time-dependent sheet forming optimization is also solved by the EI-HDMR-DE. The result shows that the EI-HDMR-DE has potential capability to solve some real-world problems. Generally, the distinctive characteristics of the EI-HDMR-DE can be summarized as follows.

In mutation phase, two alternative mutation strategies, called DE/current-to-sbest and DE/current-to-umost are suggested. They are employed to find the best solution in current iteration and locate uncertain areas. Furthermore, because the exploitation and exploration can be adjusted by scale factor F, the EI criterion is used to determine the F in each iteration adaptively by importing the Kriging modeling method.

In crossover phase, because Cr
                      commonly is determined by the separable and dependent characteristics, a novel modeling method, HDMR is employed to disclose the correlative relationships of the given problems and can be determine the value of Cr
                      directly.

To save the computational cost further, the Kriging is used to evaluate the objective function during optimization when the accuracy criterion is met. However, for most of multimodal cases, it is difficult for Kriging to construct highly accurate model. Considering the diversities of different surrogate model combination and accuracy criterion setting, this issue should be studied further later.

To validate the performance of the suggested method, an important sheet forming optimization application, the variable BHF design has been optimized by the EI-HDMR-DE. Compared with the traditional variable BHF problem, key time points are also considered. Therefore, the number of design variables should be increased. According to the result after optimization, the quality of formed blank has been improved. It suggests that the EI-HDMR-DE has a potential ability to solve real engineering application.
