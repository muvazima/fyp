                  Myocardial Infarction (MI) or acute MI (AMI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Precise and timely identification of MI and extent of muscle damage helps in early treatment and reduction in the time taken for further tests. MI diagnosis using 2D echocardiography is prone to inter-/intra-observer variability in the assessment. Therefore, a computerised scheme based on image processing and artificial intelligent techniques can reduce the workload of clinicians and improve the diagnosis accuracy. A Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of infarcted and normal ultrasound images will be useful for clinicians. In this study, the performance of CAD approach using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), second order statistics calculated from Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Higher-Order Spectra (HOS) texture descriptors are compared. The proposed system is validated using 400 MI and 400 normal ultrasound images, obtained from 80 patients with MI and 80 normal subjects. The extracted features are ranked based on t-value and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to obtain the best performance using minimum number of features. The features extracted from DWT coefficients obtained an accuracy of 99.5%, sensitivity of 99.75% and specificity of 99.25%; GLCM have achieved an accuracy of 85.75%, sensitivity of 90.25% and specificity of 81.25%; and HOS obtained an accuracy of 93.0%, sensitivity of 94.75% and specificity of 91.25%. Among the three techniques presented DWT yielded the highest classification accuracy. Thus, the proposed CAD approach may be used as a complementary tool to assist cardiologists in making a more accurate diagnosis for the presence of MI.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Myocardial Infarction (MI), the most common complication of coronary heart disease (CHD) affect millions of people worldwide, is an irreversible damage of the heart muscles caused by partial or complete blockage in the coronary artery. The clinical presentation and outcome depend on the location of the blockages, severity and duration of MI. MI progresses with time, highlighting the need for continual monitoring for recognition of underlying or forthcoming left ventricular (LV) remodelling and related complications [1]. The most important issue in the management of MI patients is to detect myocardial viability for reperfusion treatment, and the degree and type of LV remodelling [51]. Early reperfusion treatment and quantification of LV remodelling (e.g. using LV shape descriptors) of MI patients potentially improves LV function, survival and reverse of LV remodelling [51]. Therefore, (i) identification of myocardial viability and detection of myocardial damage immediately after MI; (ii) detection of infarct expansion and the extent of decline in LV function are early requirements for optimal treatment and management.

After an acute phase of MI, cardiac imaging can provide a wealth of valuable details for patient management. Given the variety of imaging options, the final selection would depend on the availability, cost and risks involved. Two dimensional (2D) echocardiography possesses several advantages – such as portability, low cost, widespread availability, no need for radiation and contrast agents. The clinical choice therefore differs depending on resources, patient characteristics and, individual experience of the physician.

An echocardiogram obtained as early as possible in the acute phase of MI helps to exclude acute mechanical complications by regional and global LV function assessment. In case of emergency such as when patients experience sudden deterioration, hypotension, acute heart failure or a new murmur, urgent echocardiography is mandatory [22].


                     
                     Fig. 1 shows the typical 2D echocardiography images of normal and MI patients in the parasternal short axis mid-left ventricular view captured during diastole and systole. Not only does the 2D echocardiography allow direct and adequate visualisation of real time regional wall motion abnormalities during chronic and acute phases of MI, it also allows accurate localisation of infarcted areas. In addition, the wall motion score index (WMSI) evaluated by 2D echocardiography, an index of LV function, is a good indicator of prognosis in-hospital and after the discharge [45,29].

The evaluation of the echocardiography image features by the echo technologists or cardiologists is important to diagnose MI, infarct expansion, extent of muscle damage and LV remodelling [37]. The accurate visual interpretation of the image features requires experience and training. In addition, the interpretation is always vulnerable to intra- and inter-observer variability [17]. And also the echocardiography images are limited by the low resolution and artefacts which hinders the visual identification of subtle changes. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approach could be useful in order to provide the cardiologists an objective interpretation of echocardiogram provided that a proper model and implementation are found. The importance of cardiac disease has inspired the implementation of state-of-the-art of clinical imaging methods and signal analysis to assist in diagnosis and clinical planning [47]. CAD is an emerging concept developed by combining the knowledge of medicine and image processing in clinical settings. To understand the philosophy of CAD, it is necessary to follow a particular protocol. A typical protocol for a CAD system consists of different stages, namely (i) image acquisition and pre-processing, (ii) segmentation/region-of-interest (ROI) selection, (iii) image feature extraction and (iv) classification. Previous researchers, Fujita et al. [24]) and Ginneken et al. [26]), have reviewed and summarised the latest development and application of CAD system. The advanced image processing techniques (e.g. DWT, first and second-order statistics and HOS) based CAD approaches in ultrasound images [3,10,50,28,12], including detection of abnormalities, e.g. atherosclerosis, LV dysfunction, coronary plaque and MI [36,5,2,4,12] may aid doctors to expedite screening large populations of abnormalities and to facilitate for proper treatment.

Few first-order statistics, such as intensity, skewness, kurtosis and entropy are calculated from the texture, and then used to classify normal and MI subjects [49,38,34]. The features extracted from the sub bands of DWT are used for the diagnosis of MI using ultrasound images [39,40]. These features extracted using first/second-order statistics and DWT texture descriptors are able to identify the minute changes of patterns in the echocardiography images. The HOS is a nonlinear method which [14] can capture interaction among its frequency components and phase coupling. Hence, in this work the performance of texture descriptors DWT, second-order statistics computed from the GLCM and HOS in identification of MI using echocardiography images are evaluated.

Over the years, investigators developed various types of CAD systems for identification of lesions and distinctive diagnosis of detected lesions based on classification between malignant and benign lesions [31,20]. Among them, few CAD systems for identification of lesions like breast lesions on mammograms are successfully applied in clinical situations [33,25]. To date, no significant efforts have been made to employ CAD approaches for diagnosis of MI or other cardiac abnormalities using ultrasound images. The application of CAD concept in echocardiography for the detection of MI is a new field that has not been studied adequately and is still in its infancy for potential full application. Hence, there is a need to explore the application of CAD scheme on echocardiogram images for the detection of MI. In our previous review paper [50], we have comprehensively discussed the various echocardiography image analysis methods used for the automated identification of MIs.

In this research paper, performance of CAD of MI using echocardiography images with DWT, GLCM and HOS methods are evaluated. These three texture descriptors are used to extract important echocardiography image features for developing an automatic detection of MI.

The proposed system is shown in 
                     Fig. 2. In this system, normal and MI echocardiography images are subjected to pre-processing using adaptive histogram equalisation. Following steps are carried out on the pre-processed echocardiography images:
                        
                           (a)
                           Features are extracted;
                                 
                                    i.
                                    on the DWT coefficients,

based on second-order statistics computed from GLCM, and

from bispectrum coefficients of HOS.

These three set of extracted features are ranked separately using t-value.

The highly ranked features from each method are fed to the classifier support vector machine (SVM) one by one separately, to get the highest classification accuracy using minimum number of features.

The echocardiogram image data required for the study were collected from National Heart Centre, Singapore using ultrasound scanner (ProSound α 10, ALOKA Hitachi, Japan). For this work, a total of 160 subjects (80 MI and 80 non-MI) were enroled. Echocardiography video sequences captured in the parasternal short axis mid-left ventricular view were analysed. The age of the subjects (both male and female) ranges from 21 to 75 years. Among MI subjects, the echocardiography data used are from the subjects׳ images acquired soon after onset of MI.

Typical temporal frame resolutions were 30 frames/seconds. From each echocardiography video sequence of approximately the same duration, the non-consecutive frames from each patient (having 20 frames) were obtained (i.e. 5 equally spaced frames from each sequence of 20 frames) automatically using algorithm. These 5 frames chosen shall include both end diastolic and end systolic phases (i.e. one cardiac cycle). A total of 800 echocardiography image frames were thus available for analysis (400 non-MI and 400 MI images). All the images were cropped automatically to a resolution of 400×500 pixels by retaining only the heart region pixels and stored in JPEG format. For this study, approval has been obtained from the Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB). We have obtained approval for waver of consent from IRB as this is a retrospective study which does not involve any patient recruitment.

The pre-processing step involves enhancement of image contrast to help in the process of feature extraction. In this work, the red–green–blue (RGB) colour echocardiography heart images are changed into grayscale images. Then the grayscale images contrast is improved by using adaptive histogram equalisation [27]. By performing adaptive histogram equalisation, the dynamic range of image histogram gets increased and input image pixels intensity values are assigned in such a way that the output image comprises a uniform intensity distribution.

@&#METHODS@&#

The feature extraction from textural image is one of the important steps in an automated CAD system. The image features can be extracted using texture analysis [35,46] and other methods. In this present work, three texture descriptors (DWT, GLCM and HOS) are used to analyse the echocardiography image features. Brief descriptions of those methods are explained in the following sections.

Wavelets are mathematical functions which first divide the data into components of multiple frequencies, and then perform the study on each component with a resolution of its scale [9]. Wavelet transform (WT) decomposes a signal into basis functions which are known as wavelets. The WT is calculated separately for different frequencies resulting in multi-resolution analysis. The DWT gives a multi-resolution description of a signal, which is very useful in analysing the signals [44]. It decomposes a signal into a ranking of scales which ranges from the roughest scale to the finest one. Hence, this method provides portray of an image at different resolutions, and is useful tool for image feature extraction.

The DWT decomposes 2D image at level i into approximation coefficients (cA
                              i
                           ) and detail coefficients in three orientations (horizontal cH
                              i
                           , vertical cV
                              i
                            and diagonal cD
                              i
                           ). The approximation coefficients can be further decomposed in the same way for the second-level. In this work, we have performed the image decomposition up to second level and extracted Energy (cA
                              i
                           _E, cD

                           _E) and Kapur׳s entropy (cA

                           , where the pixels are separated with a distance d at ith and jth gray level. In this present work, four angles (0°, 45°, 90° and 135°) are considered with pixels distance of 1. The second-order statistical features (energy (E), contrast (Con), correlation (Cor), homogeneity (Hom), entropy (Ent), autocorrelation (AutCor), dissimilarity (Dis), cluster shade (Shade), max probability (MaxProb), difference variance (DVar), difference entropy (Dent), sum average (SAver), sum entropy (SEnt), sum variance (SVar), information correlation measure 1 (InfM1), and information correlation measure 2 (InfM2)) are calculated using the GLCM [7].

In this work, Radon transformation is first performed to transform the 2D image into one dimensional signal, before extracting the important features by using the HOS method [2]. In this work, Radon transform is performed for every 10° rotation of whole images. The HOS method is one of the powerful techniques used for the analysis of non-linear properties of the images [6,41]. HOS is the spectral portrayal of higher order statistics such as third and higher order moments and cumulants. The third-order statistics of the image bispectrum is used in this work. The bispectrum displays symmetry and is evaluated in the principal domain region Ω 
                           [13,18,19].

The bispectral entropies – normalised bispectral entropy (BS_Ent1) and normalised bispectral squared entropy (BS_Ent2) [16,15] are also computed in this paper.

Feature ranking helps to rank the significant features according to their discriminating criteria [23]. In this current work, the significant features are ranked using t-values [11] and are fed to the classifier for classification.

In this current work, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for automated classification. SVM classifier is a supervised learning method, which performs the classification by constructing a separating hyper-plane in an n-dimensional space where n is the number of input features. The hyper-plane constructed separates input data classes. Using nonlinear kernel function, such as polynomial function of order 1 (linear), order 2, and order 3, and radial basis function (RBF), the input data is transformed to a high-dimensional feature space so that the transformed data becomes more separable than the original input data [21].

The 10-fold cross validation technique is used to evaluate the classifier performance. The original features׳ dataset is divided into 10 equal sets. The first nine sets are used for training the classifier, and the 10th set is used for testing the classifier. This process is repeated 10 times using different sets of test data. The average of 10-folds is used to evaluate the performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV)) of the classifier.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this current work, DWT, GLCM and HOS are used to extract features from echocardiography images to identify the differentiation between normal and MI cases. Our experiment findings are discussed in the following sections.


                        
                        
                        
                        Tables 1–3 show the statistical analysis results of various features obtained from DWT coefficients, GLCM (second-order statistics) and HOS using echocardiography images. All 16 features extracted from DWT coefficients exhibit clear distinction between normal and MI echocardiography images (Table 1). This method identifies the subtle changes occurring in image pixels in vertical, diagonal and horizontal directions. Similarly, all 16 second-order statistical parameters obtained in Table 2 using GLCM also presents distinct differentiation between normal and MI classes. Using HOS total of 108 features are extracted from echocardiography images. The first 37 features out of 108 shown in Table 3 demonstrate the differentiation between two groups of images.

It can be seen from the result tables that, entropy values are high for normal class compared to MI due to more variations in the pixels in normal echocardiography images. Pixels in images of MI class exhibit less variation due to the insufficient blood flow to the myocardium. Each set of parameters extracted using three texture descriptors are ranked using t-values. All 16 features of Tables 1and 2 and first 37 highly ranked features of Table 3 are subjected to classification using SVM classifier.


                        
                        
                        
                        Tables 4–6 show the results of classification using DWT, GLCM and HOS methods, respectively. Table 4 shows that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel achieved an accuracy of 99.50%, sensitivity of 99.75% and specificity of 99.25% using 16 features obtained from DWT coefficients (Table 4). Table 5 shows that the SVM classifier with polynomial of order 3 kernel yielded 85.75% accuracy, 90.25% sensitivity and 81.25% specificity using 16 features computed from GLCM. Table 6 shows that, the SVM classifier with RBF kernel achieved 93.0% accuracy, 94.75% sensitivity and 91.25% specificity using 23 features obtained from HOS.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this present work, the performance of DWT, GLCM and HOS in CAD of MI using echocardiography images are compared. The results obtained clearly show that these three methods are able to pick up minute changes in the echocardiography images effectively and hence yielded high accuracy. DWT helps to quantify sudden changes in the pixels and hence the entropy value is lower for MI compared to normal class. This indicates that the high frequency components are less in MI cases. Entropy computed from the DWT coefficients in the horizontal (cH1-Ent, cH2-Ent) and vertical (cV1-Ent and cV2-Ent) directions have provided highest discrimination. Echocardiography images with non-uniform pixels cannot be fully described by second-order statistics (GLCM). Second-order statistics can describe minimum phase system only [43]. Therefore, the higher-order statistical method (HOS) is used to reveal information of the phase and nonlinearity present in MI cases. Hence HOS-based features are more discriminative than the second-order statistics (GLCM). Moreover, HOS performs better even in noisy conditions and thus is able to capture the nonlinear interaction of the pixels in the frequency domain and also phase coupling [8,43].

The summary of previous studies conducted on CAD of MI, by using echocardiography images, is presented in 
                     Table 7. It can be seen from the table that few researchers used DWT, GLCM (second-order statistics) and HOS for the detection of MI.

In a study by Skorton et al. [48], the kurtosis feature extracted by using statistical methods showed early changes in MI echocardiography images; this study evidenced an average sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 70% for the diagnosis of MI. Then Kamath et al. [34] differentiated normal and scarred regions of MI based on the gray levels of the pixels, normalised with respect to the reflection amplitude of the pericardium. The study is able to identify the highly reflectile echo (HRE) zones using computerised echo image texture analysis and these zones are correlated with infarcted myocardium.

Tak et al. [49] used mean pixel intensity feature for the detection of MI. The study reported that the improvement of abnormal wall motion from 29% (week 1) to 40% (week 2) in patients after MI are able to be identified using statistical methods. In the study of Moldovanu et al. [38], the computer-aided technique automatically crops the ROIs from the apical two chamber area. Further from ROIs, the features computed using first order statistics for end-systole and end-diastole frames are extracted. From extracted features, the salient features entropy, standard deviation and mean showed a difference between normal and infarcted myocardium.

Mojsilovic et al. [39] demonstrated analysis and classification of small dimension image samples using new wavelet-based approach, to describe the quality of infarcted myocardial tissue. Therein, energy features are calculated by using a proposed wavelet method and classified by using unsupervised classification technique based on a modified statistical t-test. The algorithm detected MI condition with highest classification rate of 96%.

Neskovic et al. [40] provided a novel approach for non-invasive assessment of viability of myocardium in the early post-infarction period and used wavelet image decomposition to characterise the myocardial tissue. The performance of the proposed method increased from day 1 (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 86%, accuracy: 78%) to week 3 (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 100%, accuracy: 100%).

Agani et al. [10] employed an automated system based on wavelet combined with the GLCM method to identify MI. The algorithm computed features such as energy, entropy, contrast and inverse difference moment on various sub bands of the image. Their technique yielded 91.32% accuracy using Mahalanobis distance classifier.

Compared to the previous studies, in our proposed method, we have obtained more than 92% classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using DWT, and HOS methods. However, we have reported more than 92% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using 16 features obtained from DWT coefficients.

The following inferences can be made between the previous works (summarised in Table 7) and the results of our study summarised in Tables 4–6:
                        
                           (a)
                           In the previous studies cited in Table 7, MI was diagnosed based on the manually cropped region. On the other hand, our proposed method is completely automatic and does not involve any segmentation.

We have used more subjects than the previous studies (Table 7), and reported more than 92% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using 10-fold cross validation. Hence our proposed method is more robust.

Our method is non-invasive and does not involve using any contrast agent.

It can reduce the workload of clinicians significantly.

In our work, the algorithms and methods are developed into the prototype system. They are validated using the 10-fold cross validation method on in-house database which are acquired from the collaborative hospital. Using this prototype system, the methodology proposed provided >92% of accuracy. However, an independent test dataset will be obtained in future to validate our proposed system.

On the other hand, some limitations of our method may be stated as follows:
                        
                           (a)
                           The performance of the system may fall with increase in the number of subjects.

Our system is completely automated and does not require human intervention. So, it may affect human skills in interpretation in the long run.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Accurate and early identification of MI using echocardiography images is the focus of cardiologists for early treatment and prevention of post-MI complications and death. Current visual identification of echocardiography features and manual interpretation of those features is time-consuming, labour intensive and prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer-aided approach may help in automatic and accurate identification of MI.

In this paper, the performance of the CAD approach based on image processing methods to detect MI using echocardiography images are compared. The performance of CAD system in classification of features achieved an accuracy of more than 92% by using DWT and HOS. However, 16 features extracted from DWT coefficients have performed better and yielded 99.50% accuracy. The proposed CAD system can be used as an adjunct tool to assist cardiologists in making a more accurate diagnosis on the presence of MI and further complications in hospitals and polyclinics. The proposed method can be further extended to detect the different stages (mild, moderate and chronic) of MI.
