                  CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+ (RE=Er, Ho, Tm) phosphors were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. XRD patterns confirmed tetragonal structure under different RE3+ and M+ ions doping conditions. Particles shapes and sizes were confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses. Particles shape and size were well tuned by control of solution pH; spherical balls consisting of nano-grains at low pH of ∼2, rice grain shapes at moderate pH of ∼6, and thin flakes at higher pH of ∼12, were observed. Fine tunability of upconversion (UC) emission color was achieved by doping multiple RE3+ ions within a single CaMoO4 host. Blue, green and orange upconverted emission were observed by doping Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ in the CaMoO4, respectively. Further, the emission colors were well tuned by the combination of Tm, Er and Ho ions and their concentrations. CaMoO4:Tm3+,Ho3+,Yb3+ exhibited perfect white emission with well tunability from cool white to warm white colors. Substitution of part of Ca ions by M+ (M=Li, Na, K, Rb) ions affected the crystal field symmetry around RE3+ ions and hence changed the transition probabilities between their f–f transition levels, consequently intensified the UC intensities. The blue (Tm3+), green (Er3+), and orange (Ho3+) upconversion intensities of CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,0.10K+ phosphors increased by 60, 50 and 40 folds compared to the unsubstituted analogues, respectively. The K substituted CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphors exhibited intense UC emissions visible by naked eye even pumped by less than 1mW laser power and can have potential application in displays and variety of other applications.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Photon upconversion involves the absorption of several photons of low energy with subsequent emission of higher energy photons. Various processes can lead to upconversion, including two/three-photon absorptions, ground state followed by excited state absorption, energy transfer upconversion, second harmonic generation, and photon avalanche [1–3]. Since its discovery in the 1960s, upconversion (UC) has been the focus of research [3–11]. These upconversion materials has several potential applications in solar cells [4], novel display technologies [5], inks for secure printing [6,7], optical communication and amplifier [8], high density optical storage [9], infrared detection and sensors [10], and more recently bio medical diagnosis and therapies [11,12]. Urged by the potential applications, these UC materials with strong luminescence in the NIR to visible or NUV region has been extensively investigated in recent years.

One of the promising applications of the upconverting nanomaterials is its use in the solar cell industries to improve the efficiency of the present solar cells. Due to the mismatch between the wavelengths of the solar radiation and those traditional silicon solar cells, the efficiency of silicon solar cell is limited. Photons below the band gap of the silicon semiconductor are not absorbed. Significant increase in efficiency can therefore be expected by utilizing upconverting nanomaterials that would shift the unused part of the solar radiations (longer than 1100nm) to the optimal spectral range of the silicon solar cell (400–1000nm). Lahoz et al. achieved 0.3% external quantum efficiency increment by applying the upconverting fluoride glasses on the rare face of the c-Si cell [13]. Trupke et al. demonstrated the external efficiencies of nearly 1% by applying NaYF4 UC phosphor in the similar fashion [14]. Lin et al. applied Y6W2O15 UC phosphor in the GaAs solar cell and increased the efficiency remarkably [15]. Wu et al. applied YF3 UC phosphor for the efficiency increase of Dye sensitized solar cell and demonstrated efficiency increment [16]. All above literatures suggests that use of UC phosphor is a promising way to increase the efficiency of various type of solar cells. However, all of the above mention applications are dependent on the UC luminescence efficiency and homogenous particles of the UC phosphor for device fabrication. Thus, development of highly efficient, environmentally resistant and homogenous nanoparticles UC phosphor with low excitation density threshold is utmost, especially, for solar cell applications. Oxide materials are usually chemically, mechanically and thermally stable and could therefore be promising host for the light upconversion application if their UC efficiency is increased remarkably.

Another promising application of the UC phosphor is the novel environmentally friendly display applications. Much of the lighting which is employed at present market utilizes the excitation of a mixture of several phosphors in an atmosphere containing mercury. The trend to other environmentally friendly types of lighting necessitates a search for alternative mechanisms and new phosphors. Upconverting materials indeed can be used to fabricate such novel display items. With the advent of cheap laser diodes, the upconversion of infrared radiation by suitable Ln3+ combinations is of current interest. Recently, multicolor UC by different host and or different Ln3+ ions has been exploited in sol–gel derived thin films, and solid state samples [17,18]. However, for novel display applications, high brightness with continuous emission are desired. In addition, they should be resistant to photo-bleaching and harsh environment like higher temperature and corrosion. However, the present upconverting nanomaterials suffer mainly two demerits, (1) they exhibit extremely low efficiency and need high power lasers to visualize by human eye that is not permitted from the safety point of view [19,20] and (2) lack of full color (blue–green–red) efficient upconversion within single host to realize better devices. To overcome from the first demerit, i.e. to increase the efficiency, several attempts have been made such as co doping with sensitizer ions [2,21,22], crystal surface coating [23,24], core/shell synthesis [25,26], metal plasma resonance [27], co-doping with different metal ions [28–30], and different preparation methods [2]. However, none of these methods have achieved the desired level of UC efficiency (should be pumped by as low as 1mW laser power). Hence, the luminescence intensity enhancement of UCNPs is still a challenging topic.

Mainly, the UC intensity is governed by following three factors: (1) high electronic transition probabilities of the dopants [30–32], (2) the energy transfer rate from sensitizer (Yb3+) to emission center (Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+, etc.) which intern depends on the extent of overlap of the transition dipoles of these two ions. Thus, the distances between Yb3+ and Tm3+ (Er3+, Ho3+, etc.) ions affect the energy transfer and migration and the UC intensity [20,21], and (3) the local environment of RE3+ ions in the host lattice. The crystal field, which is responsible for breaking the selection rule for the forbidden 4f–4f transitions of RE3+ ions, originates from the atoms surrounding the RE3+ ions [33]. According to the Judd–Ofelt theory, the luminescence emission peak position and its efficiency can be well controlled by tuning the crystal filed asymmetry around the central metal ion [31,32]. For instance, Teng et al. synthesized Na
                        x
                     ScF3+
                     
                        x
                     :Yb,Er nanocrystals and studied the effect of polarity of the reaction medium on the phase and composition of the nanocrystals and used Sc3+ doped crystals for multicolor tuning [33]. Huang et al. reported that small amount of Sc3+ ions doping results the higher UC intensity [34]. The Sc3+ ions occupies the Y3+ position in NaYF4 lattice. Since the Sc3+ ion is smaller than Y3+ ion, small amount of Sc3+ doping will destroy the local symmetry around the emission center resulting in the higher UC intensity. Luitel et al. controlled the emission colors in the Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+ by host cation substitution and observed a white luminescence by controlled crystal field of RE ions [35]. Dou et al. tuned the UC spectra by doping different alkali metal ions into the NaYF4:Yb,Er phosphor [29]. They reported no UC emission intensity enhancement, but the blue/green, blue/red, and green/red emission intensity ratios were affected by the concentration of Li+ and K+. Singh et al. explored the PL emission enhancement of the phosphor by Li+ doping [30]. Compared to the huge number of studies on the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals, very small effort has been paid on the work of oxide based UC phosphors [20,22,36,37].

Herein, we report color tunable highly efficient UC in a CaMoO4 single host by co-doping multiple rare metal ions (Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+) and varying their concentrations. Significant improvement of upconversion intensity was achieved by tuning the crystal asymmetry by substituting part of the host metal ion by various alkali metal ions.

Calcium molybdate phosphors doped with RE3+ and Yb3+ ions; CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+; were prepared by hydrothermal (HT) process. In a typical hydrothermal reaction, 10mM mixture of Ca/Yb/RE (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O/Yb(NO3)3·5H2O/RE(NO3)3·5H2O) were prepared in a beaker with distilled water by constant stirring with magnetic stirrer. In the case of alkali metal ions substituted sample, CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,M+ (M=Li, Na, K, Rb), part of Ca2+ ions were substituted by double amount (in moles) of specific M+ ions. In a separate beaker, 10mM (NH4)2MoO4·2H2O was prepared in distilled water. Citric acid was used as template/surfactant and urea as precipitating agent such that controlled precipitation could be achieved. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted by aqueous ammonia/nitric acid solution. 30ml of the mixture was poured into a 50ml Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 200°C for 12h. The white solid obtained was centrifuged, washed multiple times with distilled water followed by ethanol and freeze dried for 12h. Samples were further calcined at 700°C for 1h to get the final crystalline CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+ phosphors.

Phase identification was carried out using a Shimadzu XRD-6300 instrument with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the phosphor particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi-S3000N). Elemental analysis was carried out using EDX coupled with SEM. Before SEM measurements, each sample was coated roughly 5nm in thickness with platinum-palladium using Hitachi E-1030 ion sputter. Mass percentage of the constituent ions were estimated using Rayny EDX-800HS energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. UC emission spectra, pumped by a 980nm cw laser with variable power output (<1–200)mW were recorded using USB 4000 UV–VIS–NIR miniature fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean optics). CIE color chromaticity values were obtained using BW TEK spectrometer using BaSO4 as white standard. All measurements were carried out at room temperature unless specified.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Fig. 1
                      presents the phase analysis of CaMoO4 doped with 1mol% Er3+, 6mol% Yb3+ and 5mol%K+. The XRD patterns of all the samples prepared under different pH conditions and post heat treated at 600°C agree very well with standard pattern of JCPDS (29-0351) and no distinguished secondary phases were identified. We have recorded XRD patterns under identical conditions by changing RE3+ ions instead of Er3+ to Tm3+ and Ho3+ and presented in Fig. S1, but no change on the XRD peak positions and intensities were observed. Obviously, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ are isovalent rare earth ions with similar physical properties and small amount of substitution does not alter the host phase [2,22,39]. The CaMoO4 consists of scheelite type tetragonal structure with I41/a space group and Td symmetry [38,39]. The lattice constants of the typical sample calculated from the XRD data are; a
                     =5.54Å and c
                     =11.805Å, very similar to the reported data [JCPDS: 29-0351]. The XRD patterns of different alkali ions (Li, Na, K, and Rb) substituted CaMoO4:1at% RE are presented in supporting Fig. S2. No impurity phases related to alkali metal ions were detected except Rb substitution. It suggests that those alkali metal ions get incorporated into the CaMoO4 matrix without phase separation. The Rb+ ions (ionic radius ∼0.172nm) are too big compared to Ca2+ ions (ionic radius ∼0.112nm) and it was difficult to preserve the same CaMoO4 phase during its substitution and generated Rb-phase in extremely low concentration. It is important to notice that addition of small amount of M+ ions helped to generate and stabilize phase pure CaMoO4 otherwise there was generation of CaRE2O4 phase (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S3). When RE3+ ions replace Ca2+ ions, charge imbalance occurs and produces stress in the crystal lattice that decreases the solubility of the RE3+ ions in to the CaMoO4 host and RE ions get separated as CaRE2O4 phase. However, addition of small amount of M+ ions reduces the excess +ve charge and increases the RE3+ ions replacement into the CaRE2O4 phase. Upto 10mol%M+ ions substitution, no secondary phases were observed for three alkali metal ions, except Rb+. Further, the XRD patterns of the various moles of K substituted CaMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.06Yb3+,xK+ phosphors were recorded and presented in supplementary Fig. S3. No any secondary phases was observed upto 10mol%K substitution in to the Ca site. However, with the increase of the K+ concentrations ⩾15mol%, secondary phases KYb(MO4)2 (JCPDS: 52-1688) and/or K2Mo2O7 (JCPDS: 36-0347) appeared (Fig. S3) indicating that the solid solubility limit of K+ in the CaMoO4 phase is ∼10mol%. The solid solubility (intermixing of ions within the same lattice without generating new phase) limit for various alkali metal ions obtained were 30mol%, 20mol%, 10mol% and less than 10mol% for Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+, respectively. Fig.1(b) summarises the lattice parameters of CaMoO4 with various moles of K+ substitution. It is clear that the cell volume gradually increased by K+ substitution up to 10mol%, and above it decreased again. It confirmed that the substitution of Ca2+ ion (∼0.112nm) by bigger K+ ion (∼0.150nm) increased the cell volume. The decrease of cell parameters above 10mol% might be due to secondary phase formation which might have different cell parameter.

The growth mechanism of the various particles shapes was controlled by the growth mechanism of transition metal ions, here Mo ions, in the solutions during hydrothermal treatment and can be explained as in the supporting information S4 
                     [12,36]. First Ca2+ ions gets complexed with the citrate molecules and interaction with the molybdenum ions followed by precipitation form calcium molybdates. These calcium molybdates or its hydrates forms crystal nucleus or nanograins. Unidirectional growth of the calcium molybdates nanograins forms different shapes during the hydrothermal treatment process. Further, the rate of precipitation reaction was highly dependent on the pH of the reaction solution. At lower pH, the precipitation rate is extremely high resulting huge number of crystal nucleus instantly and get agglomerated easily. Numerous nanograins agglomerate rapidly resulting ball like structure which forms smooth surface and compact size during the hydrothermal treatment process. The size of the individual balls were observed to range between few microns to tens of micron as shown in Fig.2
                     (d) whereas the nanograins within few nm range. If the pH was increased to about 4–6, a mild condition, the rate of precipatation decreased and the individual nanograins could grow unidirectionally forming elongated two dimensional structures. During the hydrothermal treatment these elongated structures got rolled over and formed compact rice grains shape. The size of the rice grains ranges from 60nm to few hundreds of nm, as shown in Fig.2(c). The rice grains size is expected to increase with the HT treatment time as shown in the TEM images of the supporting Fig. S5. Further increase of pH to strong basic conditions one dimensional growth was favored and bigger and flat structures of few microns ranges were formed. These bigger and flat structures formed smooth and compact plates during the hydrothermal treatment process. EDX spectrum of selected sample was recorded and presented in the supplementary Fig. S6. The clear peaks of Ca, Mo, O, Yb (Tm) and K confirmed that the nanoparticles formed corresponding to CaMoO4:Tm,Yb,K.

The UC emission phenomena of the Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ codoped with Yb3+ were studied pumped by 980nm laser at room temperature and result are presented in Fig. 3
                     . CaMoO4:0.001Tm3+,0.1Yb3+ phosphor exhibited strong blue (∼477nm) and NIR (∼797nm) emissions. The NIR emission at 797nm and blue emission at 477nm are assigned to the 3H4
                     →
                     3H6 and 1G4
                     →
                     3H6 electronic transition of Tm3+ ion in the CaMoO4 host [12]. We have carefully monitored the Tm3+ ions concentration (Fig.3(b)) and found that the optimum concentration for the strong blue emissions was ∼0.2mol%. At higher Tm3+ ions concentration, the quenching of the upper excited states by the cross relaxation through Tm3+–Tm3+ interaction occured and reduced the blue emission band while increased the NIR emission band (undesired for present study). If Tm3+ concentration was further increased then concentration quenching of the all excited states occurs and UC emission was rapidly vanished. CaMoO4:0.02Er3+,0.1Yb3+ phosphor exhibited strong green emission centered around ∼520–560nm corresponding to the 4f–4f (2H11/2, 4S3/2
                     →
                     4I15/2) and weak orange emission band centered around ∼650nm corresponding to the (4I9/2
                     →
                     4I15/2) electronic transition of Er3+ ion [21]. The optimum Er3+ ions concentration for the better green UC intensity was about 1at% Er as shown in Fig.3(b). In a similar way the CaMoO4:0.02Ho3+,0.1Yb3+ phosphor exhibited strong orange emission centered around ∼640–680nm corresponding to the 4f–4f (5F5
                     →
                     4I8) and weak green emission band centered around ∼520–560nm corresponding to the (5S2,5F4
                     →
                     4I8) electronic transition of Ho3+ ion [40]. Ho3+ ion emissions are also splitted into hyperfine structures indicating that RE3+ ion experienced striange crystal field due to the distortion of the crystal lattice from the regular tetrahedron. The optimum Ho3+ ions concentration for the better green UC intensity was about 0.2at% Ho as shown in Fig.3(b).


                     Fig. 4
                      represents the effect of Yb3+ ions concentration at fixed RE3+ ions concentration (0.1mol% for Tm, 0.2mol% for Ho and 1.0mol% for Er). As shown in Fig. 4, at fixed RE3+ ions concentrations, the intensities of the blue, green and orange emissions corresponding to Tm, Er and Ho ions gradually increased with increasing Yb3+ ions concentration upto 10mol%, 6mol% and 6mol%, respectively. Above these Yb concentrations, the UC intensity again decreased due to quenching process [37]. This concentration quenching effect could be explained by the energy transfer between the nearest dopants (either activator to activators or activators to sensitizers or sensitizer to sensitizer). As the dopants concentration increased, the distance between dopants ions shrinks allowing non-radiative energy migration such as exchange, dipole or multi-pole interactions. Further, at higher rare earth ions concentrations, the solid solubility limits reached the maximum and a secondary phase appeared and hampered the UC emission [2,21].

It is speculated that the addition of trivalent RE3+ (Tm/Er/Ho/Yb) ions in to the divalent Ca2+ sites in CaMoO4 produces stress (due to charge imbalance). Thus, charge neutrality demands removal of three Ca2+ sites to introduce two RE3+ or Yb3+ ions, which eventually restricts the RE3+/Yb3+ ions solubility. Due to restricted solubility of rare earth ions in the CaMoO4 host, several efforts has been made recently to increase the emission efficiency of the rare earth ions doped phosphors [12,38,39]. Use of monovalent charge compensator ions (such as Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+) showed promising effect on the enhancement of emission intensity of the alkali or alkaline earth based materials [12,29,40]. Das et al. explained that the K+ ions addition on the CaSO4:Dy3+ enhance the PL intensity significantly [41]. Chung et al. significantly increased the UC intensity of CaMoO4 blue phosphor by excess Li+ ions addition [38]. Charge compensation method is also used to increase the crystallinity of the phosphor by eliminating the Ca2+ vacancies and impurity phases formed which in unintentionally formed during the doping process of RE3+ ions. Importantly, substitution of part of divalent Ca2+ ions (0.112nm) by monovalent K+ ion (0.152nm) is expected to distort the crystal field of RE3+ (Tm/Er/Ho) ions in the CaMoO4 significantly due to size and charge difference. If the symmetry of the crystal is lowered, the f–f transitions of RE3+ ions is expected to enhance significantly [41]. Herein, we have systematically investigated the effect of various alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+) on the phase stability of Tm3+/Yb3+ doped CaMoO4 and its UC luminescence.


                     Fig.5
                     (a) shows the effect of 5mol%M+ ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+) substitution on the blue (CaMoO4:0.1mol% Tm, 10mol% Yb), green (CaMoO4:1mol% Er, 6mol% Yb) and orange (CaMoO4:0.1mol% Ho, 6mol% Yb) phosphors. Obviously, addition of alkali metal ions significantly intensified the UC emission intensities of all the three emission bands and the trend of increment is same for all the three emission bands as; K+
                     >Na+
                     >Li+
                     >No alkali ion. However, the order of increment varied slightly. Addition of K significantly intensified the UC emission peak intensity by almost 60, 50 and 40 folds for the blue, green and orange peaks, respectively. Since, K+ addition exhibited significant UC intensity enhancement, effect of K+ ions concentration was studied within small increment and the result is presented in the inset in Fig.5(b). It is clear that K+ ions addition gradually increased the UC emission intensity up to 12mol% for Tm and Ho and 10mol% for Er emission peaks and above those critical values again decreased indicating the limit of K substitution. As seen from the XRD in Figs. S2 and S3, the doping (Tm3+/Yb3+/K+ ions) showed no significant change in the crystal structure (no new phase was generated), suggesting these doped ions occupied the cationic sites in the host lattice structures. However, at higher K+ concentrations, new K2Mo2O7 (JCPDS: 36-0347) and KYb(MO4)2 (JCPDS: 52-1688) phases appeared which are non emissive and reduced the UC intensity. Two factors plays important roles for the improvements of UC intensities by K+ substitution. First, the K+ doping facilitates the solubilization of rare earth ions in to the CaMoO4 matrix by allowing the Tm3+/Yb3+ ions to occupy the Ca2+ sites through charge balance mechanism [43,44]. Second, the larger K+ ions (r
                     K
                     +
                     =0.152nm and r
                     Ca
                     2+
                     =0.114nm) in the CaMoO4 matrix distort the crystal field around the RE3+ ions, that cause severe crystal field break and distortion around RE3+ ions. This increases the 4f–4f transition probabilities of RE3+ ions and significantly increases the UC emission intensities [34,42]. The crystal field distortion is expected to be higher for K+ ions compared to Li+ and Na+, and hence UC intensities increment is higher for the K+ substitution even though all the metal ions showed significant increment. The Rb+ ions is extremely large, very difficult to occupy the Ca2+ ions so easily generates secondary Rb-phase and hence the effect was not pronounced. Further, the UC emission intensity was also dependent according to the morphology of the phosphor. As shown in supporting Fig. S7 for the typical CaMoO4:Tm,Yb,K, the ball like phosphor samples exhibited higher UC intensities which is in the order of balls like particles>flakes like particles>rice grain like particles. Obviously, as the packing density decreases, the volume content of the phosphor decreases leading to the decrease of the UC emission intensity of the phosphor. The SEM micrograph in Fig. 2 shows that the packing densities is in the order balls>flakes>rice grains.


                     Fig. 6
                      shows the color tunable UC of CaMoO4:x mol% Tm3+, y mol% Ho3+, 10mol% Yb3+, 10mol%K+ phosphor. Controlled addition of Tm and Ho ions together into the CaMoO4 single host generated perfect white UC emission color. Further, the UC emission color can be well tuned from cool white to warm white by controlling the concentration of the Tm and Ho ions concentrations as shown in digital photographs in Fig. 6 inset and Fig. 7
                     . When 0.1mol% Tm and 0.1mol% Ho is used, a cool white UC color was detected due to dominating blue UC whereas at slightly higher Tm concentration (∼0.2mol% and above) or higher Ho concentration a warm white UC was detected due to dominating orange UC emissions at later conditions. It is speculated that at higher RE ions concentrations, due to the pairing of the RE–RE ions, high energy excited states photons from the 1G4 (Tm) states easily cross relaxed to the low lying 5F4 (Ho) states, consequently, orange and green emissions will pronounce. The detail mechanism will be discuss in next section.


                     Fig. 8
                      shows the excitation power dependence of blue, green and orange UC emissions in the CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphors recorded at room temperature. It is well known that for unsaturated UC processes, the number of photons required to populate the upper lying states can be obtained by the following general equation:
                        
                           
                              
                                 I
                                 ∝
                                 
                                    
                                       P
                                    
                                    
                                       n
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     where n is a number of pumping photons required to excite the emitting state, I is the UC intensity and P is the laser pumping power. The calculated result (Fig. 8) indicates that the slope is ∼1.708 for orange UC, 1.88 for green UC and 2.54 for blue UC emissions. This result indicates that the green (2H11/2/4S3/2
                     →
                     4I15/2) and orange (5F5/5F4/5S2
                     →
                     5I8) upconversion processes involves two photons whereas the blue UC (1G4
                     →
                     3H6) involves three photons [12,22].

According to above results the upconversion mechanism of CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphor can be generalized as in Fig. 9
                     . Under 980nm lasers pumping, the 2F5/2 of Yb3+ gets populated (2F7/2
                     →
                     2F5/2) [46]. Then non-resonant energy transfer from the 2F5/2 (of Yb3+) level to the 3H5 level of Tm3+ and/or 4I11/2 level of Er3+ and/or 5I6 level of Ho3+ occurs. Alternatively, ground state absorption (GSA) processes (Tm: 3H6
                     →
                     3H5; Er: 4I15/2 →4I11/2 & Ho: 5I8 →5I6) can also populates upper levels. Subsequent non-radiative multiphonon relaxation (designed by red dotted lines) can be induced and populates the low lying states. Through the excited state absorption (ESA) or energy transfer upconversion (ETU) followed by multiphonon relaxations the 3F4, 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 5F5/5F4/5S2 states get populated in the Tm, Er and Ho ions, respectively [12,21,34]. The radiative transitions (Tm: 3H4
                     →
                     3H6; Er: 2H11/2/4S3/2
                     →
                     4I15/2 & Ho: 5F5/5F4/5S2
                     →
                     5I8) give rise to NIR, green and orange emissions, respectively. In the Tm ions, the 3F3 state generates metastable 3H4 state via non-radiative transition. The 3H4 state can be further excited to the 1G4 state through the ESA or ETU processes and the 1G4
                     →
                     3H6 radiative transition gives rise to blue emission around 477nm [38,45].

Furthermore, the energy difference of 1G4 (Tm)→
                     5F4/5F5 (Ho) is smaller and if the concentration of Tm-Ho ions are higher enough, non-resonant energy transfer from higher lying 1G4 (Tm) state to lower lying 5F4/5F5 (Ho) state is highly favorable which intensifies the Ho orange emission as discussed in earlier section.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A facile hydrothermal procedure has been used to synthesize shape and size controlled CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+ upconversion phosphor. SEM images manifested spherical balls at low pH, rice grain shapes at medium pH and 2-D flakes at higher pH. Blue, green and orange UC emission colors were achieved by doping Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ ions into the CaMoO4 host, respectively. Color tunability of the UC emission was achieved by selecting proper Tm3+/Er3+/Ho3+ ions and its concentration. A perfect warm to cool white upconversion color can be obtained in the CaMoO4:Tm3+,Ho3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphor by Tm/Ho proportions. Further, the upconversion intensity was significantly improved by alkali ions doping and the order of increment is as; K+
                     >Na+
                     >Li+
                     >No alkali ion. The UC emission mechanism was elucidated and found that two photon processes involved the orange and green emissions while 3 photon processes governed the blue emission. The K+ ions substitutions in the CaMoO4 host distort the crystal field around RE3+ ions that significantly enhanced the UC emission intensity by more than 60 folds. The brightest warm white UC was obtained in the CaMoO4:0.1mol% Tm3+, 0.2mol% Ho3+, 10mol% Yb3+, 10mol%K+ phosphor pumped by as low as 1mW (980nm) laser and can have potential applications in displays, solar cell and catalysis.
