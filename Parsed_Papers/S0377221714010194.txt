                  We analyze split cuts from the perspective of cut generating functions via geometric lifting. We show that α-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuéjols et al., give all the split cuts for the mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split cuts for the 1-row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split cuts for finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split cuts for the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closure has arbitrarily bad integrality gap. This complements the mixed-integer example provided by Basu et al. (2011).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The existing literature on cutting planes for general integer programs can be roughly partitioned into two classes. One class of cutting planes relies on the paradigm of cut-generating functions (CGFs) (Conforti, Cornuéjols, Daniilidis, Lemaréchal, and Jérôme, 2013), whose roots can be traced back to Gomory and Johnson’s work in the 1970s. Prominent examples in this class are Gomory mixed-integer cuts (GMI), mixed-integer rounding cuts (MIR), reduce-and-split cuts and k-cuts (Andersen, Cornuéjols, and Li, 2005a; Cornuéjols, Li, and Vandenbussche, 2003; Gomory, 1963; Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990). The other class of cutting planes is based on the idea taking convex hulls of disjunctions; this perspective goes back to Balas’ work on disjunctive programming (Balas, 1979). Examples in this class are split cuts, lift-and-project cuts and, more recently, t-branch disjunctions (Balas, Ceria, and Cornuéjols, 1993; Dash and Günlük, 2013; Sherali and Adams, 1990).

One important advantage of the cut-generating function paradigm is that often they give closed form formulas to generate cuts that can be computed very efficiently. In contrast, the disjunctive programming paradigm usually involves solving a cut generating linear program 
                     (Balas et al., 1993), which can be computationally expensive. This leads to a significant blowup in time required to generate cuts using the disjunctive paradigm, as opposed to the cut generating function framework. Hence, there is great value in results which show that a certain family of disjunctive cuts can also be obtained by cut generating functions that are computable efficiently. Moreover, establishing connections between the cut-generating and the disjunctive paradigms contributes to the overarching goal of obtaining a more complete understanding of cutting planes.

In this paper, we analyze the family of split cuts 
                     (Cook, Kannan, and Schrijver, 1990) from this viewpoint. Split cuts are one of the most important cuts in practice and their effective use was responsible for a major improvement in MIP solvers since the 1990s (Achterberg and Wunderling, 2013; Bixby, Fenelon, Gu, Rothberg, and Wunderling, 2004). Due to their importance, these cuts have been extensively studied, both theoretically (Andersen, Cornuéjols, and Li, 2005b; Basu, Cornuéjols, and Margot, 2012; Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990) and computationally (Balas, Ceria, Cornuéjols, and Natraj, 1996; Balas and Saxena, 2008; Bonami, 2012; Dash and Goycoolea, 2010; Fischetti and Salvagnin, 2011; 2013).

An important tool for the cut generating function approach has been the study of finite and infinite dimensional corner relaxations. Corner relaxations retain enough of the complexity of mixed-integer programs to be extremely useful models for obtaining general cutting planes, and yet have a structure that yields to mathematical analysis and a beautiful theory has been built about them (Conforti, Cornuéjols, and Zambelli, 2011a).

In Section 1.1, we formally define the main objects of study of this paper, and then follow up with a statement of our results in Section 1.2.

We define a family of cut-generating functions for the n-row corner relaxation, that we call α-cuts, which is a natural higher-dimensional generalization of k-cuts (Cornuéjols et al., 2003). Informally, an α-cut for an n-row corner relaxation is obtained by taking an integer vector

Notice that these definitions hold for the case where R and/or Q are infinite, thus generalizing the standard definition of split cuts to this setting.

We show that the α-cuts give all the split cuts for a generalized mixed-integer corner relaxation, which includes both the finite and infinite dimensional relaxations.

                           Theorem 1
                           Consider an n-row generalized corner relaxation 
                                 C
                              . Then the α-cuts are exactly the split cuts for 
                                 C
                              . More precisely, every α-cut is a split cut for 
                                 C
                               and every split cut for 
                                 C
                               is dominated by an α-cut.

In particular, this result directly gives the equivalence between k-cuts and split cuts for the 1-row (finite or infinite dimensional) corner relaxations.

The proof of Theorem 1 is based on geometric lifting, a technique introduced in Conforti, Cornuéjols, and Zambelli (2011b). The cut-generating functions that we obtain can also be derived using the formulas from Section 2.4 of Andersen et al. (2005a). However, in our opinion, our geometric viewpoint illuminates aspects of these cut generating functions that are not immediately apparent if one uses the algebraic approach of Andersen et al. (2005a). We illustrate this advantage using two applications: Theorems 2 and 3 below.

It is known that every cut for the finite-dimensional corner relaxation is a restriction of a cut for the infinite relaxation. We show that, not only does the infinite relaxation encode all finite-dimensional corner relaxations and valid cuts for them, but it also preserves the structure of split cuts.

This result relies on the fact that the characterization of Theorem 1 holds for the infinite relaxation.

In addition, we use insights obtained from this characterization to better understand the strength of split cuts. Cook et al. (1990) constructed an example of a mixed-integer program with infinite split rank. Reinforcing the potential weakness of the split closure, Basu, Bonami, Cornuéjols, and Margot (2011) constructed mixed-integer programs whose split closures provide an arbitrarily weak approximation to their integer hull. On the other hand, it is known that every pure-integer program (where all variables are integer valued) has finite split rank (Chvátal, 1973). Nonetheless, in our final contribution we construct an explicit family of pure-integer programs whose split closure is arbitrarily bad compared to the integer hull.

Mixed-integer rounding (equivalently, the Gomory mixed-integer) functions can be seen as a family of cut generating functions that completely describe all split cuts for finite-dimensional mixed-integer corner polyhedra (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990). MIR functions are parametrized by tuples of rational numbers; in contrast, our α-cuts are parameterized by tuples of integers. This property ascribes an additional simplicity on the cut-generating functions that we obtain.

Now we define the crucial concept of lattice-free cuts. First, given a convex body

The idea behind the lifting of cuts is to first obtain a (weaker) cut by ignoring some of the integrality of the variables and then strengthen it by incorporating back some of the discarded information. In our context, we can formally define lifting as follows: given a cut (ψ, π) valid for

                      is a lifting of (ψ, π) if ψ′ = ψ and π′ ≤ π. For example, the GMI function introduced in Section 1.1.1 can be seen as a lifting of a lattice-free cut, a fact that will be very important for our developments.

The main result in this section is the next lemma, which shows that every split cut for

                         can be obtained via geometric lifting from a cut derived from a lattice-free split set. We say that (ψ, π) dominates (ψ′, π′) with respect to a set X if X∩(ψ, π)⊆X∩(ψ′, π′).

To conclude the proof, it suffices to show that [αε/2] ∈ (1/3, 2/3) implies [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3). For that notice that when [αε/2] ∈ (1/3, 1/2], this implies [αε] ∈ (2/3, 1] and hence [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3). On the other hand, when [αε/2] ∈ [1/2, 2/3) we have [αε] ∈ [0, 1/3), again reaching the conclusion [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3).□

                              The optimal value of minimizing y

                           2 over the whole of

                                 2) ≥ 1/2 is satisfied by all feasible solutions. Such solutions then satisfy the weaker inequality y
                                 1 + y
                                 2 ≥ 1/2ε; this concludes the proof of the lemma.□


                           Theorem 3 then follows directly from Lemmas 10 and 11.
