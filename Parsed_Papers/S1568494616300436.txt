                  In this study, we introduce a concept of a granular input space in system modeling, in particular in fuzzy rule-based modeling. The underlying problem can be succinctly formulated in the following way: given is a numeric model, develop an efficient way of forming granular input variables so that the corresponding granular outputs of the model achieve the highest level of specificity. The rationale behind the formulation of the problem is offered along with several illustrative examples. In conjunction with the underlying idea, developed is an algorithmic framework supporting an optimization of the specificity of the model exposed to granular inputs (data). It is dwelled upon one of the principles of Granular Computing, namely an optimal allocation of information granularity. For illustrative purposes, the study is focused on information granules formalized in terms of intervals (however the proposed approach becomes equally relevant for other formalism of information granules). Some comparative analysis with the existing idea of global sensitivity analysis is also carried out by contrasting the essential differences among the two approaches and analyzing the results of computational experiments.
