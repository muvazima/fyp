                  A translation (framing) code based on the circular code was proposed in Michel (2012) with the identification of X circular code motifs (X motifs shortly) in the bacterial rRNA of Thermus thermophilus, in particular in the ribosome decoding center. Three classes of X motifs are now identified in the rRNAs of bacteria Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus, archaea Pyrococcus furiosus, nuclear eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Triticum aestivum and Homo sapiens, and chloroplast Spinacia oleracea. The universally conserved nucleotides A1492 and A1493 in all studied rRNAs (bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts) belong to X motifs (called m
                     AA). The conserved nucleotide G530 in rRNAs of bacteria and archaea belongs to X motifs (called m
                     G). Furthermore, the X motif m
                     G is also found in rRNAs of nuclear eukaryotes and chloroplasts. Finally, a potentially important X motif, called m, is identified in all studied rRNAs. With the available crystallographic structures of the Protein Data Bank PDB, we also show that these X motifs m
                     AA, m
                     G, and m belong to the ribosome decoding center of all studied rRNAs with possible interaction with the mRNA X motifs and the tRNA X motifs. The three classes of X motifs identified here in rRNAs of several and different organisms strengthen the concept of translation code based on the circular code.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The ribosome is a complex ribonucleoprotein particle responsible for the synthesis of the cell protein by translating messenger RNA (mRNA). Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, a large subunit and a small subunit. Each subunit is formed by ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and proteins. A ribosome contains three transfer RNA (tRNA) binding sites: A-site (aminoacyl), P-site (peptidyl), and E-site (exit). During the translation process, the aminoacyl tRNA binds to the A-site where the decoding center containing the universally conserved dinucleotide AA (A1492 and A1493) is tasked with distinguishing cognate from non-cognate tRNAs by anticodon–codon interactions (Wilson, 2014). The transfer of the amino acid from the P-site to the A-site results in the peptide-bond forming between the carboxyl group at the P-site and the newly arrived amino acid at the A-site. As the ribosome progresses by three nucleotides, the peptidyl tRNA moves from the A-site to the P-site. Finally, the unloaded tRNA moves from the P-site to the E-site.

The introduction of 3D crystallographic structure contributed significantly to the better understanding of the functionality of ribosomes. 3D structures and experimental biological results proved that the decoding center is located in the RNA region of the ribosome.

In 1996, a statistical analysis of occurrence frequencies of the 64 trinucleotides {AAA, …, TTT} in the three frames zero, one and two of genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes showed that the trinucleotides are not uniformly distributed in these three frames (Arquès and Michel, 1996). By convention here, the frame zero is the reading frame in a gene, and the frames one and two are the reading frame zero shifted by one and two nucleotides in the 5′-3′ direction, respectively. By excluding the four periodic permuted trinucleotides {AAA, CCC, GGG, TTT} and by assigning each trinucleotide to a preferential frame (frame of its highest occurrence frequency), three subsets X

                     1, and X
                     2 of 20 trinucleotides are found in the frames zero, one, and two, respectively, simultaneously of two large gene populations (protein coding regions): eukaryotes (26,757 sequences, 11,397,678 trinucleotides) and prokaryotes (13,686 sequences, 4,709,758 trinucleotides) (Arquès and Michel, 1996). This set X contains the 20 following trinucleotides

The two sets X
                     1 and X
                     2, of 20 trinucleotides each, in the shifted frames one and two of genes can be deduced from X by the circular permutation map (see below). These three trinucleotide sets present several strong mathematical properties, particularly the fact that X is a C
                     3 self-complementary trinucleotide circular code (Arquès and Michel, 1996). A trinucleotide circular code has the fundamental property to always retrieve the reading frame in any position of any sequence generated with the circular code. In particular, initiation and stop trinucleotides as well as any frame signals are not necessary to define the reading frame. Indeed, a window of a few nucleotides positioned anywhere in a sequence generated with the circular code always retrieves the reading frame. For crossing the largest ambiguous words of the circular code X (words, not necessarily unique, in two or three frames), this window needs a length of 13 nucleotides with X (Fig. 3 in Michel, 2012). A window of 13 nucleotide length is the largest window of X to retrieve the reading frame for all the ambiguous words of X.

Recently, X circular code motifs (X motifs shortly), i.e., motifs generated from the circular code X, are identified in the 5′ and/or 3′ regions of 16 isoaccepting tRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Michel, 2013). X motifs are also found in 16S rRNAs, in particular in the decoding center which recognizes the codon–anticodon helix in A-tRNA (Michel, 2012). A 3D visualization of X motifs in the ribosome shows several spatial configurations involving mRNA X motifs, A-tRNA and E-tRNA X motifs, and four 16S rRNA X motifs. These results led to the concept of a possible translation (framing) code based on the circular code (Michel, 2012).

By developing a search algorithm of X motifs in a DNA multiple sequence alignment, obtained here with a global multiple sequence alignment program, three classes of X motifs identified in multiple aligned rRNAs are involved in the ribosome decoding center of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts.

A few basic properties of the trinucleotide circular code X (Eq. (1)) are presented here in order to recall to the reader that the X motifs can retrieve the reading frame (by definition), and thus, may be involved in gene translation.

The fundamental property of a circular code is the ability to retrieve the reading (original or construction) frame of any sequence generated with this circular code. A circular code is a set of words over an alphabet such that any sequence written on a circle (the next letter after the last letter of the sequence being the first letter) has a unique decomposition (factorization) into words of the circular code (Fig. 1
                               in Michel, 2012, for a graphical representation of the circular code definition and Fig. 2
                              
                               in Michel, 2012, for an example). The reading frame in a sequence (a gene) is retrieved after the reading of a certain number of letters (nucleotides), called the window of the circular code. The length of this window for retrieving the reading frame is the letter length of the longest ambiguous word, not necessarily unique, which can be read in at least two frames, plus one letter (Fig. 3 in Michel, 2012, for an example).

In order to identify a general property of X circular code motifs in the ribosome decoding center, the Algorithm_Search_Xmotif_seqCommon is applied here to MSA of rRNAs of different organisms, whose crystallographic structures are known and available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do, February 2014). The selected PDB entries have necessarily a bacterial 16S rRNA or a eukaryotic 18S rRNA, and if possible in addition an mRNA and/or tRNA to visualize the spatial interaction of all their X motifs. PDB entries containing synthetic chains were excluded. The studied PDB crystallographic structures are for bacteria: Escherichia coli (Brilot et al., 2013) and Thermus thermophilus (Jenner et al., 2010); for archaea: Pyrococcus furiosus (Armache et al., 2013); for nuclear eukaryotes: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Armache et al., 2010a); Triticum aestivum (Armache et al., 2010a,b; Gogala et al., 2014) and Homo sapiens (Anger et al., 2013), and for chloroplasts (an organelle of eukaryotes): Spinacia oleracea (Sharma et al., 2007). Table 1
                         summarizes the main features of the crystallographic structures studied.

Jmol is an open-source Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D (http://www.jmol.org/). It allows the reading of a variety of file formats and high-performance 3D rendering with no hardware requirements. Several scripts were written in Jmol for each PDB entry to visualize the X motifs in the messenger, transfer and ribosomal RNAs. They are not detailed here.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The universally conserved dinucleotide AA (in position 1492 of the 16S rRNA in E. coli) has an experimentally proven biological function in the codon–anticodon binding (Moazed and Noller, 1990; Powers and Noller, 1994; Yoshizawa et al., 1999). Very unexpectedly, this universally conserved dinucleotide AA is found to be located in X circular code motifs (Table 2
                        ).

In rRNAs of both E. coli and T. thermophilus, the conserved dinucleotide AA occurs at the 2nd and 3rd sites of the trinucleotide GAA∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). In rRNA of E. coli, it belongs to the X motif m
                           AA(E. coli, 1487, 1501, 15)=G,GGT,GAA,GTC,GTA,AC of 15 nucleotide length starting with the nucleotide G suffix of CAG,CTG,GAG∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) followed by four trinucleotides GAA,GGT,GTA,GTC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) (given in lexicographical order) and ending with the dinucleotide AC prefix of ACC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). In rRNA of T. thermophilus, it belongs to the X motif m
                           AA(T. thermophilus, 1490, 1498, 9)=G,GAA,GGT,GC of nine nucleotide length starting with the nucleotide G, as in E. coli, followed by two trinucleotides GAA,GGT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and ending with the dinucleotide GC prefix of GCC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). These two rRNA X motifs m
                           AA(E. coli) and m
                           AA(T. thermophilus) have completely different primary structures. Thus, the classical bioinformatics methods, such as sequence alignment or phylogenetic inference, were not able to identify these motifs which are only revealed by the circular code theory.

In rRNA of T. thermophilus, there is a dinucleotide AA in the X motif m
                           AA*(T. thermophilus, 1461, 1475, 15)=G,GGC,GAA,GTC,GTA,AC of 15 nucleotide length aligned with the X motif m
                           AA(E. coli) with only one nucleotide difference (T in GGT replaced by C in T. thermophilus). However, the X motif m
                           AA*(T. thermophilus) has a spatial structure far from the decoding center (Michel, 2012) and probably no function in modern rRNA of T. thermophilus.

In rRNA of P. furiosus, the conserved dinucleotide AA occurs at the 2nd and 3rd sites of the trinucleotide GAA∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and belongs to the X motif m
                           AA(P. furiosus, 1445, 1456, 12)=A,GAA,GTC,GTA,AC of 12 nucleotide length starting with the nucleotide A suffix of GAA,GTA∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and then with a suffix of 11 nucleotides identical to the X motif m
                           AA(E. coli).

There are significant differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNAs, in particular eukaryotic 18S rRNAs are about 40% larger than prokaryotic 16S rRNAs. Nevertheless, some rRNA sites are conserved. In particular, the universally conserved dinucleotide AA in position 1492 of bacterial rRNAs occurs in eukaryotic rRNAs but at different positions: 1755 in S. cerevisiae, 1765 in T. aestivum (Fan-Minogue and Bedwell, 2008) and 1824 in H. sapiens (Bulygin et al., 2009).

In rRNA of S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, the conserved dinucleotide AA is the prefix of the X motif m
                           AA(S. cerevisiae, 1755, 1764, 10)=
                           m
                           AA(H. sapiens, 1824, 1833, 10)=
                           AA,GTC,GTA,AC of 10 nucleotide length followed by two trinucleotides GTA,GTC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and ending with the dinucleotide AC prefix of ACC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). In rRNA of T. aestivum, it occurs at the 2nd and 3rd sites of the trinucleotide GAA∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and belongs to the X motif m
                           AA(T. aestivum, 1763, 1774, 12)=A,GAA,GTC,GTA,AC of 12 nucleotide length which is identical to the archaeal X motif m
                           AA(P. furiosus).

In rRNA of S. oleracea, the conserved dinucleotide AA occurs at the 2nd and 3rd sites of the trinucleotide GAA∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and belongs to the X motif m
                           AA(S. oleracea, 1438, 1450, 13)=GT,GAA,GTC,GTA,AC which is a suffix of 13 nucleotides of the bacterial X motif m
                           AA(E. coli).

In all studied rRNAs, the universally conserved dinucleotide AA precedes the trinucleotide GTC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)), except in m
                           AA(T. thermophilus) where GTC is replaced by GGT. Thus, it always occurs at the 2nd and 3rd sites of a trinucleotide which is always GAA when the trinucleotide belongs to X (Eq. (1)). For one X motif m
                           AA(S. cerevisiae)=
                           m
                           AA(H. sapiens), it does not belong to a trinucleotide of X (Eq. (1)). Figs. 1–7
                           
                           
                           
                            show that the rRNA X motifs m
                           AA(E. coli), m
                           AA(T. thermophilus), m
                           AA(P. furiosus), m
                           AA(S. cerevisiae), m
                           AA(T. aestivum), m
                           AA(H. sapiens), and m
                           AA(S. oleracea) (purple with the conserved dinucleotide AA in red) of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes and chloroplasts belong to the ribosome decoding center with spatial relations with mRNA X motifs (green) and tRNA X motifs (blue with the anticodon in black).

The bacterial conserved nucleotide G (in position 530 of the 16S rRNA in E. coli) has an experimentally proved biological function in the codon–anticodon binding (Moazed and Noller, 1990; Powers and Noller, 1994; Yoshizawa et al., 1999). Very unexpectedly, this bacterial conserved G is also found to be located in X circular code motifs (Table 2).

In rRNA of E. coli, the conserved nucleotide G occurs at the 2nd site of the trinucleotide GGT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and belongs to the X motif m
                           G(E. coli, 527, 536, 10)=GC,GGT,AAT,AC of 10 nucleotide length starting with the dinucleotide GC suffix of GGC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) followed by two trinucleotides AAT,GGT∈
                           X and ending with the dinucleotide AC prefix of ACC∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). In rRNA of T. thermophilus, the conserved nucleotide G occurs at the 1st site of GTT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and belongs to the X motif m
                           G(T. thermophilus, 528, 536, 9)=GC,GTT,ACC,C of nine nucleotide length starting with the dinucleotide GC, as in E. coli, followed by two trinucleotides ACC,GTT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and ending with the nucleotide C prefix of CAG,CTC,CTG∈
                           X (Eq. (1)). As with the conserved dinucleotide AA, the two rRNA X motifs m
                           G(E. coli) and m
                           G(T. thermophilus) have completely different primary structures and can only be revealed by the circular code theory.

In rRNA of P. furiosus, the conserved nucleotide G occurs at the 2nd site of the trinucleotide GGT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)), as in m
                           G(E. coli), and belongs to the X motif m
                           G(P. furiosus, 480, 497, 18)=GC,GGT,AAT,ACC,GGC,GGC,C of 18 nucleotide length starting with the dinucleotide GC, as in m
                           G(E. coli) and m
                           G(T. thermophilus), followed by five trinucleotides AAT,ACC,GGC,GGT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) and ending with the nucleotide C, as in m
                           G(T. thermophilus).

The bacterial X motif m
                           G(E. coli) is a prefix of 10 nucleotides of the archaeal X motif m
                           G(P. furiosus). The conserved nucleotide G occurs at the 2nd site of GGT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) in m
                           G(E. coli) and m
                           G(P. furiosus), and at the 1st site of GTT∈
                           X (Eq. (1)) in m
                           G(T. thermophilus). Figs. 1–3 show that the rRNA X motifs m
                           G(E. coli), m
                           G(T. thermophilus) and m
                           G(P. furiosus) (orange with the conserved nucleotide G in fuchsia) of bacteria and archaea belong to the ribosome decoding center with spatial relations with mRNA X motifs (green) and tRNA X motifs (blue with the anticodon in black).

The search of the conserved nucleotide G in rRNAs of eukaryotes is impossible using this information alone. By using the circular code theory, the conserved nucleotide G in rRNAs of bacteria and archaea occurs in X motifs m
                        G. The rRNA X motifs m
                        G(E. coli) and m
                        G(P. furiosus) have the common X motif m
                        G({E. coli, P. furiosus})=GC,GGT,AAT,AC, and the rRNA X motif m
                        G(T. thermophilus) is GC,GTT,ACC,C (Table 2). By using the Algorithm_Search_Xmotif_seqCommon (Section 2.2) with the global multiple sequence alignment ClustalW2 (gap open of 10 and gap extension of 0.2 and 0.1 in case of pairwise), these two X motifs m
                        G are searched in rRNAs of nuclear eukaryotes S. cerevisiae, T. aestivum, H. sapiens and chloroplasts S. oleracea. Very surprisingly, a common X motif m
                        G is identified in rRNAs of nuclear eukaryotes: m
                        G(S. cerevisiae, 574, 582, 9)=
                        m
                        G(T. aestivum, 578, 586, 9)=
                        m
                        G(H. sapiens, 623, 631, 9)=
                        m
                        G(NuclarEukaryotes)=GC,GGT,AAT,T (Table 3
                        ). Furthermore, a X motif m
                        G is also identified in rRNA of chloroplasts: m
                        G(S. oleracea, 475, 481, 7)=
                        m
                        G(Chloroplasts)=GC,GGT,AA (Table 3) which is a prefix of seven nucleotides of m
                        G(NuclarEukaryotes). As the common X motif m
                        G({NuclarEukaryotes, Chloroplasts})=GC,GGT,AA is a prefix of the common X motif m
                        G({E. coli, P. furiosus})=GC,GGT,AAT,AC, we can make the realistic hypothesis that the conserved nucleotide G in nuclear and chloroplast rRNAs occurs at the 2nd site of the trinucleotide GGT∈
                        X (Eq. (1)).

Furthermore, Figs. 4–7 show that the rRNA X motifs m
                        G(S. cerevisiae), m
                        G(T. aestivum), m
                        G(H. sapiens) and m
                        G(S. oleracea) (orange with the conserved nucleotide G in fuchsia) of nuclear eukaryotes and chloroplasts belong to the ribosome decoding center with spatial relations with mRNA X motifs (green) and tRNA X motifs (blue with the anticodon in black).

By using the Algorithm_Search_Xmotif_seqCommon (Section 2.2) with the global multiple sequence alignment ClustalW2, an X motif m is identified which is universally conserved in rRNAs of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts (Table 3): m=
                        AC,ACC,GCC,C of nine nucleotide length starting with the dinucleotide AC suffix of AAC,GAC,TAC∈
                        X (Eq. (1)) followed by two trinucleotides ACC,GCC∈
                        X and ending with the nucleotide C prefix of CAG,CTC,CTG∈
                        X (Eq. (1)). The start and end positions of the X motif m in the seven studied organisms are given in Table 3.

Very unexpectedly, Figs. 1–7 show that the universally conserved rRNA X motif m (yellow) of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts belongs to the ribosome decoding center with spatial relations with mRNA X motifs (green) and tRNA X motifs (blue with the anticodon in black).


                        Table 4
                         shows eight X circular code motifs identified by multiple sequence alignment of the seven studied 16S rRNAs E. coli, T. thermophilus, P. furiosus, S. cerevisiae, T. aestivum, H. sapiens, and S. oleracea. There are two strictly conserved X motifs:
                           
                              (i)
                              AA,GTC,GTA,AC of 10 nucleotide length which is a suffix of the X motifs m
                                 AA for E. coli, P. furiosus, S. cerevisiae, T. aestivum, H. sapiens and S. oleracea; and m
                                 AA* for T. thermophilus (studied in Section 3.1 and Table 2).

AC,ACC,GCC,C of nine nucleotide length which is the X motif m (studied in Section 3.4 and Table 3).

The six other X circular code motifs occurring at the same position in the multiple sequence alignment are less conserved. However, they may also have a biological function in modern or primitive translation codes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The results obtained here bring several new contributions to the ribosome decoding center, in particular to its primary structure which is related to the mathematical property of circular code. The universally conserved dinucleotide AA in all studied rRNAs of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts belongs to X motifs (m
                     AA; Table 2). The conserved nucleotide G in rRNAs of bacteria and archaea also belongs to X motifs (m
                     G; Table 2). The development of the Algorithm_Search_Xmotif_seqCommon (Section 2.2) associated with the global multiple sequence alignment allows to identify the X motifs m
                     G in nuclear and chloroplast rRNAs (Table 3). Furthermore, it reveals a new X motif (m) which is universally conserved in the seven studied organisms (Table 3). Finally, the three X motifs m
                     AA, m
                     G, and m belong to the ribosome decoding center in all studied rRNAs of bacteria, archaea, nuclear eukaryotes, and chloroplasts (Figs. 1–7).

Several biological considerations can be stressed from these results. The function of the ribosome decoding center which has been attributed to a very few nucleotides only, precisely the dinucleotide AA and the nucleotide G, may be related to motifs containing at least two successive trinucleotides up to a maximum of five successive trinucleotides (Tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, all these motifs are X circular code motifs; thus, motifs with the circular code property CC (Definition 5) allowing retrieval of the reading frame, the property C
                     3 (Definition 7) allowing retrieval of the two shifted frames and the complementary property SCC (Definition 6) allowing pairing with the X circular code motifs of mRNAs and tRNAs. These results strengthen the concept of translation code based on the circular code proposed in Michel (2012).
