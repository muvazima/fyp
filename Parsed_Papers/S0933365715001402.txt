                  Objective
                  This work presents a computer-based approach to analyze the two-dimensional vocal fold dynamics of endoscopic high-speed videos, and constitutes an extension and generalization of a previously proposed wavelet-based procedure. While most approaches aim for analyzing sustained phonation conditions, the proposed method allows for a clinically adequate analysis of both dynamic as well as sustained phonation paradigms.
               
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The analysis procedure is based on a spatio-temporal visualization technique, the phonovibrogram, that facilitates the documentation of the visible laryngeal dynamics. From the phonovibrogram, a low-dimensional set of features is computed using a principle component analysis strategy that quantifies the type of vibration patterns, irregularity, lateral symmetry and synchronicity, as a function of time. Two different test bench data sets are used to validate the approach: (I) 150 healthy and pathologic subjects examined during sustained phonation. (II) 20 healthy and pathologic subjects that were examined twice: during sustained phonation and a glissando from a low to a higher fundamental frequency. In order to assess the discriminative power of the extracted features, a Support Vector Machine is trained to distinguish between physiologic and pathologic vibrations. The results for sustained phonation sequences are compared to the previous approach. Finally, the classification performance of the stationary analyzing procedure is compared to the transient analysis of the glissando maneuver.
               
               
                  Results
                  For the first test bench the proposed procedure outperformed the previous approach (proposed feature set: accuracy: 91.3%, sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 97%, previous approach: accuracy: 89.3%, sensitivity: 76%, specificity: 96%). Comparing the classification performance of the second test bench further corroborates that analyzing transient paradigms provides clear additional diagnostic value (glissando maneuver: accuracy: 90%, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 80%, sustained phonation: accuracy: 75%, sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 70%).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The incorporation of parameters describing the temporal evolvement of vocal fold vibration clearly improves the automatic identification of pathologic vibration patterns. Furthermore, incorporating a dynamic phonation paradigm provides additional valuable information about the underlying laryngeal dynamics that cannot be derived from sustained conditions. The proposed generalized approach provides a better overall classification performance than the previous approach, and hence constitutes a new advantageous tool for an improved clinical diagnosis of voice disorders.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Voice quality is known to be closely interconnected with vocal fold (VF) vibration [1]. A rough and hoarse voice is often caused by asymmetric and irregular vibration essentially affecting the modulation of the air-stream coming from the lungs [2]. In this regard, endoscopy is an inherent part of clinical examination routines. Currently, videostroboscopy is still the most prevalent imaging technique in clinical practice [3], capturing VF dynamics during sustained phonation at constant pitch and loudness. During stroboscopy, light flashes are synchronized to the fundamental frequency of VF vibration with a slightly increasing phase [4]. Thus, stroboscopy simulates real-time playback by merging frames from different oscillation cycles. Consequently, stroboscopy is restricted to highly periodic VF vibration, and thus clinically to a sustained phonation examination paradigm. Rapidly changing and non-periodic signals cannot be clearly resolved by stroboscopy.

Contrarily, high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) captures full laryngeal images in real-time with sampling rates of 2000–20,000fps, allowing new insights into physiologic and pathologic mechanisms of the VFs [5,6]. Despite allowing for analyzing transient and thus dynamic phonation paradigms, HSV examination is still mostly performed during sustained phonation at constant pitch and loudness. However, the vibration observed during sustained phonation represents only a very limited subset of the entire complex voice production mechanisms. It is known, that the degree of symmetry and regularity of VF vibrations highly depends on the examined frequency interval [7]. Thus, pathologic indications may not be observable in a sustained phonation condition at only one specific pitch or intensity level.

From a clinical point of view, there is a particular demand for extracting valuable and interpretable parameters from both: (A) sustained phonation sequences focusing on the type and stability of VF vibrations at specific pitch and intensity, and (B) dynamic phonation sequences focusing on the systematic change of VF vibration types during pitch or intensity change. While most approaches focus on analysis of sustained conditions [1,8–10], just a limited number of studies deal with the analysis of transient phonation paradigms. Braunschweig et al. reported promising results for diagnosing functional voice disorders from phonation onset analysis [11,12]. They demonstrated their method in a total of 71 subjects, and found statistically significant differences between both groups. However, the approach involves eight to ten examinations at different sound pressure levels for each subject, which limits the clinical applicability. Transient laryngeal dynamics were examined by Rasp et al. [13] during a monotonous increase of the fundamental frequency. Generally, pitch is a result of changing the VFs’ eigenfrequency controlled by length, tension and mass of the vibrating VFs [14]. While the authors found decreasing VF amplitudes during the glissando, the change of the glottal closure characteristics could only be classified into six rough categories. A continuous characterization was not achieved in this context.

Quantitative analysis of dynamic phonation was performed by Wurzbacher et al. [7,15]. They extended a stationary biomechanical two-mass model to dynamic phonation paradigms and examined its benefit for identifying pathologies from a glissando using a parameter optimization strategy [16,17]. However, since the lumped element models imply a very strong discretization of the vibrational structure along the anterior-posterior dimension, the analysis of the longitudinal propagation of VF vibrations is quite limited. Furthermore, it had not been proven yet that the computed model parameters, which are obtained using an optimization procedure, are unique. A proper clinical interpretation of the parameters remains challenging.

A continuous analysis of VF dynamics along the anterior-posterior (AP) dimension was achieved by introducing phonovibrograms (PVG) [18]. The principle of PVG construction is demonstrated in Fig. 1
                     (1–3). The PVG encodes the lateral displacement of VF vibrations in a single image by color-coding the distance between the glottal axis and the VF contours for left and right side, respectively. Concatenating the color-coded stripes of the subsequent images of video results in a two-dimensional image, the PVG. Depending on the specific type of VF vibrations, geometric patterns occur within the PVG, which represent the glottal opening and closing process. In Fig. 1(3), the white dotted contour line exemplarily represents the vibration pattern of the left VF for the second oscillation cycle. The PVG contains the visible spatio-temporal pattern of VF vibration along the entire glottal axis and allows for a visual assessment and further clinical interpretation without inspecting the entire high-speed video sequence in slow motion.

The underlying data within a PVG provide further information for a quantification of the VF vibration characteristics. Recent works showed that quantitative features can be derived from PVGs that characterize VF vibrations very precisely [20–24]. However, there are two main limitations with these initial approaches: Firstly, the number of extracted features is extremely high. Voigt et al. employ about 200 numerical features for classification. High-dimensional feature vectors, however, may reduce the predictive power of the classifier – a phenomenon known as the “curse of dimensionality” [25]. Secondly, the features are not understandable within a clinical context causing problems with the clinical interpretability and acceptance.

To solve both problems, we recently proposed a wavelet-based procedure in combination with a principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the geometric structure of a PVG. It extracts the most significant properties of VF vibration patterns by quantifying the main characteristics of the PVG geometry (dotted contour line Fig. 1(3)) on the basis of three dominant PCA eigenvalues [19]. The three eigenvalues λ
                     1
                     −
                     λ
                     3 provide a compact representation of the complex VF vibration patterns along the entire glottal axis. Furthermore, the eigenvalues are clinically interpretable as they correlate with a rating scheme elaborated by the European Laryngological Society for a perceptive assessment of glottal closure characteristics [26]. As shown in Fig. 1(4), the first eigenvalue λ
                     1 encodes the open-closed ratio, whereas λ
                     2 distinguishes between a zipper-like opening from posterior to anterior (dorsal) or anterior to posterior (ventral). The third eigenvalue λ
                     3 (not shown here) distinguishes between oval (opening from medial to terminal) and hour-glass (opening from terminal to medial) vibration types. From the eigenvalue distribution, clinically relevant measures can be derived that allow distinguishing between physiologic and pathologic vibration patterns [27]. Moreover, it could even be shown that the procedure differentiates between malignant and precancerous lesions solely on the basis of laryngeal dynamics analysis [28].

The PVG eigenvalues allow one to uncover precisely even the intra-individual vibratory changes induced by different phonation conditions in a quantitative manner. Fig. 1(4) exemplarily illustrates the two-dimensional PCA subspace for λ
                     1 and λ
                     2 comprising the results of five distinct examinations of a single healthy male subject obtained at different fundamental frequencies (F
                     0: 143Hz – 333Hz). The different fundamental frequencies provoke a systematic change of the VF vibration patterns, which is clearly reflected by the different magnitudes of both eigenvalues.

The hitherto existing PVG wavelet analysis approach is limited to the characterization of VF vibrations during sustained phonation (stationary analysis), however. It thus does not take advantage of a dynamic examination paradigm that incorporates additional information about VF dynamics compared to the sustained one. The goal of the work presented here is to propose a generalized procedure allowing a clinically adequate analysis of both dynamic as well as sustained phonation sequences in order to enhance the computer assisted diagnosis of voice disorders (non-stationary analysis). The discriminatory power of the new features introduced here is validated using a supervised machine learning approach.

@&#METHODS@&#

The proposed method was developed and verified on the basis of clinical HSV recordings, including two different clinical test benches and phonatory tasks. Endoscopic imaging was performed with the HS Endocam 5562 high-speed camera system (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) during sustained and dynamic phonation. The camera provides a spatial resolution of 256×256 pixels at 4000 frames per second. The following two clinical scenarios were considered for the validation of the proposed generalized analysis procedure:

The first clinical test bench was used to investigate whether the generalized analysis procedure (GAP) proposed here is suitable for the analysis of sustained phonation sequences and superior to a formerly developed stationary wavelet-based approach. For this purpose, a dataset was analyzed comprising 150 subjects that were collected within a previous study [19]. The results can thus be set into relation to classification results obtained by a set of perturbation and symmetry parameters: amplitude periodicity index (API), time periodicity index (TPI), amplitude symmetry index (ASI), and phase symmetry index (PSI) as they were defined by Qiu et al. [29].

All subjects were examined during the sustained phonation of the vowel /ae/ at a comfortable pitch and loudness. For 100 subjects, no signs of voice disorders were found (Group H1; 63 females; age 41.27±15.84yr; males: 37, age 49.05±15.33yr), whereas 50 subjects were diagnosed with unilateral VF paresis (Group P1; females: 28, age 48.80±18.43yr; males: 22, age 56.40±12.81yr). An overview of the clinical test bench data I is given in Fig. 2
                           . Note that a part of the here shown high-speed video recordings including the phonovibrograms are provided in the “medDB” open access research database (https://lea.hochschule-trier.de).

The second clinical test bench was used to investigate whether the proposed GAP approach is suitable for extracting additional clinically valuable information from dynamic phonation paradigms and outperforms the analysis of sustained phonation sequences. For this purpose, twenty female subjects were each examined twice, performing the following two phonatory tasks: (1) Sustained phonation of the vowel /ae/ at a normal pitch and loudness and (2) dynamic phonation (increasing pitch) from a low frequency to a higher one. From the group of twenty subjects, ten subjects were healthy without any signs of a voice disorder (group H2; 10 females: age 20.1yr±1.9yr). The ten pathologic cases (group P2) were diagnosed with unilateral VF paresis (5 females: age 43.8yr±13.2yr) and muscle tension dysphonia (5 females: age 48.6yr±11.4yr). An overview of the clinical test bench data II is provided in Fig. 3
                           .

Depending on the vibration type of the VF characteristic, geometric patterns occur within a PVG. For instance, the triangle-shaped contour line in Fig. 1(3) represents a zipper-like opening and closing of the VFs within a single oscillation cycle. It was shown that describing the vibration patterns of the VFs is equivalent to quantifying the shape of the geometric patterns within a PVG [19]. During sustained phonation there is just a minor change in the PVG geometry throughout an entire sequence. In contrast, during a dynamic phonation subglottal pressure, VFs’ tensions and lengths change, which in turn affects the PVG geometry. Consequently, for the purpose of non-stationary analysis, the changes of the geometric PVG contours need to be extracted as a function of time. Fig. 4
                         summarizes the seven consecutive steps A–G of the generalized PVG analysis procedure, which is explained in detail in the following sections.

Phonovibrograms provide the basis for the analysis procedure proposed here. Initially, from all 190 HS video recordings, the vibrating VF edges were segmented using a clinically evaluated segmentation procedure [30]. From the sustained phonation sequences, a constant length of 500 video images were segmented consistently. The length of the dynamic videos sequences analyzed depended on the individually performed glissando. For the control group, the range was between 0.68 and 1.99s (mean: 1.08s), and between 0.63 and 1.5s for the pathologic group (mean: 1.09s). Altogether, 109,993 images were segmented for the clinical test bench II, resulting in a total of 184,993 analyzed images included in the study.

From the segmented video sequences, the corresponding PVGs were constructed according to Fig. 1(1)–(3). Further details about the PVG construction process is given in Lohscheller et al. [18]. In the following, PVG

                           (k, n) denotes the PVG data matrix where l, r refers to the left and right side, k is the position along the glottal axis, and n the video frame number. The trajectory pairs

                              (

                            refer to the lateral deflection at a specific position k along the glottal axis (Fig. 1(3)), and hGAW

                           (n) and hGAW
                           
                              r
                           (n) are hemi-glottal area waveform functions specifying the area, which is enclosed by the glottal midline and the appropriate (left/right) VF edge for each frame n (Fig. 1(1)).

In case of dynamic phonation, a PVG exhibits re-occurring, quasi periodical patterns continuously changing their appearance throughout the progression of the glissando as shown in the upper two rows of Fig. 5
                           . In order to describe the spatio-temporal properties of VF dynamics as a function of time, the individual opening and closing instants need to be determined for each cycle individually. In this context, the information is required at which discrete time instants each oscillation cycle starts and ends.

The complex wavelet phase of the hemi-glottal area function hGAW
                           
                              l,r
                           (n) can be used to describe the time profile of the opening and closing process for each VF independently, and thus serves as an indicator for separating subsequent oscillation cycles in a highly robust way. The required phase information can be derived on the basis of a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)

The parameter a reflects the different scales of the dilated wavelet, while b refers to its translational displacement. Note that n refers to the discrete frame number, whereas t denotes a continuous time parameter. In Fig. 5 (middle) a scaleogram of a hGAW

In order to extract the relevant phase signal from the CWT, the scale a
                           0 needs to be identified that reflects the fundamental frequency f
                           0 of the oscillation. For this scale the harmonic structure of the Morlet wavelet provides a similar appearance as the glottal area function so that the phase

                           can be estimated by the angle of the complex wavelet transform. In contrast to the previously proposed stationary analysis and in the general case of dynamic phonation, the scale a
                           0 cannot be assumed to be constant since the fundamental frequency changes over time. Thus, within the time-scale plane of the scaleogram, the entire curve a
                           0(b) needs to be identified where the signal concentrates its maximum energy. This curve is referred to as the ridge of the wavelet transform [31]. Localization of the wavelet ridges can be performed in a straightforward manner, as they correspond to local maxima of the scaleogram for each time b 
                           [32,33]. With respect to the glissando maneuver, we are looking for a continuous ridge in the time-scale plane that is estimated by identifying the maxima in the scaleogram

                           0(b) of the scaleogram. Low values in the sawtooth phase signal indicate the beginning and high values the end of the oscillation cycles.

To allow a further time dependent analysis, the PVG and the extracted wavelet phase signal are divided into a sequence of equally sized windows according to automatic speech synthesis and recognition approaches [34,35]. We utilize a 62.5ms window size that is equivalent to M
                           =250 subsequent images. In order to track the temporal changes with a high degree of precision, we use a frame overlap of 6.25ms comprising 25 images. Instead of quantifying the dominant vibration scheme, this technique creates a series of windows 
                              w
                              =
                              [
                              1
                              ,
                              …

                              W
                              ]
                            that are suited for capturing temporal changes in the PVG. The following steps of the procedure are performed for each window individually.

The window length is defined in such a way that short time stationarity of the PVG can be assumed within the considered time interval. This allows estimating an average PVG cycle geometry, which is representative for the window considered, reflecting the mean VF vibration pattern. Fig. 6
                            presents the process of PVG cycle averaging, which is performed for each VF side independently.

For each of the W windows, the VF deflections

                              )
                            are extracted from the corresponding PVG

                              l,r
                           (b), the individual cycles can be identified in a very robust way. In order to derive a mean trajectory pattern representative of the investigated window, the VF deflections need to be averaged over the extracted cycles. For this purpose each cycle is normalized to the uniform phase axis φ
                           =[0, …, 1]. Due to rather short time intervals, each cycle is normalized using cubic interpolation of the corresponding trajectory 
                              
                                 T

                              )
                           . Averaging the interpolated VF deflections over the number of cycles results in a mean VF trajectory (Fig. 6(2)–(4)). Iterating steps 2–4 for each window and all k positions along the glottal axis results into

                           , which represents the mean vibratory characteristic of each VF along the glottal axis for all windows (see Fig. 6(5)). Hence, changes within the VF dynamics can be tracked over the entire high-speed sequence as a function of time for each VF independently.

Within each window, a characteristic geometric pattern occurs within the averaged PVG cycle that directly reflects the mean vibration type of the respective VF. Quantifying the VF vibration pattern therefore demands the description of the characteristic properties of the mean PVG geometry quantitatively.

                            is primarily characterized by opening and closing instants – points where the lateral acceleration reaches its maximum [19]. Connecting these time instants along the glottal axis forms a geometric structure that describes the geometric shape of a PVG cycle (white dashed line in Fig. 1(3)). In Unger et al. [19], we showed that these time instants can be extracted in a robust manner using a Mexican hat wavelet, which is defined as

                           1 match each other. The Mexican hat acts as second order multiscale differential operator so that the wavelet transform provides minimum values at the opening and closing instants within the different scales. In order to identify the required instants, we proposed a multiscale product (MSP) approach denoting the pointwise product of wavelet coefficients of successive scales [19]. The MSP exploits the fact that noise components provide a rather low degree of correlation between wavelet transforms of adjacent scales, whereas singularities such as opening and closing instants appear continuously across the scales and are therefore enhanced [36]. In accordance with our previous approach [19], we apply an MSP with the three different scales

                           (1) represent the identified time instants obtained by the MSP.

The MSP approach described above robustly identifies the opening and closing instants, but a distinction between opening and closing contours cannot be made on the basis of the MSP alone. The missing information can be obtained by applying a first-order real-valued Gaussian wavelet

                            into a parameter space, which is spanned by the first three eigenvalues λ
                           1,2,3 obtained from a PCA [19]. For the approach presented here, the PCA space is derived from the distance vectors

                            obtained from the 100 healthy subjects, which were examined during sustained phonation. In the case of the stationary analysis approach [19], which serves as benchmark, all of the high-speed sequences (each 500 frames) are processed as a whole, i.e. no windowing is applied (W
                           =1). Thus, for the 100 subjects and the two VFs, the PCA space is spanned by a set of 200 different distance vectors. In the case of the non-stationary analysis approach presented here, which fragments the PVG in different windows (W
                           =11), 2200 distance vectors altogether could be used to span the PCA space. In both cases, the resulting PCA space represents the spectrum of healthy vibration modes that fundamentally compose physiologic vibration patterns. The first eigenvector encodes the duration of the glottal opening (short opened phase for low λ
                           1, long opened phase for high λ
                           1), the second distinguishes between a zipper-like opening either from posterior to anterior (dorsal type, low λ
                           2), from anterior to posterior (ventral type, high λ
                           2) or a superposition of both types meaning that the VFs open and close simultaneously alongside the glottal axis (longitudinal type, λ
                           2

                            obtained from hitherto unknown high-speed recordings were projected into the appropriate PCA space for each VF individually. As a result of the projection, the main part of the information was captured by the first three dominant eigenvalues of the PCA space. This low-dimensional representation of the PVG contours can be interpreted clinically and further represents a tremendous data reduction [19]. Thus, in the case of the stationary analysis (W
                           =1) of sustained phonation, the vibration pattern of each VF is represented by a single triple

While the stationary analysis maps phonation sequences to coordinates in the PCA space, the non-stationary analysis introduced here yields trajectories

                        , which constitute novel information about the symmetry and regularity of the change in VF vibration patterns as a function of time. Depending on the phonatory condition (sustained or dynamic phonation), different physiologically motivated assumptions about the behavior of the trajectories within the PCA parameter subspace can be deduced. In the following, we will show that according to the phonatory condition, suitable features can be defined, which appropriately describe the temporal behavior of VF dynamics.

Parameters for assessing the PVG vibratory characteristics in the case of sustained phonation have been defined before [19]. On the basis of these measures, we can define the following features for each window

As shown in Fig. 1, pitch fundamentally influences the vibratory characteristics of VF dynamics. Though VF vibrations likewise change individually during a dynamic phonation, it can be assumed that in healthy voices the vibration patterns of the left and the right VF undergo symmetric and isochronal changes throughout, e.g. a glissando. On the basis of this assumption, the first measure

                              NS
                            that describes the change of VF dynamics for a single subject.

In order to derive conclusions about the discriminative power of the proposed features sets F
                        
                           S

                           NS
                        , the introduced clinical test bench scenarios (see Section 2.1) were used.

For clinical test bench I, which comprises 150 sustained recordings, all high-speed videos were analyzed twice: on the one hand using the proposed non-stationary GAP approach (twenty dimensional feature vector: F
                        
                           S
                        ) and on the other hand using the recently presented approach by Unger et al. [19] that served as benchmark (ten dimensional feature vector: F
                        
                           Ref
                        ). In order to provide an optimal classification performance a feature selection procedure based on mutual information was applied [39]. The feature selection procedure considers the relationship between features during the selection process and has shown a very good performance in different fields [40–42]. According to [43,44] the maximum number of selectable features was set to five, which is one-tenth of the considered group size (50 subjects for the group P1). The identified features as well as the reference feature set F
                        
                           Ref
                         served as input for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a polynomial kernel building a predictive model to assign an unseen feature vector to one of the classes healthy or paresis. Particularly the SVM is known to be quite accurate for moderately imbalanced data [45]. For the selected features and the reference feature set F
                        
                           Ref
                        , the two-class problem H1 vs. P1 was considered. An overview of the analysis procedures applied is provided in Fig. 2.

For clinical test bench II, which comprises sustained and dynamic recordings of 20 subjects, the high-speed videos were analyzed according to the schema shown in Fig. 3. For the feature vector F
                        
                           S
                        , which describes the sustained phonation sequences, again, the feature selection procedure described here was applied to identify the most relevant features. Due to the small group sizes the maximum number of selectable features was set to three, which corresponds to the number of measures contained within feature vector F
                        
                           NS
                        .

For all scenarios, classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using a leave-one-out validation scheme. Due to the applied feature selection procedure including the adjustment of the number of considered features, the results are directly comparable to each other.

For clinical test bench I (sustained phonation paradigm), analysis results are presented in Fig. 8
                         for a healthy male subject and a female subject suffering from unilateral VF paralysis. For ease of visualization, just the PCA subspaces spanned by the two dominant eigenvalues (λ

                        2) are displayed. Within the background of each graph, the eigenvalue distributions (light gray data points) of the 100 healthy subjects are given. These data were used to span the PCA space in which the results of the subjects analyzed were projected into.

The stationary analysis procedure – which constitutes the benchmark – resulted in a single data point for each VF independently (Fig. 8A). The Euclidean distance F

                           asym
                        
                        =1.11) could be detected. Here, the vibration asymmetry was even higher than for the pathological subject (F
                        
                           asym
                        
                        =1.02). For this reason, differentiation between healthy and pathological vibrations, which is based on stationary asymmetry measures alone, is frequently challenging.

Both high-speed videos were analyzed a second time using the proposed non-stationary analysis procedure that allows tracking the changes of VF vibration patterns over time. The obtained eigenvalue distributions are displayed in Fig. 8B and D. The mean asymmetry measure 
                           
                              
                                 F

                              asym
                           
                           =
                           1.16
                         for the healthy subject is almost identical to the stationary analysis case, while it is slightly higher for the pathological case 
                           
                              
                                 F
                                 ¯
                              
                              asym
                           
                           =
                           1.28
                        . This results due to the fact that for the healthy subject, the vibration patterns of both VFs hardly changed over time during the sustained phonation interval. The 2-norm of the standard deviation of the first three eigenvalues was quite low and amounted to 0.083 for the left and 0.117 for the right VF. In contrast, in the case of VF paralysis, the eigenvalue distributions of both VFs changed considerably over time. The 2-norm of the standard deviation amounted to 0.746 for the left and 0.638 for the right VF. This fluctuation was not detectable using just a stationary analysis approach. It can be deduced that features describing the temporal stability of the vibrations patterns should be beneficial for an improved differentiation between physiological and pathological vibrations.

To reduce the dimension of the feature space, the feature selection approach described was applied to the non-stationary feature vector F
                        
                           NS
                        . The following five features were identified:

                                 F
                                 ¯

                                 λ
                                 ¯
                              
                              2
                              r
                           
                        . Among the selected features, 
                           std
                           (
                           
                              F

                           (
                           w
                           )
                           )
                         represented the formerly hypothesized temporal stability measure, namely the time stability of the phase difference between the left and right VF.

The five selected features were fed into the SVM to automatically distinguish between the normal and pathological group (H1 vs. P1). For the five features, a classification accuracy of 91.3% (sensitivity: 80.0%, specificity: 97.0%) was achieved on the basis of a leave-one-out validation scheme. For the benchmark feature set F
                        
                           Ref
                        , a classification accuracy of 89.3% (sensitivity: 76.0%, specificity: 96.0%) was achieved. For the perturbation and symmetry parameters, an accuracy of merely 68% (sensitivity: 56%, specificity: 74%) was achieved [19].

For the second clinical test bench (sustained phonation sequences and glissando recordings), the analysis results are presented in Fig. 9
                         for a healthy subject, and a subject suffering from unilateral VF paralysis. Both subjects were examined twice: during sustained phonation (left), and during a glissando (right). All high-speed recordings were analyzed using the proposed non-stationary analysis procedure.

For both subjects, the temporal behavior of the analyzed sustained phonation interval (Fig. 9A and C) is similar to the results presented in Fig. 8. For the example presented, the mean asymmetry measure

                                 ¯
                              
                              asym
                           
                           =
                           0.92
                         of the pathological case was even less than for the healthy subject (ID=H20), which complicates the correct identification of a voice pathology.

                         are shown in Fig. 10
                        . Due to the relatively low number of subjects, the differences between the groups H2 and P2 were tested on the basis of Bonferroni-corrected Mann Whitney-U tests at the significance level p
                        =0.0033. Only for the asymmetry parameter

                         could significant differences be seen for groups H2 and P2. Neither group could be separated linearly within the corresponding three dimensional feature space (Fig. 10D).

Within Fig. 9B and D, the results are presented that were derived from the glissando maneuvers. For the healthy subject, there was a systematic change in the vibration patterns of both VFs during the glissando, which was reflected by low values of the fractal dimension measures (D
                        
                           l

                        =1.15). The change of the eigenvalues indicated a direct transition from a dorsal glottal closing pattern involving a longer closed phase to a more longitudinal closure with a longer open phase. This isochronous and likewise symmetric change of the vibration patterns of both VFs was reflected by the parallel increase of the corresponding eigenvalue trajectories

For the pathologic case (Fig. 9D) much more diffuse and asymmetric changes of the vibration patterns of both VFs were observable during the glissando, which may originate from a reduced coupling between both VFs. The high irregularity and the non-systematic changes of the vibration patterns were reflected by increased values of the fractal dimensions (D

                         are summarized within the boxplot graphs in Fig. 11
                        . The covered frequency range for the healthy group was 288Hz±85Hz, and 233Hz±81Hz for the pathologic group. A statistically significant difference in the range of the pitch intervals did not exist between the groups (Mann Whitney-U test). The fractal dimension measures were clearly increased for the pathologic group while the values of the lateral correlation T
                        
                           corr
                         decreased. The tests revealed statistically significant differences between the healthy and the pathologic class for all measures. Considering all investigated subjects, a linear separation between the healthy (H2) and pathologic (P2) groups can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 11D.

To further investigate the discriminative power of the features F

To consider the small group sizes, just three relevant measures were selected using the feature selection procedure (see Section 2.4). On the basis of the selected features

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In recent years, HSV has established itself as a gold standard in laryngeal imaging. It captures full images of the VFs with high temporal resolution, making it applicable for evaluating even transient or aperiodic vibrations. While the majority of the procedures are designed to analyze sustained phonation sequences, the current work addresses a generalized approach to process both, sustained and dynamic phonation routines. The procedure is a consistent extension and generalization of a previously presented wavelet-based analysis procedure [19]. The extension involves the following modifications of the computational routine: the phase estimation is performed with respect to the varying fundamental frequency, and the PVG is divided into equally-sized windows. The contour is then extracted from each window individually and temporal alterations of the vibration pattern are represented by eigenvector trajectories within the PCA space from which temporal features can be abstracted.

Note that in our studies, the procedure was able to capture the PVG structure even for highly disturbed vibration patterns, as seen in some cases of paralysis. Nevertheless, it has to be kept in mind that completely aperiodic patterns cannot be readily analyzed when subsequent cycles have to be identified. In these cases, the eigenvalue quantities should be interpreted with caution.

In clinical practice, laryngoscopic HSV examinations are mostly performed during sustained phonation at habitual pitch and loudness. In the case of sustained phonation it can be assumed that, if the underlying phonatory condition is kept constant, VF vibrations reach a steady state condition, which is reflected by a particular opening and closing pattern. During the considered time interval, VF dynamics should fluctuate around a mean vibration pattern. As shown in Fig. 12
                        , during sustained phonation this fluctuation is normally distributed for the physiological and even for the pathological group. However, due to the typically occurring reduced coupling of the VFs in cases of paralysis, the variance of the fluctuation is increased for the pathological group (higher values of the standard deviations) compared to the healthy group. This fluctuation, which is expressed by the variation of the eigenvalues over time, reflects the stability of the entire vibration pattern, including the visible two-dimensional process of VF opening and closing along the glottal axis. It therefore potentially comprises much more information about the entire process of VF dynamics than, e.g. the one-dimensional analysis of the glottal area waveform (GAW) [3,46,47].

The GAP feature set for sustained phonation conditions F
                        
                           S
                         includes the temporal stability of the phasing 
                           
                              F
                              async
                           
                           (
                           w
                           )
                         between the left and right VF, which is not part of the benchmark feature set F
                        
                           Ref
                        . The temporal stability is thus a rather relevant feature, which is in accordance with other approaches that include measures of temporal stability [24,22,23]. In conjunction with the results obtained by the SVM classification approach, the findings indicate that the features derived about the temporal stability of the VF vibration are helpful for an automatic identification of voice disorders. In particular, the true positive rate could be increased by 4% compared to the former stationary analysis. Compared to the perturbation and symmetry parameters, the classification accuracy is more than 23.3% higher.

The interpretation of the magnitude of the standard deviations as a temporal stability measures is, however, is only valid for a steady state condition. As soon as the phonatory condition changes during the examination situation, as, for example, subglottal pressure or VF tensions, the necessary condition of a stationary process is no longer fulfilled. This might result in detectable systematic changes of the vibration patterns over time, and consequently in increased values of the standard deviation. In Fig. 13
                        , two examples of healthy phonations are demonstrated. The eigenvalues

                         of subject ID=H17 fluctuate around a stable position within the PCA subspace, which indicates a steady state phonation condition. Contrarily, a systematic change of the eigenvalues 
                           
                              λ
                              
                                 1

                                 l
                                 ,
                                 r
                              
                           
                           (
                           w
                           )
                         of subject ID=H38 can be observed within the PCA subspace. Due to the clear parallel trend of both VF trajectories, likewise a systematic change in the phonatory condition must be concluded for the investigated time interval. Hence, as the steady state condition is not fulfilled, the standard deviations cannot be interpreted as stability measures any longer. An unchecked interpretation of temporal instability measures might thus lead to an erroneous overestimation of the real vibration irregularity.

The example given in Fig. 13B reveals that the non-stationary analysis approach presented here is capable of detecting even slight systematic changes within the VF dynamics during short time intervals (500 frames correspond to 125ms). This relatively high sensitivity has a direct implication for the clinical examination. During the recording of laryngeal high-speed videos, great care has to be taken in maintaining the proper phonatory condition. It is indispensable to verify whether the steady state condition has really been fulfilled. Otherwise, the correct interpretation of quantitative irregularity measures is problematic.

In current literature, other studies can be found dealing with classification of pathological vocal fold dynamics. Bohr et al. employ features from different categories for classifying organic pathologies including cysts, nodules and epithelial thickenings of female subjects [48]. For the two-class problem healthy vs. pathologies, they achieved an overall accuracy of 88%. However, the study involves only a very limited number of subjects per pathology. Moreover, 44 features are employed for classification, which makes a general assessment of the features’ predictive power difficult. Similar results were found for a texture-based analysis from single laryngeal images [49]. Here, the authors achieved 87% for the three-class problem healthy vs. nodular (nodules, polyps, and cysts) vs. diffuse mass lesions (papillomata, keratosis, and carcinoma). Texture-based classification, however, does not assess the VFs’ vibratory behavior and thus, cannot be applied to neurogenic or functional disorders. Other classification systems that focus on identifying paretic vibration patterns from sustained phonation sequences report accuracies of 89% [10] and 93% [22]. A direct comparison between these results is, however, difficult. However, the mentioned approaches are limited to sustained phonation sequences, which inhibits the portability of the results to our study. Furthermore, an objective comparison of different approaches would demand a standardized research database comprising high speed videos including the obtained results. To support the idea of open science, the open access research database “medDB” (https://lea.hochschule-trier.de) was developed that allows access to laryngeal high-speed video data including the corresponding segmentation results and phonovibrograms. The platform further allows each registered scientist to share own video data and/or own analysis results with the scientific community to make the outcome of different research approaches more comparable.

In current research, minor attention has been paid to the additional value of examining quantitatively transient mechanisms instead of stationary processes for diagnostic purposes. A transient phonation paradigm such as, for example, a glissando, is, however, of particular interest for voice research and diagnostics, since it constitutes a more comprehensive voice examination situation in contrast to a sustained phonation paradigm. It therefore delivers additional information about functional aspects of the voice generation process.

Stationary analysis principally defines abnormalities as lateral asymmetries or deviations from a mean, which is regarded as a normal reference [2]. However, since during dynamic phonation changes in the vibration patterns are intentionally provoked, the definition of measures quantifying the deviation from a mean is no longer practicable. Generally, higher pitch results in increased glottal length and decreased glottal area and amplitude [14]. In this work, we showed that the generalized analysis approach proposed here, in combination with adequate temporal measures, is suitable for quantitatively describing the regularity (fractal dimension D
                        
                           l,r
                        ) and lateral synchronism (correlation T
                        
                           corr
                        ) of the changes of VF dynamics over time during dynamic phonation. The results revealed that during the glissando in pathologic voices, the change of the vibration patterns is less systematic compared to healthy voices (see Fig. 11). Within the defined 3D features space (D
                        
                           l,r
                        , T
                        
                           corr
                        ), the normal and pathologic vibrations could be separated in a linear way. This finding was supported by an automatic differentiation between normal and pathologic glissandi. Although the group size of the second clinical test bench is rather small, the classification accuracy could be improved from 75% (15 out of 20 correctly classified cases) to 90% compared to a sustained phonation paradigm (18 out of 20 correctly classified cases).

However, a large-scale study will be necessary to confirm the current findings. Due to gender-specific differences in laryngeal size [50] and vibratory behavior [51,52], the variability of the features characterizing dynamic phonation is expected to be rather high. Therefore, a higher number of male and female subjects have to be included into upcoming studies to confirm the clinical significance of the parameter distributions. Likewise, healthy and pathologic groups of test bench II are not age-matched. Thus, age-related influences on the proposed dynamic eigenvalue parameters have to be examined in detail as well.

Nevertheless, previous studies [7,15] also identified a clinical merit when analyzing glissando maneuvers instead of sustained phonation. In this context, the application of this approach to further dynamic paradigms as the changes of the sound pressure level during phonation or the voice onset interval will be in the focus of future investigations. Each phonatory maneuver may require the definition of individual features, which are specifically adapted to the investigated voice production mechanism. The approach presented here might be helpful to comprehensively analyze the different types of phonation paradigms, which is of particular interest to understand and analyze the process of physiological voice production and the origin of voice pathologies in a more quantitative way.

In its current form, the procedure quantifies the PVG contours by taking the distance from opening to closing instants, which conform to our previous approach [19]. In doing so, the results of both methods can be directly compared, but no distinction is made between the opening and closing phase, which might theoretically lead to implausible symmetry measures. Nevertheless, the procedure can be directly extended by projecting both contours separately into a PCA space. Since this will incorporate a higher number of quantities, larger groups and further tests will be necessary to validate the benefit of the extended parameter set. The extension might provide a more detailed insight into the complex mechanisms of VF dynamics.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A procedure for a generalized assessment of VF dynamics was presented, extending and generalizing a previous stationary wavelet-based approach. Here, not only sustained, but dynamic phonation sequences can also be analyzed. The specific type and temporal change of VF vibration patterns could be quantified using a time-variant decomposition of eigenvalues comprehensively describing the vibration patterns and their evolution over time. Depending on the phonation performed during endoscopy, specific features could be derived that quantify different aspects of vibration patterns. It was demonstrated that features characterizing the temporal evolvement of the vibration patterns provide additional information about laryngeal motorics showing promising results for an automated differentiation between normal and pathological vibration types. Even though the number of analyzed subjects is limited in this data set, it can be stated that the non-stationary parameters allow detailed insight into the time varying characteristics of vocal fold dynamics. Future work will focus on analyzing further dynamic phonation conditions, such as voice onset maneuvers and changes in the sound pressure level to achieve a full framework for a comprehensive analysis of laryngeal high-speed videos.
