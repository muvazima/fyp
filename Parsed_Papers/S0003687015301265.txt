@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Assessment of work energy expenditure (or metabolic rate) is a key parameter in the evaluation of the physical aspect of work in occupational ergonomics, especially when using thermal stress indices (e.g., TWL, PHS, WBGT, IREQ, PMV-PPD), and in the determination of work-rest regimens for physical work (ACGIH, 2013; Brake and Bates, 2002; ISO 11079:2008; ISO 7730:2006; ISO 7933:2004).

But the obligation to wear a mask is invasive and unacceptably uncomfortable to many workers so that measurement durations in work settings are often restricted to short periods of time especially when working in hot conditions. On the other hand, heart rate (HR) is a very cost effective non-invasive measure that can be easily and safely obtained over long work periods (e.g., complete work shift) and can be used as a replacement to

Ways to control them include, for instance, ensuring they are present during the submaximal test such as having a test that uses similar muscle groups as in the work to be studied, or by administering the test near the actual worksite so as to have similar test and work conditions (Nielsen and Meyer, 1987). This is seldom possible in the case of thermal stress since it can vary greatly between time of the test (often early in the morning) and time of work measurement, especially when work is performed outdoors (e.g., forestry, agriculture).

                        W
                     ), which is related to the physical work performed and determines metabolic rate. The method hypothesizes that the heat strain component develops progressively during work and remains stable during the first minutes of the ensuing rest break (Vogt et al., 1973). During that time, the subject recovers from the physical work performed (motor component) and accordingly, a fast decrease in heart rate can be observed. After the first minutes have elapsed the heat accumulated in the body (i.e., HR thermal component), begins to dissipate gradually and accordingly from that point on HR decreases slowly to eventually reach the resting level. In Vogt et al.'s method, the HR thermal component can be estimated during a 10-min seated rest pause immediately following a work period (Fig. 1
                     ). The HR thermal component at the end of the work period is calculated as the HR elevation above resting value at or near the 4th minute after the beginning of the rest pause, that is when recuperation of the motor component is thought to be complete. This method allows the assessment of the HR thermal component when HR data is collected in the presence of heat stress, which is often the case in actual work conditions. Imbeau et al. (1995) applied Vogt et al.'s method to estimate the metabolic rate of scaffolding work. However very few studies have been published in peer reviewed journals on the practical application of this method or on the accuracy in estimating

                      that can be achieved with it in actual work settings. Using a different approach based on rectal temperature and heart rate measurements to estimate the HR thermal component, Kampmann et al. (2001) have shown that the mean metabolic rate estimation in mining work can be reduced by 25% when the HR thermal component is taken into account. Such an overestimation error is significant and can change radically the outcome of a risk analysis performed with any of the thermal stress indices cited above or compromise the determination of productive work-rest regimens for physical work.

@&#METHODS@&#

This study used the data collected in three research projects on physical workload and productivity of forest workers conducted in various regions of the Province of Québec (Canada). Participants were 10 tree planters and 40 brushcutters, all males with a minimum experience of three years who were representative of their group in terms of work productivity (tree planting: 2500 trees per day; brushcutting: one hectare per week) and could undertake a submaximal test according to the PAR-Q questionnaire. Smokers (N = 9) were allowed since they still represent an important proportion of the worker population in this industry. All participants signed an informed consent before participating in the study. All workers were observed during one complete workday. Measurements took place in the months of July to October between 2009 and 2013. Age characteristics were different between tree planters (mean ± s.d. = 25 ± 2.0 years; range = 23–28 years) and brushcutters (mean ± s.d. = 50 ± 9.8 years; range = 22–67 years) since the former are generally younger in this industry. This dataset was intended to provide a wide age range. Table 1
                         summarizes the participants' characteristics.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

Participants were met in the morning before the beginning of their workday either outside the forest camp where they lodged (n = 42) or directly on the side of the road near their day's worksite (n = 8) to review the experimental procedure. A HR monitor (RS800, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) set to record at 5 s intervals was donned and kept until the end of the work day. The participant took a seated rest during which a portable

                         measuring apparatus was installed. Two different instruments were used: a Fitmate Pro (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) was used in n = 35 participants and a K4b2 (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) in n = 15 participants. Both instruments have been validated against the Douglas bag over

The participant took a submaximal step-test (Fig. 1, leftmost image) with his regular work clothes but not the protective equipment (helmet, gloves and harness). Most step-tests took place outdoors due to the lack of infrastructures in forest settings (n = 35). The Meyer and Flenghi (1995) step-test was used since it offers several advantages: simple, cost-effective, and practical, it can be implemented safely without imposing high cardiac strain, particularly for older and less active individuals. Imbeau et al. (2010) showed that the highest exertion level on this test reached by a group of forest workers corresponded well to the exertion generally measured during typical brushcutting work. Apud et al. (1989) showed that using a standardized test procedure involving mainly the lower limbs (e.g., ergocycle, step-test) is a valid approach for estimating

                         from HR measurements in forest work involving the muscular mass of both lower and upper limbs (ex., brushcutting and tree planting). An additional advantage of the Meyer and Flenghi step-test is that the constant step frequency (15 steps per min paced with a metronome) is sufficiently low for any worker to be able to keep pace at all four step heights, for superior overall test precision and robustness. The equipment consists of a lightweight portable bench with a height-adjustable step (11.5, 21.5, 31.5, and 41.5 cm). The dimension of the bench (50 cm × 46 cm x 42 cm) is small enough to be easily implemented just about anywhere (e.g. side of logging road). In this test, after a 5-min sitting rest to obtain resting heart rate, participants are asked to stand in front of the bench for 2 min. The test starts with the participant stepping onto and off the lowest step height for 3 min, followed by a short, 30-s standing rest in front of the bench while the experimenter increases the step height by sliding the step out of the lowest set of tracks and into the second-height tracks. This 3.5-min cycle is then repeated for the three remaining step heights. The

                         measuring apparatus could not be used any longer since it was deemed uncomfortable by the participants. The oxygen consumption measurement were conducted at mid-morning (34% of the cases) or mid-afternoon (66% of the cases) so as to correspond to different ambient thermal conditions.

Four seated 10-min rest pauses were taken by the participant at his work site during the workday (mid AM, before lunch, mid PM, and end of work day) to assess the HR thermal component using Vogt et al.'s method at four moments of the work shift. As suggested by Vogt et al. (1970), the rest pauses always followed the most physically demanding part of the work cycle (planting or brushcutting work) and preceded any work activity that could contribute partially to rest (e.g., walking, tree rebagging, filing the blade, filling with gas). A portable chair with a hood to protect against the sun was installed in the shade whenever possible (Fig. 1 rightmost image). Participants were not allowed to eat, speak or move during the rest pauses to ensure a HR recuperation profile as smooth as possible.

An experimenter followed the participant during the day to note his every activity including changes in clothing. Thermal conditions (dry bulb temperature - Ta, globe temperature - Tg, air velocity - Va, and relative humidity - RH) were measured during the step-test and recorded throughout the day at 5 s intervals at the work site as close to the worker as possible using a tripod-mounted Kestrel® 4000 weather meter (Nielsen-Kellerman Co., Boothwin, PA) equipped with a vane and a globe thermometer (15 cm diameter copper globe with a Lascar EL-USB-TC-LCD thermocouple and data logger; Lascar Electronics, Salisbury, UK) in 2009–2011, and a vane equipped Kestrel® 4400 weather meter in 2011–2013 (the Kestrel 4400 uses a 2.5 cm globe whose output is adjusted automatically to that of a 15 cm copper globe). All measuring devices were synchronized to GPS time every morning before the beginning of data collection.

The resulting breath-by-breath values were smoothed using a 7-breath centered average and then reduced to 15 s stationary averages to reduce noise (Robergs et al., 2010).

                         averages from each step-test exertion level (one rest and 4 steps) (Meyer and Flenghi, 1995). Resting HR was calculated as the 1st percentile of the measurements over the workday (Mairiaux and Malchaire, 1990). In 46% of the participants (n = 19), this resting HR value was below that measured during the morning seated rest preceding the step-test. The 1st percentile HR value was used to calculate the HR thermal component.

According to Vogt et al. (1973), the duration of the motor component recuperation averages 4 min, but it can vary between participants (e.g., acclimatization, fitness). Hence, in this study, the transition point between the motor and thermal recuperation was determined graphically through close examination of the HR profile of the 10-min seated rest pauses. The transition point is located at the sudden change in the recuperation curve profile; i.e., a fast decrease changing to a slow decrease, usually occurring around the 4th minute of rest (Fig. 1). The HR thermal component was calculated as the average HR values over a 1-min time window centered on the transition point. Per Vogt et al. (1973), a linear increase of the HR thermal component over time (ΔHR
                        
                           T

                         profile was then subtracted from his measured HR profile (raw HR) throughout the same period, yielding a corrected HR profile. The increase in the HR thermal component over time was averaged over the work period yielding ΔHR

A paired sample t-test was conducted to compare the ambient thermal conditions and clothing insulation during the step-test and during actual work in the forest. Pearson's correlation coefficient was also computed for the work phase and rest phase separately to identify relationships between predicted

A wide range of ambient thermal conditions were observed (Table 2
                        ) from: cold to hot (WBGT: 5.9 °C–24.2 °C), dry to damp (RH: 35%–100%), no air movement to windy conditions (Va: 0–4.7 m s−1). Temperatures were significantly cooler and more humid in the morning during the step-test than during the workday. Tree planters wore lighter clothing (short, long underwear and t-shirt) than brushcutters (long sleeves vest and heavy pants). However, for a few exceptions, participants wore the same clothing during the step-test and work in the forest.

The location of the transition point between motor and thermal recovery (i.e., end of motor recovery) was on average 3.86 ± 1.15 min (range: 1 min–7 min) from the beginning of the rest pause. From that point on, the thermal recovery decreased at a rate of 0.9 ± 0.6 bpm min−1 to reach a level between 0 and 33 bpm at the end of the 10-min rest pause. The mean corrected HR during thermal recovery after work in the forest (i.e., from the transition point to the end of the 10-min rest pause) (65 ± 8 bpm, range: 48–81 bpm) was not statistically different from the step-test rest value (mean bias = −1 ± 3.5 bpm, t37 = −1.54, p = 0.137).

Heteroscedasticity was not significant.

This level of effort is determined by the type of activity performed in combination with widely varying environmental conditions such as sloping terrain, field obstacles, vegetation density, load carried (e.g., brushcutter), and stem diameters to be cut (Toupin et al., 2007). To protect themselves, workers had to wear clothing ensembles (e.g., rain gear, long sleeves to protect against mosquitoes) and personal protective equipment (safety helmet, multi-ply pants, safety rubber boots, gloves) that increased clothing insulation (up to 1.7 Clo: Table 2), thereby degrading the exchange of heat produced by the working muscles with the environment especially in warm to hot ambient conditions. Degraded heat exchanges translate to heat accumulating in the body with a consequent increase in HR (ΔHR
                        
                           T
                        ) over time (Vogt et al., 1970, 1973). The very heavy physical work in combination with the varied ambient conditions and clothing insulation observed in this study lead to HR increases due to heat accumulated in the body (i.e., ΔHR
                        
                           T
                         or HR thermal component) ranging from 3 to 40 bpm at the end of the work period (i.e., elevation at the transition point in the ensuing seated rest pause) with a 21 bpm average. These figures indicate that many participants (18 out of 38) had a ΔHR
                        
                           T
                         at the transition point equal to or beyond the 21 bpm limit proposed by Martinet and Meyer (1999) to protect 95% of the worker population against an increase in body core temperature exceeding 1 °C. These figures also indicate that there were a number of instances (5 out of 38) where the 33 bpm limit proposed by ISO9886:2004 to protect 50% of the workers was exceeded.

Our results show that equivalent cardiovascular strains can result from two quite different sets of stress conditions as shown by the raw HR measurements (Table 3). On average, the highest exertion level of the step-test produced a net cardiac cost of 57 bpm that is marginally lower than the 60 bpm figure measured during work in the forest. However, 27% of the increase of the latter is caused by heat accumulated in the body as a result of thermal stress whereas in the step-test muscle work only is responsible for the increase. Hence, the physical work component of forest work (60 bpm − 17 bpm = 43 bpm) although considered very heavy (Chengalur et al., 2004) is much less demanding from a metabolic heat production point of view than the highest exertion level of the step-test. This clearly shows that equating raw HR measurements to metabolism can be misleading where thermal stress is present.

During brushcutting and tree planting work, the thermal HR component represented on average 27% (range 0%–52%) of the HR elevation (NCC) (Table 3) yielding a corresponding average 6.4 ml kg−1 min−1

                         in thermal stress indices (ex., PHS, WBGT) may be seen as a positive consequence in that it overestimates heat produced by the body during work and thus provides workers with better protection. But, a large estimation error may lead to the prescription of work-rest regimens that are judged too conservative and unproductive by workers and employers alike, and in the end may not be applied. That would be equivalent to not taking into account heat stress and putting workers at risk.

The use of Vogt et al.'s (1970, 1973) method enabled an accurate estimation of ΔHR

                        ). With two participants the mean error decreases to −11% to +10% which is in line with the 10% suggested by ISO8996 (2004). These error figures show Vogt et al.'s (1970, 1973) method to produce precise estimations at the group level and subject level.

Our results indicate that the transition point between metabolic recuperation and thermal recuperation was at 3.86 min on average after the work stoppage, but it could be as far as 7 min. The 3.86 min figure is very close to the average 4 min proposed by Vogt et al. (1973) and Mairiaux and Malchaire (1990). Hence, a 10-min rest pause as proposed by Vogt et al. (1973) will allow the practitioner not to miss the transition point and will likely allow the participant to lose part of his accumulated body heat before resuming work. Such a long pause will also help the practitioner to determine the point on the HR profile where to start the linear increase of ΔHR
                        
                           T
                         for the ensuing work period. The practitioner who is interested in the ΔHR
                        
                           T
                         profile over the work day will have to plan for a number of pauses distributed throughout the day (e.g., as was done in this study). A requirement for the application of Vogt et al.'s method is that the rest pause be taken in a neutral environment. This requirement could not be met in this study since facilities offering neutral climatic conditions were not available in the forest. Also, the workers were paid on an incentive basis such that rest pauses had to be taken very close to the work site so as not to degrade their productivity. In this study, the use of an umbrella to protect the workers against the sun during the rest pause seems to have produced conditions that although not neutral were suitable enough to clearly pinpoint the transition point between motor and thermal recovery. In future work, it would be worth investigating more in depth the impact of ambient conditions on the motor and thermal recovery.

The literature on physical work capacity assessment recommends that submaximal exercise tests be performed in laboratory conditions with the participant wearing light clothing (neutral ambient conditions, t-shirt, shorts and running shoes). In this study, the step-test was administered near the work site with the worker wearing his normal work clothes. This could have affected the participants' HR-

                         relationships and possibly contributed to increase estimation errors. However, from the practitioner's point of view it is reassuring to know that such a deviation from the recommended testing conditions, which is often the case in practice, can produce a mean estimation error at group level below 1% (95%CI: −3% to +1%), that is well below the ±5%

One limitation of this study pertains to other variables that could yield a HR elevation without a subsequent increase in metabolism but that were not specifically addressed in our experimental setting (e.g., size of working muscle groups, static work components, steady or non-steady-state work, mental stress and dehydration). However, according to ISO9886 (2004) and Meyer et al. (2001) the effect of stress (ΔHR
                        
                           N
                        ), dehydration, and muscle static work (ΔHR
                        
                           S
                        ) cannot be quantified by Vogt et al.'s (1973) method. In this study, these factors likely had a negligible effect on HR elevation. For one, psychological stress was unlikely since the participants performed their daily work in the usual conditions and they were accustomed to the presence of researchers and to participating in field research. A number of authors have indicated that forest workers are often in a state of dehydration despite the fact that they can self-hydrate at will mainly because of the important water loss produced by a combination of high work intensity, ambient conditions and clothing insulation (Bates et al., 2001; Trites et al., 1993). In this study, dehydration has not been measured nor controlled, but an important sweat loss could certainly be observed in a number of participants. Hence, it is possible that dehydration may have contributed to the HR elevation in this study. But given the small

(2001) suggest. In future research it would be interesting to exert a better control on dehydration and better characterize its effect with respect to Vogt et al.'s (1970, 1973) method. From a practitioner's point of view, this study shows that the method offers very good accuracy in conditions where participants can drink at will and with the possibly that they can be partially dehydrated. Static muscular work usually has a marginal to negligible contribution to the elevation of HR in the presence of significant whole body dynamic muscular work (Nielsen and Meyer, 1987), which was the case in this study. As for other factors such as working muscle groups and steady vs non steady state physical work, they were fairly constant throughout the study and were typical of tree planting and brushcutting activities. Hence, our results should be applicable to other comparable types of physical activities.

Finally, the experimental design used in this study did not allow testing for repeatability. Although repeated measurements over time were recorded (e.g., breath-by-breath
