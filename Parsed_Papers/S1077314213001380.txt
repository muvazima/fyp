                  This paper discusses the problem of segmenting foreground objects precisely in surveillance video images when foreground moving objects and the still backgrounds have the similar color parts. Motivated by the studies in color constancy, the notion of color invariants is introduced to realize integrated segmentation in color similar situations. Color invariants, which are derived from a physical model, are used as descriptors of image. Then a simple background subtraction method using the color invariants is performed to examine the effectiveness of color invariants in color similar situations. The experimental results demonstrated that the color invariants based method performed well in various situations of color similarity and also was robust to environmental illumination change. Moreover, the color invariants based method achieved higher accuracy and efficiency of background subtraction compared with other existing algorithms in practical real-time surveillance video images of indoor environments.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Background subtraction is a fundamental issue of computer vision, which aims to segment foreground moving objects from images by parameters or descriptors so that the pixels residing in the foreground or background can be effectively differentiated. In some specific applications, background subtraction is demanded to exactly segment the foreground moving object from the background without apertures or discontinuities in segmentation. However in many common situations (e.g., the similar color of foreground moving objects and background, the abrupt change of illumination intensity), it is unable to realize the integrated object segmentation with background subtraction algorithm [1,2].

In order to overcome the problems of apertures and discontinuities in segmentation, researchers [3–6] tried to improve the robustness of background subtraction algorithm for the illumination changes. Nevertheless, few researches worked on the apertures and discontinuities from the view of color model used by images [7]. Intuitively, the color discriminative ability of background algorithm is basically related to the way of representing colors in the image. RGB, the default color model generated by the surveillance camera, is an additive color model, which is formed by adding three basic colors with different proportions to reproduce a band of color arrays to represent colors in image. Since the formation of RGB color model is simple, it is widely used in the electronic devices [8]. Hence, most background subtraction algorithms used in the intelligence surveillance systems are directly processing images based on RGB color model, such as the GMM [9], Codebook [10], and etc. The GMM algorithm is one of the most prevalent background subtraction algorithms. Nonetheless, experiments proved that the GMM algorithm did not perform well when there were shadows; i.e., shadows were usually viewed as foreground objects by the GMM algorithm. This indicates the fact that the GMM algorithm is sensitive to the illumination intensity change. Funt et al. [12] confirmed in his research that the normalization of RGB values could eliminate the effect of illumination intensity. However, once the RGB value is normalized, images’ color values in the dark area become unstable [13]. The codebook algorithm uses the color distance to describe colors in order to make the best use of illumination intensity [10]. Although, theoretically, this method makes the algorithm independent of abrupt illumination change and discriminative to color similarity, it works poorly in practice [14].

To get the full use of color information, the HSI color model is proposed, which is more intuitive and perceptual with human eyes compared with the RGB color model. In HSI color model, the intensity and chroma information are defined separately, this is better to cope with the color similarity as well as the illumination change. Unfortunately, the HSI color model is an unstable color model; i.e. when the color saturation is low, the H value changes randomly. As a result, HSI color model is unsuitable to the background subtraction algorithm.

Luke et al. [11] proposed the YCrCbCg and HSv color models to improve the stability of the illumination change. The algorithm based on the YCrCbCg and HSv color models works well for various kinds of indoor environments, but it still unable to process the image under the color similarity situation.

The color models used in the above mentioned algorithms describe image colors only with color spectral information, but without consideration of color spatial structure in image. The color of an object is not only a function of surface reflectance, but also a function of both the illumination spectrum and the sensing device [15]. Thus, it is necessary to consider the formation of color image as the combination of the image surface reflectance, ambient illumination and the photographing device. Therefore, it is assumed that a color model which integrates the color spectral information and spatial configuration will be more precise to describe colors in image.

Geusebroek et al. [16,18] analyzed that the formation of colors in image was an integrated process of spectrum energy distribution in the spatial dimension at certain spectral scale-space and spatial scale-space. Then the Kubelka–Munk theory was adopted to model the formation of the color in term of physical basis, which integrated the color spectral information and spatial content to describe color [17]. The color invariants were derived from the Kubelka–Munk theoretic model, which were invariable to illumination changes and had excellent color discriminative capability in theory.

In this paper, the color invariants are applied as descriptor for background subtraction method. The indoor environments are selected as the tentative environments. A background subtraction method based on a novel descriptor consist of color invariants is proposed. Experiments and results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes precise background–foreground segmentation in different color similarity situations and it has the robustness to illumination change. The method also achieves a high true-positive segmentation accuracy and runtime efficiency.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the color invariant descriptors. In Section 3, the framework of background subtraction method based on color invariants is described. Section 4 presents the experiments and the results that examine the foreground segmenting capability and efficiency of the proposed method in different color similarity situations and its robustness to illumination.

Color is an effective cue to discriminate objects in images. However, the general color models only use the color spectral information and its color representation for color spectrum is not as sophisticated as the color reflected light spectrum for human eyes. Therefore, in order to describe colors in a more discriminatively way, it is necessary not only to use the color spectral energy distribution coding color information, but also the spatial configuration of color [18]. The Kubelka–Munk theory as defined in Eq. (1) is established based on a physical model in term of spectral and spatial dimension of color [16]. Parameters with properties independent of illumination intensity and viewpoint are defined as the color invariants.

                      denotes the material reflectivity. The set of color invariants derives from the Kubelka–Munk theory are shown in Table 1
                     . In Table 1, C.I. is short for color invariant and the corresponding column lists the names of the defined color invariants. The second column is the definitions of each color invariant. The third and the forth columns give out the conditions and physical models from which the color invariants derived.

The color invariants list in Table 1 are defined in an ideal physical model, i.e. the color invariants are defined in the given dimensional spectrum at an infinitesimal small spatial neighborhood. However, in practice, the spatial-spectral energy distribution is measurable only at a certain spatial extend and a certain bandwidth. According to Florack and Munk [17], the Gaussian function and its derivatives can be used as general probes for the measurement of spatial-spectral differential quotients. Therefore, in order to compute the color invariants in practice, Gaussian color model is adopted as the image color describing model. Gaussian color model is a human perceptual oriented color model which conveys color in term of spectral and spatial structure [18]. Hence, the spectral and spatial parameters in the definitions of color invariants can be calculated in the Gaussian color model.

Since the subspace spanned by the human visual system is of dimension 3, the third or higher order Taylor expansion of incident light spectral energy distribution is unobservable by human eyes [18]. Hence, the second order truncated Taylor expansion is sufficient to approximate the spectral energy distribution of color for human visual system.

In order to examine to effectiveness of color invariants, a primitive background modeling method is conducted. N images of background sequence are used to the initial background model. For each image, color invariants H,
                        Wx
                        ,
                        Wy
                         are calculated. Consequently, each image gets three feature planes, named H plane, Wx
                         plane, and Wy
                         plane respectively. Then, each pixel of the feature plane is modeled with single Gaussian distribution. The mean values of feature planes μH

                        , and Wy
                         planes respectively. The procedure of background modeling is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . As a result, the background model contains three feature planes; each pixel of the feature planes is a 2-tuple vector including μ and σ, which are statistical parameters calculated from background reference images.

For each input video frame, the color invariants H, Wx
                        , Wy
                        ,are calculated to obtain H plane, Wx
                         plane, and Wy
                         plane respectively. Then, the current frame’s feature plane compares with its corresponding feature plane in the background model. Judgment is implemented in pixel level based on the pre-set rules as defined in Eqs. (15), (16) to decide whether the pixel in the current input image belongs to foreground or not. H plane is used below as an instance to illustrate the judging conditions:

(15) and (16) are the pre-set rules which set the rules that if the current feature value were different from the mean value at the corresponding position in the background model but the difference was less than the t times of standard deviations at the corresponding position in the background model, then the current pixel would be judged as the background pixel; otherwise, the current pixel would be the foreground pixel.

                         plane are given in Eqs. (17)–(20). Fig. 2

The difference fusion image achieved in the above steps is not sufficient due to the noise and incomplete region of foreground regions. Hence, some post-processing operations are required to obtain a pure background–foreground binary image. The post-processing operations are implemented in following steps:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Step a: Threshold the difference fusion image.


                        
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Step b: It is assumed that the foreground moving object is larger than any other foreground object in the thresholded image. Therefore, the largest foreground region is recognized as the foreground moving object. To this end, the areas of the foreground regions in the thresholded image F(x,
                                 y) are calculated. Then, the foreground regions whose areas are less than the largest one’s are deleted in the thresholded image F(x,
                                 y).


                                 Step c: Dilate and erode the thresholded image to make the foreground moving object complete; i.e. the region with valued zero surrounded by the pixels of valued one are then filled with ones.


                                 Step d: Use the media filter to make the silhouette of foreground moving object smooth.

After implementing the above steps, the pure background–foreground segmented image is shown in Fig. 4
                        .

@&#EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS@&#

In order to validate the proposed method and the effectiveness of color invariants, experiments are performed on two indoor surveillance video images. The first video images are acquired from the Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory at University of Missouri (CIRL). The second video images are captured from surveillance camera in normal indoor environment. The “ANLiWEi ALE-641CX” camera, which is a cheap and ordinary surveillance camera, is used to capture the videos. The size of video is 352*288.

To testify the color discriminative ability of the proposed color invariants based method, two series of experiments are conducted with the foreground moving objects having the similar color with background. Firstly, by contrast, a comparison of proposed method with other background subtraction algorithms in the same color similar situation is implemented. Then, the performance of proposed method in different color similar situations is testified.

In the first experiment, GMM algorithm [9], Codebook algorithm [10], and FCTF (Fused Color and Texture Features) algorithm [11] are chosen as the contrastive algorithms. The visual results are shown in Fig. 5
                        . In Fig. 5, the first row is the input video frames, the second row is the proposed method processed results, the third row is the FCTF algorithm processed results, the forth row is the Codebook algorithm processed results and the fifth row is the GMM algorithm processed results.

For quantitative comparison, the processed results are compared to the ground true images and the Jaccard Coefficient [21] is calculated. The ground true images are created by manual selection of foreground moving object pixels from input video frames. As defined in Eq. (24), the Jaccard Coefficient is a pixel-based performance metric which can eliminate the effect of large volume of true negatives and focus on the accuracy of true positives. Thus the higher Jaccard Coefficient one method gets, the more precise foreground moving object the method detected. Fig. 6
                         illustrates the Jaccard Coefficient comparison.
                           
                              (24)
                              
                                 JC
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       TP
                                    
                                    
                                       TP
                                       +
                                       FP
                                       +
                                       FN
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

As the visual results and the graph shown, the proposed method obtains much better performance than the other methods. For GMM algorithm, it can basically but not precisely segment foreground moving object. Furthermore, GMM is not stable in color similar situation, as shown in the last image of Fig. 5, the foreground moving object is discarded.

In the second experiment, the proposed method is performed in different color similar situations as shown in Fig. 7
                        . In Fig. 7, the odd rows are input video frames from red, green, black, and blue color similar situations respectively and the even rows are background–foreground segmented images produced by the proposed method.

From the results shown in Fig. 7, it seems that the proposed method achieves almost the same background–foreground segmentation performance for the tested color similar situations. In order to ascertain the color discriminative capability of proposed method in different color similar situations, the precision–recall curve is drawn as the criterion. The ROC curve is presented in Fig. 8
                        .

Seeing from the curves and the visual results in Fig. 7, the proposed method achieves both high precision and recall value for all tested color similar situations basically. However, the color discriminative performance varies with the colors. The proposed method performs best in blue color situation, but is unstable in green color situation.

In this section, experiments are conducted to examine the robustness of the proposed method to abrupt illumination change. Fig. 9
                         displays the situation when the indoor lights turn off then turning on at daytime in indoor environment. The first and second frames in the first row are the frames in lights off situation, while the third and fourth frames are consecutive frame after the first and second frames but in lights suddenly turned on situation. Fig. 10
                         shows consecutive frames in the situation with lights off and on in indoor environments at night.

As shown in the second row of Figs. 9 and 10, the proposed method can deal with abrupt illumination change at daytime when the light intensity changes gently. However when at night the illumination changes drastically, as showed in Fig. 10, the proposed method fails to segment the foreground moving object exactly, since the background–foreground segmentation results are disturbed by the pixels in background, especially the dark area pixels.

The indoor video images provided by CIRL are applied to testify the accuracy of the proposed method, which contain three video sequences and three sets ground true images. The image size is 640*480. Fig. 11
                         shows the input video images, ground true images, FCTF algorithm processed images, and the proposed method processed images. Table 2
                         lists the accuracy of background–foreground segmentation result of FCTF method and the proposed method.

Results in Table 2 show that both the FCTF algorithm and the proposed method have high accuracy of background–foreground segmentation for relative high-resolution images (compared with the last video images with size of 352*288). Luke et al. [11] propose the FCTF algorithm and demonstrate that the accuracy of FCTF algorithm is much better than the other existing algorithms. Therefore, from Table 2, the accuracy of the proposed method is of the state-of-art.

Besides accuracy, runtime efficiency is also one primary criterion to evaluate an method. Table 3
                         lists the comparison of the proposed method with the other algorithms. Both the time cost of background modeling and background subtraction are computed. The computer used in this experiment is Intel i3-2100 CPU, 3.10GHz, 4GB RAM, 32-bit Windows XP OS. The test video contains 82 frames with 352*288 resolutions. The first 10 frames are used to initiate the background modeling.

From the data shown in Table 3, the GMM and Codebook algorithm have high runtime efficiency, while the FCTF algorithm runs costly to achieve high accuracy. The proposed algorithm has a high accuracy while its efficiency is 10 times faster than FCTF algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, color similarly problem between foreground moving object and background is discussed from the view of color representing. The spectral information and the spatial configuration of color are integrated to describe the colors in image. Then color invariants are derived and used with a primitive background subtraction method in indoor environments to validate its color discriminative ability. After a series of experiments, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can well fulfill the background–foreground segmentation in different color similarity situations and has certain robustness to illumination change. The images tested in these experiments are all low-resolution images captured from ordinary surveillance camera. Hence, more accurate background–foreground segmentation can be achieved with high-resolution images. Furthermore, the color invariants can be employed in more optimized and complex background subtraction algorithms to realize more efficient and precise foreground detection.
