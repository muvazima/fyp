                  Background
                  Drug repositioning is the process of finding new indications for existing drugs. Its importance has been dramatically increasing recently due to the enormous increase in new drug discovery cost. However, most of the previous molecular-centered drug repositioning work is not able to reflect the end-point physiological activities of drugs because of the inherent complexity of human physiological systems.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Here, we suggest a novel computational framework to make inferences for alternative indications of marketed drugs by using electronic clinical information which reflects the end-point physiological results of drug’s effects on the biological activities of humans. In this work, we use the concept of complementarity between clinical disease signatures and clinical drug effects. With this framework, we establish disease-related clinical variable vectors (clinical disease signature vectors) and drug-related clinical variable vectors (clinical drug effect vectors) by applying two methodologies (i.e., statistical analysis and literature mining). Finally, we assign a repositioning possibility score to each disease–drug pair by the calculation of complementarity (anti-correlation) and association between clinical states (“up” or “down”) of disease signatures and clinical effects (“up”, “down” or “association”) of drugs. A total of 717 clinical variables in the electronic clinical dataset (NHANES), are considered in this study.
               
               
                  Results
                  The statistical significance of our prediction results is supported through two benchmark datasets (Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and Clinical Trials). We discovered not only lots of known relationships between diseases and drugs, but also many hidden disease–drug relationships. For example, glutathione and edetic-acid may be investigated as candidate drugs for asthma treatment. We examined prediction results by using statistical experiments (enrichment verification, hyper-geometric and permutation test P
                     <0.009 in Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and Clinical Trials) and presented evidences for those with already published literature.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The results show that electronic clinical information is a feasible data resource and utilizing the complementarity (anti-correlated relationships) between clinical signatures of disease and clinical effects of drugs is a potentially predictive concept in drug repositioning research. It makes the proposed approach useful to identity novel relationships between diseases and drugs that have a high probability of being biologically valid.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Drug repositioning is defined as the process of finding new uses outside the scope of the original medical indications for existing drugs. Its importance has been dramatically increasing recently due to the enormous increase in new drug discovery cost [1,2]. Because 90% of new drug candidates fail in early tests of safety and efficacy in de novo drug discovery, many researchers are applying repositioning strategies to discover novel therapeutics of known drugs.

Drug and target protein characteristics based on chemical structures and the properties of ligands and receptors have been used to identify new targets for existing drugs. Keiser et al. make use of chemical similarities between drugs [3]. The Keiser hypothesis was that structurally similar chemicals tend to have similar properties. In other words, similar molecules exhibit similar biological activities. Chang et al., Kinnings et al., and Zahler et al. focused on physical interactions between drugs and targets, which is called docking method [4–6]. Their methods for drug repositioning assume that a chemical would be a feasible candidate for a treatment of a disease when the chemical physically binds to the target protein of interest, which has already been reported to play an important role in development or treatment of the disease. Bleakley et al., Mei et al., and van Laarhoveb et al. take into account unified resources including chemical structures, amino-acid sequences of target proteins, and chemical–protein interaction network [7–9]. Even though these approaches can be considered as systematic and comprehensive means to find new molecular targets for existing drugs, there are some drawbacks for finding new uses of known drugs. Their primary limitation is an inconsistency between the results from these methods and clinical therapeutic effects. Additionally, in physical binding simulations between drugs and its targets, three-dimensional-structure libraries of both chemical compounds and target proteins are required. Unfortunately, 3D libraries of both chemical compounds and proteins have not been completely identified so far. Although information about 3D structure can be inferred from 2D structure, this may also introduce errors that may occur in the transformation.

Gene expression information is also widely used for drug repositioning [10–12]. Several studies have tried to identify novel uses of existing drugs by analyzing patterns of gene expression-signatures of both drug-associated and disease-associated gene sets. Although those studies have suggested computational approaches to discover new drug indications by taking experimental outcomes of molecular activity into account, there are still problems that make some improvements necessary. First is the gap of chemical responses between molecular and phenotypic levels of the entire human system. For instance, in complex physiological systems, it may be hard to represent the overall molecular responses of chemicals with only gene expression data because gene expression profiles are derived from separated-cell lines treated with each chemical. Secondly, the experimental process requires enormous time and cost to retain enough expression data to use in research.

Clinical information may provide new opportunities to directly connect chemicals to clinical therapeutic effects in complex physiological systems because clinical information not only indicates the phenotypic states of disease-conditions, but also reflects the end-physiological results of chemical impacts on human biological activity [13,14].

One of the strategies for drug repositioning with clinical information is the side-effects-based approach [15,16]. In these studies, an underlying assumption was that if many side-effects are shared between drugs having different indications, then the drugs could be repositioned.

Recently, many researchers in biomedical fields have focused on another resource of the electronic clinical data [17–19]. Electronic clinical information encompasses a variety of medical histories, such as diagnoses, prescriptions, and laboratory test results, and they are accumulated when medical services are provided to patients in medical institutions. With the rapid increase in the adoption of the electronic clinical information systems, there is now plenty of clinical data, which provides a promising opportunity to investigate hidden connections between diseases and clinical variables [20]. In addition, most doctors prescribe medicines based on the clinical status or symptoms of patients. Therefore, electronic clinical information can directly help identify alternative indications of already approved drugs.

One potential source in electronic clinical information for drug repositioning is the free text in the clinical notes that has explicit information about disease–drug relationships [21–23]. The basic idea of the study is to count the number of times that a disease and a drug co-occur in the same free text and compare that count to the number of expected co-occurrences by chance. This approach can be used easily, but it may lead to many false-positives. Moreover, it does not consider other useful structured data for drug repositioning included in the electronic clinical data, such as laboratory test and medical survey results that can capture clinical disease signatures.

Here, we suggest a systematic framework (Fig. 1
                     ) to make inferences for new uses of known drugs using the structured data in the electronic clinical information. The electronic clinical information was from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) which was provide by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in the USA [24]. We adopted the clinical-level complementarity between clinical disease signatures and drug effects. In this framework, we established clinical variable vectors for diseases and drugs by applying two methodologies (statistical analysis on electronic clinical information and literature mining on PubMed). Then, we assigned a score to each disease–drug pair based on both complementarity and association between clinical variable vectors for diseases and drugs. We validated our prediction results by making use of two independent datasets, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [25] and Clinical Trials [26]. CTD is a database containing chemical-disease, chemical-gene and gene-disease interactions manually curated from literature, and Clinical Trials is a database for clinical studies of human participants in 190 countries (http://clinicaltrials.gov/).

The statistical significance of our prediction results is supported through two benchmark datasets (enrichment verification, hyper-geometric, and permutation test P
                     <0.009 in CTD and Clinical Trials). Through our prediction results, we discovered that glutathione and edetic-acid may be investigated as candidate drugs for asthma treatment. These results show that using electronic clinical information and the concept of clinical-level complementarity can offer promising insights into drug repositioning research.

We obtained electronic clinical information from the cross-sectional epidemiological database called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). It is a major program of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and its aim is to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the USA. NHANES includes demographics, dietary habits, health-related questions, and results of laboratory tests. These datasets are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.

Drug information was retrieved from the DrugBank database [27]. Of the 6811 drug entities in the database, 1578 FDA-approved drugs, and their 22,143 synonyms were included in our research.

Literature information came from the biomedical literature resources of PubMed. We downloaded and aggregated all publicly available abstracts and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms of each published work, ranging from 1950 to 2011. We then retrieved a total of 11,563,353 PubMed abstracts and their MeSH information. Because MeSH terms indicate essential keyword annotations of the literature, we utilized MeSH information in this study.

The validation in this work used two independent datasets (CTD [25] and Clinical Trials database [26]). A total of 469,609 chemical-disease relationships manually curated from literature, and 197,234 studies that are currently under Clinical Trials were gathered from the CTD and Clinical Trials database, respectively.

We collated health questionnaire and laboratory test results in six cohorts from 1999 to 2010 in NHANES data. It contained 59,205 individual samples, 2369 clinical variables, 22 disease conditions. Each sample size of all disease-conditions in the NHANES dataset is represented in Table S1. Questionnaire information was used to stratify individual samples into disease status (“disease” or “control”). Individual samples who had been diagnosed with a certain disease-condition, defined as those answered “yes” submitted on a questionnaire survey (e.g., “Doctor told you have asthma?”), were grouped as the disease status. On the other hand, those who answered “no” for all disease-conditions, were grouped as the control. Next, to perform the statistical analysis for the identification of disease-related clinical variables (clinical disease signatures), we filtered out clinical variables in laboratory test, satisfying the following criteria.
                           
                              (1)
                              Each variable should be represented by a numerical value for statistical analysis (Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Variables should exhibit clinical meanings, for example, glucose (LBXSGL) or triglyceride (LBXSTR).

Variables should be expressed in consistent units of measure. For instance, although LBXSGL and LBDSGLIS both indicate glucose concentration, these variables are expressed in different units (mg/dL and mmol/L). In such cases, we chose only one of the variables.

After filtering out clinical variables based on criteria above, a total of 717 clinical variables were considered in this study (Table S2).

Next, the sample size of disease-conditions is a critical factor to ensure adequate power to detect statistical significance [28,29]. Hence, we considered only disease-conditions in which the number of patients diagnosed with them would be sufficient to perform statistical analysis: type 2 diabetes, myocardial ischemia, stroke, congestive heart failure and asthma. In this study, the sample size of patients diagnosed with each disease-condition was greater than 1000.

@&#METHODS@&#

We took account of the problem of inferring alternative therapeutic indications of existing drugs by making use of electronic clinical information. Our hypothesis was that a drug can have a potential therapeutic effect on a disease if there are complementary relations between the clinical disease signature vector and the clinical drug effect vector.

In this study, we integrated six cohorts (1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010) in NHANES data; with five disease-conditions and 717 clinical variables. We constructed disease signature vectors (Table 1
                        ), which contain the 717 clinical variables, for each of the five disease conditions. Each clinical variable has the relation directionality that indicates the direction of the significant value change between disease condition and healthy control. The relation directionality consists of three relation types (“up”, “down” and “no-relation”). The “up” or “down” relation type was assigned to a clinical variable, when a clinical variable had a significantly increased or decreased value over corresponding control values, and a relation type of clinical variable with no significant value change was “no-relation”. We then regarded clinical variables with “up” or “down” relation type as clinical disease signatures. A list of clinical disease signatures for each disease is represented in Table S3. The significance of value change for each clinical variable was identified using statistical analysis (Wilcoxon rank sum test). In this process, we first applied the Wilcoxon rank sum test to the integrated cohort to assign the p-value for each clinical variable. From the calculated p-value for the Wilcoxon rank sum test, we further estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) for the p-value to correct for multiple testing, using the FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) procedure in SAS [30]. Although we could get the same results by using a certain cut-off of p-value instead of using FDR, interpretations between p-value and FDR are quite different. The FDR not only has a clear, easily understandable meaning, but also give a far more accurate indication of the level of false positives for the given cut-off threshold. Therefore, we believed that FDR-based cut-off is more reasonable than p-value-based cut-off in this study [31]. Only clinical variables that satisfied the condition of FDR of less than 5% could be clinical disease signatures. Next, the relation directionality was assigned to the clinical variable by using a difference of the average rank for the clinical variable between disease and control.

In this section, the generation of a clinical drug effect vector is explained. As mentioned in the section on data sources, we collected 11,563,353 abstracts published from 1950 to 2011 from PubMed. We also retained 1578 FDA-approved drugs and 717 clinical variables from the DrugBank database and NHANES data, respectively (See Section 2). To reduce the search space in literature mining, we only used PubMed identifiers (PMIDs) containing at least one drug–clinical variable pair used in this study, resulting in 663,035 PMIDs.

Clinical drug effect vector contains the 717 clinical variables with relation directionality between drugs and clinical variables, which is same to the clinical disease signature vector. The relation directionality in the clinical drug effect vector indicates drug effects to clinical variables. For example, relation directionality is “up” if a drug increases the amount of a clinical variable, on the other hand, it is “down” if a drug decreases the amount of a clinical variable. When there is no effect between a drug and a clinical variable, relation directionality is “no-relation”.

To establish clinical drug effect vectors, we first identified drug-associated clinical variables by co-occurrence-based literature mining that was widely used to discover meaningful associations between two biological terms in simple manner [32]. The association significance (p-value) between a drug and a clinical variable in the PubMed abstracts and MeSH-information, was calculated by Fisher’s exact test. The calculated p-values were then adjusted for multiple testing by estimating the false discovery rate (FDR). Only clinical variables with FDR values lower than 5% were allowed to the next step.

For the remaining clinical variables, we determined the relation directionality (“up”, “down” and “no-relation”) of drug effects by a supervised machine learning technique, specifically, the shallow linguistic kernel suggested by 3.3 [33]. It is a good method to extract a relation between entities from biomedical literature based on shallow linguistic information, and its superior performance was already verified in various entity-pairs [34,35].

The shallow linguistic kernel is defined as the linear combination of kernels, a global context kernel (GCL) and local context kernel (LCK),

A set of features of the global context kernel can be defined by the following three patterns: Fore–Between, Between, and Between–After, which are based on the Di
                        –CVj
                         pair (drug–clinical variable) observations in the sentence. Therefore, it can be represented by a composite kernel defined for three patterns relative to the detection of relations:

The local context kernel uses information about surface (punctuation, capitalization, and numerals) and shallow linguistic (POS tag, lemma, and stem) features derived from tokens to the left and right partial sentence of the drug–clinical variable pair. Then, it can be defined as the combination of left and right proper context feature sets:

Since no corpus was available to generate the relation extraction models that classify the “up”, “down” or “no-relation” relation directionality between a drug and a clinical variable, we manually created the corpus that was specific for our research, resulting in 598 sentences annotated with 110 “up-relations”, 185 “down-relations”, and 303 “no-relations”. In this process, we first selected sentences that included three terms (drug, clinical variable and pre-defined relational keyword). The relational keywords explain the relation directionality between drugs and clinical variables, and it was obtained from relation term in RelEx [36]. In the RelEx, a list of relation terms is used to extract biological relations, such as physical or regulatory interactions between genes and proteins from free texts. Because all relation types in RelEx were not needed in this step that identifies the “up” or “down” relation directionality between drugs and clinical variables, we manually selected “up” and “down” relational keywords in accordance with our purpose. Additionally, we added synonyms and word stems to extend relational keywords using a large-scale lexical database of English, i.e., WordNet [37]. Then, we obtained 65 “up” relation keywords and 56 “down” relation keywords (Table S4), and they indicate relation between two terms. Subsequently, for the selected sentences, each relation type can be assigned by manual curation (Fig. 2
                        ).

By using the created corpus, we generated relation extraction models based on the shallow linguistic kernel for identifying the “up”, “down” and “no-relation” relation directionality between drugs and clinical variables. These models then were evaluated on the manually curated corpus using five-fold cross-validation (Fig. S1). Next, we applied the generated model to 663,035 PubMed abstracts containing at least one drug–clinical variable pair used in this study, we obtained 6845 pairs with “up” relation and 7994 pairs with “down” relation.

In the literature mining based relation extraction, there were two particular cases. In the first case, conflicted relation directionality between a drug and a clinical variable might be observed in more than two sentences, although the drug and the clinical variable were the same. For example, in the case of vidarabine (drug) – lymphocyte (clinical variable) pair, the relation directionality was extracted as “up” relation in three sentences, and “down” relation in four sentences. In a case of conflicting result, the relation directionality between them can be determined in accordance with high rates of the “up” relation and “down” relation. In other words, we assigned the relation directionality to the drug–clinical variable pair when the percentage of either “up” or “down” relation directionality with respect to the drug–clinical variable pair was over 70%, otherwise, the relation directionality was “no-relation”. After this step, we finally obtained 1081 pairs with “up” relation and 2965 pairs with “down” relation.

In the second case, we could not extract the relation directionality between drug and clinical variable because there was no relational keyword between them in a sentence. It would cause information loss if we ignore significant drug–clinical variable pairs (FDR<5% by Fisher’s exact test) in the co-occurrence-based literature mining. Therefore, we assigned the relation directionality of these significant drug–clinical variable pairs as “association” in the clinical drug effect vector. Finally, taken together, the relation directionality in the clinical drug effect vector contains four relation types such as “up”, “down”, “association” and “no-relation”.

For each disease–drug pair, we calculated a score that indicated the potential therapeutic effect of the existing drug on a particular disease. Our underlying hypothesis was that a drug can be repositioned on the disease-of-interest if there are complementary relations between the clinical disease signature vectors and clinical drug effect vectors. Therefore, to obtain scores for disease–drug pairs, we took into account complementarity with respect to the relation directionality of clinical variables between a certain disease and a drug of interest. Additionally, for significant drug–clinical variable pairs with “association” relation directionality (See Section 3.3), we also considered the association of clinical variables between a disease and a drug. Thus, our scoring function for a disease–drug pair reflected the two conditions above and is represented by:

                         are the “complementarity” and “association” scores between the clinical disease signature vector and the clinical drug effect vector, respectively. The value of C is estimated by counting the number of clinical variables having a complementary relation between a disease and a drug. It can be calculated when the clinical variable has “up” or “down” relation directionality in both clinical disease signature and drug effect vector. In calculating A, the score of A is calculated by counting the number of clinical variables that are with “up” or “down” relation directionality in the clinical disease signature vector and “association” relation directionality in the clinical drug effect vector.

                        ’ is a relative weighting factor between the complementarity and association score. In this study, we set the weighting factor as ‘0.7’ because it achieved the best performance among the candidate weighting factors to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 (Fig. S2). Fig. 3
                         illustrates an example of the scoring function.

In this section, we explain the procedures for constructing gold-standard datasets. The gold-standard dataset of disease–drug relationships was generated from two independent validation datasets: the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) by the Mount Desert Island Biological Lab in USA [25] and the Clinical Trials [26] database, which comprises the results of clinical studies conducted with human participants around the world. As a first step to constructing a gold-standard dataset, we mapped chemical IDs in the CTD to DrugBank IDs, resulting in 1042 mapped drugs out of 1578 FDA-approved drugs in the DrugBank. We then extracted relationships between these 1042 mapped drugs and the five diseases used in this analysis from the CTD. In this step, we only considered curated annotations with direct evidence set to “therapeutic”. Consequently, we constructed the gold-standard dataset, which included 358 between relationships 1042 mapped drugs, and five diseases. Additionally, we obtained all disease–drug relationships that were found to be either completed or undergoing Clinical Trials from the official website of Clinical Trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). We subsequently mapped drug names to the DrugBank identifiers, resulting in 59,495 unique disease–drug relationships that are undergoing Clinical Trials. Of these relationships, 447 relationships contained the diseases and drugs that were considered in our study.

Validation of the predictions was performed for each five disease case that had an enough sample size for a statistical test because sample size influences prediction performance (Fig. S3).

To check whether our drug repositioning scores are valid or not, we performed the fold-enrichment (FE) test for five disease conditions by using known disease–drug relationships from the gold-standard datasets (CTD and Clinical Trials). It allows us to evaluate the correlation between the score of a disease–drug pair and the likelihood that a disease–drug relationship occurs. In the FE test, all disease–drug pairs were ranked by the score and binned into groups of 50 disease–drug pairs and Fold-Enrichment (FE) score was defined as:

                        where M, N are the number of all mapped drugs (1042) and the number of drugs in response to each disease condition in the gold-standard dataset, respectively. The number of drugs involved in the gold-standard datasets within the group is n, and the number of total drugs in the groups is m. In this study, we defined m as 50. If our scoring function is reasonable, The FE score of a group having high average disease–drug scores is higher than the group with low average disease–drug scores. As shown in the Fig. S4, there was a highly significant correlation between the average disease–drug scores and FE scores.

Although the FE test is an indirect measure to capture the correlation between disease–drug scores and therapeutic effects, it may be reasonable for the disease–drug score to indicate the drug’s potential to be a treatment for a certain disease. We also explored the relative separation between verified and unverified disease–drug relationships in the score distribution. By this way, we benchmarked our predictions against known disease–drug relationships derived from each validation dataset (CTD and Clinical Trials). As shown in Fig. 4
                        , disease–drug relationships verified in the validation datasets have higher scores than other unverified disease–drug relationships.

In addition to that, the quantitative performance of the proposed method was examined for each disease condition, and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve was used for assessment (Fig. S5).

To prune predicted relationships between diseases and drugs, we generated a set of putative drug candidates in which only significant (p
                        <0.05) drug candidates were considered to reduce false discoveries (Table S5). We measured the significance (p-value) of disease–drug scores by creating a background distribution of disease–drug scores calculated by randomly choosing the relation directionality of clinical variables in clinical disease signature vectors and clinical drug effect vectors. This task was repeated 10,000 times. Then, lists of candidate drugs with respect to each disease-condition were generated, and all drugs in each list were ranked by the inferred score. We then checked whether inferred disease–drug relationships with significant scores statistically overlapped disease–drug relationships in verified validation datasets using a hyper-geometric test. For every disease-condition, we found that coverage of two validation datasets in our significant prediction results was markedly high (Table 2
                        ).

Additionally, we carried out a permutation test to verify that the relationships between diseases and drugs found by our method are more significant than randomly selected relationships. The statistical significance (p-value) of each disease–drug relationship in the permutation test was estimated by counting how many of the matched disease–drug relationships verified in validation datasets by randomly selected relationships (repeatedly generated 100,000 times) were larger than or equal to those predicted by our method [38]. The test results were also statistically significant for all disease-conditions (Table 2). Table 2 contains the results of two significant tests for novel predictions. It shows that our model predicted more meaningful disease–drug relationships than those expected by chance.

In this section, we analyzed disease–drug relationships with high scores to verify whether high-scored disease–drug relationships are truly meaningful or not. We carefully examined associations between diseases and drugs by making use of clinical variables and its relation directionality shared in clinical disease signature and clinical drug effect vectors. Table 3
                         presents three drug candidates, except for already known treatments to target diseases, which are likely to be treatments for each disease-condition. For each disease-condition, we selected the three drugs that have reliable literature evidences, and were ranked in less than 15th. Information about the relation directionality between drugs and clinical variable are represented in Table S3, and a list of all drug candidates containing already known drugs to target diseases is supported in Table S5. Additionally, the information about primary indications corresponding to candidate drugs is provided in Table S6.

An interesting finding is that several drugs (glutathione and edetic-acid) related to anti-oxidants were identified as possible treatments for asthma. One possible explanation is that oxidative stress from the altered glutathione redox status may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and modulation of asthma [39,40]. Fitzpatrick et al. insisted that glutathione may provide positive therapeutic opportunities for treating asthma patients whose airway glutathione reserves are depleted [39]. Surprisingly, it is analogous to the therapeutic effect (anti-inflammatory) of zinc (DB01593) that is already known as a treatment for asthma [41]. Generally, the anti-oxidants tends to have a natural anti-inflammatory action without side-effects [42]. Additionally, in the clinical disease signatures for asthma (see Table S3), the relation directionality of cobalt (URXUCO) was identified as “up”. According to Pratviel et al., the presence of cobalt in the human body can significantly raise the level of the oxidative stress by the redox cycle catalyzing production of reactive radicals and reactive oxygen species [43]. In the case of lithium (DB001356), it had “down” of relation directionality with respect to cobalt in the clinical drug effect vector. Moreover, lithium had a negative effect to the level of barium (URXUBA). It may reduce the contraction of smooth muscle in the airway [44], which is one of the typical symptoms for asthma [45]. It seems possible that lithium may be a candidate treatment for asthma.

We also found that penicillamine (DB00859) may be a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Penicillamine is used for a treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as a form of immunosuppression [46]. Several studies reported that penicillamine can maintain the concentration of insulin by producing autoantibodies to the insulin, called insulin antibody reaction [47,48]. Although it may be induce a side-effect (hypoglycemia) on non-T2D patients, it is possible that the penicillamine may be used for a treatment for T2D by preventing the insulin clearance [48]. In addition to that, patients with T2D had significantly higher level of albumin (URXUMA) compared to healthy individuals [49]. It is consistent to the clinical disease signatures for T2D by our method (see Table S3). According to Alp et al., this result may be explained by the fact that albumin is significantly associated with the insulin-inhibitory activity. In the clinical drug effect vector, penicillamine had “down” of relation directionality for albumin. Interestingly, the relation directionality of albumin in telmisartan (DB00966) that is already used to treat type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity is also “down” [50]. Therefore, it is likely to be an evidence for a new use of the penicillamine in T2D.

Other interesting finding is that creatine (DB00148) may be used for a candidate treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). A possible explanation for this might be that creatine have an effect to increase the red blood cells (RBC or hematocrit) [51] and this result is in line with those of the clinical drug effect vector. Generally, patients with CHF may have a related problem of anemia. A decrease in the hematocrit may cause the anemia by limiting the amount of oxygen being carried to the body, which makes the heart work harder [52]. A low level of hematocrit (LBXHCT) was also detected in the clinical disease signatures for CHF as mentioned in the previous work, and Karolczak et al. reported that one drug of existing treatments of CHF (aspirin, DB00945) decrease the level of hematocrit [53]. These factors may explain that creatine may mitigate congestive heart failure.

In the case of myocardial ischemia, ischemic-reperfusion injury is a primary symptom. The propensity to injure the myocardium stems from the major responses of myocardium to proinflammatory mediator. It can lead to a redirection of the normal inflammatory response that neutralizes host invaders to one that attacks the host tissues [54]. In this process, neutrophils (LBXNEPCT) plays a role to attack host tissues [55]. Therefore, altering the activation of neutrophils is one of the pharmacological therapies in myocardial ischemia. It is consistent with an effect of original treatment (irbesartan, DB01029) for myocardial ischemia, which reduce the number of neutrophils in the body [56]. Acetylcysteine (known as N-acetylcysteine or NAC, DB06151) is a major mucolytic agent mitigating symptoms for a variety of pulmonary diseases [57]. In our results, each relation directionality of neutrophils for the disease (myocardial ischemia) and the drug (NAC) was identified as “up” and “down”, respectively. Moreover, Sochman et al. also reported that NAC has an effect to inhibit neutrophils [58]. It is possible, therefore, that NAC may be used for the ischemic-reperfusion injury mediator.

Cyclosporine-A (DB00091) is known as the treatment of transplant rejection and rheumatoid arthritis. According to Osman et al., Cyclosporine-A can act as a neuroprotective agent against stroke and possesses neuroprotective properties through its ability to block the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), which in turn inhibits neuronal damage [59]. It is a same role of an existing drugs to treat stroke (hydrocortisone, DB00741) that is also acting as the neuroprotective agent [60]. In the clinical disease signatures for stroke, (see Table S3), the relation directionality of eosinophils (LBXEOPCT) was assigned as “up”. This results were supported by previous studies that considered the high level of eosinophils (called eosinophilia) as the cause of stroke [61,62]. In the clinical drug effect vector, Cyclosporine-A had a negative effect on eosinophils (“down”). It is consistent to results of published papers that explained the inhibitory effect of Cyclosporine-A on eosinophils [63,64]. Therefore, it seems possible to be repositioned as a treatment for stroke.

This analysis based on clinical variables may provide opportunities for discovering new therapeutic candidates of existing drugs on the phenotypic level. Particularly, in this analysis, we comprehensively considered 717 clinical variables from electronic clinical information (NHANES) that characterized the diseases and drugs. With a set of clinical variables and its relation directionality, it may allow phenotypic-level interpretations for indirect relationships between diseases and drugs.

Furthermore, except for already known treatments for target diseases, we could realize that most drug candidates are structurally dissimilar to other approved-drugs known as treatments for five diseases (low Tanimoto-coefficient). It is noteworthy that the inferred drug candidates shown in Table 3 would not have been predicted as new treatments for target diseases by the previous chemical structure-based approach. Hence, these example shows that electronic clinical information used in the proposed method functions as feasible and effective data resources for drug repositioning research.

In our ongoing research, developing a computational framework to identify new drug indications using the complementarity between clinical disease signatures and drug effects, may provide biomedical researchers with new insights. However, to archive further improvements, there are some issues to be addressed.

A first limitation of the proposed method is the number of disease-conditions considered in our research. In general statistical analysis, a large sample size should be used to achieve better statistical power to detect important and precise effects or associations. Our results show a positive correlation between sample size and prediction performance (Fig. S3). For this reason, we considered five disease-conditions for which include more than 1000 samples were available, although the NHANES dataset contains information pertaining to other disease-conditions. The NHANES program examines about 5000 persons per year to check their health and nutritional status. This means that the number of patients diagnosed with a certain disease is insufficient compared to EHRs in hospitals. Therefore, we expect that the sample size problem seems likely to be resolved by using plenty of clinical data provided by hospitals.

A second limitation is using the literature mining technique to link drugs and clinical variables. A common drawback of all literature mining-based approaches is that the information to be extracted is dependent on the amount of biomedical studies focused on something of our interests. For example, more biomedical knowledge is available in well studied drugs than those in poorly studied drugs in the PubMed abstracts. One of the solutions to overcome this problem is extracting significant clinical variables and its relation directionalities corresponding to drugs being evaluated from the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provided by hospitals. Unfortunately, those have been restricted to outsiders due to privacy issues, and were not included in the publically available electronic clinical information, such as NHANES, Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) [65]. For this reason, in our current study, such information about drugs was identified by literature mining, even though it might contain the information loss with respect to less studied drugs. However, it also seems likely to be addressed by collaborating care-providing institutions.

The other limitation is differences between electronic clinical information (NHANES or KoGES) and EHRs. Although electronic clinical information is technically an electronic record of patient health features, typically EHRs refer to operational clinical records data from a care providing institution. To apply the EHRs to proposed method, several points should be considered. In EHRs, since laboratory tests for patients are not performed continuously, (i) clinical values for patients may be incomplete and biased, and (ii) it may be hard to identify pure health controls. Therefore, the suggested method needs some modifications to be adapted to EHRs, e.g., suitable data transform and missing value imputation techniques to address the first consideration, and using records in health medical examinations for healthy people to cope with the second consideration. Based on the considerations and modifications above, we will adapt our method to the de-identified EHR such as MIMIC-II [66]. It may allow us to analyze various disease-conditions that are not handled due to small sample sizes in this study.

Furthermore, to improve the performance of our method, we need to combine clinical information with various data resources including structural information about drugs, target-proteins, side-effects information, and molecular activities. Particularly, In the case of cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tried to provide not only clinical variables but also molecular profiles (DNA, RNA and Epigenetics) of cancer patients [67]. It would be an interesting further study to investigate relationships between diseases and drugs by making use of multiple data resources.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we established a computational framework to predict novel applications of existing drugs using electronic clinical information which reflects the end-point physiological results of drug impacts on the biological activities of humans. In this study, we adopted the concept of complementarity between clinical disease signatures and clinical drug effects. Using the suggested computational framework, we calculated a score for each disease–drug relationship, indicating the repositioning potential of the respective drug toward the target disease. We showed the feasibility of our proposed framework through statistical experiments (enrichment verification, hyper-geometric, and permutation test). It makes the suggested method useful to extract novel relationships between diseases and drugs that have a high probability of being biologically valid.
