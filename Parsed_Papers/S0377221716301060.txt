                  Previous work has studied the classical joint economic lot size model as an adverse selection problem with asymmetric cost information. Solving this problem is challenging due to the presence of countervailing incentives and two-dimensional information asymmetry, under which the classical single-crossing condition does not need to hold. In the present work we advance the existing knowledge about the problem on hand by conducting its optimality analysis, which leads to a better informed and an easier problem solution: First, we refine the existing closed-form solution, which simplifies problem solving and its analysis. Second, we prove that Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are necessary for optimality, and demonstrate that the problem may, in general, possess non-optimal stationary points due to non-convexity. Third, we prove that certain types of stationary points are always dominated, which eases the analytical solution of the problem. Fourth, we derive a simple optimality condition stating that a weak Pareto efficiency of the buyer’s possible cost structures implies optimality of any stationary point. It simplifies the analytical solution approach and ensures a successful solution of the problem by means of conventional numerical techniques, e.g. with a general-purpose solver. We further establish properties of optimal solutions and indicate how these are related with the classical results on adverse selection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Banerjee’s joint economic lot size model (Banerjee, 1986) refers to a bilateral monopoly consisting of a single buyer operating in an EOQ setting and a single supplier who manufactures and ships to order. If the buyer’s economic order quantity (EOQ) and the supplier’s economic lot size (ELS) do not coincide then the parties should negotiate the lot size to be adopted for repetitive ordering, manufacturing and shipment of the product within this supply chain. As long as the buyer (referred to as he) has decision authority with regard to the order size, he will insist on his EOQ. The supplier (she) can still do better by offering the buyer a side payment as a reward for deviating from his EOQ to the system-optimal joint economic lot size (JELS), and thus realize a Pareto improvement. The JELS model has received a considerable attention in the literature as a conventional model of supply chain coordination and has further been extended to a number of more general settings (Ben-Daya, Darwish, & Ertogral, 2008; Glock, 2012; Liu & Çetinkaya, 2007; Pibernik, Zhang, Kerschbaum, & Schröpfer, 2011; Sucky, 2004, 2006).

In particular, Sucky (2004, 2006) studied a setting in which the buyer is privately informed of his cost structure and can therefore abuse this information asymmetry by untruthful reporting of cost data, and thus induce favorable terms of contract with the supplier. To counteract, the supplier can proactively design a menu of offers, each comprising a particular lot size and a side payment, for presenting to the buyer. Determining such a menu of offers that would minimize the supplier’s own expected costs constitutes her bargaining problem. It has been modeled and solved in Sucky (2004, 2006) as a principal–agent problem in adverse selection form (Laffont & Martimort, 2002).

Sucky’s work thus studies a conventional supply chain coordination model by Banerjee in a more general and a more realistic setting, and parallels much of the supply chain research that addresses information asymmetry in various settings (see e.g. Cachon & Zhang, 2006; Lau, Lau, & Zhou, 2006; Liu & Cetinkaya, 2009; Wang, Lau, & Lau, 2009; Yang, Aydin, Babich, & Beil, 2009; Voigt & Inderfurth, 2011; Ha, 2001; Burnetas, Gilbert, & Smith, 2007; Lutze & Özer, 2008; Corbett & de Groote, 2000). At the same time, it has a distinctive feature of assuming information asymmetry to be two-dimensional, i.e. with respect to holding and fixed ordering costs of the buyer. As a result, the bargaining problem in Sucky (2004, 2006) gives rise to a non-linear optimization problem whose solution poses certain challenges. In particular, as the problem proves to be non-convex, its stationary points do not need to be optimal. Consequently, the analytical solution as in Sucky (2004, 2006) requires, in general, to determine and evaluate all stationary points of the problem, whereas attempting to solve it numerically may result in a convergence to a non-optimal solution.

These particular model properties have not, however, received attention in the follow-up research. Due to the significance of the JELS model, we believe that they deserve a closer investigation. Therefore, the present work intends to advance our knowledge of the bargaining problem under consideration and offer a better informed and an easier problem solution. Specifically, in Sucky (2004, 2006), a detailed analysis has been conducted for the setting in which two possible cost structures are assumed for the buyer. In the present work we (i) propose a refinement of the original closed-form solution, which simplifies problem solving and its analysis; (ii) demonstrate that the problem on hand may possess non-optimal stationary points due to non-convexity; (iii) prove that certain types of stationary points are always dominated; (iv) establish an easily perceivable sufficient optimality condition, under which any stationary point of the problem proves to be its optimal solution — despite of non-convexity of the problem. Result (iii), in particular, eases the analytical solution of the problem by allowing to restrict attention only to specific types of stationary points. Result (iv), in turn, ensures a successful solution of the problem by means of conventional numerical techniques, e.g. with a general-purpose solver, when the said condition holds true, and also simplifies the analytical solution approach. We further establish properties of optimal solutions and indicate how these are related with the classical results on adverse selection.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of adverse selection problems. In Section 3 we introduce the problem setting, describe the solution approach as per (Sucky, 2004, 2006) and present a refined closed-form solution. In Section 4 we discuss the non-convexity of the problem on hand, identify solution properties and relate them with the classical results on adverse selection. In Section 5 we establish a sufficient condition for optimality of a stationary point. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.

The principal–agent problem in adverse selection form has received an extensive treatment in the information economics literature and found a broad range of applications in diverse areas (Rochet & Stole, 2003; van Ackere, 1993). In its typical setup (Laffont & Martimort, 2002), a principal sets out to contract an agent to produce some quantity of a certain good. The parties need to settle on the contract terms (x, z), where x is the quantity to be produced and z is the payment to the agent. The principal’s valuation of the quantity x is S(x). The agent’s production costs are C(θ, x), where θ ∈ Θ is the agent type that is privately known by the agent; the principal has only knowledge of the probability distribution Ω over Θ.

The principal has all of the bargaining power. The principal’s problem is to design and announce a mechanism (M, g(m)) with a message space M and allocation rule g: m↦(x, z) that establishes the contract terms depending on the message m ∈ M to be received from the agent. The objective of mechanism design is maximization of the principal’s own expected utility

                     . By the revelation principle (Myerson, 1979, 1982), the principal can restrict attention to truthful direct revelation mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms with

                      such that the agent weakly prefers revealing his true type to revealing any other type in the message m.

                           (i)
                           
                              C(θ, x) is convex in x, for each θ ∈ Θ, and S(x) is concave.

Information asymmetry is one-dimensional, so that agent type is represented by a scalar θ.

The single-crossing condition is satisfied: Cx
                              (θ, x) is strictly increasing in θ, for each x.

                                    Cx
                                     and Cxx
                                     respectively designate the 1st and 2nd order partial derivatives of C with respect to x.
                              
                           


                              C(θ, x) is strictly increasing in θ and Cxx
                              (θ, x) is non-decreasing in θ, for each x.

Note that assumption (ii) allows to normalize all reservation utilities to zero, whereas assumption (iii) implies, without loss of generality, a strict order θ
                     1 < ⋅⋅⋅ < θn
                      of the agent types. Assumption (iv) states that indifference curves of any two agent types on the (x, z)-plane cross at most once.

                        See in this regard e.g. Laffont and Martimort (2002) as well as Kreps (1990, Chapter 17). More generally, the single-crossing condition requires Cx
                           ( · , x) to be either strictly increasing for each x or strictly decreasing for each x.

                      it can then be shown that constraints (IR2) and (IC12) bind at the optimum, while (IR1) and (IC21) do not, by virtue of assumptions (iv), (v) and monotonicity of the principal’s utility in z. Eliminating variables z
                     1, z
                     2 via binding constraints gives a concave function in (

                     2 is distorted downwards from the first-best.

These insights carry over to the case of n > 2 as follows (Laffont & Martimort, 2002; Maskin & Riley, 1984): the individual rationality constraint (IR

                     ) of the highest agent type and the local upward incentive compatibility constraints (IC

                      being strictly increasing in i (see e.g. Laffont & Martimort, 2002).

When Ω is a continuous probability distribution, it is being typically assumed that 
                        
                           Θ
                           =
                           [
                           
                              θ
                              ̲
                           
                           ,
                           
                              θ
                              ¯
                           
                           ]
                        
                      (see Hellwig, 2010, for a mixed distribution of agent types). The problem is accordingly to determine an incentive-feasible schedule (x(θ), z(θ)) that maximizes the principal’s expected utility. Problem (
                        
                           O
                        
                     ), (IR
                           i
                        
                     )–(IC
                           ij
                        
                     ) is then straightforward to adjust. Several solution approaches, featuring variational and control-theoretic methods, exist (see Rochet & Stole, 2003; Laffont & Martimort, 2002). The analysis of the problem and its solution leads under assumptions (i)–(v) to similar insights as in the discrete case indicated above.

Problem solution becomes, however, more involved when one or more of the assumptions (i)–(v) are violated. In the discrete case, this may require to use direct nonlinear programming methods (Bazaraa, Sherali, & Shetty, 2006) or to resort to advanced numerical techniques (see e.g. Cecchini, Ecker, Kupferschmid, & Leitch, 2013). In the continuous case, the analysis may turn out to be intractable (Laffont & Martimort, 2002). Research work has particularly addressed study settings in which one of assumptions (ii)–(iv) does not hold. Regarding (ii), Kerschbamer and Maderner (1998) and Jullien (2000) studied the problem in the discrete and continuous-type settings, respectively, assuming that reservation utility depends on the agent type — what leads to countervailing incentives and may result in a different solution structure compared to the above classical results. Regarding (iii), Rochet and Stole (2003) point out that most of the studies assume the information asymmetry to be one-dimensional, while the agent’s hidden characteristics are in many settings inherently multi-dimensional. This may render a natural ordering of the buyer types impossible and the problem solution more involved (see also Schottmüller, 2015). Rochet and Stole (2003) and Rochet and Choné (1998) present in this regard solution methods for discrete and continuous-type settings that allow both for multi-dimensional private information and multiple goods. Their insights indicate that bunching is characteristic for multi-dimensional settings. McAfee and McMillan (1988) propose a generalized single-crossing condition for multi-dimensional multi-product settings, while Figalli, Kim, and McCann (2011) study conditions under which a continuous-type setting leads to a convex program. Regarding (iv), Schottmüller (2015) points out that, although the multi-dimensional agent types can always be enumerated and ordered in some way in a discrete-type setting, the single-crossing property is unlikely to hold. He also indicates other reasons, for which the agent utility may naturally violate the single-crossing condition, even if his hidden information is intrinsically one-dimensional. As a consequence, it is not sufficient to take only local incentive compatibility constraints into account when solving the problem. Araujo and Moreira (2010) and Schottmüller (2015) characterize optimal solutions in a continuous-type setting when the single-crossing condition is violated at most once and show how the optimal solution structure can differ from the classical result. In the next section we turn to discussing the JELS problem with asymmetric information as an adverse selection problem. In Section 4 we will then establish properties of its optimal solutions.

Consider a supply chain with a single supplier and a single buyer (Fig. 1). The buyer faces a deterministic constant demand for a particular product over an infinite horizon and meets the demand from stock that he replenishes by repetitively re-ordering the product from the supplier. Upon receiving the buyer’s order, the supplier sets up a production batch, manufactures the order, and ships it to the buyer. Thus, the buyer’s order size represents, at the same time, the supplier’s manufacturing lot size, as per lot-for-lot assumption (Banerjee, 1986).

The supplier aims to negotiate the order size with the buyer, while knowing the buyer’s cost structure only probabilistically. Following Sucky (2006), the problem data is comprised on the buyer side (referred to as A) of:

Assuming that the supplier has all of the bargaining power in this supply chain, while the buyer has the decision authority with regard to choosing the order size, the supplier’s bargaining problem can thus be stated as an adverse selection problem with the supplier acting as the uninformed principal and the buyer as the privately informed agent.

                     Note that the above problem is stated in terms of the firms’ disutilities, with (2)–(3) representing the individual rationality constraints, and (4)–(5) — the incentive-compatibility constraints.

Problem (1)–(6) obviously complies with assumption (i) of Section 2 due to strict convexity of the firms’ cost functions. However, assumption (ii) does not hold in general because reservation utilities in (2)–(3) are type-dependent. Further, assumption (iii) is violated as well, since the buyer’s private information is two-dimensional. We shall distinguish in this regard between two cases:

Case (a) leads to violation of assumption (iv).

                        We are thankful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing our attention to this.
                      Indeed, in this case, the cost curves of the buyer types are situated one above the other, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (left). The graph on the right shows that indifference curves can, as a consequence, cross twice, which implies that the two buyer types cannot be discriminated by their marginal rate of substitution between order size and payment. Further, this case proves to satisfy assumption (v). Indeed, the buyer types can naturally be arranged in the order of increasing cost Bi
                     , under which assumption (v) holds. Thus, we can distinguish in case (a) between more and less efficient buyer types, but cannot do so ”at the margin”.

On the contrary, case (b) satisfies assumption (iv) but partly violates assumption (v). Fig. 3
                      illustrates this. It is straightforward to verify that the cost curves of the buyer types cross in this case at most once, and so do any two indifference curves. The single-crossing condition of assumption (iv) is therefore satisfied. Regarding assumption (v), observe that the costs

                        Regarding assumption (iv), note that

                                    )
                                 
                              
                            is then strictly decreasing in i. See in this regard footnote 2.
                      To summarize, we cannot consistently distinguish in case (b) between the more and less efficient buyer types, but can do so “at the margin”.

Thus, problem (1)–(6) in general violates assumptions (ii), (iii) and either assumption (iv) or (partly) assumption (v). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works has studied adverse selection problems with these properties in their generality. As the classical solution approach outlined in Section 2 cannot be used, we follow Sucky (2006) in solving problem (1)–(6) in its general form by means of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions (Bazaraa et al., 2006).

KKT conditions and problem constraints (2)–(5) jointly comprise a system of equations and inequalities (A.1)–(A.8) given in Appendix A. A set of offers that satisfies (A.1)–(A.8) for some nonnegative values of Lagrange multipliers λ
                     1, λ
                     2, μ
                     1, μ
                     2 is called a KKT solution of problem (1)–(6), or its stationary point. By distinguishing between a zero and a positive value to be taken on by each of the four Lagrange multipliers, one obtains 
                        
                           
                              2
                              4
                           
                           =
                           16
                        
                      distinct cases, of which only eight prove to be feasible (Sucky, 2006, p. 531). Solving system (A.1)–(A.8) analytically in its general form leads therefore to eight generic types of KKT solutions.

We collate all types of KKT solutions from 1 to 8 in Table 1
                     . Note that each type is represented by a closed-form expression of one or more candidate sets of offers as well as associated feasibility and necessary optimality conditions. If a candidate set of offers satisfies the respective conditions then, by construction, it qualifies as a KKT solution of problem (1)–(6). We refer the reader to Sucky (2006, Section 5.2) for derivation of KKT solutions of types 1 to 6.

In the present work, we contribute to these results by:

                        
                           (1)
                           refining KKT solutions of types 4–6;

deriving KKT solutions of types 7–8.

We provide specific details in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively. These results simplify problem solution and ease its analysis that we conduct below.

In the next section we turn to studying the properties of KKT solutions for the purpose of determining optimal solutions of the problem. To simplify the subsequent exposition, we will use the notation JELS
                        i
                      to refer to the joint economic lot size associated with the buyer’s cost structure no. i. By definition, this is the order size that minimizes the total costs

As indicated in Section 3, Table 1 collates all types of KKT solutions from 1 to 8. The indicated sets of offers represent candidate solutions; they qualify as KKT solutions if they satisfy the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions. We should stress at this point that a KKT solution still does not need to represent an optimal solution to problem (1)–(6) because the problem proves to be non-convex — despite of convexity of the functions involved. Indeed, by rewriting the problem in a standard form

                      illustrates a situation in which four sets of offers (of types 3, 4 and 7) satisfy the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions and therefore qualify as KKT solutions. Only one of these solutions is optimal.

This example shows that KKT conditions indeed do not need to be sufficient for optimality. Nonetheless, there holds the following

                        Proposition 1
                        
                           KKT conditions

                              (A.8)
                            
                           are necessary for local (and hence global) optimality.

                     Proposition 1 implies that optimal solutions of problem (1)–(6) are captured by those sets of offers of types 1–8 that satisfy the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions, as given in Table 1. Thus in general, all of these sets of offers need to be checked against their feasibility and necessary optimality conditions in order to detect KKT solutions of the given problem instance, and then objective function (8) has to be evaluated at each KKT solution to determine an optimal one. Note that in the example given in Table 2, picking just the first set of offers on the list that satisfies the feasibility and necessary optimality conditions (i.e., set of offers of type 3) would have led to a non-optimal decision represented by a KKT solution with the worst objective value.

The following result shows that the search for optimal solutions can nevertheless be restricted to certain types of KKT solutions only, because any other KKT solution is guaranteed to be sub-optimal. To be specific, observe that Table 1 contains expressions of 15 candidate solutions to problem (1)–(6) that are divided into eight types. We can index all candidate solutions as

We can for this reason disregard candidate solutions 6a–d, 7b, 8b when determining optimal solutions, and restrict our attention only to those contained in S
                     *. Taking into account Observation 1 in Appendix C, the above result can further be strengthened as follows.

                        Corollary 2
                        
                           A problem instance with JELS1 ≠ JELS2 
                           has all its optimal solutions among candidate solutions of types 1–5.
                        


                     Proposition 2 and Corollaries 1–2 lead us to establishing the following properties of optimal sets of offers.

                        
                           1.
                           By Proposition 2, at least one of the order sizes in the menu is first-best, being represented by the respective joint economic lot size. Thus, there is no distortion from the first-best for at least one of the buyer types. This is in line with the classical result discussed in Section 2.

When JELS1 ≠ JELS2, i.e. when the first-best quantities depend on the buyer type, Corollary 2 implies that there are five generic types of optimal menus. These five generic types can be described as follows: type 1 — first-best quantities, both individual rationality (IR) constraints bind, while the incentive compatibility (IC) constraints do not; types 2 and 3 — one IR constraint and one IC constraint bind; types 4 and 5 — both IR constraints and one IC constraint bind. This result is in line with the existence of five possible menu types derived by Kerschbamer and Maderner (1998) for the adverse selection problem with countervailing incentives under more restrictive assumptions (among which is a strict monotonicity of utility functions in quantity, and the single-crossing condition). Our result thus generalizes theirs.

Further, when JELS1 ≠ JELS2, bunching does not occur. This follows from the expressions of the menus of types 1–5 in Table 1. Indeed, it is immediately seen that the order sizes in the menu of type 1 cannot coincide; the same can be easily derived from the expressions of order sizes in the menus of types 2 and 3. The same conclusion can be derived for the menus of types 4 and 5 from their necessary optimality conditions. This generalizes the result of Kerschbamer and Maderner (1998) as well.

                               we have that the first-best quantity is the same for both buyer types. Further, it follows from the definition of joint economic lot sizes in (7) that the cost structures of the buyer types must strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense. Pareto-dominance enables candidate solutions of type 7 and 8, that are undefined otherwise. When

                               either menu 7a or menu 8a proves to be a KKT solution (see Table 1). Furthermore, menu 7a (resp. 8a) coincides with the menu of type 3 (resp. 2) when the latter is defined, and supplants it otherwise (see Appendix F). Hence, the conclusion about five generic menu types sustains in this case as well.

                               we have a possibility of bunching. Bunching occurs namely when a KKT solution of type 7a or 8a proves to be optimal. This possibility represents a marked contrast to the classical result of Section 2 and the results of Kerschbamer and Maderner (1998). We elaborate in Proposition 3 below on the conditions under which bunching takes place.

To summarize, the following holds true: in an optimal set of offers, there is no distortion for at least one buyer type; there exist five generic types of optimal menus; bunching can only occur when the first-best quantities coincide. The following proposition gives precise conditions for the occurrence of bunching. To simplify the subsequent exposition, let

                     . Note that in either case, the supplier’s cost reduction more than offsets the side payment; it is also known that her respective net benefit is biggest when the buyer type i (

                        i
                      and receives the minimum required compensation. In the presence of two buyer types, the supplier prepares a menu of two respective offers; given that 
                        
                           
                              JELS

                           ,
                        
                      both offers contain an identical order size. Thus regardless of the buyer’s true cost structure, he will obviously pick the offer with the bigger side payment. Hence the supplier can equivalently design a menu of two identical offers that both feature the bigger of the two possible compensations 
                        
                           z

                              ,

                      (what is equivalent to satisfying the incentive compatibility constraints (4)–(5)). As a result, the buyer type requiring actually a lower compensation (buyer type 1 in Fig. 4) is going to be overpaid, and this happens with probability ω
                     1. Proposition 3 states that if this probability is not too high — specifically, not above the threshold H
                     2/H
                     1 — then it will be optimal for the supplier to adopt the set of offers in question (menu 7a in the given example), which entails bunching. Otherwise, if ω
                     1 exceeds the threshold, it is optimal for the supplier to hedge by adopting a different set of offers (one of type 4) — that intends the joint economic lot size for the buyer type 1, and a different lot size for the buyer type 2.

The proof of Proposition 3 shows that if ω
                     1 is exactly at the threshold H
                     2/H
                     1 (as in the example in Table C.3), the problem has multiple global optima — one represented by menu 7a, and two others — by sets of offers of type 4. Thus, the supplier is indifferent between these three menus; we adopt the convention that in this case, she offers a menu that entails a greater efficiency (in the expectation) — that is, menu 7a with the first-best quantity. Hence the assertion (ii) of the proposition: that bunching (via menu 7a) occurs if and only if condition ω
                     1 ≤ H
                     2/H
                     1 holds.

It is worth noting that sets of offers of type 4 and 7a do not depend on ω
                     1, ω
                     2 (see Table 1), and, thus, lack of bunching when the said condition does not hold is solely due to sets of offers of type 4 turning up as KKT solutions and the comparison between the objective values at KKT solutions in their favor. Hence, condition ω
                     1 ≥ H
                     2/H
                     1 is similar to the monotonicity condition involving the hazard rate of the probability distribution with more than two agent types (see Section 2).

                      Further, note that, since the equality 
                        
                           
                              JELS

                              JELS

                      implies Pareto-dominance among the buyer’s possible cost structures, the single-crossing condition does not hold (see Section 3); conversely, under single-crossing, bunching does not emerge, which is in line with the classical results (cf. Section 2).

Although Proposition 2 and Corollaries 1 and 2 narrow down the number of candidate solutions to be evaluated using the analytical solution approach, this still, in general, does not obviate the need to deal with multiple KKT solutions even when seeking to find just any optimal solution.

If the problem is being solved by means of numerical optimization techniques, e.g. with a general-purpose solver, then, depending on the choice of the starting point, the algorithm may end up at a KKT solution that does not necessarily represent a global minimum.
                        8
                     
                     
                        8
                        Neither should it represent a local minimum (cf. Chap. 10 in Bazaraa et al., 2006; Morrow, 2011). Using second-order sufficient conditions (see e.g. Bazaraa et al., 2006, Theorem 4.4.2) and the results derived in Section D.3 of Appendix D, it can still be shown that non-optimal KKT solutions represented by sets of offers of types 4, 5 and 6 must represent local minima of the problem, provided that the Lagrange multipliers that were assumed to be positive for the respective set of offers (Sucky, 2006, Table 5) have strictly positive values.
                      Our numerical experience confirms this (we in particular experimented with fmincon solver from matlab’s optimization toolbox, version 5.1, and Excel® Solver 2010, using each solver’s default settings).

It becomes therefore of interest to investigate the question whether it is possible to establish a condition that would guarantee that a KKT solution of the problem represents its globally optimal solution. When pursuing the analytical approach to solving the problem, such a condition would allow to pick just the first set of offers from the set S
                     * that satisfies the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions as per Table 1. When pursuing a numerical approach to solving the problem, this condition would assure that the numerical solver that converges to a KKT solution, obtains an optimal solution. In this section we establish such a condition.

To this end, it is instructive to illustrate the emergence of multiple KKT solutions by referring here once again to the problem instance given in Table 2 of Section 4. For illustrative purposes, we will restrict our attention to those feasible solutions of problem (1)–(6), at which individual rationality constraints (2)–(3) are binding, so that the following holds:

                      depicts the graph of objective function (14) over the feasible region defined by (15) and (16). As one can see, the feasible region consists of two disjoint parts, which gives rise to two distinct local minima. The reason is that one of the buyer’s possible cost structures in Table 2 strictly dominates the other in Pareto sense: B

                     is strictly concave and unimodal, see Fig. 6
                     . As a result, (15) is satisfied on two disjoint intervals, which makes the feasible region of (14)–(16) non-convex and leads to existence of two local minima.

Note further that the left-hand sides of constraints (15) and (16) represent univariate functions that are just additive inverses of one another, as Fig. 6 illustrates. As a result, a strict Pareto dominance among the buyer’s possible cost structures always makes exactly one left-hand side in (15)–(16) strictly concave and unimodal, and leads to multiple local minima.

In contrast, if the buyer’s cost structures do not strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense and therefore happen to be weakly Pareto-efficient, then the left-hand sides in (15)–(16) both represent monotone functions. Fig. 7
                      illustrates this for the problem instance obtained from the one given in Table 2 by interchanging the values of parameters B
                     1 and B
                     2. The consequence is that each constraint is satisfied on a convex subset of the real line, which makes the feasible region of the surrogate problem connected and hence convex. Note that strict concavity of one constraint may still persist (which is the case when B
                     1 ≠ B
                     2, cf. (17)). Nevertheless, both left-hand sides prove to be quasiconvex functions (see Appendix J for a definition); given the strict convexity of objective function (14), this guarantees optimality of a KKT solution (see Proposition J.2 in Appendix J).

Unfortunately, weak Pareto-efficiency of the buyer’s possible cost structures does not lead to quasiconvexity of constraints in the original problem (1)–(6), so that the above argument does not carry over to problem (1)–(6). Despite that, there still holds the following

                        Proposition 4
                        
                           Suppose that the buyer’s possible cost structures are both weakly Pareto-efficient. Then a KKT solution of problem 
                           
                              (1)
                           
                           –
                           
                              (6)
                            
                           is an optimal solution. Specifically, the following is true:
                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    a set of offers of type 1–5 satisfying the respective feasibility conditions and necessary optimality conditions is optimal;
                                 


                                    a set of offers of type 6 satisfying the respective feasibility conditions and necessary optimality conditions cannot exist, unless it coincides with a set of offers from i);
                                 


                                    sets of offers of types 7 and 8 are undefined.
                                 

See Appendix J.□


                     Proposition 4 thus establishes that weak Pareto-efficiency of the buyer’s cost structures guarantees optimality of a KKT solution of the original problem, too. To obtain this result, we employ the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier approach (see Appendix J for details) and prove that under this condition, the restricted Lagrangian function of the problem turns out to be convex, what guarantees optimality of the solution in question — despite the fact that the problem remains non-convex. This can be explained as follows. As we know from Section 3, weak Pareto-efficiency of the buyer’s possible cost structures implies the single-crossing property. Under single-crossing, the functions in Fig. 7 happen to be monotonic. This, in turn, leads to convexity of the restricted Lagrangian function and thus ensures optimality of the respective stationary point (see the proof of Proposition 4 in Appendix J for details).

An immediate consequence of the proof of Proposition 4 is the following

                        Corollary 3
                        
                           The set of offers of type 1 is optimal whenever it satisfies the respective feasibility conditions. The buyer’s possible cost structures do not need to be both weakly Pareto-efficient.

                      to the buyer with the cost structure no. i (Banerjee, 1986; Sucky, 2006), the set of offers of type 1 is an optimal solution to a relaxed problem (1)–(3), (6). If it happens to be feasible to the original problem (1)–(6) as well, then it obviously represents its optimal solution, irrespective of the relation between the buyer’s possible cost structures (see also Lemma I.1 in Appendix I).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the present paper we have conducted an optimality analysis of the single supplier–single buyer bargaining model with asymmetric information introduced by Sucky (2004); 2006), by taking his original analysis as our starting point. Our contribution to the knowledge about this problem and its solution is four-fold. First, we proposed a refinement of the original closed-form solution of the problem, thus simplifying problem solving and its analysis. Second, we have proven that KKT conditions are necessary for optimality, and demonstrated that the problem on hand may, in general, possess non-optimal stationary points due to non-convexity. Third, we have proven that certain types of stationary points happen to be always dominated, which eases the analytical solution of the problem by allowing to restrict attention only to specific types of stationary points. Fourth, we derived an easily perceivable optimality condition that requires a weak Pareto-efficiency of the buyer’s possible cost structures, under which any stationary point of the problem proves to be its optimal solution.

We thus contribute to both analytical and numerical approaches to solving the problem. It must be noted that in general, the analytical approach still requires to check potentially multiple candidate solutions against the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions, in order to determine the stationary points of the problem, and further evaluate the objective function at each stationary point. The first, third and fourth of the above results nevertheless reduce the required effort and simplify any subsequent parametric analysis of the problem substantially. The fourth result ensures, in addition, a successful solution of the problem by means of conventional numerical techniques, e.g. with a general-purpose solver, as it ascertains the user that the solver converging to a KKT solution converges to the true optimum of the problem.

The properties of the optimal sets of offers that we have derived are, on the one hand, in line with other existing results on discrete-type adverse selection problems: there is no distortion from the first-best for at least one buyer type, and there exist five generic types of optimal solutions — even if the single-crossing condition does not hold. However, in the latter case, there exists a possibility of bunching, which is in line with the results obtained in continuous-type settings (Araujo & Moreira, 2010; Rochet & Choné, 1998). We have fully characterized the conditions for emergence of bunching in our setting.

An interesting direction for the future research would be to extend the above results to more general settings — e.g. involving product quality aspects (Affisco, Paknejad, & Nasri, 2002; Liu & Çetinkaya, 2007) and more general production and shipment policies (Ben-Daya et al., 2008), more than two or a continuum of the buyer’s possible cost structures (McAfee & McMillan, 1988; Rochet & Stole, 2003), and more general distributions of bargaining power between supply chain members.

                        1 > 0 (Sucky, 2006) in three ways: (i) it imposes an upper bound on μ
                        1; (ii) it relaxes the strict inequality to the non-strict one in order to accommodate degenerate solutions; (iii) it accounts for the possibility of a zero denominator in (B.6). Table 1 displays condition (B.5) by separating it into two rows.

                        2 are considerably simplified by the above Eqs. (B.4) and (B.7).

Further, the necessary optimality condition has to be extended by a similar approach as in Section B.1 to:

As indicated in Section 3, we contribute to the original results of Sucky (2006) by deriving two additional types of KKT solutions of problem (1)–(6). They correspond to cases no. 5 and 6 in Sucky (2006, Table 5); to maintain the original numbering of KKT solutions, we designate the new solution types as type 7 and 8, respectively, and derive them below in the closed form.

                         holds — what in turn requires that the buyer’s possible cost structures strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense. The analysis in Appendix F further provides us with the following two observations.

                           Observation 1
                           If a set of offers of type 7 with

                              .

If a set of offers of type 7 with x
                              1 ≠ x
                              2 satisfies the respective necessary optimality condition then there must necessarily hold ω
                              1 ≠ ω
                              2.


                        Table C.3 provides an example in which a set offers of type 7 happens to be a KKT solution of problem (1)–(6) and its optimal solution, too. Furthermore, this set of offers yields supply-chain coordination because it leads either buyer type to adopting the system-optimal joint economic lot size, as Observation 1 and condition (C.3) indicate. Note that the buyer’s choice from this set of offers will reveal no information to the supplier because both offers coincide.

These KKT solutions correspond to case no. 6 as per Table 5 in Sucky (2006), being described by the following combination of Lagrange multipliers: 
                           
                              
                                 λ
                                 1
                              
                              >
                              0
                              ,
                              
                              
                                 λ
                                 2
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                         and μ
                        1, μ
                        2 > 0. This case is symmetric to the one considered in Section C.1 above, therefore KKT solutions of type 8 can be obtained by exchanging the indices of the buyer’s assumed cost structures in equations (C.2)–(C.8). We collate the results in Table 1.

Note that sets of offers of type 8 are undefined for problem instances with 
                           
                              A
                              ≤
                              0
                           
                        . Furthermore, Observations 1 and 2 made in Section C.1 above equally apply to sets of offers of type 8.

KKT solutions of type 4 assume the case

                        1, μ
                        1 > 0 adopted for deriving KKT solutions of type 4, we thus still permit either Lagrange multiplier to take on the zero value, in order to consistently classify the coinciding sets of offers as a KKT solution using the feasibility and necessary optimality conditions of either solution type.

Assume now that the second parenthetical expression in (D.5) equals zero. Then equation (D.5) holds if and only if its first parenthetical expression equals zero as well; in such a case we can set μ
                        1 to any value within the bounds 0 ≤ μ

Consider a set of offers of type 4. Its order size x
                        2 is determined by one of the two possible expressions in (D.9). We shall assume that x
                        2 is defined and x
                        2 > 0. It is then easy to see that the denominator in (D.6) is equal to zero if, and only if, exactly one of the following is true:

                                       1
                                       )
                                    
                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        It is easy to see that this equality can only be satisfied with either 
                           
                              r
                              =
                              1
                           
                         or 
                           
                              s
                              =
                              1
                           
                         or both. However, case (i) under consideration assumes that B
                        1 ≠ B
                        2 and h
                        
                           A,1 ≠ h
                        
                           A,2, and hence r, s ≠ 1.

Thus, in case (i), a positive order size x
                        2 as determined by (D.9) turns the denominator in (D.6) to zero if and only if 
                           
                              r

                              s
                           
                         or, equivalently,

                        Note that under this condition, the buyer’s cost structures {B
                        1, h
                        
                           A,1} and {B
                        2, h
                        
                           A,2} strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense; furthermore, both order sizes 
                           
                              x
                              
                                 2

                         happen to be positive.

Refer now to case (ii). In this case, condition (D.11) automatically holds true. Thus, taking both cases (i) and (ii) into account, we conclude that, given a positive order size x
                        2, a zero denominator in (D.6) implies condition (D.11).

Conversely, assume that condition (D.11) holds. It then obviously implies that either B
                        1 ≠ B
                        2, h
                        
                           A,1 ≠ h
                        
                           A,2 or 
                           
                              
                                 B
                                 1
                              
                              =
                              
                                 B
                                 2
                              
                              ,
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              
                                 h
                                 
                                    A
                                    ,
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 h
                                 
                                    A
                                    ,
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         is true. In the former case, condition (D.11) further implies condition (D.10) to hold, whereas the latter case represents case (ii). Hence, condition (D.11) implies either case (i) or case (ii). We know that either case leads to a zero denominator in (D.6).

Thus, having a zero denominator in (D.6) with a given order size x
                        2 > 0 from a set of offers of type 4 is equivalent to having condition (D.11) satisfied.

KKT solutions of type 6 are associated with the case λ

                     2, μ
                     1, μ
                     2 > 0 (Sucky, 2006, p. 534). Their derivation is similar to that of KKT solutions of type 4, see Appendix D above. Specifically, from (A.5) and (A.6) we derive:

                     2 as given in equations (36), (37) in Sucky (2006), which we subsequently simplify in accordance with Section D.2 of Appendix D to:

                     where 
                        A
                      denotes the right-hand side of (F.6). Note that (F.9) has to be satisfied by any set of offers of type 7, what necessarily requires 
                        
                           A
                           >
                           0
                        
                     . We will accordingly assume this to hold throughout this section. Note further that this in turn implies that the buyer’s possible cost structures strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense.

Given (F.6), it is then immediate to see that equation (F.9) can only be satisfied with 
                        
                           
                              x

                           =
                           
                              x
                              2
                           
                        
                     . Furthermore, this immediately implies that the parenthetical expression on the right of (F.5) equals to zero as well, and vice versa. Thus the parenthetical expressions on the right of (F.4) and (F.5) must be either both non-zero or both zero; the latter case holds if and only if

                              x

                     . In that case, equalities (F.4) and (F.5) hold if and only if

                     2; by the same argument as in Section D.1 of Appendix D, we can set

                     . By (F.1), this implies 
                        
                           
                              μ

                     Since the solution in question turns the right-hand side in the above equation to zero, the parenthetical expression in the left-hand side must be equal to zero, as well — what in turn implies that x
                     1 minimizes the joint total costs associated with the buyer’s cost structure {B
                     2, h
                     
                        A,2} and thus coincides with the respective joint economic lot size JELS2. Hence both JELS1 and JELS2 are equal to x
                     1 and therefore to each other.

Consider now the case of x
                     1 ≠ x
                     2. Then, by the above argument, the parenthetical expressions on the right of (F.4) and (F.5) are non-zero. Thus (F.4) and (F.5) respectively yield the following expressions for μ

                     Thus x
                     2 is determined as the square root of the right-hand side in (F.15) — provided that it is defined, and x
                     1 is determined due to (F.9) as 
                        
                           
                              x

                     . It is straightforward to rewrite x
                     1 in the form given in equation (C.4). Note that 
                        
                           
                              ω
                              1

                              ω
                              2
                           
                        
                      would make the numerator and the denominator in (F.15) equal and lead to 
                        
                           
                              x
                              1

                              x
                              2

                     . Hence x
                     1 ≠ x
                     2 is only possible to hold when ω
                     1 ≠ ω
                     2. Note further that the value of μ
                     2 can be determined using equation (F.14). It has been assumed to be positive; however, by the same argument as in Section D.1 of Appendix D, it is sufficient to require μ
                     2 ≥ 0. Then by (F.1), 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              1
                           
                           =
                           
                              μ
                              2
                           
                           +
                           
                              ω
                              1
                           
                           >
                           0
                        
                     . In particular, it is easy to see that by virtue of (F.13) and (F.14), 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              2
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                      makes the solution in question coincide with the set of offers of type 3.

We now determine the side payments z

                     2 to be respectively offered in conjunction with the order sizes x

                     2. With

                        The notation and the wording partly used in Proposition G.1 are due to Bazaraa et al. (2006, Theorem 4.2.13). The hypothesis of the proposition involves an equivalent form of the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification as per Theorem 4.10.4 in Hestenes (1975) (see Horsley and Wrobel, 2004, Lemma 14); see also Solodov (2011). In the absence of equality constraints, the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification implies the Arrow–Hurwicz–Uzawa constraint qualification (Mangasarian, 1969, p. 102). By Theorem 7.3.7 in Mangasarian (1969), this leads to the assertion of Proposition G.1.

                      always holds by definition of the joint economic lot sizes JELS1, JELS2 in (7). Thus at most one of the two inequalities in (H.1) can be violated. If none is violated then the set of offers of type 1 proves to be a feasible solution of problem (1)–(6). Furthermore, we can easily verify that it uniquely minimizes the objective function (1) subject to individually rationality constraints (2)–(3) (cf. Sucky, 2006, Section 4.2). Therefore, it must represent a unique optimal solution of problem (1)–(6) as well. Hence, an optimal set of offers

                                       Since Δ ≥ δ holds by assumption, it follows that the set of offers in question satisfies constraint (5). This finally proves the alternative set of offers to be feasible. Furthermore, it delivers a lower value to the objective function (1) than the original set of offers

                                       Since δ > Δ holds by assumption, it follows that the set of offers in question satisfies constraint (4). This finally proves the alternative set of offers to be feasible. Furthermore, it delivers a lower value to the objective function (1) than the original set of offers

Thus in both sub-cases above, we obtain that

If the 1st inequality in (H.1) does not hold, while the 2nd does, we shall follow the same approach as in the above Case 1, which implies

The following lemma is helpful in proving the proposition.

                        Lemma I.1
                        
                           Assume that the set of offers of type 1 satisfies the respective feasibility conditions as per 
                           
                              Table 1
                           
                           . Then, this set of offers represents a unique optimal solution of problem 
                           
                              (1)
                           
                           –
                           
                              (6)
                           
                           .
                        

Under the assumption of the lemma, the set of offers of type 1 represents a KKT solution of problem (1)–(6), and thus its feasible solution. Furthermore, this set of offers uniquely minimizes objective function (1) subject to constraints (2)–(3) (see Sucky, 2006, Section 4.2 for a proof). Hence it represents the unique optimal solution to (1)–(6) as well.□

                      implies

                     1 ≠ B

                        A,1 < h
                     
                        A,2 holds — so that the buyer’s possible cost structures strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense. Thus the order sizes

                      of the proposition. This proves (I.2) to hold. Consequently, both sets of offers 7a and 8a satisfy the respective necessary optimality conditions as per Table 1. It is also easy to see that in each of the menus 7a, 8a, the side payments obey

                     . Thus, both menus entail bunching. We below distinguish between Cases 1 to 3.

                              2 satisfy (I.2). It is then straightforward to verify that the menus 7a and 8a coincide with each other and also with the set of offers of type 1 — that proves to satisfy the respective feasibility conditions. By virtue of Lemma I.1, this set of offers then represents the unique optimal solution of the bargaining problem (1)–(6). Next, we rewrite (I.5) in the following form:

                              2 satisfy (I.2), as before. It is then straightforward to verify that menu 7a satisfies the respective feasibility condition and thus proves to be a KKT solution of the bargaining problem (1)–(6), while menu 8a does not. We will below conduct the proof of assertion (ii) of the proposition by comparing the objective value that menu 7a delivers to the bargaining problem with that of other KKT solutions, if there are any. Referring to Table 1 and taking into account assumption (I.11), it is straightforward to verify that:

                                    the set of offers of type 1 fails to satisfy the respective feasibility conditions;

by virtue of (I.4), the set of offers of type 2, if defined, coincides with menu 8a and fails to satisfy the respective feasibility conditions;

by virtue of (I.4), the set of offers of type 3, if defined, coincides with menu 7a;

the sets of offers of type 5 fail to satisfy the respective feasibility condition;

by virtue of (I.3) and (I.4), menu 7b coincides with menu 7a;

by virtue of (I.3), menu 8b coincides with menu 8a and therefore fails to satisfy the respective feasibility conditions.

Furthermore, we below prove that under the hypothesis of the proposition and assumption (I.11),

                                 
                                    •
                                    the sets of offers of type 6 fail to satisfy the respective necessary optimality conditions.

We separate the proof of the latter assertion in the following two steps. Firstly, from the preceding analysis we know that the buyer’s possible cost structures strictly dominate one another in Pareto sense. We shall prove that under assumption (I.11), specifically the following must hold:

To summarize, the sets of offers of types 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 do not represent any KKT solutions, while the sets of offers of type 3 and 7b, if defined, coincide with menu 7a. Thus, it only remains to check the latter against the sets of offers of type 4, as follows below.

In the latter case, the sets of offers of type 4 fail to satisfy the necessary optimality conditions and, therefore, do not represent any KKT solutions. Then menu 7a happens to be the only KKT solution of the bargaining problem and its unique optimal solution.

Let now (I.20) hold. Then the set of offers of type 4 happens to be a KKT solution. Consider the objective value that it delivers:

In this case a set of offers of type 4 delivers the same objective value as menu 7a does, and thus both menus solve bargaining problem (1)–(6). By the convention adopted in Section 4, we assume that from several optimal sets of offers, the supplier picks one that minimizes the expected supply-chain costs.

                        where ⟨ · , · ⟩ designates the inner product of two vectors. The relationship between convexity, pseudoconvexity and quasiconvexity is described by the following proposition (Mangasarian, 1965):

                           Proposition J.1
                           
                              The following implications hold true for a differentiable function f: convex ⇒ pseudoconvex ⇒ quasiconvex, but none of the converse is true.

                                 A,2 hold. Then, obviously, ζ′ > 0, ζ′′ ≤ 0, and so ζ is monotone increasing and concave. It is pseudoconvex by its strict monotonicity, since for each x, y > 0 the inequality

By construction, it is represented by some set of offers of type 1–8, as per Table 1, and satisfies the respective feasibility and necessary optimality conditions. To prove that it is optimal to (1)–(6), we below use the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier (GLM) approach (Everett, 1963) in its extended form due to Brooks and Geoffrion (1966). When applied to problem (P) in Appendix G, their result states that if there exist multipliers

                               (Sucky, 2006, p. 531). Hence the last two terms in (J.4) vanish, and

                               turns out to be a convex function. Any stationary point of it hence represents its unconstrained minimum. By construction, the set of offers of type 1 is a stationary point of

                                       By taking a similar approach as in the above case 1, it can be shown that (J.8) holds true, and hence 
                                          
                                             L

Thus, under the hypothesis of the proposition, 
                                 
                                    L

                              2 and constant in z

                              2. Given that 
                                 
                                    L

                               is separable, it obviously proves to be jointly convex in its variables, and hence its stationary points represent its unconstrained minima. By definition of a KKT solution, the set of offers under consideration is a stationary point of 
                                 
                                    L
                                    ¯
                                 
                              . Therefore, GLM condition (i) is satisfied, and the set of offers in question is indeed optimal to (1)–(6).

                              . The proof follows in this case similar steps as those used above for KKT solutions of type 4.

We now turn to the remaining four types no. 2, 3 and 7, 8 of KKT solutions.

Note that KKT condition (A.4) implies:
