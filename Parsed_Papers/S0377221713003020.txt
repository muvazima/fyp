                  We consider a time-based inventory control policy for a two-level supply chain with one warehouse and multiple retailers in this paper. Let the warehouse order in a fixed base replenishment interval. The retailers are required to order in intervals that are integer-ratio multiples of the base replenishment interval at the warehouse. The warehouse and the retailers each adopt an order-up-to policy, i.e. order the needed stock at a review point to raise the inventory position to a fixed order-up-to level. It is assumed that the retailers face independent Poisson demand processes and no transshipments between them are allowed. The contribution of the study is threefold. First, we assume that when facing a shortage the warehouse allocates the remaining stock to the retailers optimally to minimize system cost in the last minute before delivery and provide an approach to evaluate the exact system cost. Second, we characterize the structural properties and develop an exact optimal solution for the inventory control system. Finally, we demonstrate that the last minute optimal warehouse stock allocation rule we adopt dominates the virtual allocation rule in which warehouse stock is allocated to meet retailer demand on a first-come first-served basis with significant cost benefits. Moreover, the proposed time-based inventory control policy can perform equally well or better than the commonly used stock-based batch-ordering policy for distribution systems with multiple retailers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Time-based control that uses fixed replenishment schedules to coordinate production and inventory activities has long been a common practice (Graves, 1996). Manufacturers often run their materials requirements planning (MRP) systems on weekly, bi-weekly or monthly schedules. Many large retail chains also replenish their stocks in the same fashion (Shang and Zhou, 2010a). This is reasonable. Time-based inventory control policies are appealing to practitioners because they are simple in structure and easy to implement. However, periodic-review inventory control policies are not able to fully utilize system stock information to optimize system performance. As a result, previous studies on multi-echelon supply chain systems with stochastic demand have focused on continuous-review inventory control policies. We refer to Wang (2011) for a recent review of the literature on control policies for multi-echelon inventory systems with stochastic demand.

The objective of this paper is to develop a time-based inventory control policy for a two-level distribution system with one warehouse and multiple retailers (OWMR). The retailers face independent Poisson demand processes. The warehouse orders from an external supplier and the retailers order from the warehouse. We assume that the external supplier has unlimited capacity and thus can always fill up a warehouse order immediately. The warehouse, however, can fill up a retailer order only when stock is available. All lead times are constant. Shortages at the warehouse or a retailer are fully backlogged. A fixed cost is incurred for each shipment from the external supplier to the warehouse or from the warehouse to a retailer, a linear inventory holding cost per unit time is incurred for each unit of on-hand inventory at the warehouse or a retailer, and a linear penalty cost per unit time is incurred for each unit of backlog at a retailer. For simplicity, we assume that the retailers are identical. The extension of the study to OWMR systems with non-identical retailers is discussed at the end of the study.

We develop a fixed-interval order-up-to ordering policy for the system. Let the warehouse order in a fixed base replenishment interval. The retailers are required to order in fixed intervals that are integer-ratio multiples of the base replenishment interval at the warehouse. The warehouse and the retailers each adopt an echelon-stock order-up-to policy, i.e. order the needed stock at a review point to raise the echelon inventory position to a fixed base stock level. We assume that transshipments between retailers are not allowed and, when facing a shortage, the warehouse allocates the remaining stock optimally in the last minute before delivery with the most updated stock information to minimize system cost. The main objective of the study is threefold. First, we provide an approach to evaluate the exact inventory related cost for the inventory control system based on the stocking conditions at the warehouse. Second, we characterize the structural properties and develop an exact optimal solution for the inventory control system to optimize its performance with respect to both replenishment schedule and ordering policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed time-based control policy can perform equally well or even better than the stock-based batch-ordering policy under certain conditions. It is well known that stock-based inventory control policies dominate time-based inventory control policies for a single facility (Rao, 2003) or a serial system (Feng and Rao, 2007). However, we show that this is not the case for OWMR systems. The key driving factor is the coordination of multiple retailers. Although a stock-based control policy can use real time stock information through continuous-review to optimize replenishment decisions, a time-based control policy can provide a more efficient mechanism to coordinate orders and pool demand for multiple retailers. When the benefits of order coordination and stock pooling are high, the latter can provide a more efficient inventory control policy to optimize system performance.

To the best of our knowledge, the current study represents the first attempt to develop an exact optimal time-based inventory control policy for a stochastic OWMR system. As pointed out by Cachon (2001), the primary challenge in providing an exact solution for a multi-echelon inventory control system with multiple retailers is the evaluation of system cost. Several studies have developed exact system cost evaluations for OWMR systems adopting continuous-review batch-ordering policies (Axsäter, 1990, 1993a, 2000; Chen and Zheng, 1997; Cheung and Hausman, 2000). However, for periodic-review policies, the presence of multiple retailers requires that the warehouse adopt a policy for allocating the remaining stock to retailers when facing a shortage. This adds an additional complexity because an optimal warehouse stock allocation often entails an inventory state space of a large dimension and precludes an exact evaluation of the expected system cost (Federgruen and Zipkin, 1984). As a result, previous studies have developed only approximate solutions.

Three different approaches of approximation have been used. First, Eppen and Schrage (1981) introduced and subsequently many other studies (see, e.g., Schwarz, 1989; McGavin et al., 1993, 1997; Cachon, 1999; Wang and Axsäter, 2010) adopted the balance condition. This condition assumes that inventory positions at retailers can be normalized with free transshipments so that the warehouse stock allocation decision is decoupled from the inventory positions at individual retailers. As a result, the expected system cost can be evaluated with respect to only the inventory position at the warehouse. However, according to Gallego et al. (2007) and Dogru et al. (2009), the balance condition can generate significant approximation errors. Second, several studies assumed non-optimal warehouse stock allocation policies under which the expected system cost can be explicitly evaluated. Specifically, Graves (1996) and others (Axsäter, 1993b; Marklund, 2011; Shang and Zhou, 2010b) assumed the virtual allocation rule, in which warehouse stock is allocated or reserved to satisfy demand at retailers on a first-come first-served basis. Cachon (2001) assumed that the warehouse allocates the remaining stock among retailers randomly when facing a shortage. Finally, Chu and Shen (2010) developed an upper-bound power-of-two policy, in which the warehouse and retailers order in intervals that are integer power-of-two multiples of a base replenishment interval. They proved that the long-run average system cost under this approximate solution is guaranteed to be no more than 1.26 times the system cost under the exact optimal power-of-two policy. In contrast to this study, we provide an approach to develop an exact optimal solution under optimal warehouse stock allocation, in which warehouse stock is allocated in the last minute before delivery with the most updated stock information to minimize the total relevant system cost.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 formulates the inventory control system. Section 3 develops an exact evaluation of the long-run average system cost. Section 4 characterizes the optimal solution and develops a heuristic solution procedure. Section 5 presents a numerical study to evaluate the efficiency of the time-based control policy as compared to other inventory control policies. We conclude the study in Section 6.

We consider the two-echelon OWMR system that is depicted in Fig. 1
                      below. It is assumed that each retailer faces an independent simple Poisson demand process.

Let the warehouse review the system inventory position and order from the external supplier in a fixed interval of length T. The retailers review their inventory positions and order from the warehouse in a fixed interval τ that is an integer-ratio multiple of T, i.e. τ
                     =
                     T/n, where n is a positive integer. We assume that the retailers are identical (with the same demand and cost parameters) and adopt common replenishment policies. In addition, ordering activities in the system are synchronized, i.e., whenever possible, a retailer places an order when the warehouse receives a shipment. Under these conditions, suppose the warehouse receives a shipment from the external supplier at time t. Then all the retailers order together first at time t and subsequently at time t
                     
                        m
                     
                     =
                     t
                     +
                     mτ for 0<
                     m
                     <
                     n. It is worth noting that, if τ
                     =
                     nT and n
                     >1, we can find a dominating policy by letting the warehouse replenishment interval be T′=
                     nT and the retailer replenishment interval be τ
                     =
                     T′. As a result, we consider only τ
                     =
                     T/n.

The warehouse and retailers each apply an echelon-stock order-up-to policy. Let s denote the order-up-to level at a retailer and S denote the order-up-to level at the warehouse. Then each retailer orders at a review point to raise the echelon inventory position to s and the warehouse orders at a review point to raise the echelon inventory position to S. We use the following definitions. An installation refers to a retailer or the warehouse. An echelon refers to the subsystem consisting of the current installation and all its successors. Installation inventory position is equal to inventory on-hand plus outstanding orders minus backorders at the installation. Echelon inventory position is equal to inventory on-hand or in-transit within the echelon plus outstanding orders to outside suppliers minus backorders for outside customers. According to these definitions, the installation and echelon inventory positions at a retailer are identical and the echelon inventory position at the warehouse is equal to the sum of the installation inventory positions at the warehouse and the retailers. In addition, the echelon at the warehouse is equivalent to the distribution system.

Alternatively, we can also define the ordering policy based on installation inventory positions. According to the discussions above, for a retailer, installation-stock and echelon-stock ordering policies are equivalent. For the warehouse, we let R
                     =
                     S
                     −
                     Ns. Then the echelon-stock ordering policy above is equivalent to ordering at a review point to raise the installation inventory position at each retailer to s and the installation warehouse inventory position to R. Since the installation policy is easy to characterize, we define the warehouse ordering policy based on installation stock hereafter.

We define the following policy variables and demand and cost parameters, using lower case letters for retailers and upper case letters for the warehouse or system. We note that we also use other variables and functions to facilitate the analysis throughout the paper. For brevity, we provide the definitions of such variables and functions in an Appendix.

According to the proposed time-based replenishment policy, the system regenerates each time when the warehouse orders from the external supplier to raise the inventory position at every retailer to s and the installation inventory position at the warehouse to R. This means that each warehouse replenishment forms a regenerative cycle for the system. Without loss of generality, we let the warehouse review the inventory position and order from the external supplier at time 0. The shipment from the external supplier arrives at the warehouse at time L. The retailers order and the warehouse allocates and ships stock to the retailers first at time L and subsequently in intervals of τ, or at time t
                     
                        m
                     
                     =
                     L
                     +
                     mτ for m
                     =0,…, n
                     −1. Consider the retailer ordering or warehouse delivery point t
                     
                        m
                     . Each retailer orders to raise its inventory position to s. If there is a sufficient stock, the warehouse ships the ordered quantity to each retailer. Otherwise, the warehouse faces a shortage. The remaining stock is then completely allocated and shipped to the retailers at this point and no more shipment is made to any retailer thereafter within the current cycle. The shortage is backordered at the warehouse. The system starts another regenerative cycle at time t
                     
                        n
                     
                     =
                     L
                     +
                     nτ. We only need to evaluate the system cost in the above regenerative cycle. The long-run average system cost per unit time is equal to the total expected system cost incurred in the cycle divided by the cycle length T.

                     ⩽0, we can define the stocking conditions at the warehouse in three different scenarios: (i) the warehouse runs out of stock at t

                     0

                        m

                     R. It is noted that t
                     
                        n−1
                     =
                     L
                     +(n
                     −1)τ is the last retailer ordering or warehouse delivery point in the current system regenerative cycle and, therefore, the warehouse does not run out of stock in the current system regenerative cycle if there is stock left at this point, or if y
                     
                        n−1
                     <
                     R. The remaining warehouse stock at t
                     
                        n−1, if any, is carried over to the next cycle. In addition, under an order-up-to policy, stock is ordered at a review point to raise the inventory position to the order-up-to level. This means that backorders (if any) in the current replenishment cycle are satisfied in the next replenishment cycle.

We provide an approach to evaluate the exact system inventory related cost based on the stocking conditions at the warehouse in this section.

We consider the system regenerative cycle that is described in Section 2 above and evaluate the expected inventory related costs at the retailers in the interval [t
                        0
                        +

                        0
                        +
                        T
                        +
                        l) or [t
                        0
                        +
                        l,
                        t
                        
                           n
                        
                        +
                        l).

Suppose that the warehouse runs out of stock at t
                        
                           m
                        . This means that (i) the warehouse delivers the needed inventory to each retailer, raising its inventory position to the order-up-to level s, at each delivery point t

                        , raising the inventory position at retailer i to an inventory position s

                           m

                           m
                         is the last ordering point and the remaining interval [t
                        
                           m

Recall that the warehouse orders at a review point to raise the inventory position at each retailer to s and the installation warehouse inventory position to R. We assume that the stock ordered by the warehouse to satisfy backorders (if any) and raise the inventory position at a retailer to s is committed to the retailer so that only the stock ordered for the warehouse is pooled and allocated to retailers. Under this condition, the warehouse stock available for allocation is equal to R at t

It is noted that the system ordering schedule can be fully described by and hence optimized with respect to any two of the three variables: T, n and τ subject to T
                        =
                        nτ.

It is known that, even for a serial system, the system cost function is not jointly convex (Feng and Rao, 2007). Consequently, there is no standard method to find an optimal solution. We characterize the structural properties of the system cost function and develop a procedure to identify an optimal solution in this section. A heuristic solution is also developed.

Using the structural properties in Theorem 1, we can identify an optimal s given the other policy variables and characterize a finite feasible region of optimality for the other policy variables. An optimal solution that minimizes the system cost f(R,
                        T,
                        s,
                        n) can then be identified.

We first consider the case for n
                        =1. This case represents a joint replenishment policy, in which the warehouse orders in a fixed interval and delivers stocks to retailers only when a shipment from the external supplier is received. Let f(R,
                        T,
                        s∣n
                        =1) denote the system cost in this case. An optimal solution for (R,

                        s) for a given T is optimal for a close neighborhood of T.

                        s), an optimal T within each subinterval that minimizes f(R,
                        T,
                        s∣n
                        =1) exists and can be identified. The solution among the optimal solutions in the finite number of closed subintervals that provides the lowest system cost is a global optimal solution for (R,

We now generalize the solution procedure above to identify a general optimal solution. For convenience of analysis, we use τ instead of T as decision variable in this case. Since T

                        . Given (τ,
                        n,
                        R), an optimal s can be identified by the necessary condition of optimality since f(R,

                        s,

Since f(R,

                        s,
                        n) is continuous in τ
                        ⩾0, similar to the above, an optimal solution for (R,
                        n,
                        s) that is identified for a given τ
                        >0 is optimal for a closed neighborhood of τ. This means that (i) we can divide the feasible range

                        n,
                        s) remains constant and (ii) given (R,
                        n,
                        s) an optimal τ within each subinterval that minimizes f(R,
                        nτ,
                        s,
                        n) exists and can be identified. Consequently, the solution among the optimal solutions in the finite number of closed subintervals that provides the lowest system cost is a global optimal solution. This proves the existence of and also provides a method to identify an exact optimal solution. However, the implementation of this solution approach is difficult because the identification of the closed subintervals is not easy. Alternatively, we use an exhaustive search to identify an optimal τ in the above numerical procedure.

We note that computation for the optimization procedure above is extensive. This is particularly the case when λ and N are large. Computational intensity comes from mainly two sources: (i) the exact evaluation of system cost under optimal warehouse stock allocation and (ii) the identification of an optimal system replenishment schedule (i.e. n and τ).

The first difficulty is well known. Previous studies have assumed the balance condition to overcome this difficulty. The balance condition assumes free transshipments between retailers so that the warehouse stock allocation decision is decoupled from the inventory positions at individual retailers. Mathematically, this means to remove constraint (ii) in the warehouse stock allocation optimization model (4). As a result, φ

                         and the evaluation of φ

                        ) is reduced from a problem of N
                        +1 dimensions (N retailers plus the warehouse) to a problem of a single dimension (the warehouse only). This can reduce computation dramatically. In addition, the warehouse stock allocation optimization problem under the balance condition is a relaxation of the original optimization problem (4). Therefore, the minimum system cost under the balance condition provides a lower bound for the minimum system cost when no transshipments are allowed. According to Axsäter (2003), the assumption of the balance condition can produce solutions of very good quality in many situations. However, this condition can also generate significant approximation errors in system cost evaluation under certain conditions (Dogru et al., 2009). In view of these findings, we implement a two-step optimization procedure to produce a heuristic solution.
                           
                              
                                 Step 1: identify an optimal solution under the balance condition. The balance condition does not affect any analysis in the study. Therefore, the optimization procedure developed in Section 4.1 can still be used to identify an optimal solution under the balance condition.


                                 Step 2: optimize the system ordering policy (i.e. R and s) under optimal warehouse stock allocation given the system replenishment schedule that is identified in Step 1 above.

Furthermore, we can also use a two-step procedure to alleviate the second computational intensity: (i) restrict the retailer replenishment interval τ to positive integers and (ii) refine the search in the neighborhood of the integer solution of τ (plus and minus 1) that is obtained in (i) above.

According to our numerical studies, the heuristic optimization procedure reduced computation dramatically but produced a close-to-optimal solution in every case. This is reasonable. The optimization model under the balance condition captures the fundamental trade-offs in the original optimization problem. As a result, the system replenishment schedule that is obtained from this optimization is close-to-optimal. On the other hand, we also observed that the minimum system cost is insensitive to (small changes of) the retailer replenishment interval τ subject to the optimization of the other policy variables (R,
                        n,
                        s). This is similar to the insensitive property of the economic order quantity model (Zipkin, 2000). Because of this property, a reasonably small search step (e.g. 0.01) can generate fairly accurate results.

We present a numerical study in this section. Three different inventory control policies are considered: (i) the proposed time-based policy under optimal warehouse stock allocation, (ii) the proposed time-based policy under virtual warehouse stock allocation, and (iii) the installation-stock batch-ordering policy. Policy (i) is obtained using the optimization procedure in Section 4.1. For Policy (ii), Axsäter (1993b) considered a simplified solution with a single replenishment interval (i.e. n
                     =1) and Liu and Wang (2012) developed a general optimal solution. Both studies considered non-identical retailers. We evaluate and optimize Policy (ii) according to Liu and Wang (2012). Finally, Policy (iii) is evaluated according to Axsäter (1993a, 2000) and optimized using an exhaustive search. In addition, we also use the heuristic optimization procedure in Section 4.2 to develop a heuristic solution of the proposed time-based policy. This solution is referred to as Policy (iv).


                     Table 1
                      presents a numerical experiment with the following parameters: N
                     =2, H
                     =0.5, L
                     ∈{1,5}, K
                     =1, λ
                     ∈{2,5}, h
                     =0.5, k
                     ∈{0.5,1}, l
                     =1 and b
                     ={10,20}. This numerical experiment includes 16 different cases. We present the obtained optimal solution and the associated system cost for each policy in each case. In addition, we use Policy (i) as the benchmark and calculate the percentage cost deviation of Policy (x) over Policy (i) as 100[Cost of Policy (x)/Cost of Policy (i)−1]%. It is noted that a positive (negative) deviation represents the percentage cost increase (decrease) of Policy (x) over Policy (i), where x
                     =ii, iii and iv.

Several useful observations are made from this numerical experiment.

First, Policy (i) dominates Policy (ii) with relatively large cost reductions. The cost increase of Policy (ii) over Policy (i) ranges from 2.23% in Case 3 to 8.67% in Case 14. This demonstrates that virtual warehouse stock allocation (Axsäter, 1993b; Graves, 1996; Shang and Zhou, 2010a; Shang and Zhou, 2010b) significantly increases system cost as compared to last minute optimal warehouse stock allocation. As pointed out by Graves (1996), virtual allocation does not account for the retailers’ relative need for inventory. The numerical study shows that the premature commitment of warehouse stock through virtual allocation can cause substantial cost inefficiencies.

Second, the cost deviation of Policy (iii) over Policy (i) ranges from −6.26% in Case 4 to 2.69% in Case 15. This means that Policy (i) and Policy (iii) can perform better than each other under different conditions. This is interesting. It is well known that, because Policy (iii) uses real-time stock information to optimize replenishment decisions through continuous-review, it dominates Policy (i) for a single facility (Rao, 2003) or a serial system (Feng and Rao, 2007). However, the numerical study shows that this is not the case for OWMR systems. This is because Policy (i) provides an efficient mechanism to coordinate system inventory activities when there are multiple retailers. By synchronizing the inventory activities at the warehouse and retailers, Policy (i) streamlines the inventory flow from the warehouse to the retailers to minimize system inventory. Furthermore, by synchronizing the ordering activities at the retailers, Policy (i) pools the demand at the retailers to minimize stockout and system stock. Consequently, when the benefits of coordination are higher than the benefits of stock information, Policy (i) performs better than Policy (iii).

To identify the settings in which Policy (i) outperforms Policy (iii), we conducted many other numerical experiments to compare the two policies. Holding everything constant, we observed that Policy (i) performs relatively better as compared to Policy (iii) when (a) the demand density at the retailers is higher, (b) the warehouse lead time is longer, (c) the inventory holding cost at the warehouse is higher and/or the inventory holding cost at the retailers is lower, and (d) the warehouse ordering cost is lower and/or the retailer ordering cost is higher. We note that conditions (a and b) imply higher relative variability for retailer demand in the warehouse lead time (e.g. measured by the coefficient of variation) and hence higher benefits from pooling retailer demand in the warehouse lead time. In contrast, conditions (c and d) entail lower inventory levels at the warehouse and/or more frequent warehouse ordering and hence higher benefits from coordinating the inventory activities at the warehouse and retailers. When all these conditions are satisfied, a time-based inventory control policy can be more efficient than a stock-based inventory control policy.

Finally, the heuristic solution provides a close-to-optimal solution in every case. The optimal solution under the balance condition provides a lower bound (LB) and the final solution from the heuristic optimization provides an upper bound (UB) for the minimum system cost under Policy (i). We report both the LB solution and the UB solution. According to the numerical example, the cost deviation of the LB ranges from 0.00% to 1.54%. This shows that the LB does not always provide a close approximation of the minimum system cost under Policy (i). Nevertheless, the cost deviation of the UB ranges from 0.00% to 0.42%. This shows that the heuristic solution is close-to-optimal in every case. In general, the balance condition provides a good approximation in situations where the system cost structure entails a fair amount of stock at the warehouse (i.e. R is relatively large).

Several other relevant issues are also addressed in the numerical study.

First, for ease of implementation and coordination, it might be desirable to restrict the choice of the warehouse replenishment interval. To explore the effect of such restrictions, we conducted extensive sensitivity analysis and found that, subject to the optimization of other policy variables, the (minimum) system cost is insensitive to the warehouse replenishment interval. Take Cases 13–16 in Table 1 for example. When the warehouse replenishment interval is restricted to integers, the optimal warehouse replenishment interval is equal to 1 for all the four cases and the minimum system costs are 12.29, 13.70, 13.28 and 14.69, respectively. These costs are 0.07%, 0.03%, 1.13% and 0.68% higher as compared to the respective minimum costs in Table 1. The minimum system cost under the continuous-review batch-ordering policy is 1.97%, 2.10%, 1.54% and 1.99% higher, respectively. As illustrated by these cases, even a relatively large change in the warehouse replenishment interval (e.g. from 1.24 to 1 for Case 15 and from 1.20 to 1 for Case 16) causes only a small change in the minimum system cost. Further, the integer restriction on the warehouse replenishment interval does not change the superiority of Policy (i) over Policy (iii) in these cases.

Second, we repeated the numerical experiment with four and eight retailers. No significant changes in performance patterns were observed as compared to the case of two retailers. This is probably because we used percentage cost deviation in the evaluation. This performance measure is relative to the base case and can normalize the effect of system sizing factors such as the number of retailers.

Finally, the computational burden for the identification of an exact optimal solution (i.e., Policy (i)) may become impractically large. As discussed in Section 4.2, the exact evaluation of the system cost under this policy is a problem of N
                     +1 dimensions. Computation becomes extensive when N is large. This problem is commonly referred to as the curse of dimensionality. Although the computational time (on a personal computer) was generally less than one hour for each case in the numerical experiment of Table 1, the computational burden increased quickly when the number of retailers (i.e., N) and the demand rate at the retailers (i.e., λ) increased. This is reasonable. We refer to the discussion in Section 3.1. We need to solve the optimization model (4) for each different

                           m

                      is equal to the number of different combinations of d

                                 d

                                 x
                              
                              
                                 m
                              
                           
                        
                     , which increases quickly with N and x
                     
                        m
                     . According to (9), we need to carry out this computation for each x
                     
                        m
                      between zero and S
                     =
                     Ns
                     +
                     R, which increases with Nλ as well as other system cost parameters that entail a higher warehouse stock level.

According to our numerical study, the heuristic solution was able to reduce the computational burden by more than 90%. Policy (iv) was quickly identified within a few minutes for each case in the numerical experiment of Table 1. The heuristic solution assumes the balance condition and therefore removes the problem of dimensionality in the identification of a system replenishment schedule. Its effect on computational time is especially significant when the number of retailers is large and/or the demand rate at the retailers is high (i.e., when Nλ is large).

Although time-based inventory control policies are common in practice, previous studies on multi-echelon inventory control systems with multiple retailers have been confined to stock-based batch-ordering policies. One reason is the lack of efficient methods to evaluate and optimize time-based inventory control systems. In this study, we develop a methodology to evaluate and optimize a time-based inventory control policy for a stochastic OWMR system. We show that virtual warehouse stock allocation is usually not advisable and the time-based policy can out-perform the stock-based batch-ordering policy under certain conditions. This provides insights and new directions for the development of inventory control policies for supply chains with stochastic demand.

Given the complexity of the problem, we restrict the study to a two-level warehouse system with identical retailers. Nevertheless, we believe that the results of this study can be extended to OWMR systems with non-identical retailers. Let us consider the case in which all (non-identical) retailers adopt a common replenishment schedule. In this case, each retailer may have different demand and cost parameters and adopt a different order-up-to level. Therefore, we need to define these parameters and variables and evaluate the inventory related costs at the retailers separately. Nevertheless, we note that the cost valuation method in Section 3 requires only a given replenishment schedule. Consequently, the same analysis can be used to obtain an explicit evaluation of the exact expected system cost. Moreover, the optimal warehouse stock allocation model (4) also remains the same after we incorporate the different cost functions for the retailers and the greedy allocation approach is still to always allocate a unit of stock to the retailer with the lowest incremental cost. As a result, the expected system cost function in this case would be similar to (12) with only some simple modifications: (i) the system demand Nλ is replaced with

                      is modified accordingly. An optimal solution can then be developed similarly. The analysis may be further extended to situations in which retailers adopt different replenishment intervals. Nevertheless, the identification of an exact optimal solution will be a challenge in these cases because the system cost function becomes a non-convex function of many integer and continuous variables.
