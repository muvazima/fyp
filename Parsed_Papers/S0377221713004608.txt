                  Timely imaging examinations are critical for stroke patients due to the potential life threat. We have proposed a contract-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reservation process [1] in order to reduce their waiting time for MRI examinations. Contracted time slots (CTS) are especially reserved for Neural Vascular Department (NVD) treating stroke patients. Patients either wait in a CTS queue for such time slots or are directed to Regular Time Slot (RTS) reservation. This strategy creates “unlucky” patients having to wait for lengthy RTS reservation. This paper proposes and analyzes other contract implementation strategies called RTS reservation strategies. These strategies reserve RTS for NVD but do not direct patients to regular reservations. Patients all wait in the same queue and are served by either CTS or RTS on a FIFO (First In First Out) basis. We prove that RTS reservation strategies are able to reduce the unused time slots and patient waiting time. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the benefits of RTS reservation and to compare various RTS reservation strategies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper is motivated by our collaboration with a large French university teaching hospital in order to reduce the waiting time of stroke patients treated in Neural Vascular Department (NVD). A stroke is the sudden loss of brain function, which is usually caused by interruption of the blood supply (ischemic stroke) and rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). The brain is deprived of oxygen and nerve cell death will occur in the area of the brain with no blood flow. The patients will suffer from severe physical and cognitive deficits. It is crucial for stroke patients to have timely imaging examinations in order to have appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

However, significant delays are observed because many key examinations rely on expensive and heavily used imaging facilities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In France, the average waiting time for MRI examinations is about 30–40days. Stroke patients, just like the other routine patients, have to reserve the time slots via fax or via telephone for the emergency patients. Long waiting time has a negative impact on quality of care and patient service [2].

In order to reduce the waiting time of stroke patients, we proposed in [1] a contract-based MRI examination reservation process. The imaging department managing the MRI facilities reserve each week some Contracted Time Slots (CTS) for NVD treating stroke patients. Stroke patients can be served by either CTS or regular time slots (RTS) in case of arrival surges of stroke patients. CTS decisions and RTS assignment policy determine the efficiency of the reservation process. The former is the number of CTS and its distribution over the time, whereas the latter refers to the policy for assigning incoming patients to RTS. We proposed a method combining stochastic programming model and Markov Decision Process (MDP) to simultaneously determine the two decisions. Structural properties of the optimal RTS assignment policy were established by an average cost MDP model. It is proved that there exists a threshold L
                     
                        i
                      for each day i and the optimal RTS assignment control consists in sending patients to RTS by keeping CTS queue length below L
                     
                        i
                     . Then Monte Carlo approximation and local improvement were used to determine CTS decisions and RTS assignment policy. Computational results showed that the reservation process can greatly reduce the average waiting time of stroke patients. However, there exist some “unlucky” patients who are directed to RTS and have to wait much longer time than those who wait for CTS.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes three new MRI reservation processes. In these processes, RTS is reserved for NVD and added to the list of CTS. CTS and RTS time slots are grouped according to their day of availability and filled by patients. No patient is directed to wait for lengthy RTS. All patients wait in the same queue for MRI time slots and are scheduled to either CTS or RTS in a FIFO (First In First Out) order and according to the release dates of CTS and RTS.

Three RTS reservation policies are proposed in this paper based on patient queue length information and some service ratio criterion. We first prove that RTS reservation policies outperform RTS assignment policy with shorter patient waiting time and less unused MRI time slots. We then perform extensive numerical experiments to compare the performances of different contract implementation strategies.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Literature review is described in Section 2. Section 3 defines and compares different MRI-contract implementation strategies. Formal proofs that RTS reservation strategies improve RTS assignment strategy are given in Appendix A. Section 4 presents computational results to show the efficiency of RTS reservation strategies and the impact of different problem parameters. Conclusions and perspectives are given in Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Capacity reservation and scheduling of imaging facilities, such as computer tomography (CT) and MRI scanners, have received limited coverage. The two earliest contributions are [3,4]. Simulation was used in [3] to investigate the effect of scheduling rules on patient waiting time and physician idle time for X-rays in a chest radiology department. It was demonstrated in [4] that more technicians and orderlies do not imply better service quality. To improve the radiology services, the emphasis was the design of the management systems and scheduling techniques.

A new scheduling method was proposed in [2] to identify improvement potentials in order to reduce MRI access time. Finite-horizon dynamic program was used in [5] to effectively allocate the expensive imaging diagnosis capacity among several classes of patients during a day. Properties of the optimal policies are identified in order to design the outpatient appointment schedule, and establish dynamic priority rules for admitting patients into services. [6] proposed a simple approach for dividing the available diagnosis capacity between emergency and inpatients on the one hand and outpatients on the other. MDP was used in [7] for the admission of multi-priority patients on a waiting queue to a diagnostic resource. An approximate dynamic programming approach was proposed to overcome the state space explosion problem. The same problem was solved in [8] with protection level policies by protecting a part of the capacity from the lower priority jobs in order to make it available for the future higher priority jobs. A perturbation analysis technique was proposed to evaluate sample-path gradients with respect to the protection levels. A stochastic approximation approach was used to determine the optimal protection levels.

MDP was used in [9] to allocate two CT-scanners to three patient groups with different arrival patterns and different cost-structures in order to maximize the total expected reward. Ref. [10] determined the optimal number of outpatients to schedule and the assignment of outpatients to a variable-block/fixed-interval appointment schedule. An MDP approach was proposed in [11] to decide whether to accept requests for MRI examinations from patients with different priorities such as inpatients and outpatients. Different examination types, cancelations, no-shows and over-booking, and same-day demand were considered. A continuous-time Markov decision process was used in [12] to model the problem of accepting or rejecting the reservation of different services by different classes of customers. The solution strategy was proposed by using simulation-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) combined with a discrete event simulation of the service period. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic ADP algorithm performs very well in terms of objective function value, solution time, and memory requirements.

Queueing theory was used in [13] to determine the number of schedule slots to open in a radiology department for urgent CT and ultrasonography in order to keep the rescheduling rate of routine studies to accommodate emergencies below a certain level. Ref. [14] examined a multi-period capacity allocation model with upgrading by considering multiple product types and multiple classes of demand. The optimal allocation policy was shown to be a simple two-step algorithm: meet demands with available capacity of the same-class, and then upgrade customers until a protection limit of a class-dependent capacity. Bounds of optimal protection limits were proposed.

Most existing studies focus on medical service capacity allocation and scheduling from the perspective of service provider side except for [1,15,16]. Ref. [1] proposed contracted based MRI reservation process, and determined CTS decisions and RTS assignment policy by combining stochastic programming model and average-cost MDP. It differs from the previous studies on critical resource scheduling by investigating the problem from a totally different perspective and explores solutions from the perspective of a given class of customers, i.e., stroke patients. CTS are pre-reserved for stroke patients by taking their average waiting time and unused CTS into account. On this basis, [15,16] considered the possibility of canceling some CTS and proposed average-cost MDP approaches. Ref. [15] determined simultaneously RTS assignment policy and one-day advance cancelation policy for CTS; whereas [16] determined the RTS assignment policy, one-day and two-day advance cancelation policy for CTS. This paper investigates different strategies for implementing an MRI-contract in order to reduce waiting time variation. Advance cancelation of CTS is not considered in this paper.

In order to reduce the waiting times of stroke patients, we proposed in [1] a contract-based MRI examination reservation process. In this reservation process, NVD treating stroke patients is allocated a certain number of time slots every day which is called Contracted Time Slots (CTS). The distribution of CTS over time will be called the contract. When the queue for CTS is too long, stroke patients can also use additional time slots via regular reservation which is called Regular Time Slots (RTS). Patients either wait for MRI time slots in a CTS queue or are directed to RTS via lengthy regular reservation process (30–40days). This strategy will be called RTS assignment policy. Although the combination of contract and RTS assignment policy greatly reduces the average waiting time of stroke patients, the variation of patients’ waiting time is quite large. The “unlucky” patients assigned to RTS have to wait much longer than those waiting for CTS.

In order to improve waiting time distribution, this paper proposes three new implementation strategies. These new strategies still make use of the same contract. With these new strategies, no patient is directed to wait for RTS reservation, and all patients wait in the same queue for MRI time slots. Additional MRI time slots are reserved by NVD through the regular reservation process. The reservation depends on the queue length of patients, and the corresponding time slots will be available in T time periods later. These additional time slots and CTS are pooled together and given to strokes patients on a FIFO basis. These new reservation processes are called RTS reservation policies.

In this paper, the following assumptions are made:
                           
                              A1.
                              Only MRI examination is considered and each patient can use either one CTS or one RTS.

Only one class of patients is considered and all patients have equal priority.

The arrival of patients varies during a week but is stationary from one week to another. Further, the number of arrivals in one day is independent of the arrivals of other days.

The contract is known and remains the same from one week to another.

The waiting time for a time slot via regular reservation is a constant T.

The average waiting time of the stroke patients served by RTS is approximated by a constant T in this paper. In practice, the use of contract-based solution is expected to modify T and reserving more CTS for stroke patients will lead to longer T. However, assumption A5 is reasonable for the following reasons. First, in practice MRI time slots are shared among multiple departments. The proportion of MRI usage by NVD is usually not too high. For example, the hospital we collaborated with has five MRI machines shared by 61 medical services of the hospital, many external services and the imaging department itself for various diagnosis, researches and teaching activities. The change of reservation process of NVD alone is expected to have limited impact on the delay of regular reservation. Second, our simulation studies show that change of waiting time for regular reservation due to the use of well-designed contract is quite limited when the overall workload of MRI facilities is reasonable and is for example below 90%. Third, the impact of CTS on T can be further reduced by appropriate advance CTS cancelation strategies not addressed in this paper but investigated in [15] and [16].

                                       penalty factor of an unused MRI time slot.

The cost structure is as follows. Each patient incurs a cost of 1 for each waiting day for either CTS or RTS. Each unused CTS or RTS time slot incurs a cost of c. The goal is to minimize the long run average cost incurred by patient waiting and unused time slots of both CTS and reserved RTS.

                           Remark 2
                           From the description of the problem, the dynamics of an RTS reservation policy can be modeled as a Markov chain but its state space is huge and beyond practical limit as the state at the beginning of each day includes not only the length of the patient queue but also the number of RTS reserved in each of the T
                              −1 previous days, i.e. each state corresponds to a T-dimension vector. Direct analysis of the underlying Markov chain is impossible. For this reason, we compare the implementation strategies by sample path comparisons and simulation studies.

This section presents numerical experiments performed to evaluate the performance of several MRI reservation processes. We then perform sensitivity analysis to show how the reservation processes depend on different factors such as T and c, and patient arrival rates.

We first describe the base case corresponding to our real case study. From the data collected from the NVD of our study, the average numbers of patient arrivals during the week are as follows: {1,0.89,0.95,1.16,1.53,0.16,0.05} which sum up to 5.74 patients per week. The number of patient’s arrival each day is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. The average waiting time for RTS is in the range of 30–40days with an average of T
                        =35days. The weight, c, is set to 15. The base case is then modified to investigate the impact of parameters c, T, and patient arrival rates.

The control parameters of the four policies are determined as follows. For any contract n, the optimal thresholds of P
                        
                           0
                         can be determined by linear programming as shown in [1] and are denoted L
                        
                           0

                        . All policies are then evaluated by ten replications of the simulation of the MRI reservation process over 10,000days. Further, with policy 3, at the end of each day, 1000 replications of the on-line simulation over the next T days are performed in order to estimate the patient queue length distribution at the end of day t

                           Remark 3
                           We have discussed the results with the managers of the collaborating hospital. They are very interested in the proposed methodology and intend to change the current way. However, there are several issues they are concerned about: (1) the impacts of this method on the waiting times of other patients; (2) how to implement the strategies if advance CTS cancelation is considered and (3) whether it benefits from using contracts for multiple medical departments. Decisions of real implementation will made based on the results of the above issues. The implementation has also been delayed due to serious financial problems of the hospital, a common situation for most French public hospitals. Cutting cost has become top priority of this hospital while the work of this paper mainly aims at improving service quality to stroke patients. We expect the implementation of the contract-based solutions resumed after the current financial pressure.

                        Table 6
                         gives the performances of different strategies where each performance for each strategy is given in the order of Low, Medium and High demand cases. The followings are observed. When the arrival rate increases, the daily cost increases but all other performance measures decreases. While the reduction of unused ratio and average waiting time is expected. The reduction of the waiting time variation and maximal waiting time is not straightforward.

RTS reservation strategies do improve the waiting time variations and the maximal waiting time for all cases. This confirms the results of Section 3.

Finally, contracts of this section use more CTS than the contract used the previous section which limits the number of CTS to the average weekly arrival rate. With more CTS, the average daily cost, unused ratio and average waiting time are almost the same for all policies. This suggests that the benefits of RTS reservation strategies with respect to these criteria are significant only when the contracted number of CTS is near or below the weekly arrival rate. The optimal contract meets this condition if the unused time slot cost c is high.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposed different strategies to implement a contract-based MRI reservation process for stroke patients. Previous studies proposed methods for determination of the number of CTS and the corresponding RTS assignment control policy. This paper proves that RTS reservation instead of RTS assignment, i.e. reserve RTS time slots instead assign patient directly to RTS reservation, improves the contract-based solution by reducing unused MRI time slots, patient waiting time and waiting time variation. Three RTS reservation strategies are proposed. The first strategy is built on an artificial queue, the second one use actual patient queue information and the third one is service ratio oriented. Apart from the theoretical analysis, an extensive numerical experiment is performed to show the effectiveness of the RTS reservation strategies.

Future research can be pursued in several directions. First, it would be interesting to combine the RTS reservation strategies with advance CTS cancelation. Queueing analysis of RTS reservation strategies is another interesting direction. Other directions are related to the impacts of contracting MRI time slots for the neural vascular department on the waiting times of other patients. Contract design for multiple medical departments and for patients requiring multiple diagnostic facilities is an important challenging issue.

                                 0
                               wait no longer than T and a patient in the CTS queue will not be directed to RTS. The last condition holds for any optimal RTS assignment policy. By relaxing the first condition, it is still possible to show that the maximal waiting time of P

                               with real queue improves both the ratio of unused time slots and the average waiting time of patients. It further avoids unlucky patients with lengthy regular reservation time T.

The proofs of the above properties need the following basic relations of policy P
