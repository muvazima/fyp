                  Pairwise comparison (PC) is a well-established method to assist decision makers in estimating their preferences. In PCs, the acquired judgments are used to construct a PC matrix (PCM) that is used to check whether the inconsistency in judgments is acceptable or requires revision. The use of Consistency Ratio (CR)—a widely used measure for inconsistency—has been widely debated and the literature survey has identified a need for a more appropriate measure. Considering this need, a new measure, termed congruence, is proposed in this paper. The measure is shown to be useful in finding the contribution of individual judgments toward overall inconsistency of a PCM and, therefore, can be used to detect and correct cardinally inconsistent judgments. The proposed measure is applicable to incomplete sets of PC judgments without modification, unlike CR which requires a complete set of PC judgments. To address ordinal inconsistency, another measure termed dissonance, is proposed as a supplement to the congruence
measure. The two measures appear useful in detecting both outliers
and the phenomenon of consistency deadlock where all judgments equally contribute toward the overall inconsistency.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The method of pairwise comparison (PC), introduced by Thurstone (1927), has been used in several decision making methods to assess the relative importance of criteria and alternatives, see Saaty (2008); Siskos et al. (2005); Figueira et al. (2004); Greco et al. (2010) for examples. The main benefit of using this approach is to convert both objective and subjective judgments into relative weights of importance. This paper focuses on the method of pairwise comparisons that is often used to help DM in describing his/her preferences. A new technique is proposed here to measure the level of inconsistency in a set of pairwise judgments.

The pairwise judgments can be used to construct a matrix and a prioritization procedure can be applied to derive a corresponding priority vector. If the judgments are consistent then all prioritization methods give the same result. However, in the case of inconsistent judgments, different prioritization methods derive different priority vectors (Choo and Wedley, 2004). It is therefore important to measure consistency of judgments prior to the process of prioritization.

Although widely used, current measures for consistency have been criticized for their shortcomings (see details in Section 2.2). We contend that the redundancy in PC judgments can be used to measure the contribution of each judgment toward the overall inconsistency. Based on this, two new measures for consistency are proposed here and are shown to be useful in measuring overall inconsistency in PC judgments. Moreover, these measures can also be used to suggest changes in the judgment values in order to improve overall consistency.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 formulates the problem of prioritization and reviews the literature related to consistency in PC judgments; Section 3 collects an empirical evidence that existing measures are insufficient; the new measures are then proposed in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. Section 6 discusses the use of these measures for improving the overall consistency in PC judgments and then illustrated through examples in Section 7; finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Consider a prioritization of n elements E
                     1, E
                     2, …, En
                     . In the PC method, DMs assess the relative importance of any two elements Ei
                      and Ej
                      by providing a ratio judgment aij
                     , specifying by how much Ei
                      is preferred to Ej
                     . If the element Ei
                      is preferred to Ej
                      then aij
                      > 1, if the elements are equally preferred then aij
                      = 1 and if Ej
                      is preferred to Ei
                      then aij
                      < 1. These judgments can be used to construct a PC matrix (PCM), A = [aij
                     ], of the order n × n. This includes all self-comparison (aii
                      = 1) and reciprocal judgments (
                        
                           
                              a
                              
                                 j
                                 i
                              
                           
                           =
                           
                              1
                              
                                 a
                                 
                                    i
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     ). The prioritization problem is to determine a priority vector w = (w
                     1, w
                     2, …, wn
                     )
                        T
                      from the given set of judgments, aij
                     . There exist many prioritization methods that can be applied to derive a priority vector from a set of PC judgments (Choo and Wedley, 2004).

The relationships among elements can also be depicted by means of a directed graph (digraph), G = (E, J), where E is the set of nodes representing n elements E
                     1, E
                     2, …, En
                     , and J represents the set of all ratio judgments {aij
                     } as weighted edges (Ali et al., 1986; Harker and Vargas, 1987). When a complete set of judgments is provided, the digraph G becomes fully connected.

The cardinal information, aij
                        , is provided with respect to some predetermined preference scale. In the case of tangible criteria, this can be derived from the directly measured information as, for example, weights (in kilograms) or price (in euros). In the case of intangibles, Saaty (1977) proposed the use of a set of verbal judgments that correspond to the ratio-scale of 1–9. Pairwise judgments can be provided using an additive-scale, however, the use of ratio-scale is considered to be more appropriate for measuring the relative intensities (Harker and Vargas, 1987; Krantz, 1972; Stevens, 1961). Despite its criticism and shortcomings (Dyer, 1990; Belton and Gear, 1983), the 1–9 scale has been widely used in various applications (Vaidya and Agarwal, 2006; Vargas, 1990).


                        Harker and Vargas (1987) compared Saaty’s scale with other proposed scales and considered it to be more appropriate than others. In their comparison, the proposed scales included two linear scales, 1–5 and 1–15, and two non-linear ones, x
                        2 and 
                           
                              x
                           
                        . Their claim was, however, supported by only one example, leaving the argument largely unresolved. Lootsma (1993) preferred the use of a geometric scale over the linear one, while Salo and Hamalainen (1997) proposed a balanced scale claiming that the weights generated by their proposed scales are more evenly dispersed as compared to Saaty’s scale. Finan and Hurley (1999) proposed to re-calibrate the verbal scale, transforming it into a geometric scale and claimed to achieve better performance compared with linear scales. Saaty (1994) also proposed a finer-grained version of the 1–9 scale, where he suggested the use of 1.1–1.9 for comparing stimuli with close resemblance.
                        Ishizaka et al. (2011) summarized a comprehensive list of transformations applied to Saaty’s 1–9 scale with a conclusion that there exists no single scale appropriate for all situations.

A complete set of judgments in the PC method creates an opportunity to have inconsistent information, primarily due to the redundancy inherent in its structure. One may argue to try to avoid redundancies present in data, however, redundancy may prove valuable in validating information acquired from imperfect human minds.

There are several causes of inconsistency including psychological reasons, clerical errors and an insufficient model structure (Sugden, 1985). The psychological reasons further break down into factors such as incomplete information, uncertainty and/or lack of concentration during the judgment process.

The judgment scale of 1–9 (Saaty, 1980) is an appropriate example of an insufficient model structure. Consider that if A is 5 times better than B and B is 3 times better than C, then the consistent value of 15 for comparing A to C is unavailable when using the 1–9 scale. Also, replacing these values with verbal statements will not change the underlying model/scale, and therefore, using the linear scale has this limitation in its structure.

There are situations where inconsistencies are unavoidable e.g. a tournament ranking problem including results where A beats B and B beats C, but then A loses to C (intransitivity). In this situation, ranking is required without amending any data, as teams may be unable to play again. Sugden (1985) suggested such inconsistencies be considered as rational.

Another possible cause of inconsistency is incorrect data entry e.g. entering a reciprocal value into a PCM. This happens when a ratio for Ei
                         to Ej
                         is mistakenly provided at a transpose location in a PCM i.e. aji
                         instead of aij
                        . Lipovetsky and Conklin (2002) termed such errors Unusual and False Observations (UFO).

Consistency in PCs is generally of two types i.e. cardinal consistency(CC) and ordinal consistency (OC). The judgments of DMs are cardinallyconsistent, if 
                           
                              
                                 a
                                 
                                    i
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 1
                                 
                                    a
                                    
                                       j
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         and aij
                         = aikakj
                         for all i, j and k. OC states that if Ei
                         is preferred to Ej
                         and Ej
                         is preferred to Ek
                        , then Ei
                         should be preferred to Ek
                         i.e. If Ei
                         → Ej
                         → Ek
                         then Ei
                         → Ek
                        .

The preference judgments are ordinally inconsistent(or intransitive) if Ek
                         → Ei
                         when Ei
                         → Ej
                         → Ek
                        . Therefore, ordinal inconsistency can be defined as Ei
                         → Ej
                         → Ek
                         → Ei
                        , which represents a circular triad of preferences (Kendall and Smith, 1940).

When two comparison elements Ei
                         and Ej
                         are equally preferred, Ei
                         ∼ Ej
                         (preference equivalence or a tie), then OC requires one of the following three conditions to be satisfied: Ei
                         → Ek
                         and Ej
                         → Ek
                        , or Ei
                         ← Ek
                         and Ej
                         ← Ek
                        , or Ei
                         ∼ Ek
                         and Ej
                         ∼ Ek
                        . For example, if aij
                         = 1 and aki
                         > 1, then OC demands that akj
                         > 1. This implies that a judgment akj
                         < 1 will introduce ordinal inconsistency. The ties present in PCMs can be shown as undirected edges between corresponding elements (Jensen and Hicks, 1993).

Using the fact that for a consistent positive reciprocal matrix, the largest eigenvalue λ
                           max is equal to n, Saaty defined a measure of consistency, termed a Consistency Index (CI):-

                              
                                 (1)
                                 
                                    
                                       CI
                                       =
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                λ
                                                max
                                             
                                             −
                                             n
                                          
                                          
                                             n
                                             −
                                             1
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           where perfect consistency implies that CI = 0 and CI > 0 for inconsistent matrices.

To define a unique consistency measure which does not depend on the dimension of the PCM, Saaty (1980) further introduced the Consistency Ratio (CR) criterion. This is the ratio between the Consistency Index and a Random Consistency Index (RI):-

                              
                                 (2)
                                 
                                    
                                       CR
                                       =

                           where RI represents the average CI of a randomly generated PCM of the same dimension, n. The values of RI are statistically calculated from thousands (or millions) of randomly generated PCMs.


                           Table 1
                            shows the two sets of CR values given in Saaty (1980) and Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez (2003). Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez (2003) calculated the values of CR by increasing the number of iterations for their experiments and, therefore, claiming higher precision.


                           Saaty (1980) claimed that if the value of CR is smaller than or equal to 0.1, the estimated priority vector w can adequately approximate the unknown preference vector r. Therefore, the PCM is considered to be acceptable when the threshold of CR ≤ 0.1 is met. However, if CR > 0.1, the estimated priorities could be erroneous and, therefore, DMs should be asked to improve the consistency by revising their subjective judgments. This threshold is used in various applications to accept or reject a PCM (Vaidya and Agarwal, 2006).

Although widely used, CR has been much debated for its two major drawbacks i.e. sensitivity to scale (Murphy, 1993; Stein and Mizzi, 2007) and the threshold value of CR ≤ 0.1 (Bozóki et al., 2014; Bozóki and Rapcsak, 2008; Monsuur, 1997). Consequently, a number of alternative methods have been suggested to address these drawbacks. Some of these methods are discussed below.


                           Crawford (1987) proposed the logarithmic residual mean square as a natural measure of consistency while proposing the geometric mean (GM) method. Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez (2003) formalized the logarithmic residual mean square, termed the Geometric Consistency Index (GCI), as:-

                           where w is a priority vector estimated using the GM method. They compared GCI to CR, and proposed threshold values for GCI equivalent to CR.


                           Koczkodaj (1993) described CR as a global measure that lacks a proper justification for its use. He proposed a measure, termed Consistency Measure (CM), in part to eliminate the drawbacks of CR, such as the inability to identify inconsistent judgments and its arbitrary threshold value of CR ≤ 0.1.

CM is calculated by considering a set of three judgments (triple) from J at a time. The value of CM is chosen from the most inconsistent triple amongst all possible combinations i.e.

CM has been shown to be useful for improving consistency by revising judgments (Koczkodaj and Szarek, 2010). However, similarly to the CR index, this measure cannot capture the ordinal inconsistency of the comparison judgments.

In order to measure ordinal inconsistency, Kendall (1955) introduced an ordinal coefficient of consistence, ζ, for comparisons between elements with no preference equivalencies. Kendall’s ζ is calculated using the following equation:-

                                       ζ
                                       =
                                       1
                                       −
                                       
                                          L
                                          
                                             L
                                             max
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           where L is the number of circular triads present in given PCM, and L
                           max is the maximum number of circular triads possible. The value of L
                           max is (n
                           3 − n)/24 for odd values of n, and (n
                           3 − 4n)/24 when n is even, formulated in Kendall (1955).


                           Gass (1998) formulated the prioritization problem for PCs as a tournament ranking problem and calculated the total number of cyclic judgments as:-

                            (also termed the out-degree). It should be noted that this definition of L does not support preference equivalence.

In order to include preference equivalence, Jensen and Hicks (1993) extended Kendall’s work and proposed the generalized coefficient of consistence. They suggested it be used as a supplement to CR, in the presence of intransitive judgments. The number of circular triads considering preference equivalence is always greater than L for obvious reasons.

From their definitions, it can be seen that the CR and CM measures of consistency do not take into account the ordinal inconsistency (or intransitivity) of the PCM. This is also true for GCI, which has a linear relationship with CR (Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez, 2003). Bozóki and Rapcsak (2008) compared CR and CM with a conclusion that no single measure is adequate in all situations. They also questioned the CR work for using randomly generated PCMs as the reference point and, hence, considered this reference to be inappropriate for analyzing human-based decisions.

Generally, if the comparison matrices are ordinally consistent, most prioritization methods derive priorities with the same ranking, only with different intensities. If, however, the matrices are ordinally inconsistent (intransitive), there exists no priority vector satisfying all contradictory preferences. Therefore, different prioritization methods provide different ordinal rankings that partially correspond to the ordinal comparison judgments.

Experiments have been performed to investigate how well inconsistency in a PCM is measured when different scales of measurement are used. The authors have used Monte-Carlo simulation for this purpose. Monte-Carlo experiments are based on repeated random sampling to compute results that are usually not achieved through a deterministic algorithm. Such methods are useful to model phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs. Monte-Carlo methods have often been used previously for analyzing PCMs (Seaman et al., 1991; Herman and Koczkodaj, 1996; Koczkodaj, 1998; Ishizaka and Lusti, 2006).

PCMs were randomly generated using the sets of values given in Table 2
                     . Each scale consists of equivalence (1), dominance ( > 1) and their reciprocal values. For each n ranging from 3 to 6, 50,000 PCMs were generated by randomly picking the values from the selected scale. The CC of each PCM was measured using CR while the OC was measured with the number of circular triads, L.

The results from these experiments are discussed below.

The percentage of the acceptable PCMs found for each scale is shown in Table 3
                        . Considering the linear scale of 1–9, the percentage of acceptable PCMs decreases with the increase in n i.e. 22.21percent for n = 3, 3.36 percent for n = 4 and only 0.26 percent for n = 5.

The geometric and power scales are least likely to produce acceptable PCMs. In the performed experiments, no PCM was found acceptable for n = 5 when using the power scale.

For the inverse and root scales, the percentage decreases monotonically as the value of n is increased. The possibility of having an acceptable PCM remains around 60 percent when using the logarithmic scale and is invariant to n. The chances of obtaining an acceptable PCM with the balanced scale are higher than with all the other tested scales and goes even higher for greater values of n (see Table 3). When PCMs were randomly generated for n = 5 using the balanced scale, all had CR below 0.1 (100 percent).

It is inferred from these results that the possibility of having an acceptable PCM is highly sensitive to the selected scale. In other words, the value of CR is sensitive to the measurement scale chosen for generating PCMs.

In order to investigate the use of CR for measuring OC, 15,000 acceptable PCMs were generated for each scale. These matrices were then tested as to whether transitive (L = 0) or intransitive (L ≠ 0). The intransitive acceptable PCMs (IAPs) were then counted for each scale. The results for n = 5 are shown in Fig. 1
                        . Similar results were found for other values of n.

The percentage of IAPs was found to be very low for the linear and geometric scales (below 1 percent). No IAP was generated for the power scale. The balanced scale produced the highest percentage of IAPs, followed by the logarithmic scale. When the inverse scale was used, more than half (53.3 percent) of the generated PCMs were found to be intransitive. Similarly, 23.4 percent of acceptable PCMs were found to be intransitive when using the root scale.

From the results given above, it is concluded that intransitive PCMs are not always rejected by Saaty’s criterion of CR ≤ 0.1.

Considering the CC test between Ei
                      and Ej
                      i.e. aij
                      = aikakj
                      (for all i, j, k), if the DM’s judgments are cardinally inconsistent, then we obtain at least one indirect judgment aikakj
                      ≠ aij
                      for some i, j and k where i ≠ k ≠ j. Fig. 2
                      illustrates this concept by locating direct and indirect judgments together on a judgment scale. Two of the indirect judgments in Fig. 2 suggest preference ratios higher than the direct judgment, while the third one (on the left) suggests a preference reversal (to be discussed in Section 5). When a DM provides a complete set of judgments in J = {aij
                     }, a total of

Considering the dispersion of indirect judgments across the measurement scale, the deviation between aij
                      and the indirect judgment aikakj
                      can be formulated in a variety of ways, such as:-

                     where k ≠ i ≠ j ≠ k and Kij
                      is the total number of indirect paths available between Ei
                      and Ej
                     . When a complete set of judgments is available, the value of Kij
                      is equal to (n − 2) for all judgments. In the case of an incomplete set of judgments, the values of Kij
                      may have different values for different judgments.

The aggregation can also be formulated in other ways, for example, θij
                      can be taken as the worst deviation among all the indirect judgments i.e.

It is clear that a single global value measuring inconsistency, whether cardinal or ordinal, is insufficient to locate all the inconsistent judgments present in J. Although Koczkodaj’s CM has the property of detecting the most inconsistent judgment, it fails to describe the contribution of other judgments to the overall inconsistency. It is, therefore, proposed to measure inconsistency with the help of these individual congruence values for a given set of judgments.

The judgment, a
                     34 is found to be most inconsistent (θ
                     34 = 1.12), while a
                     45 is considered the most consistent one. The two judgments a
                     14 and a
                     15 are found to be equally inconsistent (i.e. θ
                     14 = θ
                     15 = 0.69). Similarly, this can be calculated for other PCMs generated using different scales.

It is emphasized here that the values of θij
                      in this example are calculated using logarithmic deviation between directand indirect judgments, as given in (12). The use of other definitions may produce different results and the appropriateness of each definition may be further investigated.

If need be, the set of values {θij
                        } can further be used to derive a single global measure—the overall congruence—through an aggregation procedure, for example:-

                        where m is the total number of judgments acquired in J. Like θij
                        , the overall congruence, Θ can also be formulated using other approaches, such as choosing the worst deviation among all the measured ones i.e.

                           
                              (17)

                                    max
                                    (
                                    
                                       θ
                                       
                                          i
                                          j
                                       
                                    
                                    ∀
                                    
                                       a
                                       
                                          i
                                          j
                                       
                                    
                                    ∈
                                    J
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

It should be highlighted that Θ can have many definitions, depending on the way individual congruence values are aggregated and the formulation used for δ. For example, the overall congruence value for J
                        1 (in the above example) will be equal to Θ = 0.828 when using (16), or Θ = 1.12 when using (17).

Recall: the value of CR is sensitive to the measurement scale and is only suitable for a linear scale of 1–9. In contrast, the congruence measure is applicable to any scale in a straight-forward manner. However, the threshold of acceptance for each scale may differ and requires investigation.

As discussed earlier, Aguaron and Moreno-Jimenez (2003) formalized GCI as the aggregated logarithmic residuals, defined in (3). It can be shown that the GCI measure can be formulated as a congruence measure by using logarithmic squared deviations (given in (13) for δ), (14) for θ and (16) for Θ.

Similarly, CM can also be formulated as a congruence measure. As discussed earlier, the value of CM is chosen from the most inconsistent triple among all possible combinations of indirect judgments (Koczkodaj and Szarek, 2010). On carefully observing the multiple definitions of δ, θ and Θ, it can be concluded that CM can be obtained with δ in (10), θ in (15), and Θ defined in (17).

In other words, it can be concluded that CM and GCI can be seen as the two possible aggregates for inconsistencies present in individual judgments.


                        Harker (1987) investigated an incomplete set of judgments, where DMs are allowed to respond with “do not know” or “not sure” to some judgments. It has been highlighted that the probability of acquiring incomplete PCs increases as n increases (Fedrizzi and Giove, 2007; Fedrizzi, 2012). The proposed congruence measure is applicable to incomplete sets of PC judgments without modification, unlike CR which requires a complete set of PC judgments.

The value of θ
                        15 = 3.87 shows that a
                        15 is the least congruent with other judgments. The three judgments of a
                        23, a
                        34 and a
                        24 are found to be perfectly consistent. All the other judgments make an equal contribution to the overall inconsistency. As there exists a single judgment that shows the highest deviation, this suggests the presence of an outlier i.e. a
                        15.

This matrix tells a completely different story: all given judgments are found to be equally inconsistent. This type of situation can be termed “consistency deadlock” as no improvement can be suggested. A single global measure of consistency (e.g. CR) cannot describe the presence of consistency deadlock. In such cases, any of the provided judgments can be selected for revision.

The concept of indirect judgments can also be used to calculate OC, based on the ordinal violation between a given judgment and the corresponding indirect judgments. The preference relation Ci
                      → Cj
                      (implying aij
                      > 1) should enforce aikakj
                      > 1 for all k = 1, 2, …, n. Therefore, whenever an indirect judgment contradicts this preference relation, a latent violation occurs. The concept of latent violation can be visualized in Fig. 2, which shows a violation of aij
                      by an indirect judgment through k

The set of values ψij
                      construct a dissonance matrix that can supplement the congruence matrix in order to spot the most inconsistent judgments. The term proposed here relates to the notion of cognitive dissonance i.e. the holding of two contradictory beliefs simultaneously.

It is proposed to calculate OC as the average of all the elements in {ψij
                     } as overall dissonance(Ψ):-

                     where m is the total number of judgments acquired in J. The average is proposed instead of the aggregation to remove its dependence on n.

Although the values of CR, CM and Θ measure the level of inconsistency in judgments, Ψ uniquely measures ordinal inconsistency (as with Kendall’s ζ), suggesting a number of possible preference reversals. This dissonance can be used to detect priority violations, as illustrated through examples in the next section.

The calculation of congruence matrix, [θij
                     ], has been useful to analyze cardinal inconsistency. The use of dissonance matrix, [ψij
                     ], can further supplement the visualization of ordinal inconsistency. This is explained here with the help of examples already discussed above.

                     where transpose elements are not shown, as they are redundant. The value of ψ
                     34 = 1 suggests a
                     34 to be completely dissonant with all the related judgments in A
                     1. The judgment of a
                     34, which was declared to be the most inconsistent, has also been found to be the most dissonant.

Consider another interesting example where the most inconsistent and the most dissonant judgments are different, as follows:-

The two consistency measures, calculated for each judgment in A
                     4, are given in Table 4
                      where the judgments are arranged with the values of θij
                      in descending order. The value ψ
                     14 = 1 for a
                     14 implies that no judgment in A
                     4 supports the order of preference suggested by a
                     14. While the most dissonant judgment is a
                     14 (i.e. ψ
                     14 = 1), the most inconsistent is found to be a
                     12 according to the CC measure. This paradox has generated the question of whether CC should be given precedence over OC. An answer to this question remains an area of further investigation.

When both the ordinal and the cardinal inconsistency in PC judgments are found, the next obvious step is to improve the consistency prior to the process of prioritization. Different techniques have been introduced to detect and rectify inconsistency, either by using a local operator or a matrix-based global operation (Zeshui and Cuiping, 1999; Cao et al., 2008; Ergu et al., 2011; Siraj et al., 2012). The improvements can be done manually by asking the DM to revise the judgments, or alternatively, improvements can be done using an automated approach.

In situations where the provided judgments are allowed to be revised, it is suggested that the DM is offered both θij
                         and ψij
                        . For example, consider the PCM, A
                        4 in the form of a table, shown in Fig. 3
                        (a). The DM is supposed to manually revise by changing the values of aij
                        .

The two consistency measures, θ and ψ, are shown along with the original judgments in Fig. 3(a). The values of θij
                         are shown above aij
                         while ψij
                         is shown below aij
                         in each cell. In practical situations, the DM may find it difficult to make reasonably correct assessments as several numeric values on the table may cause information overload.

A better approach is to visualize the consistency of each judgment graphically as a bar graph. Fig. 3(b) shows this approach for A
                           4, where congruence is shown as a gray bar with each judgment and dissonance is shown as a white bar. A DM can easily spot the most inconsistent judgment (a
                           12 = 9) to manually improve its value. When OC has precedence, the value of a
                           14 should be rectified first as it is ordinally the most inconsistent.

This graphical approach is useful to spot both outliers and the phenomenon of consistency deadlock. Consider the two matrices A
                           2 and A
                           3, already discussed in Section 4. Fig. 4
                           (a) highlights the presence of an outlying judgment in A
                           2 where a
                           15 is shown to be the most inconsistent, both cardinally and ordinally. Similarly, the phenomenon of consistency deadlock for A
                           3 is visually represented in Fig. 4(b). All the judgments in A
                           3 are shown here to be equally responsible for inconsistency. There is no ordinal inconsistency present in A
                           3.

There exist situations in practice where acquired data cannot be either changed or not allowed to be changed and, hence, manual revision of judgments is not possible. One way to address this is to automatically remove inconsistent judgments with minimal deviation from the initial judgments. This can be achieved using the congruence matrix; choosing the judgment with the highest value of θ. When a set of judgments is ordinally inconsistent, the use of the dissonance matrix proves supplemental, suggesting a two-step process i.e. firstly, choose the set of judgments with the highest value of ψ and then, from these candidates, select the judgment with the highest value of θ.

In the presence of an outlier, a revised value for the blamed judgment can be calculated as:-

In the case of ordinal inconsistency, the preference order of the most inconsistent judgment needs to be reversed. The suggested averaging process may not work in the presence of ordinal inconsistency. Considering the minimum deviation from the original value, a revised value can be calculated as:-

Consider A
                        2 for example; the value for a
                        15 can be changed from 
                           
                              1
                              3
                           
                         to 16 using (20). If minimal change is to be expected, then the value of a
                        15 should be changed to 1.01 using (21). Considering the phenomenon of consistency deadlock, as all the judgments in A
                        3 are equally inconsistent; the only possible improvement is to randomly select a judgment and replace its value using (20) which is equal to 4.

In the case of A
                        1, a
                        12 is cardinally the most inconsistent and the suggested correction is

                        14 should instead be corrected and the suggested value for a
                        14 is 1.01 using (21).


                        Holsztynski and Koczkodaj (1996) proved that removing local inconsistencies incrementally will improve the overall consistency of PCMs. The same proof justifies convergence of the improvement process using θij
                         and ψij
                        .

To illustrate the concept of indirect judgments and the use of congruence and dissonance, four different types of PCMs are discussed below.

                         = aikakj
                        . Hence, all the prioritization methods generate the same weights i.e. w = [ 0.545 0.273 0.136 0.045 ].

Unlike A
                        
                           ex1, the indirect judgments in A
                        
                           ex2 are not equal to the direct ones, yet the order of preference dominance remains. As can be seen in Fig. 5(b), no indirect judgment has caused latent violations implying that the dissonance value is 0. Therefore, a preference vector with NV = 0 is possible for A
                        
                           ex2. The values of CR = 0.045, CM = 0.567 and Θ = 0.686 all suggest cardinal inconsistency among judgments, while Ψ confirms that A
                        
                           ex2 is ordinally consistent.

Inconsistency in A
                        
                           ex2 can be improved using the automated approach as shown in Fig. 6
                        . The contribution of each judgment in A
                        
                           ex2 toward overall inconsistency is shown on the left of the figure, where a
                        34 is highlighted to be the most inconsistent. In the first iteration, the value of a
                        34 is updated using (20). This reduces the overall inconsistency from Θ = 0.686 to Θ = 0.314. During next iteration, the judgment a
                        12 is found to be the second most inconsistent and eventually been changed from a
                        12 = 2.5 to a
                        12 = 1.4 using (20). This step has further reduced the overall inconsistency from Θ = 0.314 to Θ = 0.046 (as shown on right side of Fig. 6).

                        A
                        
                           ex3 is included here to investigate second-order intransitivity. Hartvigsen (2005) pointed out that this comparison is transitive yet no method produces the ideal ranking. Considering the indirect judgments shown in Fig. 5(c), we can easily identify latent violations between E
                        2 and E
                        3. The direct judgment for a
                        23 is 1.2, however, the two indirect judgments suggest 0.66, causing a priority violation whilst estimating weights. Although the values CR = 0.031, CM = 0.555 and Θ = 0.405 highlight judgment inconsistency, the only measure suggesting a possibility of a priority violation is Ψ = 0.167.

Inconsistency in A
                        
                           ex3 can be improved using the automated approach as shown in Fig. 7
                        . The congruence value of θ
                        23 = 0.59 and the dissonance value of ψ
                        23 = 1.0 both suggest changing the value of a
                        23. The value of a
                        23 can be changed from 1.2 to 
                           
                              2
                              3
                           
                         using (20). This makes the matrix A
                        
                           ex3 (fully) consistent.

An intransitive PCM (L ≠ 0) always contains dissonant judgments. This is illustrated below with the following intransitive PCM:-

There is a circular triad present in A
                        
                           ex4 i.e. E
                        1 → E
                        2 → E
                        3 → E
                        1. We discuss this example in detail with the help of Fig. 5(d). The two indirect judgments for a
                        34 are perfectly consistent, while the judgment a
                        14 has one consistent and one inconsistent judgment. Each of the three judgments, a
                        13, a
                        23 and a
                        24, show one latent violation. Finally looking at a
                        12, we see that both indirect judgments are in conflict with the direct judgment. Thus the dissonance value ϕ
                        12 is maximum (equals to 1), suggesting the judgment a
                        12 to be the outlier in this PCM.

Inconsistency in A
                        
                           ex4 can be improved using the congruence and dissonance matrices as shown in Fig. 8
                        . The congruence value of θ
                        12 = 1.39 and the dissonance value of ψ
                        12 = 1.0 both suggest changing the value of a
                        12. The judgment a
                        12 can be updated from 2 to 
                           
                              1
                              2
                           
                         using (20). This makes the matrix A
                        
                           ex4 (fully) consistent as all the indirect judgments become aligned with the direct judgments after this revision.

The given examples have suggested measuring consistency as a pair of values i.e. (Θ, Ψ). Further investigation is required to explore the properties of these two consistency measures.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The congruence measure requires a threshold value as with, for example, CR ≤ 0.1 that declares a PCM to be acceptable. Such a threshold would also enable individual judgments to be declared to be acceptable or unacceptable.

For purpose of demonstration, assume that the threshold value of 0.6 for congruence has been selected for the following two PCMs generated with the linear scale of 1–9:-

The value of CR for A
                        1 is 0.55 suggesting that the PCM is unacceptable and the value of CR for A
                        2 is 0.009 that qualifies A
                        2 as an acceptable PCM. However, the use of CR does not reveal the sources of inconsistency in these PCMs.

The congruence measure detects a
                        15 to be an outlier in both PCMs. The value of θ
                        15 = 3.87 for A
                        1 suggests that judgment a
                        15 is highly inconsistent. The value of θ
                        15 = 0.58 for A
                        2 suggests that a
                        15 is less inconsistent in A
                        2 than in A
                        1.

The overall congruence, Θ, for A
                        1 is equal to 1.16 using (16) (i.e. the average of the individual congruence values). The threshold of 0.6 suggests that the PCM is unacceptable as Θ > 0.6. Based on this threshold, only three judgments in A
                        1 are found to be acceptable i.e. a
                        23, a
                        34 and a
                        24.


                        A
                        2 has an overall congruence value of Θ = 0.17. The threshold of 0.6 declares A
                        2 to be an acceptable PCM. All the judgments in A
                        2 are also considered to be acceptable when using this threshold value.

As demonstrated above, a properly justified threshold value for congruence will offer increased utility in comparison to the threshold available for CR. We consider this to be an important area for future work: finding an appropriate threshold value for the congruence measure to determine acceptable and unacceptable judgments in a PCM.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper has investigated a number of widely used consistency measures with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations. This has shown that a single global value for measuring inconsistency, whether cardinal or ordinal, is insufficient to locate all the inconsistent judgments present in a PCM. Hence, it is proposed to measure inconsistency at a fine-grained level to quantify the contribution of each judgment toward the overall inconsistency. A graph-theoretic approach is suggested for measuring level of inconsistency in the individual judgments. First, a generalized model is proposed to measure individual inconsistencies; and then, two new measures have been introduced: congruence for CC and dissonance for OC. The proposed measures are also applicable to incomplete sets of PC judgments without modification, unlike CR which requires a complete set of PC judgments. In addition, the congruence measure is applicable to any scale in a straight-forward manner, unlike CR which is only suitable for the linear and geometric scales.

The proposed measures are illustrated through examples, and it is concluded that the two matrices showing individual congruence and dissonance can be used to locate and (possibly) correct inconsistent (and/or outlying) judgments. The given examples have suggested measuring consistency as a pair of values i.e. (Θ, Ψ). It is suggested that the use of these matrices should form a useful addition to PC-based decision support tools. Further investigation is required to explore the properties of these two consistency measures. For example, the threshold of acceptance/rejection for (Θ, Ψ) should be investigated for different scales. A numerical comparison with other measures should be performed in order to compare these thresholds.
