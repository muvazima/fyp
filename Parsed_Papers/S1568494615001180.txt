                  In this paper, an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) to generate a simple and well defined TSK model is proposed. The approach is derived from the use of the improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2), where the genes of the chromosome are arranged into control genes and parameter genes. These genes are in a hierarchical form so that the control genes can manipulate the parameter genes in a more effective manner. In our approach, we first apply the back-propagation algorithm to optimize the parameters of the model (parameters of membership functions and fuzzy rules), then we apply the SPEA-2 to optimize the number of fuzzy rules, the number of parameters and to fine tune these parameters.
                  Two well-known dynamic benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our modeling approach outperforms some methods proposed in previous work.
