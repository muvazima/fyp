                  In this paper, we develop a set of mathematical models to examine and compare different pricing and launch strategies of electronic books (e-books) under two types of copyright arrangements, namely the royalty and buyout arrangements. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess how various market structure parameters influence the publisher's pricing options in different copyright, launch modes, and channels of distribution. Aimed at gaining managerial insights into the complex issues in pricing and launch strategies involving e-books, we recommend optimal launch strategies and pricing decisions for the e-book supply chain.

                        “The printed word is in the midst of a revolution. Digital books are gaining ground on their dog-eared, bookmarked counterparts and experts predict e-books could seriously challenge traditional tomes in just two years. By 2012, three in every 10 books could be delivered digitally, according to booksellers, and publishers are fuelling the transition by adding more back-catalogue books and story types to the mix. After a slow start, the e-book revolution is now well under way” (Herald Sun on 05 January 2011).

The fast penetration of electronic commerce in the publication industry has profoundly transformed the structure of the book market, and stimulated a tremendous growth in the industry. While the printed book (p-book) sales have steadied or even plummeted, particularly in some countries, such as Japan and China (Economist, 2007; Du8.com, 2010), the electronic book (e-book) sales in recent years are soaring. As the International Digital Publishing Forum reported, e-book sales were up from US$6 million in 2002 to US$20 million in 2006 and reached a staggering US$31.7 million in 2007 registering a 23.6 percent growth over 2006 (Vasileiou, Hartley, & Rowley, 2009). The worldwide e-book sales grew more than two folds between February 2010 and February 2011 (Sporkin, 2011), and it is projected to account for about half of the total book sales by the year 2020 and around 90 percent of total book sales by the year 2030 (Ojala, 1998).

The prosperous yet diversified book markets provide great business opportunities while also bring up challenges to the stakeholders involved in the book supply chain. The major issues for the book supply chain to resolve in recent years include: the format of the book, the selection of delivery channel, launch timing for different channels, the access platform, and the pricing policy. Among these, timing of launch and pricing of e-books are two most important challenges to the book marketers. As Ojala (1998) points out “The greatest enigma in the online world remains pricing and it's amazing that, after a quarter-century of information being sold online, no one has a definitive pricing model.” Many publishers are trying out different pricing strategies to stay alive in the market and to compensate for their falling hard cover and paperback printed book sales revenue (Ming, 2000). Take Amazon, the most popular book seller in the world, as an example. One case is on simultaneous launch mode that Amazon simultaneously sells the hardcover and kindle edition of “Finger Lickin’ Fifteen”, the kindle edition of the book costs $22.36 and is $6.99 more than that for the hardcover version.

                      However, on book “The King of Kahel” (by Tierno Monénemb), whose paperback and electronic edition released simultaneously, Amazon priced the paperback edition at $15.95, which is more than the e-book at $9.99.

                      The other case is on lag launch mode, for example a thriller novel by Conrath in 2008, Amazon priced the paperback edition of the book at $14.9 while lag launched e-version of the book at $2.99.

                      Such a context raise a question being addressed in this research: how does the publisher optimize the timing of launch in terms of e-book and p-book, and in different launch modes, what is the pricing strategy the publisher should apply in this context?

The electronic channel structure is undergoing a serious change as it attracts more and more retailers venturing into the electronic channel and adopting different sales and pricing models. Many factors, external and internal, such as markets, organizational structures, pricing and launch schedule, have significant impacts on the performance of the digital distribution of books. Often, these factors individually or in combination lead to conflicts of interests among the digital supply chain members. Therefore, it is critical to analyze how the retailers and publishers make the pricing and supply decisions in a dynamic e-book market. While the extant literature reports on analyses of pricing and distribution strategies of book distribution channels in isolation, to the best of our knowledge, no report is available that considers the pricing and launch strategies of different book distribution models in combination.

This paper is intended to present the analyses of the pricing and launch strategies of e-books adopted by the major stakeholders in the book supply chain, by mathematical modeling. We formalize the model with three important dimensions: centralized versus decentralized decision making in pricing a book, simultaneous versus lag launch of e-book and p-book, and royalty versus buyout copyright model. The combinations of these three pairs of factors can result in eight book selling patterns with differentiated pricing strategies. These theoretical models help analyze publishers’ and retailers’ launch and pricing strategies, and assess the sensitivity how the market structure parameters influence the publishers’ choice in different copyright and launch modes. These studies are aimed at gaining managerial insights into the complex issues involving pricing and launch strategies.

This is how rest of the paper is organized: in Section 2 we provide a brief background of existing book selling models with the relevant literature. The research problem is described in Section 3 followed by our theoretical models in Section 4. Our numerical study, and analyses of results are presented in Sections 5 and 6 respectively. We conclude with mention of few limitations and probable further extensions of this paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Qualitative studies on e-book have focused on topics such as e-book conception, related technology issues, comparison with p-book, and predicting the e-book market's future (Hua, Cheng & Wang, 2011; Mooney, 2001; Yong, 2009). Quantitative research has mostly looked at effects of piracy and digital rights management (DRM) on the price in e-books market. Sundararajan (2004) presents a model to analyze the strategic pricing choices of legal digital goods in the presence of piracy, and reports that a seller's optimal policy is either to provide the technologically maximal protection level against piracy, or to price discriminate at a strictly lower level of protection. This work was extended by Oestreicher-Singer and Sundararajan (2010) to analyze the strategic pricing choice of digital goods in the presence of a physical substitute in addition to a pirated version, and to examine the effect of having such a physical substitute alongside the pirated version. A related study of digital experience goods can be found in Khouja and Park (2007). Shiller and Waldfogel (2011) discuss other possible pricing schemes, including uniform pricing and bundling. All these above mentioned studies on digital pricing with the focus on piracy and digital rights management are conducted in the way similar to the competitive pricing problem in traditional dual-channel supply chain. Not many reports are found on dual-channel supply chain involving a digital or electronic channel of distribution which is the focus of this study.

Several studies in marketing literature consider the dual-channel competitive pricing scheme such as dual channel problem with prices competition (Kurata, Yao, & Liu, 2007), dual retail channel problem with price and non-price competition (Iyer, 1998), dual retail channel problem with price and service competition (Tsay & Agrawal, 2000), and dual-channel coordination in the presence of dominant retailer (Raju & Zhang, 2005). However, differing from the previous dual and/or multiple retailing channel analysis, we consider a mixed system where the publisher (manufacturer) sells the e-book directly, and distributes the p-book through the traditional retailer, and we discuss decision sequences derived from the publishing model for both types of books.

There is a plethora of papers on dual-channel supply-chain design in the operation management (OM) literature. Balasubramanian (1998) presents a formal analysis of conflict between the direct and traditional channel via a mail versus mall dual-channel problem. Yao and Liu (2005) examine the pricing equilibrium between a manufacturer with an e-tail channel and retail channel under two types of competitive pricing schemes, and specifically investigate the demand diffusion between the e-tail channel and retail channel. Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess (2003) develop a pricing-setting model between a manufacturer and its independent retailer for studying the dual-channel design with customer acceptance of direct channel. Bernstein, Song, and Zheng (2009) discuss the free riding phenomenon in multi-channel supply chain. Matsui (2012) investigates a channel design problem concerning whether duopolistic firms competing in a product market should vertically integrate or separate their marketing channels. In this paper, we model the dual channel design in the book supply chain, and discuss the book publishing order in the electronic channel and traditional retail channel. Furthermore, we consider the competitive pricing policy in different copyright models, publishing models, and market structures.

Our work is also related to the study of pricing policy in dual channel. Chun and Kim (2005) analyze pricing strategies between conventional offline firms and online firms, and particularly examine the effect of the market size and product characteristics on price differences between offline and online channels. They find that under certain conditions, the prices in online firms tend to be higher than in conventional offline firms. Cattani, Gilland, and Swaminathan (2006) investigate a manufacturer's pricing strategy when adding a direct channel and suggest that a selected-wholesale-price equal-pricing strategy is optimal. Hua, Wang, and Cheng (2010) also study a similar dual channel problem with delivery lead time, and find delivery lead time strongly influences the manufacturer's and the seller's pricing strategies. Yao and Liu (2005) extend a dual channel problem to analyze the price competition in both Bertrand and Stackelberg game models. Tsay and Agrawal (2000) discuss the pricing Nash competition between two downstream retailers, and service competition. However, this range of research is limited to the traditional dual-channel supply chain. In our context, e-book is different from the general product in a sense that it almost has indefinite capacity with no inventory and with almost non-existent variable production cost. In particular, the e-book has the problem of special copyright issue, and DRM has a significant financial impact on the e-book price (2010). Therefore, the pricing policy of e-book in dual channel has to be considered in a different way from that of traditional books to a large extent. A more related recent study is by Hua et al. (2010), in which three distribution channel choices, p-book only, e-book only, and both are investigated. While most prior studies only consider two factors: reader acceptance of e-book, and the wholesale price of the counterpart printed book, we take into account the intrinsic features of the publishing industry, especially the royalty and buyout model of the copyright, into the pricing model. In addition, we discuss scenarios of simultaneous launch (same-day-launch) mode and the lag launch (delayed launch) mode.

Finally, this research is close to a study by Abhishek, Jerath, and Zhang (2012), that reports on what factors lead to the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and how these platforms impact various market participants, such as the manufacturers, electronic retailers, and consumers. Two contractual agreements widely used in electronic retailing, the reselling agreement, and the platform-selling agreement are compared. Under the platform-selling agreement it is the manufacturer who decides the price whereas the price is set by the e-tailer under the reselling agreement. Although our study considers the same two types of distribution channels combined with two types of pricing strategies (Abhishek et al., 2012), additionally we consider two types of book launch strategies in our model. Moreover, the study by Abhishek et al. (2012) is a generalized comparison between two contractual agreements in electronic channel, whereas we focus on royalty agreements specific to e-book market.

As mentioned in the first section, there are three important dimensions that characterize the book selling market structure: centralized versus decentralized decision making in pricing a book, simultaneous versus lag launch of e-book and p-book, and royalty versus buyout copyright model. These form eight combinations of book selling patterns, each having its specific optimal pricing strategy and equilibrium outcomes.

Usually, there are two kinds of decision-making modes for the book supply chain: the centralized decision-making mode and the decentralized decision-making mode. In the centralized decision-making mode, there is a central decision-maker who seeks to maximize the total profit of the supply chain. Generally, the publisher is the sole decision maker in the market for printing, releasing and selling both e-books and p-books. However, in the decentralized mode, both the supplier (the publisher) and the retailer (the p-book seller, referred to as seller hereafter) make decisions independently to maximize their own profits. The seller makes decisions on pricing of p-book sales after franchising the business from the publisher for releasing the p-book. The sum of their individual profits is usually less than the maximum total profit of the supply chain in the centralized decision-making mode due to the well-known double marginalization phenomenon (Huang, Yu, Wang, & Wang, 2006). A good example of this is Amazon, the largest book online retailer with its own publishers, which sells the e-book released by Amazon publishing while the latter keeps selling the p-book though others retailers, such as Barnes & Noble, and Borders.

The issue of simultaneous versus lag launch is related to the timing of release of an e-book with respect to its printed version. As the digital edition may very well impact on the demand for the p-book, different release timings of the electronic version of the same book can result in different pricing decisions. For example, Random House, the world's largest publisher of consumer books, adopted a standard practice to release digital and the hard cover edition simultaneously (Rich & Stone, 2009). Sellers such as Amazon have set the standard selling price for e-book, where the publisher can only decide the release of a book in other formats. For instance, while launching Kindle, Amazon discounted a whole lot of available e-books to $9.99 or less and was successful in gaining a lead in e-book market. In countries like China, e-book is usually launched six months or more after p-book is published at one quarter of price of the p-book or even less. This lag launch (publishing the e-book after the p-book) model even with the low pricing strategy seems to have seriously hampered the market penetration of the e-book. In this paper, we address a core issue – how to make optimal decisions on the release and pricing of e-book sold in different distribution channels with an aim to increase market penetration while protecting the benefits of all stakeholders including publishers, and sellers.

The copyright models, including royalty model and the buyout model (Pike, 2001), affect the pricing decisions of the book publisher and seller in different ways. While the buyout model is relatively easy to handle, which can be regarded as a fixed total cost to a book's publication, the royalty payment is an important factor in addition to the pricing and launch timing of the e-book. Generally, for a fixed percentage of royalty, authors would prefer a high book price or sales volume to maximize their income and the publishers would also want a higher price and sales volume for the book to maximize their profit. Therefore, as long as authors and publishers negotiate the royalty percentage, there is no conflict of interests between them. For this study, we only consider the royalty and buyout model on the e-book.

                           In USA, e-book royalty rate is generally higher than that of p-book, in the publishing contract between the publisher and authors, the p-book royalty rate usually is 5–15%, and the e-book royalty rate is 50% almost (refer to http://www.authorsguild.org/authorship/e-book-royalty-math-the-house-always-wins-2/). For traceability, in our analysis we assume that p-book royalty is zero, and e-book royalty is r.
                        
                     

Let us consider two types of channel marketing structure dealing in both p-book and e-book sales, as shown in Fig. 1
                        .
                           6
                        
                        
                           6
                           Another book selling channel structure is also commonly seen in practice, that is the book publisher sells both e-book and p-book through the seller. This channel marketing structure is similar with centralized model (left), and our results can be extended to this channel structure easily, and still suitable.
                         The structure on the left represents a supply chain that involves a single market player, a publisher, and the other structure involves two market players, a publisher and a seller. In the single player market (i.e., the centralized decision-making structure), the publisher sells p-books at retail price p
                        1 while selling e-books at price p
                        2 online. The market with two players (i.e., the decentralized decision-making structure), represents a traditional supply chain structure in which a publisher prints and sells p-books to a seller at a wholesale price w.

                           7
                           Generally, there are two business models between the book publisher and the seller, wholesale model, and agency model (Iyer, 1998). For simplicity, we only focus on the wholesale model in this paper.
                         The seller then sells the p-books to consumers (or readers) at price p
                        1 while the publisher keeps selling e-books exclusively online at price p
                        2 directly to readers.
                           8
                        
                        
                           8
                           The setting that the publisher charges the seller a wholesale price derives from the assumption that the publisher possesses sufficient power to set its own wholesale price, and that it knows how much its seller will order at any given wholesale price, this also means that the knowledge of the seller's reaction function enables the publisher to set its wholesale price to maximize its own profit taking into consideration the seller's reaction to any wholesale price and conditional on publisher's decisions.
                        
                     

Both versions of books, p-book and e-book, have their own stable demand group. Because of different pricing strategies between the two retail channels, there are demand transfers between the two channels. Therefore, channel coordination plays an important role in the reduction of channel conflict (Cachon, 2003; Ingene & Parry, 2004). Each kind of book faces a downward sloping demand curve of the following form Di
                         = fi
                        (p
                        1, p
                        2), where Di
                         is the quantity sold for either the p-book and e-book, subscripts 1 and 2 represent the p-book and e-book respectively; and p
                        1 and p
                        2 are prices for the p-book and e-book. This demand form reflects the pricing of both kinds of books in the following key ways.
                           9
                        
                        
                           9
                           The books’ interdependence reflects the existence of underlying preferences of consumers for one kind of book over the other, which we do not model explicitly. These can be due, for example, to portability, distance to book store, or book collection. However, such loyalties are not absolute, and can be overcome by sufficiently compelling price differentials. The key ramification is that firms engage in direct competition in pricing on e-book and p-book.
                         (i) each book demand is decreasing in its own price, and (ii) each book's price increase can only increase the its rival's demand. We have the following linear price-dependent demand formulas (see McGuire & Staelin, 1983):

Note that if the parameter θ in (3) and (4) is different, then the discussion is similar and the results derived subsequently are still suitable. More specifically, the value of θ indicates the product substitutability. The demands of the two book versions are independent when θ is zero, and when θ approaches one, the two versions of the book are perfectly substitutable for each other. Similar approaches to modeling price effect have been used in a number of other papers (e.g., Bass, 1996; Tsay & Agrawal, 2000; Yao & Liu, 2005 and reference within), this linear demand structure can meet well the demand diffusion effect between the p-book and e-book channels.

To simplify the variations of models in differentiated parameters, we present the models in four types in terms of different dimensions of copyright and decision-making. The effects of e-book launch timing are discussed in each of the four derivations of the models: the royalty models in the centralized/decentralized decision making situations and the buyout models in centralized/decentralized decision making situations.

The royalty, in this paper, is referred to as a usage-based payment for the ongoing use of a book's copyright, which is paid to the authors of the book from the revenue of each book sale. It directly affects the profit of the publisher and hence subsequently the price of the book.

In the decentralized situation, there are two launch strategies: simultaneous launch, and lag launch. In the first launch strategy, the p-book and the e-book are released or launched simultaneously, where the publisher sells p-book to the seller as a wholesale and sells e-book to readers directly, then the publisher and the seller together make decisions on the prices of the p-book and e-book simultaneously. In case of the lag launch strategy, the publisher first decides the wholesale price for the p-book sold to the seller and e-book price to readers. Then, the seller retails the p-book to readers and makes decision at the p-book retail price.

First, we study the royalty model with the simultaneous launch strategy. The profit of the seller is expressed as:

                              Remark
                              The lag launch mode contains two situations according to whether or not the publisher informs the reader its e-book launching plan, (i) the publisher does not inform the readers its e-book launching plan, and the seller does not change its p-book pricing decisions after e-book published. Otherwise, if the seller adjusts its p-book pricing decisions, then this problem becomes a two-period problem, in the first period, the seller sells p-book in terms of demand model D
                                 1 = 1 − p
                                 1 + ɛ1, and in the second period, both e-book and p-book competes in terms of demand (3) and (4). (ii) The publisher informs the reader its e-book launching plan, thus this problem is consistent with the simultaneous launch mode. In this paper, we focus on case (i) when the seller does not adjust its p-book pricing decisions after e-book published.

We compute the optimal decisions by backward induction. First we compute the e-book price p
                           2, then compute the p-book price p
                           1, and finally determine the wholesale price w of p-book.

                                 In the royalty model with decentralized decision making, the wholesale price of the p-book w is an increasing function of factor θ and a decreasing function of royalty r.
                              

In the simultaneous launch mode, taking the first-order derivative of w on θ and r respectively, we have:

                                 In the royalty model with decentralized decision making, the p-book price p1 and the e-book price p2 are both increasing in the demand diffusion factor θ and royalty r.
                              

We first consider the simultaneous launch model. On the one hand, from (8), we can prove that p
                                 2 is an increasing function of w. Furthermore, since it is proved in Proposition 1 that w is an increasing function of factor θ, the e-book price p
                                 2 is an increasing function of demand diffusion factor θ too. Similarly, the p-book price p
                                 1 is also an increasing function of factor θ.

On the other hand, taking the first-order derivatives of (7) and (8) on r respectively, we have:

We can easily show that the profit function (11) is strictly concave. So there exists a unique optimal solution or at least one pure strategy in this case. This further means that there exists a vector of prices pi
                            (i = 1, 2) that uniquely maximizes the profit function.

Based on the optimal pricing decisions of the p-book and e-book in the centralized decision situation, we get the relationship between the pricing and the royalty proportion.

                              Proposition 3
                              
                                 In the centralized royalty model, the publisher's optimal prices of the p-book and e-book will have the following properties:

                                          is irrelevant to the royalty r while the e-book price p
                                          2 
                                          is an increasing function of it.
                                       


                                          The p-book price p
                                          1 
                                          and the e-book price p
                                          2 
                                          are both increasing functions of the demand diffusion factor θ.
                                       

In this model, the publisher buys out the e-book copyright by paying one lump sum to the authors. If the cost for producing the first edition of the e-book is C
                        0 and the price for buying out the copyright of the book (whether it is e-book or p-book) is C, the total cost of the book will be C
                        0 + C. Just like the decision made on the royalty model, the cost to buy out the copyright is based on the price negotiated between the publisher and the author. As the decided price is not known, we assume it to be an exogenous variable.

Just like the royalty model, there are also two launch strategies in the decentralized decision situation: simultaneous launch and lag launch strategies. In the simultaneous launch strategy, the publisher wholesales the p-book to the seller at wholesale price w, leaving the seller to decide p-book retail price p
                           1. Simultaneously the publisher launches the e-book through the electronic channel at price p
                           2 as the p-book is released.

The seller's profit function is:

Since the decisions are sequential, we compute the optimal decisions by backward induction. First we compute the e-book price p
                           2, then compute the p-book price p
                           1, and finally determine the wholesale price w of the p-book. Thus, similar to the computation method of the royalty model with the lag launch strategy, we can get

                                 In the buyout model with decentralized decision making, the wholesale price w is an increasing function of demand diffusion factor θ.
                              

First consider the model with the lag launch strategy. Taking the first order derivative of w with respect to θ, we have

                                 In the buyout model with decentralized decision making, the publisher's optimal prices of the p-book and the e-book satisfy the following properties:

In the buyout model with decentralized decision making, the buyout price does not take any effect either on the publisher's wholesale price or on the retail prices of e-book and p-book. However, comparing the royalty fee in the royalty model with the buyout price in the buyout model, we can find that the wholesale price in the buyout model is larger than that in the royalty model. The main reason is that in the royalty model, both e-book and p-book prices are positively affected by the rate of royalty payment. Hence, it is rational that the publisher adjusts these prices in accordance with the royalty payment rate changing.

In the centralized decision making model, the publisher owns both the e-tail channel and the retail channel, and is the sole decision maker of the p-book price and the e-book price. Moreover, there are also simultaneous and lag launch strategies in the centralized decision.

For the centralized buyout model with simultaneous launch strategy, the publisher's profit is:

                                 In the centralized buyout model, the p-book price and the e-book price hold the following properties:

                                          The p-book and e-book prices p1 and p2 are independent of the book's copyright buyout price C.
                                       


                                          The p-book and e-book prices p1 and p2 are increasing functions of the demand diffusion factor θ.
                                       

The proof of Proposition 6 is similar to that of Proposition 3.

                                    In this paper, we focus mainly on the release sequence of p-book and e-book, and do not study the specific time span that how long the e-book release lagged behind the p-book release. Here the ‘two periods’ is also conceptual.
                                 : In the first period, the publisher charges a relatively high price to recoup its costs (including copyright cost, production cost and release cost etc.), and in the second period the publisher marks down its book price. Our results reveals the situation in the second period when the copyright buyout price C does not affect both p-book and e-book price. Without loss of generality, we set a margin value

                                  (i = 1, 2), and in the first period the price 
                                    
                                       
                                          p
                                          i
                                       
                                       +

                                  can cover the book publisher’s and seller's total costs and target profits (see an example in Appendix B).

To further investigate the effect of the demand diffusion factor on the publisher and seller's choices of pricing and launch decisions, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis in this section. The parameter values were chosen in the following ranges:r ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9}, C ∈ {0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75}, C
                     0 ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, and θ ∈ (0, 0.9). Matlab 7.0 was used for conducting this numerical analysis. First, we tested the effect of market parameter on the publisher's choice of copyright model and launch mode. Then, we explored the impact of royalty and copyright buyout prices on the publisher's choice of copyright transfer. The simulated data used for carrying out the study are assumed to represent real-world conditions as close as possible, as of r = 0.6, C = 0.65, C
                     0 = 0.4, and θ ∈ (0, 0.9).

Here we study the impacts of the market demand factor on the publisher's choice of e-book launch mode and seller's marketing decision, and examine how the two market demand factors influence the publisher's choice of the e-book launch mode one step further. In the value graph, prefix L and S represent the profit functions under the lag launch mode and the simultaneous launch mode, respectively.

Based on the simulated results shown in Figs. 2
                         and 3
                         in the royalty and buyout model, both the publisher's and the seller's profits depend on the demand diffusion factor θ. Fig. 2 shows that in the royalty model, the publisher's profit function is an increasing function of the demand diffusion factor. The seller's profit function is also an increasing function when θ is less than a certain value, and then after the threshold value the seller's profit is decreasing with respect to θ. Fig. 3 shows that in the buyout model, both publisher's and seller's profits are increasing functions of the demand diffusion factor.

In Figs. 4
                         and 5
                        , the profit difference is defined as that of the profit in the simultaneous launch mode minus that in the lag launch mode, which can be used to indicate which launch mode is better under certain conditions. Fig. 4 shows that both the publisher and the seller will adopt the simultaneous launch mode if θ ≤ 0.54; however, when θ ≥ 0.67, the lag launch mode will be better for both. They will have different preferences when 0.54 ≤ θ ≤ 0.67. Therefore, in the royalty model, the optimal launch strategy of e-book is subject to change with the value of demand diffusion factor.

There are several possible outcomes regarding whether the selection of launch mode is negotiable between the publisher and the seller under different contractual structures. If the market is dominated by the publisher, the publisher will choose the mode that benefits him the most. If the market is more competitive, such as between different books, the publisher must take into account the satisfaction of the seller. In this case, in order to encourage the seller to choose the simultaneous launch mode, the publisher, may provide an incentive offer for the seller to adopt the mode. For example, the publisher may offer a portion Δ(θ) (

                        ) of the profit he makes to the seller. This will result in the piecewise pricing policy of the publisher in terms of different intervals of the demand diffusion factor values. However, this discussion is beyond the scope of this paper and can be explored later.
                     

As the profit difference curves in Fig. 5 indicate, in the buyout model, the publisher prefers the simultaneous launch strategy while the seller prefers the lagged one. Similar to the case in the royalty model, in order to encourage the seller choosing the simultaneous one, the publisher can compensate the seller with a certain revenue Δ(θ) (

                        ), this can make both the publisher and the seller better off.

We first analyze how the entire supply chain's profit changes with the demand factors of the p-book and the e-book. Then, we study how the demand factor affects the launch mode decision from the perspective of the entire supply chain. The results are shown in Figs. 6
                         and 7
                        .


                        Fig. 6 shows that in both copyright models, the profit of the entire supply chain is monotonously increasing with regard to the demand diffusion factor θ. In other words, the less differentiated the p-book and e-book channels are, the larger the overall book selling market is.


                        Fig. 7 shows the profit difference of the entire market regarding the demand diffusion factor between the simultaneous launch mode and the lag launch mode. The results in two different copyright models are presented for comparison. In the royalty model, when the demand diffusion factor is less than 0.66 (θ ≤ 0.66), the simultaneous launch mode is better from the perspective of the entire supply chain; otherwise, when
θ > 0.66, the lag launch mode performs better. Similarly, in the buyout model, the threshold becomes 0.89, in which the simultaneous launch mode outperforms the lagged launch mode from the perspective of entire supply chain. As the profit of the entire supply chain is composed of the profits of the publisher and the seller, the results of Fig. 7 demonstrate similar properties to that of Fig. 4.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Based on the results obtained from our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations in earlier sections, we present the relationship between the demand diffusion factor θ and the prices of the two formats of books as well as the profits of both the books in Table 1. The simple symbolic operations can be used for obtaining the relations between different models, prices, and profits in the channels explained in our findings 1–4.


                     Note: The symbol “NA”, “+”, “-” and “+/−” indicate “no relation”, “positive relation”, “negative relation” and “first positive relation, then negative relation”, respectively.

The following findings are intended to help analyzing the pricing strategies that the publisher and the seller adopt in different conditions.


                     Finding 1. In the centralized decision making, where the publisher is the only player in the market, the pricing strategies for the p-book in the royalty model and the buyout model are the same. However, the price of e-book in the royalty model will be higher than that in the buyout model.
                  

The buyout model is a one-off payment case where the publisher negotiates with the author for the buyout price of his/her book's copyright before launching the book (including p-book and e-book). Once the deal is made, the payment made for buying out the book becomes a sunk cost that does not take effect on the price of the e-book at all. So, in the buyout model, the centralized prices for these two formats of books are the same as the price without copyright issues. However, in the royalty model, the e-book launch price is relevant to the book's royalty price. When the royalty cost is high, the launch price of the e-book is usually high as well. For example, when Amazon sells the independently priced hardcover and kindle edition of a particular book at the same time, the e-version could be priced higher than p-version. For example, the kindle edition costs $22.36 with $6.99 more than the hardcover version (see the book example below).


                     
                        
                     
                  


                     Finding 2. The wholesale price of the p-book in the royalty model is higher than that in the buyout model, regardless which mode is adopted; similarly, the retail prices of both p-book and e-book in the royalty model are higher than those in the buyout model.
                  

Similar to the centralized decision making, the buyout cost in the buyout model being one-off payment and treated as a sunk cost will not take effect on the launch price of the e-book at all. However, the royalty cost is not paid one-off and upfront and is linked to the number of books sold. This method of payment to the authors benefits the publisher more, as in this case the publisher passes on a part of the royalty cost to downstream readers through appropriate pricing. At the same time, in the retail channel that sells the p-book, a portion of the royalty cost is passed onto the seller. In both channels, the publisher is not entirely responsible for payment of royalty which is directly linked with book sales.


                     Finding 3. In the decentralized situation, the wholesale price of the p-book under the lag launch mode is higher than that under the simultaneous launch mode.
                  

The lag launch of the e-book certainly offers a period of no competition to the p-book. Under the lag launch mode, generally the publisher could face the risk of lower demand for e-book since the p-book has taken most of the market demand in the lag phase. Foreseeing this situation, the publisher could issue a higher wholesale price for the p-version of a book, to depress the influence of the demand of the p-book on its e-version coming later. In this way, those who want to buy the same book in electronic version at lower price will less likely buy the printed version in the lag phase. This may avoid the risk of reduced demand for the e-book.


                     Finding 4. In the decentralized situation, the price difference between the p-book and the e-book under the lag launch mode is higher than that under the simultaneous launch mode.
                  

Under the simultaneous launch mode, the optimal launch price of e-book is only slightly less than the price of p-book, whereas the launch price of e-book is substantially less than the price of p-book under the lag launch mode. Since under the lag launch mode, “Demand-steal Effect” exists in p-book sales during the lag phase where most readers’ demand will be met by p-book, after the lag phase the publisher will choose the low price marketing strategy for the e-book. For example, in 2008 when Amazon launched a thriller novel by Conrath, it priced the paperback edition of the book $14.9 while priced the lag launched e-version of the book $2.99. In 2010, Amazon released the paperback and the electronic edition of the rewarded novel “The King of Kahel” by Tierno Monénemb simultaneously. This time, the paperback edition was priced at $15.95 whereas the lag launched e-book was $9.99.

Under the lag launch mode, while higher p-book sales may yield higher marginal revenue, this seriously influences the demand and pricing of e-book. Therefore, based on the result of the example analysis, it is worth of studying the relationship between the demand diffusion factor and the launch mode of the e-book, as is presented in Table 2
                      and pertinent to Findings 5 and 6.


                     Finding 5. In the royalty model, the publisher's choice of the e-book launch mode is influenced by the demand diffusion factor. In the buyout model, the optimal launch strategy for the publisher is the simultaneous launch.
                  

In the royalty model, when the demand diffusion factor is low, the interaction between the p-book and e-book market is low, implies the low substitution effect of the demands. In this case, the publisher could choose to launch the e-book at the same time the p-book is launched. In contrast, when the demand diffusion factor is high, the simultaneous launch of the e-book will much influence sales of the p-book. Then, the publisher can adopt the lag launch mode and sell the e-book at a low price. In the buyout model, the optimal decision for the publisher is to adopt the simultaneous launch mode. Thus, the publisher can improve the profit of the retail channel while avoiding the “Demand-steal Effect” of the p-book caused by the e-book lag launch.


                     Finding 6. For the total profit of entire supply chain, in both the royalty model and the buyout model, the publisher's choice of the e-book launch mode depends on the demand diffusion factor.
                  

In these two copyright models, the integral profit of the supply chain is an increasing function of the demand diffusion factor. Moreover, in these two models, which launch modes are chosen depends on the demand diffusion factor. When the demand diffusion factor is low, the simultaneous launch mode should be adopted from the perspective of the entire supply chain, otherwise, the lag launch mode would be better. More importantly, since the royalty and the buyout payment of the copyright are exogenous variables, it is difficult to compare between the profits in these two copyright models with different launch strategies.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we studied the launch strategy and the optimal pricing of the e-book in different copyright arrangements – the royalty, and the buyout models. In both the simultaneous and lag launch modes, we found that the wholesale price of the p-book in the royalty model is higher than that in the buyout model, and the launch price in the royalty model is higher than that in the buyout model. Furthermore, in the simultaneous launch mode, the launch price of the e-book is slightly less than the retail price of the p-book whereas it is substantially less in the lag launch mode. Based on the theoretical and numerical analyses, we recommend that the simultaneous launch mode is the optimal choice for the publisher in either of the copyright contexts.

There are few limitations in this paper. We assumed the royalty and the buyout payments for the copyright to be exogenous. In reality, these expenses are decided by the negotiation between the publisher and the author. Further studies can be conducted to investigate how the negotiated payments affect the publisher's choice of launch and pricing strategies. Moreover, this paper only investigates the pricing decision of the e-book between the publisher and the seller, while the marketing of the e-book in the electronic channel is usually handled by the third-party in practice. In this case, the revenue or profit sharing agreement becomes different and analyzing the entire supply chain's profit may suggest some interesting strategies that the supply chain members may choose to adopt. This may be another interesting issue for further research in this direction. In addition, we only consider the wholesale model between the book publisher and seller, while the agency model is also popular in practice, which could present interesting opportunities for future research. Another perspective is that the publisher informs the readers about its e-book launching plan, in this case, how do strategic readers make their purchasing decisions, to buy p-book in advance or wait to buy e-book later? In general, we believe that strategic consumer behavior is a fruitful research topic.

Refer to the rescaling method of McGuire and Staelin (1983), we analyze the demand function in details as below. For given demand functions (1) and (2), because each kind of product is assumed to have constant variable manufacturing and selling costs per unit m' and s', respectively, and marginal costs should not exceed prices and quantities should be non-negative, the prices which are allowable in this model are restricted to the set

To see this, note that total demand is obtained by adding (1) and (2), yielding

Hence the total demand is not affected by variation in either of product differentiation. However, to insure that the total demand not increase with increase in either price requires that the coefficients of p
                     1 and p
                     2 in D
                     1 + D
                     2 be nonnegative. These restrictions will be satisfied if the relative product preference parameter α is bounded by two functions of the substitutability parameter, i.e.,

                                       +

                                 ≤
                                 α
                                 ≤
                                 
                                    1
                                    
                                       1
                                       +
                                       θ
                                    
                                 
                                 .
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Thus α is constrained to lie in an interval symmetric around 0.5. This interval is greatest when θ = 0, in which case it is [0, 1]; it is the pint 0.5 when θ = 1.

Finally, the discussion above implicitly assumes that changes in θ affect the rates of change of quantities with respect to both prices. However, it is also possible to represent the situation where own-price rate of change does not vary with changes in θ. To show this, the model can be reparamterized by defining β = β/(1 − θ). If there is no functional relationship between β and θ, then β can be defined constant as θ varies. Consequently, as θ increases, the constraint on p
                     1and p
                     2 rotate as above but do not shift. As θ approaches unity, these constraints become parallel with intercept of 1/β and − 1/β, respectively. In other words, a high degree of substitutability does not force prices to equality if the own-price elasticity remains bounded. Which situation better mirrors reality in a particular industry is an empirical question; our model will accommodate either.

The model as specified contains six parameters: α, β, θ, m', s', and D. By rescaling prices and quantities, without loss of generality this structure can be expressed as a system with only one parameter.

Equation on D'1 and D'2 redefine quantities in new unit, D'
                        i
                     , where the rescaling is based on the parameters of the model. Rescaling prices p'
                        i
                      are obtained by multiplying variable gross profit pi
                      − m' − s' by the factor β/[η(1 − θ)].

Rewriting the demand functions (1) and (2) in terms of the rescaled prices and quantities yields a demand structure which is a function of only the single parameter θ as follows

By generalize the parameters in the above demand functions, we can obtain the demand functions (3) and (4).

We now take the buyout model with lag launch strategy as an example to study publisher’s and seller's book pricing problems. We assume that in the first period both firms’ objective is to recoup their costs, rather than to maximize their profits (i.e., the objective in the second period).

Note that we have obtained the publisher’s and seller's optimal book prices as given
