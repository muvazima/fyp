                  For a given set of nodes in the plane the min-power centre is a point such that the cost of the star centred at this point and spanning all nodes is minimised. The cost of the star is defined as the sum of the costs of its nodes, where the cost of a node is an increasing function of the length of its longest incident edge. The min-power centre problem provides a model for optimally locating a cluster-head amongst a set of radio transmitters, however, the problem can also be formulated within a bicriteria location model involving the 1-centre and a generalised Fermat-Weber point, making it suitable for a variety of facility location problems. We use farthest point Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to provide a complete geometric description of the min-power centre of a finite set of nodes in the Euclidean plane when cost is a quadratic function. This leads to a new linear-time algorithm for its construction when the convex hull of the nodes is given. We also provide an upper bound for the performance of the centroid as an approximation to the quadratic min-power centre. Finally, we briefly describe the relationship between solutions under quadratic cost and solutions under more general cost functions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most important problems in the optimal design of wireless ad hoc radio networks is that of power minimisation. This is true during the physical design phase and when designing efficient routing protocols (Montemanni, Leggieri, & Triki, 2008; Yuan & Haugland, 2012; Zhu, Huang, Chen, & Wang, 2012). The most appropriate fundamental model in both cases is the power efficient range assignment problem, where a communication range r
                     
                        i
                      is assigned to each transmitter x
                     
                        i
                      such the resultant network is connected and that total power 
                        
                           ∑
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 α
                              
                           
                        
                      is minimised (see Althaus et al., 2006). The exponent α is called the path loss exponent and most commonly takes a value between 2 and 4, with α
                     =2 corresponding to transmission in free-space. In this paper we study a type of power efficient range assignment problem which allows for the introduction of a single additional transmitter in the plane. We show that this formulation is related to a continuous version of the cent-dian problem (Colebrook & Sicilia, 2007) from location analysis, and present a geometric method (based on farthest point Voronoi diagrams) of constructing the optimal solution when α
                     =2.

The classical range assignment problem, which does not include the option of introducing new transmitters, is a type of disk covering problem, where the centres of the disks are given nodes, the radii (r
                     
                        i
                     ) of the disks are transmission ranges, and the directed graph induced by the disks must satisfy a given connectivity constraint (for instance strong connectivity, biconnectivity, etc.) whilst minimising 
                        
                           ∑
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 α
                              
                           
                        
                     ; see Fig. 1
                     (a), where the graph drawn is not necessarily optimal. Observe that graphs that result from some assignment of ranges are similar to unit-disk graphs, except that the disks do not all have the same radius in our case. For any α
                     >1 the range assignment problem is NP-hard, even in the case when only 1-connectivity is required of the resultant network (Fuchs, 2008).

The idea of extending the classical range assignment problem by allowing the introduction of additional transmitters is justified because, during the design or maintenance of ad hoc radio networks, it is often pertinent to introduce relays or cluster-heads for the processing of aggregated data and for the improved routing efficiency that takes place in such hierarchical structures (see Dhanaraj & Murthy, 2007; Paul & Matin, 2011; Shi, Jia, & Hai tao, 2009). Solving the range assignment problem whilst allowing for the introduction of a bounded number of additional nodes anywhere in the plane constitutes a very general and highly applicable geometric network problem, which has only been solved in certain restricted settings (see for instance Brazil, Ras, & Thomas, 2012; Brazil, Ras, & Thomas, 2010). Since the optimal locations of the cluster-heads must be found, as well as the optimal assignment of ranges on the complete set of nodes, this so called geometric range assignment problem is at least as difficult as the classical range assignment problem. Note that this problem is a type of continuous location problem, since the cluster-heads are free to be located anywhere in the plane.

This paper considers the problem of optimally locating a single cluster-head amongst a given set of transmitters, where each transmitter can send and receive data directly to and from the cluster-head. Not only is this an interesting and applicable model in it own right, but it is also a necessary first step in understanding the local structure of optimal networks with multiple cluster-heads. The graph induced by the assignment of ranges, in this case, contains an undirected star with the cluster head as its centre and the complete set of transmitters as its leaves; see for instance Fig. 1(b), where the white node represents a cluster-head.

In more formal terms we denote the given finite set of transmitters by

                        s

                      is a generalised Fermat-Weber problem (Brimberg & Love, 1999), which becomes the classical Fermat-Weber problem when α
                     =1 and the problem of constructing the centroid when α
                     =2.

A concept in facility location that is related to the min-power problem is the computation of the centre-median (or cent-dian) of a finite set of points (Colebrook & Sicilia, 2007); although, strictly speaking, the cent-dian is only defined for α
                     =1. The cent-dian problem requires one to find the Pareto-optimal solutions to the vector function

                     =1/2 and by allowing other values of α besides α
                     =1. The cent-dian problem (with α
                     =1) has been considered in the rectilinear plane (McGinnis & White, 1978), and for α
                     =2 in the Euclidean plane (Ohsawa, 1999). Besides optimally locating a cluster-head amongst given transmitters, the cent-dian also has another application in wireless ad hoc networks, namely, finding a so called core node (Dvir & Segal, 2010). Bicriteria models such as the cent-dian have been described as seeking a balance between the antagonistic objectives of efficiency (i.e., the minisum component) and equity (i.e., the minimax component).

There are numerical methods, for instance the sub-gradient method, that optimally locate a min-power centre to within any finite precision. However, structural results for the min-power centre problem, of the type described in this paper, are necessary for optimally constructing more complex geometric range assignment networks (which is the overarching goal of our research). This fact is particularly manifest in the design of algorithmic pruning modules, where one develops strategies based on properties of locally optimal structures for eliminating suboptimal network topologies from the exponential set of possible topologies. The ultimate benefits of good pruning modules has been demonstrated a number of times for problems similar to the geometric range assignment problem (Brazil et al., 2012; Brazil et al., 2010; Warme, Winter, & Zachariasen, 2000).

In this paper we mostly focus on the quadratic case, α
                     =2, and develop a complete geometric description of the solution in terms of farthest point Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. In terms of cluster-head placement the α
                     =2 assumption means that radio transmission takes place in free space, that is, in an ideal medium with zero resistance. Path loss exponents close to 2 frequently occur in real-world wireless radio network scenarios. This is true for transmission in mediums of low resistance, and in mediums of higher resistance when there is a degree of beam forming (constructive interference) (Karl & Willig, 2007). The quadratic case also applies to certain classical facility location problems, including the location of emergency facilities such as hospitals and fire stations (Fernandez et al., 2001; Ohsawa, 1999; Puerto, Rodríguez-Chía, & Tamir, 2010). Furthermore, as demonstrated in the final section, it is anticipated that theoretical developments in the α
                     =2 case will lead to solutions and approximations for other α
                     >1.

Single-facility location problems under very general norms and convex cost functions have been studied by Durier (1995) and by Durier and Michelot (1985, 1994). Some of these formulations include the min-power problem as a special case, however, a constructive method of producing the min-power centre does not directly follow from their work. The principle contribution of the research presented by Durier and Michelot in these papers involves a description of the set of solutions to generalised Fermat-Weber problems, which is a feasible and interesting endeavour when the objective cost function is not strictly convex (as is the case with the min-power problem). Nickel, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2003) generalise this approach even further by allowing each given point (facility) to be replaced by a set of points, where an optimal centre is required to “serve” at least one point from each given set. A stochastic version of generalised single-facility location problems has also been studied (see Puerto & Rodríguez-Chía (2011)).

In Section 2 we provide definitions and set up a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker formulation of the min-power centre problem and its dual for any α
                     >1. When α
                     =2 the geometric construction of the min-power centre becomes tractable, allowing us to provide a characterisation of the solution in terms of the farthest point Voronoi diagram on X, and its dual, the farthest point Delaunay triangulation. This characterisation is described in Section 3, where we also present a new linear-time algorithm for the construction of the optimal quadratic min-power centre. For α
                     =2, Section 4 explores the significance of the centroid and the 1-centre of a set of points for the min-power centre problem, and provides a characterisation of point sets for which the min-power centre and the 1-centre coincide. Section 4 also provides a bound for the performance of the centroid as an approximation to the min-power centre. The final section briefly explores the general α
                     >1 case.

                     +1 of the objective function. In general, the restriction on domain specified by Inequality (5) leads to a non-trivial variation on the minimum spanning circle problem, however, as shown in the next section, for α
                     =2 there exists an interesting and useful geometric relationship between the minimum spanning circle problem and the min-power centre problem.

In order to study the geometry of the case where α
                     =2 we first rewrite the KKT conditions in terms of the 2-centroids of X.

Observe that 
                        
                           M
                        
                      is the image of an affine transformation on X. A consequence of this observation is the following lemma. Let conv (·) denote the convex hull of a set of points. By two planar polygonal regions being similar we mean that they have corresponding sides, all of which are in proportion.

                                 conv

                           is similar to conv (X), and M is the centroid of 
                           
                              
                                 M
                              
                           
                           . For any j the point M
                           
                              j
                            
                           divides the line segment Mx
                           
                              j
                            
                           into a ratio of 1:n (see 
                           Fig. 2
                           , where the M
                           
                              j
                            
                           are grey-filled circles).
                        

For any X′⊆conv (X) we denote the image of X′ under the above affine transformation by ψ(X′), which is a subset of 
                        
                           conv
                           (
                           M
                           )
                        
                     . We also similarly employ ψ
                     −1 for the inverse transformation.

In the quadratic case (where α
                     =2) we now write

                      contains a vertex of degree more than 3 then

                      is not unique; in this case we let 
                        
                           D

A b-face of

                     b
                     ⩽2. Therefore a 0-face is a vertex, a 1-face is an edge, and a 2-face is a region of 
                        
                           V

                      defines a natural mapping from each b-face of 
                        
                           D

                     . In Fig. 3 the 0-face x of 
                        
                           D
                        
                      maps to the 2-face V(x) of 
                        
                           V
                        
                     , and the 2-face D of 
                        
                           D
                        
                      maps to the 0-face V

                      of

                     . Observe that dual 1-faces are always perpendicular to each other. If the maximum degree of 
                        
                           V
                        
                      is at most 3 then the mapping between faces is a bijection. In the case of vertices of degree more than 3 we still get a bijection if we consider every such vertex as consisting of a number of degree 3 vertices connected by zero-length edges, where the topology is uniquely determined by the choice of 
                        
                           D
                        
                     . The unique pairs in the bijection will be referred to as dual faces. For any b-face D of 
                        
                           D
                        
                      we denote by V

                        D

Observe in Fig. 3 that there exists a Delaunay triangle D
                     1 that strictly contains its dual face in 
                        
                           V
                        
                     , depicted by the unlabelled empty circle. As will become clear below, this dual relationship is unique and, in fact, the unlabelled empty circle is the centre of the minimum spanning circle (called the 1-centre) of X. We will show that something similar holds for the min-power centre problem.

Before proving the main theorem, we note that it is often the case when solving minimax non-linear programs that a complete solution can be arrived at by considering the various combinations of functions which are potentially active at the optimal solution. Hence we introduce the following lemma which allows us to restrict the number of combinations.

                     Fig. 4
                      illustrates the three different cases that arise based on the number of active functions at s
                     ∗. When ∣Λ∣=1 then s
                     ∗
                     ∈ri (V(x
                     
                        j
                     )) for some j. Therefore we can find s
                     ∗ by simply solving ∇ F
                     
                        j
                     (s)=0. Also, by Ohsawa (1999) the point s
                     ∗ must lie on the line joining M to the node of X farthest from M, say x
                     
                        r
                     . The next lemma now follows immediately from these observations.

                      to represent the node of X farthest from M will hold throughout the rest of this paper. Using Theorem 6 it is possible to design a fast geometric algorithm for finding s
                     ∗.

Ohsawa’s algorithm (Ohsawa, 1999) for finding the efficient solutions to the vector minimisation problem v-min Φ(s), where Φ(s)= (max{∥s
                     −
                     x
                     
                        j
                     ∥},F(s)), can also find s
                     ∗. There is no theoretical gain in the runtime of our algorithm over the algorithm of Ohsawa, but with modifications our algorithm should perform better in practice. We provide an intuitive reason for this as follows. As is well-known, for any set of n points X the expected number of points that are extreme points of conv (X) is O(log
                     n). Therefore the expected complexity of the farthest point Voronoi diagram does not increase very quickly as n increases. Now both M and s
                     ∗ are in 
                        
                           conv
                           (
                           M
                           )
                        
                     , but 
                        
                           conv
                           (
                           M
                           )
                        
                      becomes smaller the more we increase n (note that 
                        
                           M
                        
                      is contained in a disk of radius

                                 1
                              
                           
                           ‖
                           M
                           -
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 r
                              
                           
                           ‖
                        
                     ). Therefore we suggest that if we modify our algorithm so that it begins by checking edges and vertices of 
                        
                           V
                        
                      close to M, that the expected number of steps before s
                     ∗ is found will be small for large n. In contrast, for a fixed polygon representing a convex hull, and a fixed point in the polygon representing a centroid, the cardinality of a set X with this convex hull and centroid will not affect the practical runtime of Ohsawa’s algorithm. Of course, Ohsawa’s algorithm could also be modified to begin with points close to M, but his paper presents no theoretical justification for doing this.

It is clear from the results so far that the centroid M plays a central role in the min-power centre problem when α
                     =2. In particular, it is intuitive that M is always relatively close to the min-power centre, s
                     ∗, since both lie in 
                        
                           conv
                           (
                           M
                           )
                        
                     . This fact leads to a theorem at the end of this section which places an upper bound on the performance ratio of approximating the min-power centre by the centroid. The fact that M is a “special” point in the min-power centre problem was also observed in Ohsawa (1999), where it is shown that any Pareto optimal solution to the vector minimisation problem v-min Φ(s) lies on a simple path connecting M and the 1-centre of X (recall that Φ(s)=(P
                     
                        s

                     F(s)), where P

                     ). Interestingly, this path is piecewise linear, consisting of one segment joining M to a point on an edge of 
                        
                           V
                        
                     , and with the remainder of the path lying on the edges of 
                        
                           V
                        
                     . Since the min-power centre is Pareto optimal for v-min Φ(s) it follows that s
                     ∗ is also on this path. This brings us to a second question: what role does the 1-centre play in the min-power centre problem? We will address this question next before returning to the discussion on M.

                           =conv (X
                           ∗) it follows from Lemma 8 that s

                           =
                           C as required.□

The converse of this result does not appear to hold, but, once again by the result of Ohsawa (1999) which says that s
                     ∗ lies on a path connecting M and C, it follows that M is the min-power centre of X if and only if M and C coincide.

Our final result on the role of C in the min-power centre problem relates to point sets X that are more or less evenly distributed (with respect to distance) about their centroid. The proof utilises the formulation of Problem D1′, which, as mentioned before, is almost exactly the dual of the minimum spanning circle problem except that the domain of the τ

The converse of this lemma is not true in general, however, by similar reasoning we have:

Therefore we have the following final result on C, which follows directly from the above discussion and lemma.
                        Proposition 12
                        
                           Suppose that C is equidistant from all points of X. Then C is the min-power centre of X if and only if 
                           
                              
                                 C
                                 ∈
                                 conv
                                 (
                                 M
                                 )
                              
                           
                           .
                        

In some sense it seems we cannot say anything about the location of s
                     ∗ without involving M. In fact, let Q be a polygon with at most n extreme points. For any point set X with convex hull Q, if there is no restriction on the location of M then there is no restriction on the location of s
                     ∗ (except, of course, that s
                     ∗ must lie in Q). We make this notion clear in the next proposition before closing the section with a proof that the centroid is a good approximation for the min-power centre.
                        Proposition 13
                        
                           For any point w
                           ∈
                           ri (conv (X)), where w is on a vertex or edge of 
                           
                              
                                 V
                              
                           
                           , there exists a set of points X′ such that the extreme points of conv (X) and conv (X′) coincide and such that the min-power centre of X′ is w.
                        

We demonstrate the case when w is in the interior of an edge e of 
                              
                                 V
                              
                           ; the other case is similar. Let X′ initially consist of the extreme points of conv (X) only. We introduce points to the interior of conv (X′) to get the final X′, which means that

                            throughout. Suppose that e is a portion of V(x

                           . The integer m can therefore be selected to be large enough so that the point y resulting from the subsequent value of ε will be in the convex hull of X.□

In the case when w from the previous proposition lies in the interior of a region of 
                        
                           V
                        
                     , a similar process will produce an optimal point arbitrarily close to w. It is also relatively straightforward to extend the proposition to the case where no two nodes may coincide, and to the case where all nodes of X′ are required to lie on the boundary of the convex hull of X. Any other interesting general restrictions on the location of s
                     ∗ that do not involve M would therefore probably be for sets of nodes in convex position (i.e., where every node is an extreme point). We leave this as an open question.

The centroid is very easy to calculate – it can be done in constant time given the locations of the x

                     To place an upper bound on ρ we first need a lemma. Recall once again that x
                     
                        r
                      is the farthest node from M.

                     ≠2 is complicated by the fact that the level curves of the F
                     
                        j
                      are no longer circular. In particular, this implies that there are no easily constructed and useful fixed points directly analogous to the M
                     
                        j
                     . Even though the farthest point Voronoi diagram still plays a crucial role for general α, there is no simple dual structure analogous to the Delaunay triangulation. We may consider 
                        
                           arg
                           
                              
                                 min
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                           
                           ∑
                           ‖
                           s
                           -
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 ‖
                              
                              
                                 α
                              
                           
                        
                      (the generalised Fermat-Weber point) as an analogue for M, however, a compass and straight-edge construction of this point is almost certainly impossible since even the classical Fermat-Weber point is, in general, not constructible in this way when n
                     >4 (see Bajaj, 1988).

This section will show, however, that not all insights gained for the α
                     =2 case are lost when α
                     ≠2. In fact, there are several important uses for the mathematical machinery developed in the preceding sections. Firstly, as discussed in the introduction, path loss exponents close to α
                     =2 often occur in real radio network scenarios. It seems evident that s
                     ∗ (and even M) will serve as a good approximation points for min-power centres based on α close to 2.

Also, some of the results from the previous section, especially those involving the 1-centre C, are directly applicable for any α
                     >1. The conceptual framework that we present for proving these results consists of transforming the set X into a new set X(s) such that the general α
                     >1min-power centre problem on X is transformed into the quadratic min-power centre problem on X(s). Preliminary research indicates that this framework will also be useful for the development of bounds on the performance of s
                     ∗ or the centroid as approximation points for general α.

We first state some notation and a lemma. Recall, from Section 2, that the power of the star G centred at s with leaf-set X and for a given α is denoted P
                     
                        α
                     (s,X), and that

                           ,
                           X

                           ,
                           X
                           )

                     . We also similarly generalise the definition of F(s) to F
                     
                        α
                     (s,X). The point minimising P
                     
                        α
                     (s,X) is now denoted by

                     . Next we describe the construction of the set X(s). Essentially, each vector x
                     
                        i
                     
                     −
                     s is transformed into a vector x
                     
                        i
                     (s)−
                     s such that ∥x
                     
                        i
                     
                     −
                     s∥
                        α−1
                     =∥x
                     
                        i
                     (s)−
                     s∥. The convex hull of the resultant set of nodes will therefore contain the convex hull of X when α
                     ⩾2, with the inverse of this property holding when α
                     <2. In formal terms, for any point s let x
                     
                        i
                     (s)=

                     s) and let X(s)={x

                     ∈
                     J}. Let M(s) be the centre of mass of X(s), and let M
                     
                        j
                     (s) be the jth 2-centroid of X(s). Some of these concepts are illustrated in Fig. 6
                      for the set X(s) with s
                     =

In this paper we solve the quadratic min-power centre problem in the Euclidean plane. We provide a complete geometric description and method of construction for the optimal point by means of farthest point Voronoi diagrams. The solution leads to various structural results relating the min-power centre to the centroid and the 1-centre, and, in particular, allows us to construct an explicit bound on the performance of the centroid as an approximation point. We anticipate that the mathematical machinery developed in this paper will be applied to an important fundamental model for the physical design of wireless ad hoc networks – namely the geometric range assignment problem where a bounded number of new nodes may be introduced anywhere in the plane. Preliminary research has demonstrated that the framework we develop in this paper will also be useful for problems with cost functions that are not quadratic.
