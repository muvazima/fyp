                  Generalized characteristic functions extend characteristic functions of ‘classical’ TU-games by assigning a real number to every ordered coalition being a permutation of any subset of the player set. Such generalized characteristic functions can be applied when the earnings or costs of cooperation among a set of players depend on the order in which the players enter a coalition.
                  In the literature, the two main solutions for generalized characteristic functions are the one of Nowak and Radzik (1994), shortly called NR-value, and the one introduced by Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), shortly called SB-value. In this paper, we introduce the axiom of order monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in a unanimity coalition, requiring that players who enter earlier should get not more in the corresponding (ordered) unanimity game than players who enter later. We propose several classes of order monotonic solutions for generalized characteristic functions that contain the NR-value and SB-value as special (extreme) cases. We also provide axiomatizations of these classes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Generalized characteristic functions on a player set N, introduced by Nowak and Radzik (1994), extend characteristic functions of ‘classical’ TU-games by assigning a real number to every ordered coalition of N. Here an ordered coalition of N is a permutation of any subset of N. Classical characteristic functions form the special class where the real number or worth assigned to any ordered coalition only depends on the players that are part of this ordered coalition, i.e. it does not matter in which order the players enter the coalition. Generalized characteristic functions can be used in situations where the worth (or cost) that can be generated by a set of players depends on the order in which the players enter.

Consider, for example, the airport games of Littlechild and Owen (1973) to allocate the building and maintenance costs of airport landing strips, see also Littlechild and Thompson (1977). An airport cost situation consists of a set of airplanes (being the players in the game) and for each airplane a nonnegative cost of the airline strip that is necessary for this airplane to land. Since the airplanes are different they need landing strips of different length. In the associated airport game, the worth of a coalition (being a subset of the set of airplanes N) is the cost of the airline strip needed for the largest airplane in this coalition (assuming that larger airplanes need longer and more expensive landing strips).
                        1
                        Instead of airplanes, in an airport game every airplane landing is a player but for convenience we simply call these airplanes.

                      But this means that building a landing strip of a certain size does not depend on the order in which the airplanes enter the coalition. The worth (cost) of a coalition is always fully determined by the cost for the largest airplane in the coalition. However, in real life construction industry it is usually more expensive to build a project in several steps than to build it fully at once. For example, when one wants to extend an existing landing strip then all the machinery has to be brought back to the airport, everything needs to be setup again, maybe some reconstruction or preparation needs to be done before being able to extend the existing landing strip. Then it would have been less costly to have built the longer landing strip at once. Therefore, instead of modelling an airport cost problem on n airplanes by an n-dimensional cost vector

Such an airport cost problem, where the cost of the landing strip depends on the order in which airplanes announce that they want to use the landing strip, cannot be modelled by a classical TU-game. Although the entrance of an airplane that is not larger than the largest airplane in the coalition does not change the worth, when an airplane larger than the largest airplane in the coalition enters, then the additional cost depends on which is the largest airplane in the already existing coalition. Such generalized airport cost problems can be modeled by a generalized characteristic function where the worth of an ordered coalition of airplanes is the cost of the landing strip if it would be built sequentially, in each step being large enough to allow the corresponding airplane to land.

In the literature, the two main solutions for generalized characteristic functions are the one of Nowak and Radzik (1994), which we will call the NR-value, and the one introduced by Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) and generalized in Sánchez and Bergantiños (2001), which we refer to as the SB-value. Both solutions extend the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) of classical TU-games in the sense that for a generalized characteristic function that represents a classical characteristic function they yield the Shapley value of that classical game.

                        The Shapley value is one of the most relevant solutions concept in cooperative game theory. Kamijo and Kongo (2012) compare this value with some other relevant ones. Moretti and Patrone (2008) is an excellent survey on the transversality of the Shapley value. Extensions of the Shapley value also have been considered in other generalizations of the standard TU-game model, for example for fuzzy games in e.g. Tsurumi, Tanino, and Inuiguchi (2001) and Li and Zhang (2009), games in partition function form in e.g. Grabisch and Funaki (2012), TU-games with awards in Lorenzo-Freire, Alonso-Meijide, Casas-Méndez, and Hendrickx (2007), and games where cooperation is restricted by certain combinatorial structures such as communication structures in Myerson (1980), probabilistic communication situations in Gómez, González-Arangüena, Manuel, and Owen (2008), convex geometries in Bilbao (1998), antimatroids in Algaba, Bilbao, van den Brink, and Jiménez-Losada (2003) and augmenting systems in Bilbao and Ordóñez (2009).

In this paper we criticize some axioms underlying these two solutions and we propose a new axiom, called order monotonicity, and use it to characterize a class of solutions that contains the NR-value and the SB-value as extreme cases. Moreover, we revisit the parametric family of geometric solutions for generalized characteristic functions introduced in del Pozo, Manuel, González-Arangüena, and Owen (2011) and we characterize it.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains preliminaries on games in generalized characteristic function and games with a permission structure. In Section 3 we introduce the new axiom of order monotonicity and use it to define a new class of solutions for games in generalized characteristic functions. In Section 4 we discuss the special class of the so-called geometric solutions. Finally, Section 5 contains concluding remarks.

                        Note that both the NR-value as well as the SB-value generalize the Shapley value for TU-games in the sense that they yield the Shapley value if the worth of every ordered coalition only depends on the players belonging to it.


                        Nowak and Radzik (1994) axiomatize their value by the following three axioms. First, they define efficiency stating that the sum of the payoffs allocated over the players should be equal to the average worth of the ‘grand coalition’ N when every order or permutation in which N is formed is equally likely. Obviously, this efficiency will never be realized since eventually only one order of entrance will occur. Since, behind a ‘veil of ignorance’ it is assumed that each order is equally likely to occur, we refer to this efficiency axiom as expected efficiency and it states that the sum of payoffs equals the ex ante expected worth.

                        Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) criticize the NR-null player property by arguing that a player is a NR-null player even when it contributes to an ordered coalition incorporating in positions different from the last one. Instead of only considering the contributions to a coalition when a player enters as last one, Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) consider the effect on the worth of a coalition of a player leaving in any position in the ordered coalition. Then, they call a player that contributes nothing when incorporating to any coalition in any position, a null player. Since we will use this weaker notion of a null player, we say the player i in N is a null player in

In a (cooperative) game with a permission structure, see Gilles, Owen, and van den Brink (1992), van den Brink and Gilles (1996), Gilles and Owen (1999) and van den Brink (1997), it is assumed that players who participate in a cooperative TU-game (in characteristic function form) are part of a hierarchical organization in which there are players that need permission or approval from certain other players before they are allowed to cooperate. For a finite set of players N such a hierarchical organization is represented by a directed graph

In the conjunctive approach as developed in Gilles et al. (1992) and van den Brink and Gilles (1996), it is assumed that the permission structure restricts the cooperation possibilities of the players in the sense that we assume that a coalition is feasible if and only if for every player in the coalition all its predecessors are also in the coalition. The set of feasible coalitions in this approach thus is given by

                           Note that in games with a permission structure the hierarchical ordering of the players is explicitly modeled by the digraph. In the literature there are models with an implicit ordering among the players, such as the Big Boss games (see Muto, Nakayama, Potters, & Tijs (1988)) or their generalization to Clan games (see Potters, Roos, Tijs, & Muto (1989)).

                           For rooted trees, so also for line-graphs, the conjunctive approach coincides with the disjunctive approach to games with a permission structure where it is assumed that each player (except the top-players) needs permission from at least one of its predecessors, see Gilles and Owen (1999) and van den Brink (1997).

Although we agree with the critique of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) on the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994), we further criticize their symmetry property. The definition of a symmetric player allows that two players i and j are symmetric, when for every ordered coalition not containing these two players, the marginal contribution of these players to any position in that order is the same, but for any ordered coalition containing these two players, exchanging their position yields a different worth. For example, considering the unanimity game of the order 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           3
                           )
                        
                      on 
                        
                           N
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           3
                           }
                        
                     , according to the definition of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) all three players are symmetric, and therefore the symmetry axiom requires them to get the same payoff. Note that the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) states that players 1 and 2 are null players and therefore earn zero, so all payoff goes to player 3.

We consider both allocations to be extreme. We agree with Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) that players 1 and 2, although being null players in the sense that their marginal contribution as last player to any ordered coalition is zero, they are still needed to earn a positive worth. Player 3 on its own earns only zero.
                        7
                        Note the difference with null players in TU-games in characteristic function form where all marginal contributions of a player being zero indeed implies that without this player the other players earn the same whether this player cooperates with them or not.
                     
                     
                        7
                      However, we want to acknowledge the idea of Nowak and Radzik (1994) that player 3 should be rewarded for being the only player having a positive marginal contribution when entering, and therefore we propose a class of solutions which to this unanimity game assigns payoffs such that player 3 earns at least as much as player 2 who earns at least as much as player 1. We define this class of solutions using cooperative games with a permission structure, in particular with a line-graph structure.

So, this solution assigns to every ordered coalition the permission value of a corresponding game with permission structure where the permission structure is a directed line-graph in the reverse order of the coalition, and the game is a convex combination of the unanimity games of the singletons in the coalition, i.e. a convex combination of additive games. This solution also can be written as

Next we provide an axiomatic characterization of this class of solutions. Besides axioms that are already mentioned in Section 2, we use the following three. Although

                                 NR
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ψ
                              
                              
                                 SB
                              
                           
                        
                      are very different, they have in common that in unanimity games, players at the end of the unanimity coalition earn at least as much as players in the beginning of the unanimity coalition. In some sense, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ψ
                              
                              
                                 SB
                              
                           
                        
                      is an extreme case where all players in the unanimity coalition get the same, while 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ψ
                              
                              
                                 NR
                              
                           
                        
                      is the other extreme case where all payoff goes to the last player. Although we consider these two solutions as extreme, we require from a solution that it satisfies this monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in the unanimity coalition. So, we consider the ordering of the players in a unanimity game also as a priority ordering where the highest share in the worth should be given to the last player whose entrance is pivotal to generate the worth, and the share of players in the worth should be nonincreasing the more players have to enter after this player in order to generate the worth in the unanimity game. This will permit us to enlarge the set of solutions for generalized TU-games obtaining the class of order monotonic solutions.

We argued before that we consider the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) to be too strong. A weaker symmetry requires equal payoffs for players that, besides being symmetric in the sense of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), also are such that for any ordered coalition containing both players, exchanging their position does not change the worth of the coalition. So, we call two players

Since it requires equality of payoffs under stronger conditions on the players, full symmetry is weaker than symmetry of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997). All order monotonic solutions satisfy this weaker symmetry axiom which straightforward result we state without proof.

                           Every order monotonic solution satisfies full symmetry.
                        

It is easy to verify that all geometric solutions given at the end of Section 2 are order monotonic since

In this section we generalize the axiomatization of the Shapley value for classical TU-games given in Manuel, González-Arangüena, and van den Brink (2013) to the context of generalized characteristic functions. We begin with defining what it means when players are indifferent to each other in a generalized characteristic function.

                            if i and j are not related.

Similar as for classical TU-games, this property is symmetrical and we can say that i and j are indifferent to mutual cooperation, or indifferent players for short. We say that an ordered coalition is essential if it has a nonzero dividend.

First, we generalize null contributions for indifferent players to the class of generalized characteristic functions, stating that, if one player i is indifferent to cooperate with another player j, then he is even indifferent to the fact that this player leaves the game.

                     . This generalizes the balanced contributions property of Myerson (1980) for classical TU-games. The null contributions for indifferent players property establishes that, for indifferent players, the contributions must be balanced and, moreover, null. Therefore, in some sense it is more restrictive than balanced contributions of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) as it determines the value of the contributions. But in another sense it is less demanding because it only restricts the contributions for pairs of players that are indifferent. A similar remark was made in Manuel et al. (2013) on Myerson’s (1980) balanced contributions for classical TU-games.

Similar as for classical TU-games, by repeated application of the null contributions for indifferent players property, this property can be straightforward extended to the case in which a given player is indifferent to all the players in a group and so the proof is omitted.

Next we generalize the enemy players property used in Manuel et al. (2013) to characterize the Shapley value for classical TU-games to the context of generalized characteristic functions.

                        The enemy players property for TU-game solutions states that the payoff of two players who become enemies change by the same amount, where two players becoming enemies means that all dividends of coalitions that contain both players become zero. Formally, an allocation rule

                      When, in a TU-game two players decide not to cooperate (for instance, because they become enemies), then all coalitions that contain both players loose their dividend. However, in a generalized characteristic function we should take account of the order and position of the players when they become enemies. We distinguish three cases and explore their effects. First, when two players i and j become enemies we assume that the dividends

                      can be seen as some kind of commitment parameter with respect to an agreement about cooperation. In a ‘classical’ TU-game a coalition forms at once and when it is formed the agreement is binding. But in cooperative games in generalized characteristic function, even when a set of players agrees to cooperate, the players enter sequentially and it can be that when a player enters it can still deviate and not cooperate (or become enemies) with certain players. This means that when player

                      then the agreement is a commitment, and the position where a player enters the coalition does not matter, leading to an equal effect on the payoffs of two players when the successor becomes enemy with the predecessor. When

                      then there is no commitment at all and the payoff of a player does not depend on the contribution of players entering after him.

Although the NR-value satisfies expected efficiency, the 0-enemy players property and null contributions for indifferent players, it is not characterized by these properties. However, substituting null contributions for indifferent players by null contributions for weakly indifferent players, characterizes all geometric solutions

As this property is obviously symmetrical, whenever it holds, we say that i and j are weakly indifferent to mutual cooperation, or weakly indifferent players for short.

Since the NR-value and the SB-value are geometric solutions, we obtain axiomatizations of these solutions as a corollary.

                     , the 0-enemy players property is some kind of independence axiom stating that the payoff for the ‘lower ordered’ player does not change when two players become enemies. This is also the reason why in the proof of Theorem 4.9 we have to treat uniqueness for the case 
                        
                           α

                      separate.

Second, we now investigate what happens if we strengthen this axiom by considering that if two players become enemies, then all coalitions that contain both players and they always enter in the same order (but not necessarily consecutive), loose their dividend.

                                 α

                           then this solution is the SB-value.
                        

In the last corollary we could use null contributions for indifferent players instead of null contributions for weakly indifferent players.

                           α
                        
                     -enemy players property by (i) also considering effects of two players becoming enemies when they do not enter consecutive (strong 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -enemy players property), and (ii) also ignore the order between them (no-order 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -enemy players property). We end this section by formulating an axiom where we take account of all orders in which two players who become enemies appear. To do this consider first the following definition.

In order to illustrate the property, consider the players of a team in a soccer match and suppose the generalized game assigns to every ordered coalition the probability of that team obtaining a goal in a particular play if players pass the ball in the order given by such a (ordered) coalition. Teams with an elaborated style usually play with many passes between players. On the other hand the direct style yields a goal using the minimum possible number of passes. Under the assumptions of the global enemy players property, the contributions of players in long plays are preferred to those one in short plays (an elaborated game is preferred instead of a direct game). If two players become enemies and so they cannot stay together in the ground, the one suffering a greater loss is the one that usually participates later in the plays. So, if a defender and a forward become enemies the loss is greater for the forward. If two middles become enemies the loss of both must be more or less the same.

In this paper we argued that, besides the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994), also the symmetry property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) for generalized characteristic functions reflects an extreme way to deal with the importance of the order on the payoff allocation. Whereas the NR-null player property requires zero payoff also for players for whom the worth of an ordered coalition (in which they are not the last player) changes when this player would not participate, the symmetry property requires equal payoffs also for players for whom there is an ordered coalition containing these two players, where exchanging their position yields a different worth. To respect the order as in Nowak and Radzik (1994), but not as extreme as they do, we introduced the axiom of order monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in a unanimity coalition, requiring that players who enter earlier should get not more in the corresponding unanimity game than players who enter later. This is weaker than symmetry since in a unanimity game all players in the unanimity coalition are symmetric and therefore earn the same payoff if symmetry is satisfied. We showed that, together with expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property (of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997)), anonymity and nonnegativity, this order monotonicity characterizes a class of solutions, called the class of order monotonic solutions, which contains the NR-value and SB-value as extreme cases. Within this class we specifically characterized the so-called geometric solutions.

Besides the class of geometric solutions, we mention a second class that follows naturally from our critique on the NR-null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and the symmetry property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997). As explained in Section 3, a major difference between the axioms underlying the NR- and SB-values is what they consider null players and symmetric players, and consequently how they treat these players in the payoff allocation. The null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) implies that in the unanimity game on an ordered coalition

On the other hand, the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) does not take account of possible asymmetries between players when they switch position in ordered coalitions they both belong to. Consequently, in the unanimity game on an ordered coalition

                      are symmetric and earn the same payoff.

The null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) is so extreme that they even do not need a symmetry axiom for their axiomatization. The null player property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) is weak, but they need the strong symmetry axiom. Our next goal is to find a compromise by allowing a null player property that is weaker than that of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and a symmetry that is weaker than that of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), but which are still compatible.***

                        Note that, under expected efficiency, the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) is incompatible with the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) since according to the last axiom, in the unanimity game on ordered coalition T all players except the last in order T should get zero payoff, implying that the last player in T should get all the payoff that is distributed according to expected efficiency, while according to the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) all players in

As a final remark, we mention that instead of order monotonicity, we could define the reverse stating that in unanimity games, players at the beginning of the unanimity coalition earn at least as much as players at the end of the unanimity coalition.

Which monotonicity to use depends on the application one has in mind. In many situations it is the pivotal player, the last one to enter to generate worth, who is most powerfull. This is the idea underlying the solution of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and is, for example, also the case in strategic games as matching pennies in which there is a first-mover disadvantage. On the other hand, considering a bargaining situation it can be beneficial to have the initiative and be the first proposer. This is the case in the bargaining model of Rubinstein (1982) where there is a first-mover advantage. Similar, in applications of generalized characteristic functions it can sometimes be beneficial (with respect to the share one gets from the worth) to be the last player to enter, and sometimes to be the first.
