                  Accurate modeling of biological soft tissue properties is vital for realistic medical simulation. Mechanical response of biological soft tissue always exhibits a strong variability due to the complex microstructure and different loading conditions. The inhomogeneity in human artery tissue is modeled with a computational probabilistic approach by assuming that the instantaneous stress at a specific strain varies according to normal distribution. Material parameters of the artery tissue which are modeled with a combined logarithmic and polynomial energy equation are represented by a statistical function with normal distribution. Mean and standard deviation of the material parameters are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) and inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method, respectively. This nondeterministic approach was verified using computer simulation based on the Monte-Carlo (MC) method. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the MC simulation corresponds well with that of the experimental stress–strain data and the probabilistic approach is further validated using data from other studies. By taking into account the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of human biological tissue, the proposed method is suitable for realistic virtual simulation as well as an accurate computational approach for medical device validation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Accurate modeling of biomechanical properties of artery tissue is important for developing realistic medical simulation systems which are commonly used in surgical training, planning and treatment, and diagnostic tools for vascular diseases. With the advancements in medical imaging technologies and mapping tools, model personalization has generated a lot of research interest [25,38]. Efficient probabilistic model personalization integrating the specific patient data to a generic model enables the application of computational approaches in clinical practice [1]. This study characterizes the patient specific material parameters and validates the models using experimental data of human iliac vessels.

Nonlinear hyperelastic property is an important attribute of the artery tissue which can contribute to modeling accuracy, and hence needs to be considered for realistic deformation simulation and haptic rendering in surgical simulation of the arterial wall [43]. Experimental procedures such as inflation tests [17], biaxial tests [42], as well as tension and indentation tests [11,26] have been performed to study the mechanical properties of arteries tissue. Those experiments revealed that the mechanical behaviour of arteries is elastic, highly non-linear and anisotropic under finite strains for slow monotonic tests, and have been adequately modeled within the framework of hyperelasticity.

Many constitutive models have been proposed for mathematical description of the mechanical behaviour of artery tissue [15,22–34]. Strain energy based models are able to provide comprehensive understanding of the inter-relationship between stress and strain. In Chui et al.’s study [5], the combined logarithmic and polynomial model was reported to perform better than the combined exponential and polynomial model [15] in modeling the stress–strain relationship of liver tissue. The combined logarithmic and polynomial model has been utilized for realistic modeling of porcine artery tissue [47]. Structural strain energy function is proposed to study the arterial tissue [48]. The proposed function includes the wavy nature of the collagen and the fraction of both elastin and collagen contained in the media, which can be determined by histology. The waviness of the collagen is assumed to be distributed log-logistically. The novel strain energy function is found to behave similarly to that of Holzapfel et al. [22], both succeed in describing the typical S-shaped pressure–radius curves with comparable quality of fit.

Uniaxial stress tests have been performed on human artery tissue to study its nonlinear biomechanical properties in this work. Due to varying micro-structural composition of tissue specimens and inherent noises from experimental instruments, the measured stress–strain data often comprise of a number of stress–strain curves with large deviations [36]. Material parameters of soft tissue model are usually characterized using the mean stress–strain curve and ignoring the stress–strain curve deviations. However, it is important to incorporate the inherent stiffness variations for realistic medical simulation [14]. These inherent stiffness variations of artery tissue may be modeled using probabilistic uncertainty analysis. The applicability of probabilistic uncertainty analysis has been demonstrated in evaluating structural reliability [9,10], and knee ligamentous constraint analysis [4]. A probabilistic method was proposed to model the mechanical properties of liver tissues in [14]. To our best knowledge, few reports have been published on probabilistic analysis of human artery for characterization and deformation simulation in the literature.

In this study, we introduce a probabilistic approach to model the inhomogeneity, specifically the stiffness variations of human artery tissue. Cyclic tension tests in longitudinal and circumferential directions were performed on human arteries. The arteries are highly inhomogeneous with large variances in stress–strain curves. In order to study the anisotropic mechanical properties of arterial tissue, a combined logarithmic and polynomial constitutive equation [5,47] is employed to model the average stress–strain relationship of human artery tissue in circumferential and longitudinal directions. The material parameters are expressed as a statistical function with normal distribution. The mean values of the material parameters are identified using GA while the standard deviation of the material parameters are determined using direct calculation method (DC) and inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method, respectively. The probabilistic approach is then verified using Monte-Carlo (MC) method and demonstrates good correspondence with cumulative distribution function (CDF) between simulated and experimental stress–strain data. Validation of the material parameters are carried out with experimental human artery data.

In Section 2, the probabilistic approach is introduced and material parameters are determined from the scattered experimental stress–strain data. Section 3 presents the verification of derived material parameters through MC simulation and historical experimental data. Section 4 concludes the study with a short summary.

There are three types of arteries: elastic, mixed and muscular. Abdominal aorta, femoral artery and popliteal artery are examples of elastic, mixed and muscular arteries respectively [6]. Uniaxial elongation tests were performed on 20 samples of human femoral arteries from 5 donors in circumferential and longitudinal directions, average 4 samples from each donor. The experiments were carried out with a mechanical property measurement system which was designed to meet the requirements of automated environment control, testing, and data collection for biological tissue [47], as shown in 
                        Fig. 1. Load cells (LCM UF series) were employed to measure force imposed on specimen. Human femoral arteries were obtained from human donors and stored in an ice box with Histidine Tryptophan Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution before experiment for about 2 weeks’ time. The arteries were intended for organ transplant, and the donors’ identities were protected in according to an approved Institutional Review Board protocol. All arterial specimens were excised from the distal end of the abdominal aorta, with lengths between 40 and 50mm and diameters between 6 and 11mm. During experiment, the artery specimen was immersed in Krebs Ringer solution at 37°C throughout the experiment, with pH value maintained at 7.3–7.4 using carbon dioxide, which is designed to improve the test accuracy by mimicking the inner environment of human body.

Specimens were tested in both circumferential and longitudinal directions. A ring segment was sliced off from one end of each arterial specimen and tested in circumferential direction. The remaining section of the specimen was used to perform tests in the longitudinal direction. All specimens were preconditioned before data collection over a course of at least five cycles, allowing the specimens to reach a steady state as no further changes occurred on the stress–strain curves [16,44]. During the experiments, force and displacement data were measured and recorded. Stretch ratio λ was calculated by dividing instantaneous gauge length by its original length while engineering stress T was calculated by dividing the instantaneous load by the original cross-sectional area. Strain

                         can be expressed as

                           1
                        . The tension tests were performed until the stretch ratio reached 1.55 for both directions at a ramping speed of 2.5mm/s.

Two sets of scattered stress–stain curves which represent the data in circumferential and longitudinal directions were plotted together with its mean curve in 
                        Fig. 2. Each set includes twenty curves. The experimental stress with respect to a specific stretch ratio is assumed to vary according to normal distribution. Mean value and standard deviation of stress is calculated as:

                        Fig. 3. The probability density function (PDF) of the stress values calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) at three different strain values are plotted in Fig. 3 which shows the normal distribution of stress values. The experimental data is tested using Shapiro–Wilk test [39]. The average probabilities of normality in circumferential and longitudinal directions are 0.7185 and 0.7237, which validate the assumption of normal distribution.

Probabilistic method is used for material parameter identification of artery tissue. Deformation of artery tissue is considered as a structural problem that can be solved using the probabilistic method.

The artery tissue is represented by a 7-constant combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function as follows:

Material parameters of the mean stress–strain curve can be characterized using the above equation.

The identification process was carried out using genetic algorithm (GA). GA is an effective global search method which is well suited for the minimization of non-convex objective functions. The mean value curve is available for material parameter identification through a data set of the form

                            as the initial solution population, the algorithm will evaluate their level of fitness in the problem domain and create a new set of approximations based on breeding the better evaluated solutions. By repeating the selection, crossover and mutation procedures of the GA, the evolution of populations of individuals that are better suited to their environment than their parents are obtained. The minimum value of R(C

                           ) is reached, too. An initial population of nearly 100 individuals was used along with a selection percentage of 0.1 and a crossover percentage of 0.7. The algorithm converges to minima after approximately 100 generations while the number of total evolution generations is set to be 150.

Two methods were employed to calculate the standard deviation of material parameters. The first method is called direct calculating method (DC method), which utilizes the standard way to calculate the standard deviation of predicted stress (

                           ) as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The second method is the Inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method.

The IMVFOSM method is derived as follows. By first taking Taylor expansion of Eq. (6), the performance function is linearized at the mean values of material parameters:

The comparison between simulated results and mean experimental values are illustrated as following (
                        Fig. 4 and 
                        Table 1).

The similar curve patterns in circumferential and longitudinal indicate that C
                        5, C
                        6 and C
                        7 are the dominate parameters. It can be seen from the graphs that the simulated results fit better in circumferential direction than that of longitudinal direction. This indicates that the chosen strain energy density function fits betters with the constitutive behaviour in the circumferential direction than in the longitudinal direction.

Following the computation methods described in Section 2.2.3, numerical values of 
                           ∂

                                 i
                              
                           
                         and standard deviation of experimental stress in circumferential and longitudinal directions at different strain stages are shown in 
                        
                        Tables 2 and 3, respectively.


                        
                        
                        Tables 4 and 5 compare the standard deviation of material parameters using the DC method and IMVFOSM method.

From the tables, it can be concluded that under the same conditions, IMVFOSM method yields a smaller standard deviation of material parameters

                                       C
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         than that of the direct calculating method, which indicates that IMVFOSM can provide a more accurate solution with smaller variations in material parameters.

In order to verify the accuracy of the probabilistic material parameters estimation method, Monte Carlo (MC) method is used. The MC methods is a sampling method [7,8,20,27,29] often used in computer simulations of physical and mathematical systems when it is infeasible to compute an exact result with a deterministic algorithm [2]. Eq. (6) is performed for 10,000 times with the parameters displayed in Tables 4 and 5.

Stress CDFs calculated from DCM and IMVFOSM at strain values of 1.25, 1.30, 1.35, 1.40, 1.45, 1.50 and 1.55 are plotted in 
                        Fig. 5. The results also reveal that simulated stress CDFs of both DC method and IMVFOSM method can correspond well with that of the experimental stress CDFs. Nevertheless, material parameters calculated using IMVFOSM method has performed better than that of DCM with a closer match. In 
                        
                        Figs. 6 and 7, the convergence of Monte Carlo is demonstrated by the average and standard deviations of the stress value at a given stretch ratio 1.45 [24], where the average value T

                        Pa, and the standard deviation of DCM and IMVFOM are 928.5Pa and 648.14Pa, respectively. The average of stress in longitudinal direction is 2.80×104
                        Pa, and the standard deviation of DCM and IMVFOM are 710.19Pa and 522.97Pa, respectively.

The 3-sigma rule is widely used in industrial quality control which states that nearly all values (99.7%) lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution [35]. It can also serve as an efficient tool for researchers to select useful data from the clinical dataset in scientific research. In this work, the 3-sigma rule is employed for validation of the proposed model.

Historical tension experimental results of human femoral arteries were obtained from previous works [41,46]. They were plotted together with simulated results in

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Performance of an engineering system is usually influenced by many unavoidable uncertainties [3]. Similarly, medical simulation based on soft tissue modeling is also subjected to unavoidable uncertainties. Accurate modeling of soft tissue is a challenging task even for a simple case [19].

Characteristics of biological tissue always vary among different subjects. The mechanical response of artery tissue is affected by a multitude of factors such as age, sex, species [18,40,45], vessel size and position along their length [28]. Experimental stress–strain curves of different specimens always exhibit a strong variability. Our proposed probabilistic modeling method which takes into account the systematic derivation of human tissue parameters serves as an appropriate approach to model the mechanical inhomogeneity of soft tissue. The assumption on normal distribution agrees with our observation on the distribution of the stress–strain curves from our experiments on human iliac vessels.

Modeling inherently requires some simplification, thus the degree of realism of the model compared to the observations is limited by the initial assumptions that make the model valid. Finding the appropriate level of details in a model in order to fit it to the data as well as obtain meaningful predictions would require great efforts. Multiple parameters sets that satisfy the observations with similar accuracy serve as a good approach for realistic soft tissue modeling. In this work, the artery tissue was modeled with combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function. The material parameter of the chosen model can be represented within the range of 3-sigma rule, in which provides a multiple parameter sets for the human arterial tissue.

The mathematical models describing complex dynamics will result in nonlinear formulations. The interaction between the model parameters, model variables and observations affect the constitutive model performance. The material models often include large number of parameters that are difficult to be estimated. Genetic algorithm is utilized since it is suitable for characterization of model parameters with large parameters due to its ability to explore the entire search space looking for global minima [37]. Moreover, the parameter characterization problem will also result in non-unique solutions, where experimental observations could have resulted from a range of possible parameter sets instead of a unique set. Thus methods for estimating patient-specific parameters should consider these challenges in providing not only point estimates for the parameters but also ranges of possible parameters.

There are previous investigations on soft tissue uncertainties analysis using probabilistic modeling. A stochastic approach which based on the principle of the maximum entropy was introduced to investigate the effect of the parameter random uncertainties on the arterial pressure [12,30]. Segmentation of blood vessels on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images was studied with a physically justified adaptive probabilistic model [13]. A probabilistic framework was also introduced for systematic descriptor selection for MIS feature tracking and deformation recovery [31]. Although it is very difficult to model all the uncertainties concerning the challenges above, accurate modeling of the human artery tissue inhomogeneity is noteworthy for realistic medical simulation. Probabilistic modeling approach provides a powerful tool for quantitative study on the impact of multiple variables on properties of human artery tissue. The data set which indicates a reasonable stress–strain range can be utilized as reference in the virtual simulation of artery tissue. This model is also applicable for other tissues when calculating the parameter variability.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, an effective probabilistic approach is proposed to represent the mechanical properties of human artery tissue incorporating the inherent stiffness variations between different subjects. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis is carried out to model the uncertainties of human artery tissue. The combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function has modeled the human arterial behaviour accurately, and our proposed probabilistic approach is able to implement with other hyperelastic models, such as the Holzapfel model [21] or Ogden model [32]. Interaction between the uncertainties on observations and estimated parameters is a major phenomenon to consider in biomechanical models for medical simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which utilizes a statistical model to study the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of human arterial tissue.
