                  This paper studies a valuation framework for financial contracts subject to reference and counterparty default risks with collateralization requirement. We propose a fixed point approach to analyze the mark-to-market contract value with counterparty risk provision, and show that it is a unique bounded and continuous fixed point via contraction mapping. This leads us to develop an accurate iterative numerical scheme for valuation. Specifically, we solve a sequence of linear inhomogeneous PDEs, whose solutions converge to the fixed point price function. We apply our methodology to compute the bid and ask prices for both defaultable equity and fixed-income derivatives, and illustrate the non-trivial effects of counterparty risk, collateralization ratio and liquidation convention on the bid-ask spreads.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Counterparty risk has played an important role during the 2008 financial crisis. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
                        1

                        See BIS press release at http://www.bis.org/press/p110601.pdf
                        
                     , two-thirds of counterparty risk losses during the crisis were from counterparty risk adjustments in MtM valuation whereas the rest were due to actual defaults. In order to account for the counterparty risk, recent regulatory changes, such as Basel III, incorporate the counterparty risk adjustments in the calculation of capital requirement. On the other hand, the use of collateral in the derivative market has increased dramatically. According to the survey conducted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in 2013
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        Survey available at http://www2.isda.org/functional-areas/research/surveys/margin-surveys/
                        
                     , the percentage of all trades subject to collateral agreements in the over-the-counter (OTC) market increases from 30 percent in 2003 to 73.7 percent in 2013. OTC market participants continue to adapt collateralization and counterparty risk adjustments in their MtM valuation methodologies for various contracts, including forwards, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.

When an OTC market participant trades a financial claim with a counterparty, the participant is exposed not only to the price change and default risk of the underlying asset but also to the default risk of the counterparty. To reflect the counterparty default risk in MtM valuation, three adjustments are calculated in addition to the counterparty-risk free value of the claim. While credit valuation adjustment (CVA) accounts for the possibility of the counterparty’s default, debt valuation adjustment (DVA) is calculated to adjust for the participant’s own default risk. In addition, collateral interest payments and the cost of borrowing generate funding valuation adjustment (FVA). In the industry, the valuation adjustment incorporating CVA, DVA, FVA and collateralization, is called total valuation adjustment (XVA)
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        The terminology can be found in Carver (2013) and Capponi (2013), among others.
                     .

In this paper, we study a valuation framework for financial contracts accounting for XVA. We consider two current market conventions for price computation. The main difference in the two conventions rises in the assumption of the liquidation value – either counterparty risk-free value or MtM value with counterparty risk provision – upon default. Brigo, Buescu, and Morini (2012) and Brigo and Morini (2011) show that the values under the two conventions have significant differences and large impacts on net debtors and creditors.

With counterparty risk provision, the MtM value is defined implicitly via a risk-neutral expectation. This gives rise to major challenges in analyzing and computing the contract value. We propose a novel fixed point approach to analyze the MtM value. Our methodology involves solving a sequence of inhomogeneous linear PDEs, whose classical solutions are shown via contraction mapping arguments to converge to the unique fixed point price function. This approach also motivates us to develop an iterative numerical scheme to compute the values of a variety of financial claims under different market conventions.

In related studies, Fujii and Takahashi (2013) incorporate BCVA and under/over collateralization, and calculate the MtM value by simulation. Henry-Labordère (2012) approximates the MtM value by numerically solving a related nonlinear PDE through simulation of a marked branching diffusion, and provides conditions to avoid a “blow-up” of the simulated solution. Burgard and Kjaer (2011) also consider a similar nonlinear PDE in their study of hedging strategies inclusive of funding costs, and taking into account closeout payments exchanged at the time when either party of the contract defaults. In contrast, our fixed point methodology works directly with the price definition in terms of a recursive expectation, rather than heuristically stating and solving a nonlinear PDE. Our contraction mapping result allows us to solve a series of linear PDE problems with bounded classical solutions, and obtain a unique bounded continuous MtM value.

Our model also provides insight on the bid-ask prices of various financial contracts. The XVA is asymmetric for the buyer and the seller. As such, the incorporation of adjustment to unilateral or bilateral counterparty risk leads to a non-zero bid-ask spread. In other words, counterparty risk reveals itself as a market friction, resulting in a transaction cost for OTC trades. In addition, we examine the impact of various parameters such as default rate, recovery rate, collateralization ratio and effective collateral interest rate. We find that a higher counterparty default rate and funding cost reduce the MtM value, whereas the market participant’s own default rate and collateralization ratio have positive price effects. For claims with a positive payoff, such as calls and puts, we establish a number of price dominance relationships. In particular, when collateral rates are low, the bid-ask prices are dominated by the counterparty risk-free value. Moreover, the bid-ask prices decrease when we use the MtM value rather than counterparty risk-free value for the liquidation value upon default.

The recent regulatory changes and post-crisis perception of counterparty risk have motivated research on the analysis of XVA. Brigo, Capponi, and Pallavicini (2014) consider an arbitrage-free valuation framework with bilateral counterparty risk and collateral with possible re-hypothecation. Capponi (2013) studies the arbitrage-free valuation of counterparty risk, and analyzes the impact of default correlation, collateral migration frequency and collateral re-hypothecation on the collateralized CVA. Thompson (2010) analyzes the effect of counterparty risk on insurance contracts and examines the moral hazard of the insurers. Brigo and Chourdakis (2009) focus on the valuation of CDS with counterparty risk that is correlated with the reference default. Hull and White (2012) investigate the wrong way risk – the additional risk generated by the correlation between the portfolio return and counterparty default risk.

Let us give an outline of the rest of the paper. In Section 2, we formulate the MtM valuation of a generic financial claim with default risk and counterparty default risks under collateralization. In Section 3, we provide a fixed point theorem and a recursive algorithm for valuation. In Section 4, we compute the MtM values of various defaultable equity claims and derive their bid-ask prices. In Section 5, we apply our model to price a number of defaultable fixed-income claims. Section 6 concludes the paper, and the Appendix contains a number of longer proofs.

In the background, we fix a probability space

                      ≡ r(t, Xt
                     ) for some bounded positive function. At the default time τ
                     0, the stock price will jump to value zero and remain worthless afterwards. This “jump-to-default model” for S is a variation of those by Merton (1976), Carr and Linetsky (2006), and Mendoza-Arriaga and Linetsky (2011).

A defaultable claim is described by the triplet (g, h, l), where g(ST, XT
                        ) is the payoff at maturity T, (h(St, Xt
                        ))0 ≤ t ≤ T

                         is the payoff at the default time τ
                        0 of the reference entity. We assume continuous collateralization which is a reasonable proxy for the current market where daily or intraday margin calls are common (see Fujii & Takahashi, 2013). For party i ∈ {1, 2}, we denote by δi
                         the collateral coverage ratio of the claim’s MtM value. We use the range 0 ≤ δi
                         ≤ 120 percent since dealers usually require over-collateralization up to 120 percent for credit or equity linked notes (see Ramaswamy, 2011, Table 1
                        ).

We first consider pricing of a defaultable claim without bilateral counterparty risk. We call this value counterparty-risk free (CRF) value. Precisely, the ex-dividend pre-default time t CRF value of the defaultable claim with (g, h, l) is given by

                        0. When either the market participant or the counterparty defaults first, i.e. τ < τ
                        0, the amount that the remaining party gets depends on unwinding mechanism at the default time. We adopt the market convention where the MtM value with counterparty risk provision, denoted by P, is used to compute the value upon the participant’s defaults (see Fujii & Takahashi, 2013; Henry-Labordère, 2012).

Moreover, the market participant is exposed to funding cost associated with collateralization over the period since the collateral rate and funding rate do not coincide with the risk-free rate. When the liquidation value of the contract Pt
                         is positive to party 1 at time t, party 2 posts collateral

                        2 to party 2 until any default time or expiry. On the other hand, when Pt
                         is negative to party 1, party 1 borrows

                           As an alternative of MtM value with CR provision, the liquidation value at the time of default can be evaluated as the CRF value of the claim. In other words, at the default time τ < τ
                              0, the liquidation value is evaluated as Πτ
                               rather than Pτ

In OTC trading, market participants, such as dealers, may take a long position as a buyer or a short position as a seller. Without counterparty risk, the buyer’s CRF bid price Πb
                        (t, s, x) for a claim with payoff (g, h, l) is given by (2.4). The MtM value of the seller’s position satisfies (2.4) by replacing (g, h, l) with

                         is different from f(t, s, x, y) in (2.12), the symmetry observed in the CRF prices generally no longer holds in the presence of bilateral counterparty risk. Most importantly, such an asymmetry generates bid-ask spreads for defaultable claims. For any contract with counterparty risk provision, the participant can quote two prices: Pb
                        (t, s, x) as a buyer or Ps
                        (t, s, x) as a seller. In addition, since the payoff components (g, h, l) can be negative, the bid and/or ask prices also can be negative (see Fig. 4).

The total valuation adjustment (XVA) is defined as a deviation of the MtM value from the CRF value, namely,

                     Then, we recognize from (2.13) that the MtM value with counterparty risk provision satisfies 
                        
                           P
                           =
                           M
                           P
                        
                     . This motivates us to show that the operator 
                        M
                      has a unique fixed point, and therefore, guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the MtM value P.

We discuss our fixed point approach by first showing that the operator 
                        M
                      defined in (3.1) preserves boundedness and continuity. To this end, we outline a number of conditions according to Heath and Schweizer (2000).

The conditions (C1) – (C7) are quite general, and they allow for various models, including the Heston, CEV, and thus, geometric Brownian motion models for equity, and the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross models for the stochastic factor X (see (Heath & Schweizer, 2000), Section 2). The triplet (g, h, l), default intensities λ
                        (i) and interest rate r can be easily chosen to satisfy the boundedness and continuity conditions in (C3), as we will do in our examples in Sections 4 and 5.

We provide the proof in Appendix A.1. The insight of Proposition 3.2 and Theorem 3.3 is that we can construct and solve a series of inhomogeneous but linear PDEs whose classical solutions converge to a unique fixed point price function P as in (2.13). Recent studies by Burgard and Kjaer (2011) and Henry-Labordère (2012) evaluate the MtM value P(t, s, x) by working with the associated nonlinear PDE of the form:

                        . The nonlinearity of (3.6) poses major challenges on analyzing and numerically solving for P. Henry-Labordère (2012) provides a method to approximate the solution that involves replacing the nonlinear term f with a polynomial and simulating a marked branching diffusion. This method, however, does not guarantee that the solution from simulation will resemble the solution of the nonlinear PDE, and does not ensure any regularity, such as continuity or boundedness of, either solution. Henry-Labordère (2012) provides conditions on the chosen polynomial to avoid a “blow-up” of the simulation algorithm. In contrast, our fixed point methodology circumvents this issue by establishing that the pricing definition in (2.13) is a contraction mapping, as opposed to working with the nonlinear PDE. As a result, we solve a series of linear PDE problems with bounded classical solutions. In the limit, a unique bounded continuous MtM value P is obtained.

Our contraction mapping methodology lends itself to a recursive numerical algorithm. As mentioned in the previous section, we iteratively solve a sequence of linear inhomogeneous PDEs (3.4). At each iteration, the error is measured in terms of the maximum difference between two consecutive solutions P

We now apply our valuation methodology to value a number of defaultable equity claims. Specifically, we will derive and compare the MtM values with and without counterparty risk provisions as well as the CRF value. Moreover, we will analyze and illustrate the bid-ask prices.

                                 )
                              
                           
                         and P(0, s) for 
                           
                              0

                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        . As we can see, the ordering of these three values can change completely depending on the spot price. For example, for large spot prices, we observe that the CRF value dominates the other two MtM values, but it is lowest when the spot price is small. Furthermore, the value without provision dominates the value with provision for high spot prices, and the opposite holds true for low spot prices.

Next, we look at the sensitivity of the MtM values with respect to the counterparty’s or own default risk, collateralization ratio and effective collateral rate. In Fig. 2
                        , the MtM values are decreasing in the counterparty default rate (left) and increasing in the participant’s own default rate (right), as is intuitive. Note that the MtM value with provision moves more rapidly with respect to the counterparty default rate, but the MtM value without provision is more sensitive in the participant’s own default rate.

In Fig. 3
                        
                         (left), an increase in δ
                        2 reduces counterparty-risk exposure, and therefore, increases the MtM values with and without counterparty risk provision. The rate of increase in contract value slows down when the collateralization ratio exceed 1. In the over-collateralized range [1, 1.2], party 1 is no longer exposed to the counterparty’s default risk. The increase in the contact value (from party 1’s perspective) results from the possibility of collecting the excess collateral upon party 1’s own default.

In practice, if the participant’s funding cost rate is high, the effective collateral rate can be negative (see Burgard & Kjaer, 2011). This implies a net interest payment by the participant for the long position due to collateralization. As the effective collateral rate becomes more negative, the contract values with and without provision decrease as we observe on the right panel of Fig. 3.

We illustrate the bid-ask prices Pb
                         and Ps
                         of a call spread in Fig. 4. On the left panel where the participant is assumed to be default-free, we observe the dominance of the three prices: Ps
                         ≥ Π ≥ Pb
                        . However, in the bilateral counterparty-risk case, the ordering of prices is different in in-the-money (ITM) and out-of-money (OTM) ranges. We see that Π ≥ Ps
                         ≥ Pb
                         in the ITM range, but Ps
                         ≥ Pb
                         ≥ Π in the OTM range.

Equity forward contracts are commonly traded in the OTC market. With stock S as the underlying asset, we consider a forward with maturity T. The initial forward price F
                        0 is set so that the contract has zero value at inception. When the underlying stock defaults, the stock price goes to zero, and the buyer has to pay the discounted value

                        , we show the convergence result of the MtM value at time

In Fig. 5, we plot the bid-ask prices Pb
                         and Ps
                         of the forward contract with counterparty risk provision together with the CRF value. On the left panel, all three values increase as the underlying stock price increases. Similar to the call spread case, the price ordering changes from Π ≥ Ps
                         ≥ Pb
                         in the ITM range to Ps
                         ≥ Pb
                         ≥ Π in the OTM range. On the right panel, both MtM values decrease significantly as the counterparty default rate increases. However, the MtM with provision moves more rapidly, similar to Fig. 2.

                           Total Return Swap


                           Total return swaps (TRS) are also traded over the counter as an alternative to equity stock forwards. The swap buyer will receive the increase in equity value at swap expiration date T,

Some derivatives have positive payoffs, i.e. the triplet g, h, l ≥ 0, including calls, puts and digital options. For both conventions, the nonlinear property of the price function disappears since we can substitute the nonlinear functions

In both (4.11) and (4.12), the bid prices have two components: the CRF value of the call option, i.e. Black–Scholes price, and a multiplier that depends on the parameter α (see (4.2)). First, suppose that 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                        . This happens, for example, when the contract is perfectly collateralized and effective collateral rate is zero, i.e. 
                           
                              
                                 δ

                              =
                              
                                 c

                        . In this case, both bid prices are identical to the CRF value

                        2 < 1. In this case, the call option buyer is exposed to counterparty default risk, and consequently, the bid prices are less than the CRF value Π(t, s).

                        Fig. 6 illustrates the two bid prices (with and without provision) for various maturities and spot prices. We observe the dominance of the price without provision over the price with provision. Moreover, the difference of two prices increase as maturity or spot price increases. This wider level of difference is attributed to the fact that the difference of counterparty risk exposure increases as the maturity increases.

Next, we derive a number of price dominance relationships for the bid-ask prices and the CRF value of claims with positive payoffs.

We provide a proof in
                         
                        Appendix A.3. In market conditions where the effective collateral rates c
                        1, c
                        2 are much lower than the counterparty/own default rates λ
                        (1), λ
                        (2), the conditions for (4.13) and (4.14) are satisfied. In turn, since the buyer’s (resp. seller’s) MtM value with provision assumes Pb
                         (resp. Ps
                        ) as the liquidation value, which is lower than the liquidation value Π in the case without provision according to (4.13), this implies the price dominance relationships in (4.14), as is presented in Fig. 6.

We now consider defaultable fixed-income claims under bilateral counterparty risk setting. We model the stochastic factor X by two affine diffusions: Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) processes. Under the OU model, the factor process X follows

                      on the reference default intensity, and this allows us to apply our contraction mapping result in Theorem 3.3. For implementation, we apply the FDM and Algorithm 1 in Section 3.2 to (5.2) to obtain the MtM value with counterparty risk provision.

After the 2008 financial crisis, CDS contracts are traded in a new standardized way whereby the protection buyer pays at a fixed premium rate, along with a non-zero (positive/negative) upfront payment at the start of the contract. A long position of a CDS contract written on the default event {τ
                        0 ≤ T} is summarized by the triplet notation

In Fig. 7, we compare the three MtM values in terms of the counterparty recovery rate

                         and the counterparty default rate λ
                        (2). The CRF value is given by (A.9) and is independent of R
                        2 and λ
                        (2), so it is flat across the x-axes in Fig. 7. An increase in counterparty recovery rate or a decrease in counterparty default rate improves both MtM values, whereas the CRF value does not change. In both cases, the MtM value without provision dominates the MtM value with provision.

Total return swaps (TRS) on defaultable bonds are OTC traded, and their MtM values are subject to counterparty risk. A TRS is also referred to as a bond forward (see Schönbucher, 2003, Chap. 2.5). Fix a maturity of T years, we consider a TRS on a zero-recovery defaultable bond with maturity T′ ≥ T. The value of the defaultable bond, denoted by C, is given in (A.5) for the OU model and in (A.6) for the CIR model. Given no default up to the swap maturity T, the swap buyer receives the difference between the bond price C(T, XT
                         ; T′) and the pre-specified strike

                         from the swap seller. If the bond defaults before time T, the swap buyer pays the strike K to the seller. Until the first default time τ or expiration date T, the buyer continues to pay at the risk-free rate plus a spread

In Fig. 8, we obtain the bid-ask upfront prices with provision for a CDS and a TRS, along with the counterparty risk-free upfront values, under the CIR model. Since both CDS and TRS are swaps, the MtM values can be positive or negative, depending on the reference default intensity. As buying a CDS is similar to longing default risk, the CDS upfront value is increasing in the reference default intensity (left). On the other hand, since the TRS buyer is shorting default risk, the TRS upfront value decreases as the reference asset’s default intensity λ
                        (0) increases (right).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, we have discussed a valuation framework to analytically study and numerically compute financial contracts subject to reference and counterparty default risks with bilateral collateralization. In addition to the underlying price dynamics used in this paper, our fixed point approach and the corresponding iterative numerical algorithm can potentially be adapted to price derivatives with counterparty risk in other models. The challenge lies in efficiently and accurately solving a sequence of inhomogeneous PDE problems. Our model also sheds light on the role played by counterparty risk and collateralization in the formation of bid-ask spreads.

Several interesting and practically important problems remain for future investigation. For example, what are the price and risk impacts of utilizing multiple counterparties for OTC trading? A recent study by Bo and Capponi (2013) derives the XVA of a CDS portfolio with a large number of entities. Apart from pricing, counterparty risk should also be incorporated into static or dynamic strategies for derivatives trading (see e.g. Jiao & Pham, 2011), as well as mark-to-market timing Leung and Liu (2012). In view of the financial crisis, counterparty risk has also become a key component in the design of clearing houses. Answers to these questions will be useful not only for individual or institutional investors, but also for regulators.

                         where X follows the OU or CIR model. This specification is more general than the one used in the numerical examples in Sections 5.1–5.2, and it yields analytic expressions for the pre-default prices (without counterparty risk provision) of the credit default swaps and total return swaps considered therein. These prices are used for comparison analysis (see Figs. 7 and 8).

In the OU model, the pre-default zero-coupon bond price with maturity T and zero recovery meets the formula (Schönbucher, 2003, Chap. 7.1.1)
