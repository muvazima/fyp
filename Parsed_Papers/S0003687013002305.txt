                  This paper introduced a laboratory study on quantifying the impact of display angles 0.0°–90.0° on the legibility of Sans-Serif 5 × 5 Capitalized Letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z, commonly used for acuity tests. This study addressed three issues not tackled in the previous studies, including (a) extremely large incident angles 82.8°–90°, (b) multiple letters other than a single letter E previously used, and (c) the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility evaluation. A total of 20 young college students with Snellen acuity 20/20 or better and normal color vision participated in this experiment. They were asked to read viewing materials presented at 15 display angles. This study derived two equations and modified an existing legibility index to correct the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility evaluation at extreme oblique display angles.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Every day people read text presented on different displays, such as books, newspapers, signs, computer screens, navigation monitors, instrument panels, etc., often not perpendicularly but at a display angle. The angle between the display normal and the sightline of the observer is called incident angle, which has a possible range from 0° to 90°. People prefer to read text presented horizontally from left to right at an incident angle of zero or close to zero, as of a normal reading habit to which people get used. People's reading performance may be affected if text is presented in a different way, e.g., on rotated and/or tilted displays. It was found that reading is slower for vertical text due to a decrease in the size of the visual span (the number of letters recognized without moving the eyes) for vertical reading (Byrne, 2002; Yu et al., 2010; Legge et al., 2007). Although the legibility of an individual letter is not affected by the visual span, it is affected by the orientation and the perspective view of the text changed with the display angles from horizontal left to right (at 0°) to some oblique directions (Cai, 2008).

Nonetheless, oblique viewing of displays is unavoidable in daily life. Extremely large display angle close to 90° is also possible, e.g., when a driver reads road pavement markings at a far distance, when a customer in a shopping mall walks around fixed advertising boards, when a police officer tries to spot the plate of a moving vehicle on the opposite side of the street, or when a pharmacist looks at the pill description on the side of a medicine bottle label (before she/he rotates the bottle). In addition, the display angle often varies over time and space when moving observers read a fixed sign (e.g., a driver spots a roadway sign), or when seated or standing still observers read a moving or rotating display (e.g., observing a street parade).

Since Erdmann and Dodge (1898), numerous researchers in human factors and related fields studied the legibility of Roman characters. In the majority of those studies, the viewing materials were read perpendicularly to the sightline of the observers (i.e., display angle = 0°). Only a few researchers looked into the common oblique viewing of text, including Snyder and Maddox (1978), Reinwald (n.d.), and Payne (1983). In addition, those studies focused on the target size (e.g. character height H, width W, or strokewidth S
                     w) and viewing distance D, but rarely took other critical factors of legibility into account, including (a) age A
                     g of observers; (b) visual acuity A
                     c of observers; (c) viewing angles (e.g., horizontal viewing angle φ, vertical viewing angle α, or incident angle ξ); (d) visual angle subtense V of characters (V = arctan (H/D)); (e) font; (f) target luminance L
                     t, background luminance L
                     b, or surrounding luminance L
                     s; (g) luminance contrast C or C
                     %; and (h) color contrast ΔE (Cai et al., 2013).

Some quantitative studies developed equations for quantifying the legibility of characters. Cai (2008) collected 96 legibility equations (http://people.ku.edu/∼h717c996/research.html). Among them, Howett (1983) derived an equation, as Equation (1), for estimating the legibility of text (i.e., letters A–Z) viewed perpendicularly. Equation (1) examines five critical factors (text height or strokewidth, viewing distance, background luminance, luminance contrast of text, and the Snellen eyesight of the observer), more than any other equations, but no incident angle, nor the surrounding luminance of the ambient environment.

Another outstanding legibility equation for examining text viewed perpendicularly is Equation (2), which has been used for making eye charts (e.g., E-chart, Snellen chart), used to measure visual acuity of an observer's eyes. Equation (2) was theoretically derived from the minimum angle of resolution (MAR, in minutes of arc, or min arc), which specifies the visual acuity of human eyes, via the geometric relationship between the MAR and the viewing distance D (Holick and Carlson, 2002; Colomb et al., 1991; Cai, 2008). Equation (2) calculates the threshold legible (100% accurate) strokewidth of sans-serif 5 × 5 (i.e., being framed tangentially by a square, 5 unit lengths in height and width) capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z used for making eye charts that are viewed perpendicularly to the observer's eyes. The MAR has different values for different eyesight levels (e.g., MAR = 0.63 min arc for Snellen eyesight 20/12.5, 0.8 for 20/16, 1 for 20/20, 1.25 for 20/25, 1.6 for 20/30, 2.0 for 20/40, 2.5 for 20/50, and 3.2 for 20/60, etc.). Equation (3) was derived from Equation (2) in that the height-to-strokewidth ration (H/S
                     w) of those capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z is 5. Equations (2) and (3) do not include any lighting related critical factors. Instead, they assume an optimal lighting condition—a uniform (variation ≤ 20%) background luminance of at least 120 cd/m2—required for reading eye charts by the British standard BS 4274-1:2003 (BSI, 2003). Therefore, Equation (1) is more useful in practice than Equations (2) and (3) for estimating legibility of text under varying lighting conditions.

On the other hand, Reinwald developed Equation (4) to predict legibility distance of text viewed obliquely from either its horizontal viewing angle (φ) or vertical viewing angle (α), but not both. Since φ and α are both needed to define the incident angle ξ

                     , Reinwald's formula cannot examine all display angles. In addition, without accounting other critical factors, such as target size, contrast, illumination level, observer's acuity, age, etc., Reinwald's formula has limited use for common oblique displays.

Furthermore, Cai (2008) found that different forms were adopted in those regression equations, including power (24 equations adopted this form), linear (19), quadratic (14), logarithm (7), inverse (2), cubic (1), and other mixed types (12). Some equation forms, such as linear, quadratic, or cubic, were chosen by those researchers to best fit the legibility data, without a thorough examination of the physical and psychophysical fundaments behind their research. Nonetheless, it is expected that unitary forms be adopted by equations developed in different visual situations but with the same dependent variable (DV) and independent variables (IV).

Moreover, there lacked an index for evaluating the legibility level of text and graphics presented on oblique displays in those old studies. The conventional Legibility Index, LI (LI = D/H), defined as the distance D at which material can be read with perfect accuracy divided by the character height H, assumes that the viewing material is perpendicular to the observer. The D/H ratio cannot be used for evaluating characters viewed at display angles.


                     Cai et al. (2013) recently conducted a study on legibility of text presented on oblique displays. Cai et al. used nine assumptions to narrow the research scope to achromous letter ‘E’s presented on diffusive displays under uniform glare-free fluorescent lighting, and read at threshold (just readable) 100% accuracy by young people at 20–29 years of age with Snellen acuity ratio 20/20 or better and normal color vision. Cai's study came out with several results, as follows.

                           A new legibility index (LI′), as Equation (5), to evaluate text and graphics viewed at different display angles (Cai and Green, 2009). LI′ is used to replace the conventional legibility index LI (LI = D/H) widely used in the signage industry for legibility evaluation. LI′ is the inverse square root of the solid angle ω

The smaller the solid angle subtended by the legible characters, the larger the calculated value of the LI′, the more legible the characters. The LI′ reflects that people can recognize smaller characters due to its higher legibility.

Equation (6) reveals that people's normal reading habit starts to play a role at large display angles, which lowers their reading performance that could no longer be negligent starting at the critical angle of 65.7° (Cai, 2008).

As the initial effort on quantifying the legibility of text viewed on oblique displays using most (seven) critical factors, Cai's studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai and Green, 2009) still have some limitations. This paper introduces a follow-up laboratory study on quantifying the impact of display angles 0.0°–90.0° on the legibility of sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z commonly used for visual acuity tests. Results were first used for deriving two equations to predict the height of legible Sans-serif capitalized letters viewed at different display angles. Corresponding adjustment of the equations of the new legibility index LI′ was also made to take the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility into account when materials were no longer presented perpendicularly to their sightline which people get used to. The adjustment would eliminate the impact of such interference on lowering the legibility of materials presented at large display angles.

Cai's studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai and Green, 2009) have three unsolved issues that need immediate attention. They limit the applications of the new legibility index LI′ (Equation (5)) and the new legibility equation (Equation (7)), as detailed below.
                        
                           •
                           Cai's study (Cai et al., 2013) did not examine the extremely large display angles 82.8°–90.0°, which actually occur in daily viewing. To create and maintain legible environments, it is necessary to quantify the legibility of text viewed at all possible display angles 0.0°–90.0°.

The assumptions used in Cai's study (Cai et al., 2013) make Equation (7) inapplicable for multiple realistic letters. As a result, Cai recommended deploying the capital letter E (C
                              % = 97.9, black/white, H/W = 1, H/S
                              w = 5) as a reference target in practice, to estimate legible sizes of texts, calculate ideal viewing distances or ideal viewing angles of multiple displays, and design threshold lighting conditions with enhanced legibility (Cai et al., 2013). Future studies will need to examine more realistic letters, such as those Sans-serif capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z, which are commonly used for legibility and visual acuity tests.

The redefined legibility index LI′ (LI′ = ω
                              −0.5) does not take the impact of people's normal reading habit on reading oblique materials into account, which lowers the LI′ value of equally legible characters viewed at extremely large display angles. Fig. 1
                               shows the collected solid angle ω subtended by the threshold legible (100% accuracy) letter ‘E’s viewed at different display angles (0.0°–82.8°), and the calculated values of the corresponding LI′. It was found that for display angles 0.0°–65.7°, calculated values of the LI′ remain constant for all participants with different acuity levels (20/20, 20/16, 20/12.5), which match the steady reading performance (threshold legible 100% accuracy); for display angles above 65.7° till 82.8°, calculated values of the LI′ gradually decrease (since the collected solid angle gradually increases), which does not match the actual reading performance, thus, need correction.

To address these three issues that need immediate attention, this paper introduces a new laboratory study to look into the impact of display angles in a complete range (0.0°–90.0°) on the legibility of the sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z.

The laboratory experiment was conducted in the windowless Bob Foley Illumination Laboratory in 232 Art & Design building at the University of Kansas (KU). Fig. 2
                         illustrates the experiment setup. As shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c), a participant sat on an adjustable chair at one end of the laboratory with his/her head fixed on a chin rest mounted on a table. The human subjects were required to be 20–29 years old, with Snellen acuity ratio 20/20 or better (i.e., 20/20, 20/16, 20/12.5, either corrected or not), and normal color vision. A dimmable LED light panel was mounted on a custom-made wood shelf installed on a table in the front of the laboratory. The shelf, together with the LED panel, could be horizontally rotated (0° ≤ φ ≤ 90°) and vertically tilted (0° ≤ α ≤ 90°) around the center O of the bottom edge of the LED panel. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the most uniform luminous surface (max/min luminance ratio = 1.10) of the LED panel was identified at its center in a rectangular area of 0.216 m × 0.140 m (8.5″ × 5.5″). A black foam board was used to cover the entire LED panel except this small rectangular area, where a 0.216 m × 0.140 m hole was cut to provide uniform and dimmable backlight for the small display window. During the experiment, materials were presented on this display window and viewed by the participant at different display angles.

Initially, the LED panel was facing the participant at an incident angle of 0°, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The distance from the participant's eyes to the center of the 0.216 m × 0.140 m display window was 3 m (9.8 ft). The participant's eyes were fixed at 1.2 m above the floor, same as the height of the center of the display window. However, as shown in Fig. 2(b), when the LED panel was rotated and tilted around the rotation center O, the viewing distance would slightly change, since O did not overlap with the center of the 0.216 m × 0.140 m display window. The adjusted viewing distance D′ was calculated using Equation (8). Due to the same reason, the incident angle ξ could no longer be calculated using 
                           
                              cos

                        . Rather, Equation (9) was used. Nonetheless, Equations (8) and (9) are not recommended for practical uses where displays are rotated and tilted at the center of the display window.

Such a displacement of the rotation center O from the center of the display window to the center of the bottom edge of the LED panel is necessary to accommodate the extremely oblique viewing angles of the display. In the previous study (Cai, 2008), Cai adopted an alternative design with two supporting arms of the wood shelf to tilt and rotate the display around its center. These two supporting arms unfortunately blocked the display window at incident angles larger than 82.8°, which was the maximum angle examined in the laboratory. In this new experiment, therefore, the supporting arms were removed to accommodate the extremely oblique angles larger than 82.8°.

The experiment was conducted in two sessions at different ambient light levels. At Session I, the general light of the laboratory was turned on, as shown in Fig. 2(c), with an average surrounding luminance L
                        s = 6.89 cd/m2, measured using the high dynamic range (HDR) photography (Cai and Chung, 2011). At Session II, the general light was turned off, as shown in Fig. 2(d), L
                        s = 0.04 cd/m2. The purpose of testing different ambient light levels in this experiment was to find the impact of ambient light on the text legibility at extremely large display angles close to 90°, which has not yet been investigated in Cai's previous studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai, 2008).

The viewing materials used in this experiment consisted of the sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. Their mixed uses are recommended by the British Standard BS 4274-1:2003 (BSI, 2003) for testing visual acuity of human eyes. The choice of these letters was based on two reasons, as follows:
                           
                              •
                              Based on a previous study (Cai and Green, 2009, Fig. 9), those Sans-Serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C (index of legibility difficulty = 1.07), D (1.03), E (1.00), F (1.04), H (0.92), K (1.05), N (1.00), P (1.04), R (0.97), U (1.07), V (1.03), and Z (1.01) have statistically equivalent (p = 0.15) values of the legibility difficulty index.

In addition, those upright capitalized letters are capable of being framed tangentially by a square, 5 unit lengths in height and width (British Standard BS 4274-1:2003). Therefore, they are appropriate for testing legibility loss at extremely large viewing angles close to 90°, no matter how they are vertically tilted or horizontally rotated or both simultaneously in the experiment.

The height of those sans-serif letters, which are threshold legible (100% accurate) to the observer, was predictable using Equation (10), from the minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of the observer's eyes, the display angle ξ (calculated using Equation (9)), and the adjusted viewing distance D′ (calculated using Equation (8)). MAR equals 1 min arc for human subjects with eyesight 20/20, 0.8 min arc for 20/16, and 0.63 min arc for 20/12.5 (BSI, 2003).

Nonetheless, the actual height (H
                        observed) of those legible letters observed by each participant in the laboratory might differ from the predicted height (H
                        predicted), due to individual differences in visual perception. To accommodate this uncertainty, each viewing material consisted of multiple (mostly 10) lines of those sans-serif letters. Between lines there was a graduation of height at a step of H
                        predicted/5—the strokewidth S
                        w of the threshold legible (100% accuracy) letters. The H
                        predicted was assigned to the third to the last line on each viewing material. Materials were printed in black/white (C
                        % = 92.4 ± 0.6) on transparencies in a resolution of 600 DPI, which were attached on the uniform display window of the LED panel. The height of each line was labeled on the right margin of the material in font 7 (2.5 mm), which was out of the display window (no backlight), thus, illegible to the participant.

A unique viewing material was designed for each display angle tested in the laboratory at each eyesight level (i.e., 20/20, 20/16, or 20/12.5) of the human subjects. As a result, the number of viewing materials tested by each participant was determined by the number of display angles tested in the laboratory. For example, Fig. 3
                         shows three materials viewed by the same participant at three different incident angles (ξ = 0.0°, 45.0°, 65.8°).

Regarding the independent and dependent variables, one dependent variable (DV) and two independent variables (IV) were examined in the laboratory. The DV was the recognized height (H
                        observed) of the threshold legible (just readable 100% accurate) letters at each trial. The IV includes the display angle ξ and the surrounding luminance L
                        s (L
                        s = 6.89 cd/m2 when the general light was on, and 0.04 cd/m2 when the it was turned off.). The solid angle subtense (ω) of the observed threshold legible letters at different display angles could be derived using

                        . Note that for those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters, the width (W) equals the height (H).

All other factors involved in the experiment had preset values. For example, the font type (sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters), the color contrast of those letters (black/white), the luminance contrast of those letters (C
                        % = 92.4 ± 0.6), the background luminance of the viewing materials at different display angles (dimmed to a constant value about 280.0 cd/m2 in the direction of the participant's sightline, independent of display angles), the recognition performance (threshold legible with 100% accuracy), the unique age (20–29), eyesight (20/20 or better), and color vision (normal) of each individual subject, etc.

The experiment procedure is listed below, step by step.
                           
                              •
                              Before the subject came, the experimenter prepared the eyesight test and the first trial of the experiment at Session I. The small display window of the LED panel was dimmed to a constant luminance (L
                                 b) about 280.0 cd/m2.

The subject came in the laboratory when the general light was on (Session I). He/she was tested for his/her eyesight and asked to self-declare his/her normal color vision. Only qualified subjects continued to participate in this study.

The experimenter spent 5 min to introduce the study, the procedure of the experiment, and the paperwork to the subject. Before the subject signed the consent form, all his/her questions were answered.

The subject started the first trial (ξ = 0.0°) at Session I to read loudly those sans-serif capitalized letters on each line of the viewing material, and across lines from an upper line to a lower line (or occasionally in a reversed order to double check) until the subjects could no longer read correctly. There was no time limitation. During the process, the experimenter took a photograph of the test scene with a remote using a Canon EOS Rebel T2i mounted behind the subject. Then, the experimenter recorded the height (H
                                 observed) of the last line of letters that the participant could read at a threshold performance of just readable 100% accuracy, by referring to its mark on the right margin of the materials.

The subject was asked to turn around for a break when the experimenter set up the second trial. The background luminance (L
                                 b) of the small display window of the LED panel was increased to remain at the constant 280.0 cd/m2. Then, the subject turned back to the chin rest and had his/her eyes adapted for at least 2 min before the second trial was conducted in a way similar to that at the first trial.

This step was repeated for all other trials of the first session. Except the first trial (ξ = 0.0°), all other trials were conducted in a random order, to alleviate the impact of eye fatigue occurred at large display angles on reading performance.

Next, the subject was given a 10-min break. He/she might leave the laboratory for a stretch or using the restroom. Meanwhile, the experimenter turned off the general light to set up the first trial at the second session. The surface luminance (L
                                 b) of the display window was again dimmed to 280.0 cd/m2.

The participant sat in dark for at least 5 min to have his/her eyes fully adapted to the dark environment and then took the first trial at Session 2.

This process repeated for all other trials at Session II. With the general light off, all trials at the second session were randomly conducted.

After the experiment was completed, the subject was paid for their participation at both sessions. All collected data were then stored for further analysis.

A pilot run of the experiment using 10 young college students (20–29 years of age) was first conducted to find the largest incident angle at which the materials could still be readable, and prepare for the main experiment. The so identified largest incident angle could help finalize the setup of the main experiment. Those 10 subjects were asked to read viewing materials presented on the display window of the LED panel at a total of 14 display angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 49.4°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 78.2°, 83.1°, 85.2°, 89.0°), as shown in Table 1
                        . Fig. 4
                         shows the subjects' actual view of the viewing materials attached on the display window at different incident angles. Note that 90° was not included in the pilot run since no materials could be read at 90°, instead, 89° was tested. During the experiment, the luminance L
                        b of the display window was dimmed to 280.8 ± 1.0 cd/m2 at Session I, and 280.7 ± 1.1 cd/m2 at Session II, independent of incident angles.

Later it was found that at the largest incident angle 89.0°, all 10 subjects (100%) failed to read the materials at both sessions. Even the largest letters were not visible to them. At the second to the largest incident angle 85.2°, three subjects (30%) failed to read the materials at Session I, while two subjects (20%) failed to read the materials at Session II. At all other 12 display angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 49.4°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 78.2°, 83.1°), no subject (0%) failed to read the materials at either session. As a result, the threshold incident angle ξ
                        50%, where the viewing materials were readable by 50% of the young subjects, is 85.2° < ξ
                        50% < 89.0°. The largest incident angle ξ
                        max at which the materials could still be readable with 100% accuracy is 83.1° ≤ ξ
                        max < 85.2°.

Accordingly, the display angles to be examined in the main experiment were adjusted to 15 incident angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 51.7°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 79.4°, 83.1°, 85.2°, 87.0°, 88.0°), by removing 89.0°, 78.2°, and 49.4°, and adding 51.7°, 79.4°, 87.0°, and 88.0°, as shown in Table 1. Accordingly, new viewing materials were made for each added incident angles (ξ = 51.7°, 79.4°, 87.0°, 88.0°).

A total of 20 young subjects (20–29 years old) participated in the main experiment. One subject (N = 1) had Snellen acuity of 20/12.5, 13 subjects (N = 13) had acuity 20/16, while six subjects (N = 6) had acuity 20/20. Fig. 5
                         illustrates the 15 trials conducted by one of the subjects at the first session with the general lighting on. The subject repeated the 15 trials in random order at the second session when the general light was turned off. For quick reference, Table 2
                         summarizes all the variables tested or preset in the main experiment.

@&#RESULTS@&#

It was found that at the largest display angle 88.0°, 19 out of the 20 subjects (95%) failed to read even the largest letters of the viewing materials at both sessions in the main experiment. At the second to the largest display angle 87.0°, six subjects (30%) failed to read the materials at Session I, and five subjects (25%) failed at Session II. At the third to the largest display angle 85.2°, two subjects (10%) failed to read the materials at Session I, and one subject (5%) failed at Session II. At all other smaller display angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 51.7°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 79.4°, 83.1°), no subject (0%) failed to read the materials at either session. Consequently, the threshold incident angle ξ
                     50%, at which the viewing materials were barely readable by 50% of the subjects, was in a narrow range of 87.0° < ξ
                     50% < 88.0°. Remember that 85.2° < ξ
                     50% < 89.0° as identified in the pilot run. The largest display angle at which the materials were still readable with 100% accuracy was 83.1° ≤ ξ
                     max < 85.2°, which confirmed the findings obtained from the pilot experiment.

The recorded legible heights (H
                     observed) of the materials viewed by the 20 young subjects in the main experiment were further analyzed versus the 15 incident angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 51.7°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 79.4°, 83.1°, 85.2°, 87.0°, 88.0°) and the two ambient light levels (L
                     s = 6.89 cd/m2 at Session I, and 0.04 cd/m2 at Session II).

First, independent of different eyesight levels of the participants, H
                     observed/H
                     predicted was used to quantify the text legibility at different incident angles at each session in the main experiment. H
                     observed is the observed threshold legible (just readable 100% accuracy) height of a sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letter. H
                     predicted is the predicted height of the threshold legible letter at the third to the last line on each viewing material, using Equation (10). Fig. 6(a) and (b) illustrates the error bar plots of the subjects' reading performance at Session I and II, respectively, which consists of 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted versus different display angles. As shown in Fig. 6, the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted collected from the 20 subjects at both sessions gradually increases with the display angles.

Second, the ratios of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted obtained at both sessions were analyzed with SPSS, using a one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests, for the impact of ambient light (L
                     s = 6.89 cd/m2 at Session I, and 0.04 cd/m2 at Session II) on the subjects' reading performance. With the Pearson's r = 0.932, a partial correlation, controlled at each of the 15 display angles, was found between the ratios of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted obtained at session I with the general lighting and the ratios at session II without the general light. There was no significant difference of the 20 subjects' reading performance between these two sessions, indicating a negligible impact of the ambient light on the text legibility.

Since no significant difference was found in the subjects' reading performance between sessions I and II, the legibility data obtained at both sessions were combined to plot in SPSS a more reliable trendline of the text legibility versus different incident angles. Fig. 7
                      illustrates the Loess curve that fits 50% of the points at a confident level of 95% at both sessions. The Loess curve shows that the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted is on a trendline of three segments. In the first segment with the incident angles from 0.0° till probably 51.7°, the trendline is almost a constant (H
                     observed/H
                     predicted = 1.00). In the second segment of the trendline, from 51.7° to appropriately 71.6°, the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted gradually increases, non-linearly. In the third segment of the trendline, the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted rapidly increases from 71.6° till 88.0° (the largest display angle tested in the main experiment). Beyond 88.0° till 90.0°, the viewing materials were no long visible.

A non-linear regression equation was then generated with SPSS to approximate the three segments of the trendline shown in Fig. 7. The ratios of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted obtained at both sessions were combined for generating this regression equation, since no significant difference was found in the subjects' reading performance between sessions. In addition, during the regression process, the average offset of the mean H
                     observed/H
                     predicted from the line of the regression equation was calculated at display angles from 0.0° to 65.8° (before people's normal reading habit starts to play a significant role on the participants' reading performance at large oblique angles, see more details later), to justify the regression equation so that it best fits the observed data with the smallest offset. As a result, Equation (11) (R
                     2 = 0.859) was generated to fit the mean ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted at different display angles 0.0°–88.0°. With Equation (11), the average offset at those eight display angles (0.0°–65.8°) was minimum (0.0231 ± 0.0200). Fig. 8

As shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3, the mean ratios of the recorded H
                     observed/H
                     predicted gradually increase at the first eight display angles 0.0°–65.8°. Yet the increase over this span of display angles is so small that even at 65.8°, the average H
                     observed/H
                     predicted (i.e., 1.18) is still less than 1.2. Since the minimum increase of letter height between lines on the viewing materials is H
                     predicted/5, which is the strokewidth S
                     w of the threshold legible (100% accuracy) letters, the minimum increase of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted is 1/5 = 0.2. Therefore, the fluctuations of the average H
                     observed/H
                     predicted at the first eight display angles (0° ≤ ξ ≤ 65.8°) from a constant 1 are all less than the minimum increase of 0.2. Such a steady reading performance (H
                     observed/H
                     predicted = 1) of the 20 participants recorded in the laboratory at both sessions means that the interfering effect of the normal reading habit is negligent at display angles 0° ≤ ξ ≤ 65.8°. Even without correction, the revised legibility index LI′ (LI′ = ω
                     −0.5) could still be used to effectively evaluate legibility.

However, at display angles above 65.8°, the calculated ratios of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted rapidly increase with a spike at 88.0° (the largest display angle tested in the laboratory, above which the viewing materials were no longer visible). Equation (11) is used to approximate this rapid increase at display angles 65.8°–88.0°. Remember that the largest display angle at which the materials were still readable with 100% accuracy was 83.1° ≤ ξ
                     max < 85.2°, while the threshold incident angle ξ
                     50%, at which the viewing materials were barely readable by 50% of the subjects, was in a narrow range of 87.0° < ξ
                     50% < 88.0°. Therefore, although the subjects were required not to guess during the experiment, they were not confident on their reading performance at display angles larger than 83.1°. The loss of confidence was getting worse with the increase of display angles. As a result, guessing was unavoidable when the materials were presented at extremely oblique display angles 87.0° and 88.0°. Equation (11), which represents confident reading performance with threshold legible 100% accuracy, compensates for such a loss of legibility at 87.0° and 88.0° by overestimating their predicted ratios of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted.

Moreover, to correct the interference of people's normal reading habit that lowers the values of the revised legibility index LI′ (LI′ = ω
                     −0.5) at large oblique display angles, another non-linear regression equation, Equation (12), was derived from Equation (11) to quantify the participants' reading performance in terms of ω
                     observed/ω
                     predicted (ratio of the solid angle subtended by the observed threshold legible letters to the predicted one with equivalent legibility level). Since those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters have equivalent width (W) and height (H), their solid angle subtense (ω) at different display angles could be derived using

                      of the legible letters viewed at display angles using conventional tools. Equation (11) is used to quantify the impact of display angles on the legibility of those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. Using Equation (11), the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted can be predicted in practice at any possible display angles within a complete range of 0.0°–88.0° (from 88.0° to 90.0°, the viewing materials are no longer visible to the observer). Equation (11) approximates a continuous curve in the whole range of display angles (0.0°–88.0°), which fits the three segments of the trendline shown in Fig. 7. Nonetheless, the previous finding, Equation (6), which was used to quantify the impact of display angles on the legibility of a capitalized letter E, breaks the curve into two lines to better fit the laboratory data. Thus, here arises a question: is a continuous curve, as described by Equation (11), truly better than two segments of lines, as descried by Equation (6), to quantify the impact of display angles on the legibility of text?

To answer this question, Equation (11) needs to be compared to Equation (6) in light of (i) their approximation to their original legibility data, and (ii) underlying physical and psychophysical fundaments for the choice of their equation forms (power versus linear).

Unfortunately, there are two limitations on direct comparison of Equations (11) and (6). First, Equations (11) and (6) were used to examine different target text. Equation (11) examines more realistic letters (sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z), than the single capital letter E (with H/W = 1 and H/Sw = 5, black/white) examined by Equation (6). Second, Equation (11) examines a complete range of useful display angles (0.0°–88.0°), but Equation (6) does not examine the extremely oblique angles 82.8°–88.0°, at which the target text is still visible. As a result, a new equation, Equation (13) (R
                     2 = 0.709), was developed in this study, following the example of Equation (6) developed in the previous study (Cai et al., 2013) to approximate the legibility data using two overlapping lines. Fig. 9
                      illustrates the observed mean ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted recorded at the 15 display angles (ξ = 0.0°, 15.0°, 30.0°, 45.0°, 51.7°, 56.8°, 60.0°, 65.8°, 71.6°, 75.9°, 79.4°, 83.1°, 85.2°, 87.0°, 88.0°) in this study, and the curve/lines of Equations (11) and (13), as well as the lines of Equation (6) that are extended to 88.0° used for reference purpose solely.

As shown in Fig. 9, the continuous curve defined using Equation (11) approximates much closer to the average reading performance of human subjects in the laboratory, especially at the second segment of the trendline in between 51.7° and 79.4°, in which Equation (13) does not reflect such a gradual change in a reasonable manner. In addition, for extremely oblique display angles larger than 85.2°, where materials can no longer be readable with 100% accuracy (thus, guessing was introduced), Equation (13) underestimated the impact of display angles on legibility. In contrast, Equation (11) overestimated the impact, which is practically preferable (being conservative) to avoid guessing for enhanced legibility.

On the other hand, the choice of an appropriate form for a regression equation shall be determined by not only a better mathematical fit of the collected legibility data, but also the physical and psychophysical fundaments of the form behind the research. As reviewed before, 24 of the 79 regression equations collected by Cai (2008) adopt the power of geometrical ratios, such as height-to-width-to ratio, height-to-strokewidth ratio, height-to-spacing ratio, to interpret the legibility of text. Stevens' power law (Stevens, 1957) is believed the fundament behind this. Stevens' power law, as 
                        
                           ψ
                           =
                           k
                           
                              ϕ
                              β
                           
                        
                      (where ψ = sensation magnitude, φ = stimulus magnitude, β = constant (0.33 for brightness, 1.0 for visual length, 0.70 for visual area), k = a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used), is very accurate to interpret the relation between sensory magnitude judgments and the stimulus magnitude for suprathreshold performance, which applies to the legibility of text (Gescheider, 1985). In this case, the sensory magnitude judgment is the threshold legible subjective brightness of the text strokes or details of the background, while the stimulus magnitude is the luminance intensity of the text strokes and its spatial layout along the sightline. Therefore, the power of the ratio of H
                     observed/H
                     predicted could be used as a factor in the target legibility equation.

In addition, according to Lambert's cosine law, the luminous intensity observed from an ideal diffuse light-emitting surface (e.g., the LED display window tested in this study) is directly proportional to the cosine of the display angle ξ, as 
                        
                           
                              I
                              ξ
                           
                           =
                           
                              I
                              0
                           
                           cos
                           
                           ξ
                        
                      (where I
                     
                        ξ
                      is the luminance intensity of the display window observed at the display angle ξ, I
                     0 is the luminance intensity of the display window viewed perpendicularly). As a result, cos ξ could be used as a factor in the target legibility equation to interpret the luminous intensity I
                     
                        ξ
                     , which is the stimulus magnitude in the Stevens' power law, at different display angles.

Conclusively, a continuous curve described by Equation (11), which is supported by the Stevens' power law and Lambert's cosine law, is better than two segmented lines described by Equation (13) for quantifying the impact of display angles on the legibility of text in practice.

This paper introduced a follow-up laboratory study for quantifying the impact of display angles on the legibility of text, to overcome the three limitations of previous studies (Cai et al., 2013; Cai and Green, 2009) on this topic, including (i) extremely oblique display angles 82.8°–88.0° were not tested; (ii) more realistic letters need to be tested, other than the single capital letter E (with H/W = 1 and H/Sw = 5, black/white); and (iii) the revised legibility index LI′ (LI′ = ω
                     −0.5) cannot eliminate the interruption of people's normal reading habit on reading performance at extreme oblique viewing angles.

Based on the outcomes of this study, multiple conclusions can be drawn as follows.
                        
                           •
                           This study identified a complete range of display angles 0.0°–88.0° (rather than 0.0°–90.0°), in which the viewing materials (i.e., sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z) could possibly be visible to an observer. Beyond 88° till 90°, the viewing materials were no long visible. The largest display angle at which the materials can still be readable with 100% accuracy was identified between 83.1° and 85.2°. Beyond this critical angle till 88.0°, materials can no longer be read confidently (with 100% accuracy), thus, guessing was unavoidable in the reading performance of those participants, although they were asked not to guess.

The continuous curve of Equation (11) is relevant with Stevens' power law and Lambert's cosine law, which can better approximate the subjects' reading performance at different display angles. Based on Equation (11), two new legibility equations, as Equations (14) and (15), were developed by integrating Equations (1) and (3) into Equation (11) respectively. For Equations (14) and (15), the display angle 0.0° ≤ ξ ≤ 88.0°. For 88.0° < ξ ≤ 90.0°, materials are no longer visible to an observer. Note that Equations (14) and (15) are useful only for sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z. Equation (15) is useful only for optimal viewing conditions—black/white letters with luminance contrast not less than 0.9, presented on uniform (variation ≤ 20%) displays whose surface luminance ≥ 120 cd/m2—defined by the British standard BS 4274-1:2003 for benefit of visual acuity test. Equation (14) can provide more accurate evaluation results when reading those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters in varying or less-than-optimal lighting conditions.

A modified legibility index LI″, as Equation (16), to correct the interference of people's normal reading habit on evaluating the legibility levels of characters viewed at extreme oblique display angles. Equation (16) was derived by integrating Equation (12) into Equation (5). Fig. 10(a)–(c) illustrates the corrected LI″ of the reading performance in the main experiment of the 20 participants (1 subject has eyesight 20/12.5, 13 subjects have eyesight 20/16, while 6 subjects have eyesight 20/20). As shown in Fig. 10, the average observed solid angle subtended by those threshold legible (100% accuracy) Sans-serif capitalized letters at different display angles is almost constant till at extremely large display angles, where it gradually increases. Nonetheless, the corrected LI″ of the average observed solid angle remains almost constant over the whole span of 0.0°–88.0°, matching the actual constant threshold performance (just readable 100% accurate) observed in the laboratory. In contrast, the uncorrected LI′ slowly goes down at large display angles, in that it does not correct the interference of people's normal reading habit on legibility evaluation.

Using Equations (14)–(16), it is possible for assessment of the legibility levels of those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z presented at different display angles in daily applications. Nonetheless, applications of the derived two equations and the modified legibility index LI’’, so far, should be based on those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z only, since other Sans-Serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters or other font types of text have different values of legibility difficulty index whose role on interruption of the legibility at different display angles has not yet been researched. Based on this study, those letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z can be confidently used as prepared targets or reference letters in any fields outside acuity tests for evaluation of legible environments. Possible applications include estimation of legible sizes of those letters viewed at fixed distances and angles, calculation of ideal viewing distances or angles for a single or multiple displays where those letters are presented as reference targets, and determination of the threshold lighting conditions of a scene (e.g., background luminance L
                     b, luminance contrast C
                     %) without sacrificing its legibility using Equation (14), etc. (Cai et al., 2013).

Generalization of the findings of this study to other human factors and ergonomics related fields is possible only when those sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z are used either as the targets or as the references. The predicted results using those Sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters will be used as a reference in practice. This puts a limitation on examining the legibility of real text of great interests to human factors practitioners. To overcome this limitation, further studies need to quantify the legibility difficulty index of all Sans-Serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters (A – Z) as well as other font types of text. Based on the indices, an adjustment factor may be added into those two equations and the modified legibility index LI″ to predict the legibility of real letters, which will need field validations using real text and the reference sans-serif 5 × 5 capitalized letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z.

However, there are still two more issues that will affect the use of these three equations as well as their revised versions in the future in practice, as detailed below. Further research work is needed to resolve them..

                           The laboratory validation used only young people with Snellen acuity 20/20 or better and normal color vision, as the “normal” observer. The elderly with worse acuity levels were not addressed. Thus, legibility levels estimated using Equations (14)–(16) should serve as the bottom line only. Higher legibility levels are always needed for compensating less than optimal viewing of aged observers with worse eyesight. Future study will need to consider the aging effect on legibility, and test the legibility equations using subjects in different age groups.

Conventionally, rulers, tapes, wheel rolls, calipers, micrometers, laser distance meters, and laser rangefinders can measure distances, while protractors and magnetic angle locators are used for measuring 2D angles. However, no conventional tools could be used to directly measure the projected area (i.e.,

A new camera-aided measurement method with aid of the recently developed high dynamic range (HDR) photogrammetry (Cai, 2013) is thus in need.
