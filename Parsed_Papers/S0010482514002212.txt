                  α-linolenic acid (ALA) is the most frequent omega-3 in plants. The content of ALA is highly variable, ranging from 0 to 1% in rice and corn to >50% in perilla and flax. ALA production is strongly correlated with the enzymatic activity of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of omega-3 diversity, 895 protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase were compared between plants with high and low omega-3. Attribute weighting showed that this enzyme in plants with high omega-3 content has higher amounts of Lys, Lys-Phe, and Pro-Asn but lower Aliphatic index, Gly-His, and Pro-Leu. The Random Forest model with Accuracy criterion when run on the dataset pre-filtered with Info Gain algorithm was the best model in distinguishing high omega-3 content based on the frequency of Lys–Lys in the structure of fatty acid desaturase. Interestingly, the discriminant function algorithm could predict the level of omega-3 only based on the six important selected attributes (out of 895 protein attributes) of fatty acid desaturase with 75% accuracy. We developed “Plant omega3 predictor” to predict the content of α-linolenic acid based on structural features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. The software calculates the 6 key structural protein features from imported Fasta sequence of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase or utilizes the imported features and predicts the ALA content using discriminant function formula. This work unravels an underpinning mechanism of omega-3 diversity via discovery of the key protein attributes in the structure of omega-3 desaturase offering a new approach to obtain higher omega-3 content.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Omega-3s are polyunsaturated fatty acids that the body needs but cannot make them [1]. α-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3, has important roles in human health [1]. The use of ALA can reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [2]. ALA is synthesized via introducing a desaturation bond into linoleic acid (LA) by omega-3 fatty acid desaturase [3]. In plant species, ALA level is strongly correlated with the enzymatic activity of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. This enzymatic reaction can take place in the membranes of both the plastids and microsomes [3,4].

The low level of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase activity in seeds of cereal has resulted in the low ALA content in these plants. It has been reported that ALA synthesis in seeds is mostly catalyzed by microsomal fatty acid desaturase [5]. Interestingly, introducing heterologous microsomal fatty acid desaturase genes under the control of the CaMV 35S and Ubi-1 promoters resulted in a high-level accumulation of ALA in transgenic rice seeds (up to 2.5 and 13-fold, respectively) [6,7]. Hua et al., showed that rice seeds overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum localized soybean-originated microsomal fatty acid desaturase and rice-originated microsomal fatty acid desaturase gained 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher ALA than that of non-transformants, respectively [8]. Human beings cannot convert LA into ALA because of the lack of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase [9]. Therefore, ALA must be obtained through the diet. The major dietary sources of ALA are restricted to some deep sea fishes and specific oilseed plants such as flax (Linum usitatissimum), soybean (Glycine soja), rape (Brassicca napus), and perilla (Perilla frutescens). More recently, decreasing global fish supply and heavy metal pollution in sea water have limited the fish consumption [8]. There are few numbers of oilseed plants with high ALA content. However, high ALA content reduces the oxidative stability of oil and leads to rancidity in food products [10]. Therefore, in recent years, developing new varieties with decreased ALA content has been one of the goals in oilseed breeding [11,12]. Altogether, there is a considerable demand to develop non-oilseed plants with high ALA contents [8]. Indeed, oils with high polyunsaturated fatty acid have industrial applications including paints, ink carriers, and fuel [13,14]. Understanding the underlying molecular bases of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase activity in high ALA containing plants and subsequent engineering of this enzyme in non-oilseed plants are main pathways to achieve the high level of ALA.

Many attributes are required to illustrate different characteristics of a protein molecule. there is a high probability that some aspects of protein structure do not capture when a limited number of protein features is considered [15–17]. As a result, feature extraction to construct a proper and comprehensive feature vector of proteins is vital in success of any classifier. We recently demonstrated that increasing feature number and adding features such as dipeptides significantly contribute in achieving high prediction accuracy [18–20].

Structural and physicochemical features of proteins, such as amino acid compositions, dipeptide compositions, pseudo amino acid compositions, normalized Moreau-Broto autocorrelation, Moran autocorrelation, Geary autocorrelation are important class of employed features in this context [21,22]. In particular, 400 dipeptide features are good candidates which monitor protein structural alteration in amino acid level [15,19,20]. In our previous work on salinity, increasing the number of features to more than 800 resulted in higher accuracy of predictive models in discriminating halotolerant from halo-sensitive proteins [20]. Also, more robust training trough increasing the range and number of amino acid features provided the feasibility of predicting thermostability, irrespective of sequence similarity from any input protein sequence [19]. In line with this discussion, Das Roy and Dash showed that large and relevant feature set gives an opportunity to select the most relevant ones and develop more robust classifiers [23]. It has been discussed that for a successful prediction, a proper coding of proteins is necessary where using a full and proper protein feature set gives the best result [24].

Sting or repeats of amino acid/nucleotide is another type of features which has been used in “composition vectors based methods” for alignment-free classification/clustering strategy [25–27]. This approach counts the number of these repeats within different genomes or genes ranging from 1 to 7 (in maximum). Due to their limited numbers, this class of features is not able to compete with physic-chemical protein features in providing a comprehensive view on protein structure.

To prevent losing the information of sequence-order, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) has been introduced [28–30] and extensively used in the study of protein structure [31–34]. The exponential increase in the number of protein attributes highlights the need for more advanced analytical tools compared to the commonly used multivariate based methods.

Fuzzy logic, neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machine (SVM) are the most effective modeling techniques within the available mathematical models [16,19,35,36]. Numerous studies have considered modeling and prediction of food characteristics [35]. As example, Yalçin and Tasdemir developed a fuzzy expert system for prediction of ALA content of eggs from hens fed with flaxseed [37]. They achieved a high correlation between experimental values and expert system based prediction [37]. Rheological features were also used to model fatty acid composition of 7 vegetable oils (hazelnut, soybean, sunflower, olive, canola, corn, and cotton seed) using neuro fuzzy inference and neural network [38]. The effects of natural antioxidant compounds on hazelnut oil oxidation were also modeled by neuro-fuzzy inference system and neural network [35]. Fuzzy logic has been also used to model the effects of environmental treatments on food [39]. Decision trees are interesting models as a Decision Tree looks for regularities in data, determines the features to add at the next level of the tree to minimize the entropy impurity [40,41]. Decision Tree is of great attention in the recent prediction investigations since it presents the hierarchical ranking of important features and provides a clear image of protein structure variation [36,42]. Recently, Decision Tree models have been used to identify the key physiological and agronomic traits as well as maker discovery in plants [36,43,44]. It should be noted that the combination of attribute weighting algorithms with the above mentioned predictive models has the potential to increase the accuracy of prediction and decrease the complexity of analysis.

Possible link between ALA content and amino acid characteristics of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase has not been investigated yet. In this study, using amino acid attributes, we compared the molecular structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase between plants with low and high ALA. To this end, we made a big dataset of protein attributes of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase proteins in plants with high and low ALA content by the help of computational biology. Then, attribute weighting (feature selection) algorithms, predictive Decision Tree models as well as statistical univariate and multivariate were used to find the key protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (contributing to its function). This provided statistical models for prediction of enzyme performance based on the structural amino acid attributes. We developed a software, Plant omega3 (α-linolenic acid), to predict high and low content of α-linolenic acid based on the sequence-based structural protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. These results would be advantageous for engineering novel omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in future investigations.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

The following steps are required for developing a reliable predictor for a protein system as well as finding the key distinguishing the features which significantly contribute in function/phenotype: (1) making a big dataset of protein attributes for training and testing, (2) application of different attribute weighting (features election) models to unravel the most important attributes which have correlation with target variable (label), (3) fitting a reliable mathematical formula (algorithm/model) for prediction, (4) measuring the prediction accuracy to evaluate the strength of the developed predictive system, (5) providing a UIRL or a software based on the important discovered features to provide a predictive application [45].

From ExPASY (http://www.expasy.org/) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases, amino acid and coding sequences of 40 omega-3 fatty acid desaturases from different plants were extracted. Then, the percentages of ALA in various plants were collected from literature (
                        Table 1). Perilla and flax accessions were classified as omega-3 fatty acid desaturases with high ALA level (>50%). Accessions in other plants were classified as omega-3 fatty acid desaturases in plants with low ALA level (<50%).

Eight hundred and ninety five protein features such as aliphatic index, weight, isoelectric point, non-reduced Cys extinction coefficient at 280nm, half-life, atomic composition (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen), the count and frequency of each amino acids, the count and frequency of both negatively and positively charged, hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, the count and frequency of dipeptides, and length were extracted using CLC Main Workbench software (CLC bio, Denmark). This dataset is represented in Supplementary 1. For data cleaning, numerical attributes which possessed standard deviations less than or equal to a given deviation threshold (0.1) were assumed useless and removed. We called this dataset final cleaned dataset (FCdb) and used for next attribute weighting analysis.

In dataset of protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturases (FCdb), except ALA content, all features were classified as continuous variables. A dataset of these protein features (FCdb) was imported into Rapid Miner software (Rapid Miner 5.0.001, Dortmund, Germany); the amount of ALA was set as target (label) attribute (categorized as H=High, L=Low) and the other variables as input variables.

To determine how structural protein attributes of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase are effective in determining ALA content, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms including weighting by PCA, weighting by Uncertainty, weighting by Relief, weighting by Chi Squared, weighting by Gini Index, weighting by Deviation, weighting by Rule, weighting by Gain Ratio, weighting by Info Gain, and weighting by SVM were applied on the final cleaned database (FCdb). Attribute weighting algorithms find the most important protein attributes which differ in structure of fatty acid desaturases between high and low ALA containing plants. In addition, 10 new generated datasets, produced by trimming the original dataset (FCdb) by attribute weighting algorithms, as well as the original FCdb dataset (11 datasets in total) were used as input for Decision Tree models.

Sixteen Tree Induction models including Decision Tree (DT) Accuracy, DT Gain Ratio, DT Gini Index, DT Info Gain, DT Parallel Accuracy, DT Parallel Gain Ratio, DT Parallel Gini Index, DT Parallel Info Gain, DT Stump Accuracy, DT Stump Gain Ratio, DT Stump Gini Index, DT Stump Info Gain, DT Random Forest Accuracy, DT Random Forest Gain Ratio, DT Random Forest Gini Index, and DT Random Forest Info Gain were run on eleven datasets including the original FCdb dataset and 10 datasets filtered by 10 Chi Squared, Info Gain, Deviation, Gini Index, Info Gain Ratio, PCA, Relief, Rule, Uncertainty, and SVM attribute weighting algorithms, corresponding to the procedure previously described [19].

Performances of different models in prediction of ALA content of plants based on structural attributes of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase were calculated and used for comparing different models. In this study, performance was defined as measuring the accuracy of the model. Accuracy is calculated by taking the percentage of correct predictions over the total number of examples. Correct prediction means examples where value of prediction attribute is equal to the value of label attribute.

Various statistical methods such as descriptive statistics, mean comparisons (Baysian T-test, T-test and ANOVA), general linear models (univariate, multivariate) were applied on the six features important in enzyme activity obtained by attribute weighting algorithms in order to interpret the differences in omega-3 fatty acid desaturase structure between high and low ALA groups. These six proteins were: Aliphatic index, Freq of Lys, Count of Lys-Phe, Freq of Gly-His, Freq of Pro-Leu, and Freq of Pro-Asn. The agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was applied on dataset filtered using weighting algorithms. The method used in this cluster analysis was single linkage. Manhattan distance was applied to compute the distance among items in this study.

Based on the outcomes of this study on discovery of the key amino acid attributes in the structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase, we developed a software using java language to predict high and low content of α-linolenic acid (plant omega-3). The used amino acid attributes were: Frequency of Lys, Count of Lys-Phe, Frequency of Pro-Asn, Aliphatic index, Frequency of Gly-His, and Frequency of Pro-Leu. This software works with two types of inputs: (A) Fasta format of protein and (B) directly imported protein features. This software can predict level of α-linolenic acid content produced by 75% accuracy.

The software employs the developed Discriminant Functions (Linear Discriminant Function for Groups) to predict/separate α-linolenic acid content based on features involved in protein structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase as follows:

Various attribute weighting algorithms were employed to define the most important protein features. Since data were normalized before running weighting models, it would be expected that all weights should be between 0 and 1. Values closer to 1 are the index of higher effectiveness of attribute (
                        Table 2). The most important protein attributes of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase effective in ALA content were selected based on the number of weighting algorithms which showed an attribute is important. Value closer to1 indicates higher effectiveness of attribute.


                        Weighting by PCA. Applying this model indicated non-reduced Cys extinction coefficient at 280nm is the most important attributes with the weight equal to 1.00, (Table 2).


                        Weighting by SVM. Eleven attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by SVM algorithm. The frequencies of Pro-Asn, Pro-Leu, Gly-His, and Leu, counts of Gly-His, Lys-Phe, Lys-Lys, Met-Cys, Cys-Tyr, and Ser-Asp as well as Aliphatic index had 0.95, 0.92, 0.90, 0.76, 0.88, 0.85, 0.79, 0.77, 0.71, 0.71, and 0.71 weights, respectively (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Relief. Relief algorithm solely determined one attribute with weight higher than 0.70 where frequency of Hydrogen was weighted equal to 1.00 (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Uncertainty. Three attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Uncertainty algorithm. Frequencies of Lys-Phe, Pro-Asn, and count of Met-Cys had 0.83, 0.80, and 0.70 weights, respectively (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Gini Index. Seven attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Gini Index algorithm. Frequencies of Pro-Leu, Lys, Pro-Asn, Gly-His, counts of Lys-Phe, Gln-Tyr, and Aliphatic index, were weighted 1.00, 1.00, 0.96, 0.96, 0.96, 0.70, and 0.83, respectively (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Chi Squared. Six attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Chi Squared algorithm. Frequencies of Pro-Leu, Pro-Asn, Gly-His, counts of Lys-Phe, Asp-Val, and Aliphatic index had 1.00, 0.80, 0.79, 0.78, 0.78, and 1.00 weights, respectively (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Deviation. Just one attribute was weighted higher than 0.70 by Deviation algorithm. Non-reduced Cys Extinction coefficient at 280nm was the most important attribute with weight equal to 1.00 according to this algorithm (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Rule. Seven attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Chi Squared algorithm. Frequencies of Pro-Leu, Pro-Asn, Gly-His, Lys, counts of Lys-Phe, Asp-Val, and Aliphatic index were weighted 1.00, 0.80, 0.80, 0.80, 0.80, 0.80, and 1.00, respectively (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Info Gain Ratio. Twenty eight attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Info Gain Ratio. Frequencies of Pro-Asn, Gly-His, Pro-Leu, counts of Lys-Phe, Gln-Tyr, and Aliphatic index had 1.00, 1.00, 0.91, 1.00, 0.85, 0.73% weights, respectively. Frequencies of His-Arg, Ser, Pro-His, Pro-Ala, Tyr, Pro-Lys, Arg, counts of Gln-Gln, Val-Phe, Met-Cys, Gly-His, His-Arg, Gly-Val, Phe-Ala, Phe-Lys, Asp-Asn, Gly-Tyr, Leu-Cys, Met-Phe, Lys-Ile, Arg, and Tyr were the attributes with weights equal to 0.71 (Table 2).


                        Weighting by Info Gain. Nine attributes were weighted higher than 0.70 by Info Gain. Frequencies of Pro-Leu, Lys, Pro-Asn, Gly-His, Leu, counts of Lys-Phe, Lys-Lys, His, and Aliphatic index had 1.00, 1.00, 0.85, 0.85, 0.72, 0.85, 0.72, 0.72, and 0.88, weights, respectively (Table 2).

Based on the overall intersection of attribute weighting models (Table 2), six protein attributes were announced as the key distinguishing features in structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase including Aliphatic index, Freq of Lys, Count of Lys-Phe, Freq of Gly-His, Freq of Pro-Leu, and Freq of Pro-Asn.

Sixteen different Decision Tree models were applied on the eleven datasets, all of the models resulted in trees with roots and leaves; minimum performance and maximum performance were 82.5% and 100%, respectively (
                        Table 3). Four Decision Tree models were the best ones including Decision Tree models with Info Gain criterion run on FCdb dataset, Random Forest models with Gini Index criterion run on Deviation and Uncertainty datasets, Random Forest model with Info Gain run on PCA dataset, and Random Forest models with accuracy criterion run on Info Gain and FCdb datasets. The simplest trees were produced by the Random Forest model with Accuracy and Gini Index criteria run on Info Gain and Uncertainty datasets, respectively.


                        
                        Fig. 1 compares architecture of different Decision Tree models in separating high from low ALA content based on structural protein attributes of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. In Random Forest models with accuracy criterion run on Info Gain dataset, If the frequency of Lys-Lys was greater than 0.008, the protein belonged to the high ALA content class; if not, the protein belonged to the low ALA content class and performance was 100% (Fig. 1). In Random Forest models with Gini Index criterion run on Uncertainty dataset, If the frequency of Gly-His was greater than 0.01, the protein belonged to the low ALA content class; otherwise, the protein belonged to the low ALA content class and the performance of this prediction was 97.5%. Random Forest model with Gini Index criterion run on Deviation, Random Forest models with accuracy criterion run on FCdb dataset, and Decision Tree model with Info Gain criterion run on FCdb dataset induced a two-level tree and their performances were 97.5%, 87.5%, and 87.5%, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The length was the sole feature to build the tree by Random Forest model with Gini Index criterion on Deviation dataset. In particular, when the value for this feature was equal to or lower than 0.388, the proteins fell into the low ALA content class, but when the value was higher than 0.388 and equal to or lower than 0.398 the proteins fell into the high ALA content class; otherwise the protein was assigned to the low ALA content class. This shows the importance of higher protein length as a distinguishing attribute separating omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in plants with high ALA from low ones (Fig. 1). In agreement with the mentioned model, in Random Forest model with Info Gain criterion run on PCA, length was the sole important feature used to build decision trees. The performance of this model was 97.5% (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

In Decision Tree model with Parallel Gain Ratio criterion run on FCd dataset, the count of Gln-Tyr was the most important feature to build the tree. When the value for this feature was equal to 1.0, the proteins fell into the high ALA content class. When the value was equal to 0.0 and the count of Arg was equal to or lower than 13.50, the proteins fell into the high ALA content class; otherwise the protein was assigned to the low ALA content class.

In Random Forest model with accuracy criterion run on FCdb dataset, the count of Asp-Arg was the most important feature to build the tree; when the value of this feature was equal to 1.0, the protein fell into the low ALA content class. In contrast, when the value of this dipeptide (Asp-Arg) in omega-3 fatty acid desaturase was equal to 1.0, the protein was assigned to the high ALA content class (Fig. 1).

In agreement with outcomes of attribute weighting algorithms, Baysian T-test confirmed that differences between the frequencies of Pro-Asn, Gly-His, Pro-Leu, Lys, count of Lys-Phe, and Aliphatic index in structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase are highly significant (P<0.05) (
                           Table 4). These features were also the most significant features defined by various attribute weighting algorithms (Table 2). As it can be inferred from Table 4, protein architecture of high ALA containing plants in plants with high ALA content has significantly higher Lys, higher Lys-Phe, higher Pro-Asn, but lower Aliphatic index, lower Gly-His, and lower Pro-Leu (Table 4).


                           Mean and Variance. Hotelling’s T-squared test was used to test differences in mean vectors of six variables obtained by weighting algorithms, between high and low ALA contents. Results highlighted that at the 1% level, a significant difference exists between mean of six attributes in protein structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase between plants with high and low ALA contents.

Comparisons of variability differences for six important variable (derived from attribute weighting models), between two given groups of high and low ALA was carried out by van Valen test [46]. This analysis showed the equality of variances between two groups.


                           Discriminant function. Discriminant analysis can be used to investigate how variables contribute to group separation to develop the functions (combinations) of variables that can discriminate two groups of plants with high and low ALA contents. This provides a valuable model and a reliable platform for ALA content prediction based on sequence features as the combination of attribute weighting and predictive model is employed here. Discriminant analysis indicated that the rate of correct prediction for the two groups based on amino acid features was 75%. We developed Discriminant Functions (Linear Discriminant Function for Groups) to predict/separate ALA content based on features involved in protein structure of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase as follows:

Key discovered amino acid features successfully distinguished (clustered) omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in plants with high ALA content (perilla and flax; accessions) from the plants with low ALA content.

A software, Plant omega3 (α-linolenic acid) predictor, was developed using java programming language to predict the high and the low content of ALA based on structural of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (Supplementary 2). This software offers the flexibility to users to either submit the Fasta sequence of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase enzyme or import the key structural protein features (including Frequency of Lys, Count of Lys-Phe, Frequency of Pro-Asn, Aliphatic index, Frequency of Gly-His, and Frequency of Pro-Leu) (Supplementary 3). Using the 6 key structural protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase, the software predicts the α-linolenic acid content based on the obtained discriminant functions formula in this study (Supplementary 3) with the average of 75% accuracy.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

One of the most common nutritional problems in the world is omega-3 fatty acid deficiency. Because of fish supply reduction and industrial-based decrease of omega-3 fatty acids in oil crops, developing non-oilseed plants containing high omega-3 through traditional plant breeding or molecular biological strategies is of great demand [8]. Despite the economic importance ALA, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying ALA content variation. Here, for the first time, we applied various models to determine the most important features that contribute to function of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in plants using data mining and multivariate algorithms. 
                     Fig. 3 summarizes the hypothesis, the approach and outcomes of this study in both structural protein features and amino acid levels.

Protein function is under the control of its structural amino acid characteristics. Consequently, the study of a large number of amino acid features provides a broad view on the underlying architecture of a specific protein function [15,16,18–20,43,47]. Here, applied attribute weighting models determined the frequency of Pro-Asn, frequency of Gly-His, frequency of Pro-Leu, count of Lys-Phe, Aliphatic index, frequency of Lys as the most significant distinguishing protein features in structural architecture of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. This paper is the first report considering the effects of amino acid dipeptides of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase on ALA content. The findings of this research have potential to be used as the basis for future studies on engineering superior and generation of more powerful omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in future studies. The developed software in this study, Plant omega3 (α-linolenic acid) predictor, provides the opportunity of predicting the outcome of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase mutations based on structural protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. Using this software, each molecular biologist can estimate the influence of mutation in the structure of enzyme before commencing expensive lab activities like site-direct mutagenesis. Regarding the low success rate of mutagenesis (1%), this software can save hundreds hours of work and considerable expenses.

The high efficiency and applicability of attribute weighting algorithms and Decision Tree models in determining the protein attributes contributing to thermostability [48], halo-stability [20], heavy metal protein pumps [18], and lipid-binding proteins [16] have been discussed before. Here for the first time, various Tree Induction models were applied to determine the most efficient and precise model. The best performance was obtained when Random Forest models with accuracy criterion ran on Info Gain dataset. Also, In Random Forest models with Gini Index criterion run on Uncertainty, the frequency of Gly-His was the sole protein attribute to build up this tree. This attribute was is also one of the selected most important attributes by different weighting algorithms. Univariate statistical results showed that higher Aliphatic index, frequency of Lys, count of Lys-Phe are belonged to plants with lower ALA content.

The most striking result to emerge from this survey is that the discriminant function model is able to accurately distinguish ALA content in various plants based on the key structural amino acid composition of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase determined by attribute weighting algorithms. Attribute weighting models can contribute to modeling by generating a more manageable set of attributes [15,19]. Discriminant analysis determined that variables obtained by feature selection (including frequencies of Pro-Asn, Gly-His, Pro-Leu, Lys, count of Lys-Phe, and Aliphatic index) are the best predictors of the function of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. This study provides the opportunity to engineer enzyme in amino acid level and predict ALA content from the amino acid composition properties. This report is the first work which joins the results of attribute weighting algorithms with discriminant function algorithms for the accurate prediction and can be suggested to the researchers in different fields.

Unsupervised clustering methods are preferred for prediction because there is no need to target variable to classify observations into groups. Unsupervised clustering algorithms have been extensively used in different fields of biological science. Here, we applied the Single Linkage method on the dataset filtered using feature selection weighting algorithms. The results showed that the single Linkage method was able to classify thirty nine omega-3 fatty acid desaturase in different plants to the correct classes. This is a significant finding demonstrating that the outcomes of attribute weighting algorithms (including Aliphatic index, Frequency of Lys, Count of Lys-Phe, Frequency of Gly-His, Frequency of Pro-Leu, Frequency of Pro-Asn) have the potential to predict and model the behavior of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.

In total, recent developments in computational biology and bioinformatics have provided the opportunity to calculate a large number of protein attributes just based on the original sequence to illustrate different aspects of protein function. Also, recent development in machine learning models such as attribute weighting and Decision Tree algorithms have provided the chance of finding important attributes and predicting/modeling of protein function based on the computationally calculated features. In fact, application of attribute weighting and machine learning algorithms have opened a new vista in understanding the molecular mechanism of protein function. The mentioned approach has been successfully implemented in unraveling important structural attributes and prediction of protein thermostability, salinity, protein function as well as marker selection and classification [15,17,18,20,44,49]. In conclusion, we suggest a new strategy where attribute weighting algorithms can trim a large number of attributes and enhances the accuracy of further modeling and clustering algorithms. These findings document that structural amino acid composition can efficiently be applied for the accurate determination of ALA content in various plants. Finally, this study brings new ideas to increase the ALA content in different plants.
