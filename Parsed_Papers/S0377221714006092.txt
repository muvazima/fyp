                  This paper focuses on the impact of consumer environmental awareness (CEA) on order quantities and channel coordination within a one-manufacturer and one-retailer supply chain. The manufacturer produces two types of products: the environmental and the traditional products. These two products differ in their price and environmental quality. Based on the multi-product newsvendor model, this study compares three decision scenarios: the centralized model (M1), the decentralized model (M2), and the decentralized model with the coordination of a return contract (M3). The closed-form expressions of optimal order quantities, wholesale prices and return credits are derived for each scenario. Extending these models, we incorporate a production capacity constraint of the manufacturer. Finally, sensitivity analyses on model parameters are performed and numerical examples are provided.
                  Our study suggests (1) the retailer’s profit monotonically increases while the manufacturer’s profit is convex with respect to CEA; (2) a return contract can help both parties to achieve the profit they could expect in the centralized model; (3) order quantity of the environmental product increases with CEA; (4) the production capacity constraint of the manufacturer does not impact order quantities of the two products if it is sufficiently large (when it is larger than two critical points); otherwise, production capacity constraint negatively changes the channel profit and order quantities; (5) our simulation study and sensitivity analyses indicate that the difference of environmental quality between the traditional and the environmental products determines whether order quantity of the traditional product increases or remains constant with respect to CEA. The firms will benefit from product customization and consumer segmentation based on the distribution of CEA in the market.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The rise of environmental awareness changes consumer behavior. The BBMG Conscious Consumer Report shows that 51% of Americans are willing to pay more for products with high environmental quality and 67% agree it is important to buy products with environmental benefits (Bemporad & Baranowski, 2007). OECD (2002a) points out that 27% of consumers in OECD countries can be labeled “green consumers” due to their strong willingness-to-pay for environmental products and strong environmental activism. A study carried out by European Commission in 2008 shows that 75% of Europeans are ‘ready to buy environmentally friendly products even if they cost a little bit more compared to 31% in 2005 (European Commission, 2008).

Considering the impact of consumer environmental awareness (CEA), researchers started to introduce environmental quality as a demand enhancement factor in the product demand function (Liu, Anderson, & Cruz, 2012). Often the traditional and the environmental products are considered to be substitutable (Brécard, 2013; Conrad, 2005; Liu et al., 2012; Reinhardt, 1998; Rodriguez-Ibeas, 2007). The environmental product provides greater environmental benefits (or imposes smaller environmental costs) than the traditional product but has a higher price. This is known as environmental product differentiation (Reinhardt, 1998). Hybrid vehicles may be considered as an example of the environmental product. Such vehicles contribute to reducing carbon dioxide by approximately 3.5milliontons as of April 2007, but they are more expensive than traditional vehicles with similar functionalities (Yakita, 2009).

Given the important role of CEA (Bemporad & Baranowski, 2007; Mawson, 2007; OECD, 2002b), most studies in this area have been focused on product design and market competitiveness, and government environmental policies. Studies regarding its effects on supply chain management still remain sparse to our knowledge. We consider a one-manufacturer and one-retailer supply chain following the previous modeling approaches (e.g. Chen & Xiao, 2011; Lee & Rhee, 2007; Pasternack, 1985; Taylor, 2001). The manufacturer produces two types of products: the traditional and environmental (or green) products. We assume environmental quality of the products is given. One retailer sells the two substitutable products. Automobile dealership management may be considered as such an example. An automobile manufacturer (say, Ford) produces hybrid vehicles (i.e., an environmentally friendly product) and traditional gasoline vehicles (i.e., a traditional product that is less environmentally friendly). In each region (which may be defined based on the geographical distance), there is usually one and only one dealership for the manufacturer that sells both products.
                        1
                        Our results will remain the same even if there are two dealerships for the manufacture in a region but they sell different type of products (one for the environmental product, and one for the traditional product).
                     
                     
                        1
                      The automobile manufacturer and the dealership constitute one manufacturer and one retailer supply chain in a region.

We assume that the demand function of a product is the common knowledge of both parties. The retailer needs to determine order quantity and the manufacturer needs to decide wholesale price (and return credit in the case of introducing a return contract) for each product to maximize their profits. We investigate the following questions:
                        
                           1.
                           How CEA impacts both parties’ profits and the retailer’s order quantities for the traditional and the environmental products, respectively?

Whether a return policy can effectively coordinate the manufacturer and the retailer?

Will production capacity of the manufacturer change the results?

Based on the multi-product newsvendor model, our study compares three decision scenarios: the centralized model (M1), the decentralized model (M2), and the decentralized model with the coordination of a return contract (M3). We derive the closed-form expressions of optimal order quantities, wholesale prices, and return credits. Extending these models, we further incorporate a production capacity constraint of the manufacturer. Finally, sensitivity analyses on model parameters are performed and numerical examples are provided.

This study contributes to the literature by investigating how CEA impacts supply chain management. We show that a return contract can effectively coordinate the manufacturer and the retailer to achieve the profit that they can expect in the centralized model. Order quantity of the environmental product increases with CEA. The retailer’s profit monotonically increases while the manufacturer’s profit is convex with respect to CEA. The production capacity of the manufacturer does not impact order quantities of the two products if it is sufficiently large. Otherwise, order quantities and profits decrease with the production capacity. Further, based on our simulation and sensitivity analyses, if environmental quality of the traditional product is sufficiently smaller than that of the environmental product, order quantity of the traditional product will remain constant with CEA. Otherwise it will increases with CEA. Both parties will benefit from product customization and consumer segmentation based on the distribution of CEA in the market.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of relevant literature. Section 3 presents the basic assumptions and definitions. Section 4 first analyzes the centralized and the decentralized model. Then it discusses the channel coordination with a return contract. Section 5 extends the models with a production capacity constraint. Section 6 describes sensitivity analyses and numerical examples. Section 7 summarizes our main findings and concludes the paper by providing some directions for future research. All proofs are relegated to Appendix A.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our work is closely related to the growing focus on CEA in operations management. There are two main streams of literature on CEA. The first stream focuses on how firms improve environmental quality of their products to increase their competitiveness and capture additional market share. The common methods to improve product environmental quality include increasing technology investment (e.g. clean-up level, emission level), improving social responsibility, introducing eco-labeling and so on. For example, Amacher, Koskela, and Ollikainen (2004) showed that incentives for firms to invest in green technologies depend on their relative cost structure. Chung and Wee (2008) explored how green product design new technology and remanufacturing affect the production inventory policy. Su, Wang, and Ho (2012) suggested how the two technologies, Zero-Sum and Synergy, impact the market structure strategy for environmental products. In two-echelon supply chain, Ni, Li, and Tang (2010) addressed how to allocate corporate social responsibility between a supplier and a retailer under wholesale price contracts. Liu et al. (2012) investigated the impact among the supply chain players considering consumers’ environmental awareness and manufacturer competition.

The second stream focuses on how the government set environmental policies (e.g. environmental standard, subsidy and tax policy) by encouraging the manufacturers to improve environmental quality of their products. For example, Chen (2001) showed that stricter environmental standards might not necessarily benefit the environment. Gonzalez and Fumero (2002) demonstrated how frequently-used environmental policies influences the social welfare. Tian (2003) presented how a regulatory increase in the minimum required level of environmental friendliness of imported good impacts home firm and consumer gain. Bansal and Gangopadhyay (2003) investigated how subsidy policies and tax policies influence total pollution and aggregate welfare in the presence of environmentally aware consumers. Lombardini-Riipinen (2005) studied how governments set the socially optimal emission and commodity tax policies when consumers are willing to pay a price-premium for green variants of a product. Yakita and Yamauchi (2011) explored the welfare effects of environmental R&D strategies of firms. Zhang, Xu, and He (2012) examined how subsidy policies affect firms’ design strategies of environmental products.

Most studies on CEA have primarily focused on product design and market competitiveness, and government environmental policy. In this paper, we focus on how CEA impacts supply chain management and coordination, a topic on which studies remain sparse to our knowledge.

We consider two substitutable products: the environmental (or green) and the traditional products, namely, products 1 and 2. We assume that each product have two attributes, price (denoted as p) and environmental quality (denoted as e), influencing consumer demand. Both price and environmental quality of the environmental product are greater than those of the traditional product (i.e. p
                     1
                     >
                     p
                     2,
                     e
                     1
                     >
                     e
                     2). Product demand increases with environmental quality, and decreases with price.

We consider that the demand functions for products 1 and 2, denoted by D
                     1 and D
                     2, possess the following structure:

                      is the sensitivity of switchovers toward environmental quality difference. Following Liu et al. (2012), we assume θ
                     
                        e
                     
                     =
                     θτ where τ represents CEA. As suggested in prior studies, CEA affects consumer willingness-to-pay of eco-friendly products (Chitra, 2007). And it can vary greatly across industries and consumer groups and change over time (Carlson, 2005; Laroche, Bergeron, & Barbaro-Forleo, 2001). Therefore, we assume τ to be a random variable following a uniform distribution in the range of [c,
                     d], 0⩽
                     c
                     <
                     d. To simplify our analyses and presentation, we assume c
                     =0 in the remainder of this paper, then the expected value of τ, E(τ)=
                     d/2. This assumption (i.e., c
                     =0) will not change our analysis results, and the comparative statics results with respect to d are equivalent with the average environmental awareness d/2.

The demand model is inspired by Boyaci and Ray (2003), Liu et al. (2012), and Tsay and Agrawal (2000). It is a linear stochastic model with substitution: (i) the expected demand of a product decreases with its price, and increases with its environmental quality, (ii) price of one product increases and environmental quality of one product decreases the demand of the other product. Please note that the total demand of the two products does not depend on this substitutability. Adding D
                     1 and D
                     2, we have the total demand D
                     =2a
                     −
                     p
                     1
                     −
                     p
                     2
                     +
                     τe
                     1
                     +
                     τe
                     2. All else being equal, the change of θ and θ
                     
                        e
                      will not alter the total demand D for the two products. Thus, the switching of the customers between the two products is governed by the differences of price and environmental quality between the two products; that is, the substitution is based on price and environmental quality.

                      summarizes the major notations in our following model development.

We assume that the products have one sale season, and the leftovers are cleared out with a salvage value v at the end of the sale season. In this section we first present the centralized model as a benchmark, and then discuss the decentralized model with and without a return contract to coordinate the supply chain.

As a benchmark to evaluate channel coordination contract, we first model the centralized case (also termed as integrated channel). In this model, a central planner (the manufacturer, the retailer, or a third party) wishes to seek optimal production quantities y
                        1 and y
                        2 for product 1 and 2 to maximize the expected total profit of the manufacturer and the retailer. The profit function of a centralized model is:

                              Assumption 1 essentially assumes that the demand switched over from the traditional product to the environmental product due to the difference of their environmental quality should be less than the demand for the traditional product that is stimulated by its environmental quality and CEA at the first place. This assumption is also needed for the analyses of the subsequent models. We discuss the scenario when this assumption is violated using numerical examples in Section 6.3.


                              In the centralized model, the optimal production quantities of the two products are:

                        Proposition 3 presents the change of order quantities and channel profit with environmental quality of the two-product. g
                        1 and g
                        2 define the boundary conditions influenced by three exogenous variables of the two products: price, cost, and salvage value. In response to the improvement of environmental quality of the two products, g
                        1
                        <0 indicates the region where the traditional product is more profitable for the channel, and g
                        2
                        <0 indicates the region where the environmental product is more profitable.

In this model, the manufacturer firstly determines wholesale prices to maximize his own profit based on the demand information. After the retailer knows wholesale prices, he makes a decision on order quantities to maximize his own profit. We further assume that both of them possess complete information regarding the demand.

We apply the backward method to solve the Stackelberg game problem. First, we solve the retailer’s expected profit function under the condition that the manufacturer’s decision is given. Then we solve the optimal response function of the manufacturer after the solution to the retailer’s expected profit function is derived. To solve the problem, we need one general assumption.
                           Assumption 2
                           The retailer’s cost parameters satisfy that p
                              
                                 i

                              w
                              
                                 i
                              
                              >
                              c

                              , i
                              =1, 2. In another words, the retail price of a product is assumed to be greater than its wholesale price, and its wholesale price greater than its production cost.

The retailer’s problem is described as follows: when wholesale prices (w
                              1,
                              w
                              2) are given by the manufacturer, the retailer is to determine order quantities (y

                              y
                              2) to maximize his own profit function. So the problem is formulated as follows, which is similar to M1’s expected profit function,

                        Theorems 2 and 3 present that the decentralized model cannot achieve the same levels of order quantities and channel profit as the centralized model due to the double marginalization (i.e. w

In next section our interest is to design a coordination policy (using a return contract) to induce the retailer to order the optimal order quantities of the centralized model and consequently achieve the optimal channel profit.

                        Propositions 6 and 7 suggest how CEA affects the retailer’s order quantities and both parties’ profits. Proposition 7 suggests that the manufacturer will not benefit from the improvement of CEA before CEA reaches a certain level; however, the retailer will always benefit from the improvement of CEA. The propositions indicate that the retailer is the puller of the supply chain in developing the market of eco-friendly products.

From the perspective of supply chain management, decentralization results in double marginalization. In this section, we will investigate how to coordinate the supply chain with a return contract and analyze whether a return contract guarantees a ‘win–win’ situation. A ‘win–win’ situation is defined as a situation where both parties are better off because of a coordination mechanism (Chen & Xiao, 2011). The existence of a ‘win–win’ situation is crucially important for the implementation of a coordination mechanism because it guarantees an incentive for each player to accept the channel policy.

With a return contract the retailer an return all the unsold products to manufacturer with partial credits, following Pasternack (1985). Different from Pasternack (1985), in this paper we consider two substitutable products. Let (r
                        1,
                        r
                        2) denote return credits of the two products given by manufacturer for each unit returned. We hold the following general assumption.
                           Assumption 3
                           The unit credit given by the manufacturer to the retailer for each unit returned satisfies that v
                              
                                 i
                              
                              <
                              r
                              
                                 i
                              
                              <
                              w
                              
                                 i
                              , i
                              =1, 2. In other words, the salvage value of a product is less than its return credit, and its return credit is less than its whole price.


                              Assumption 3 guarantees that the return contract is efficient and the retailer has the motivation to sell the product other than to wait to return it to the manufacturer.

The return contract eliminates double marginalization, and the decentralized model can achieve the same level of channel profit as that in the centralized model. The optimal order quantities in the decentralized model with a return contract are equal to that of the centralized model (i.e.

Similar to Pasternack (1985), Proposition 8 suggests how wholesale price, the manufacturer’s profit, and the retailer’s profit change with return credit. The manufacturer’s profit increases with return credit as wholesale price increases with return credit. Because of the increased wholesale price, the retailer will not benefit from the increase of return credit.

                        Theorem 6 shows that both the manufacturer’s profit and the retailer’s profit increase with the return contract in the decentralized model, i.e. the return contract can guarantee win–win. Therefore, the manufacturer and the retailer are willing to accept the channel policy.

In this section, we extend our basic model to the case in which the total order quantity y
                     1
                     +
                     y
                     2 is limited by K, the percentage of environmental product is μ, and the percentage of traditional product is 1−
                     μ. K can be interpreted as the manufacturer’s production capacity or the retailer’s inventory capacity, and μ is the allocation of the different products. Given the capacity constraint, it may not be feasible for the retailer to order according to the demand function for each product. As such, the retailer needs to take the capacity constraint into consideration when deciding order quantity for each product. We assume that μK
                     ⩾
                     u
                     1, (1−
                     μ)K
                     ⩾
                     u
                     2 to ensure that the deterministic demand can be satisfied.

The central planner’s problem with a capacity constraint is described as follows:

                        1,
                        K
                        2), the optimal order quantity reduces to the capacity constraint point (μK or (1−
                        μ)K), and the channel profit decreases.

In this section, we present the manufacturer’s and retailer’s optimal decisions in the decentralized model when there is a capacity constraint. Similar to Proposition 10, we give the optimal solutions according to the following Proposition.

                        , wholesale prices are determined by the bargain power between the retailer and manufacturer, and the retailer’s order quantities will not be affected by wholesale price. Therefore the change of each party’s profit is unclear. But the total channel profit is less than the centralized model with a capacity constraint because of the double marginalization and the decentralized model without a capacity constraint.

We can derive the optimal order quantities and the channel profit in the decentralized model with a return contract and a capacity constraint similar to Section 4.3.

                              The decentralized model with a return contract and a capacity constraint can achieve the same optimal order quantities and channel profit as those in the centralized model with a capacity constraint, if the return credits of the two products satisfy the following conditions:

                        Proposition 12 suggests that the return contract can also coordinate the decentralized model with a capacity constraint.

                         represent the optimal wholesale price in the decentralized model without a capacity constraint. And return credits are equal to those in the decentralized model without a capacity constraint. Otherwise, return credits are not equal to the decentralized model without a capacity constraint because of wholesale price changing. Channel profit decreases with a capacity constraint.


                        Table 2
                         summarizes our analysis results presented in Sections 4 and 5.

To better illustrate our theoretical results and explore our assumptions, we present the numerical analyses in this section. We first give some numerical examples to analyze the change of channel performance including optimal profits, order quantities and return credits with respect to CEA and consumer sensitivity of switchovers toward price difference. Then we explore the scenario when the profit function is not concave. Finally, we analyze the relationship between product differentiation and the distribution of CEA using three cases.

For the purpose of our numerical demonstration, we define the unit cost function of product i as

                     =0.5. We consider that the random variable τ is uniformly distributed with the form of U[0,
                     d]. These parameters are consistent with our assumptions and industrial practices. The environmental product provides greater environmental benefits than the traditional product but has a higher cost, price and salvage value (Reinhardt, 1998).


                        Figs. 1 and 2
                        
                         show how the upper bound of CEA (or average CEA d/2) d impacts channel performance. We assume d
                        ∈[15,30] to satisfy v

                        , i
                        =1, 2. The optimal order quantity and channel profit in M1 are the same as M3, thus we present the following results with M2 and M3.


                        Fig. 1 shows that wholesale prices and return credits of the traditional and the environmental products decrease with d. The optimal order quantities of the traditional and the environmental products increase in M2 and M3. The environmental product’s order quantity increases more apparently than the traditional product with a return contract. These results are in accordance with Propositions 2 and 6 and Theorem 5.


                        Fig. 2 shows that the manufacturer obtains more profit than the retailer in M2 and M3 (or M1). And the manufacturer’s profit and the retailer’s profit in M3 (or M1) are larger than those in M2. In other words, coordinating the supply chain with a return contract is a ‘win–win’ solution. Through Propositions 7(1) and 9(1), we can obtain that d
                        1
                        =5.07, d
                        2
                        =10.85, so both the manufacturer’s and retailer’s profit increase in M2 and M3 when the CEA increases, which is in accordance with Propositions 7 and 9.

                         present the impact of consumer’s sensitivity of switchovers toward price difference θ on channel performance. We assume d
                        =20, θ
                        ∈[0,1] in order to satisfy v

                        Fig. 3 shows that wholesale price and return credit of the environmental product decrease, while wholesale price and return credit of the traditional product increase, with θ. Order quantity of the environmental product increases, while that of the traditional product decreases with θ in M2 and M3 (or M1). And order quantity of the environmental product is always larger than the traditional product in M2 and M3 (or M1).


                        Fig. 4 indicates that the manufacturer’s profit and the retailer’s profit in M3 (which has a return contract) are larger than in M2. The retailer’s profits in M2 and M3 decrease with θ, while the manufacturer’s profits first go down then go up in M2 and M3. And the total channel profit in M2 and M3 decreases with θ from the results of the calculation. Therefore, it may be a good strategy for the manufacturer to produce two products with small substitutability to avoid cannibalization.

In Fig. 6
                              , we find that order quantity of the traditional product remains constant, when (1+

                               shows that the channel profit increases with CEA. The results suggest that the impact of CEA on order quantities may be contingent on the difference of environmental quality between the two products. Thus, it is meaningful to study how the two-product’s environmental qualities affect order quantities and channel profit as d changes.

In this subsection, we examine how the two-product’s environmental qualities affect order quantities and channel profit considering the distribution of CEA. With the centralized model, we assume that the sum of two-product’s environmental quality is constant, and explore the change of optimal solutions with different combinations of environmental quality of the two products. In this example, parameters are set as follows similar to Section 6.1.

In case 3, the manufacturer produces only one type of products with certain environmental quality. In case 2, the manufacturer provides two similar products.

Similar to Fig. 6, when the difference of the two-product’s environmental qualities is sufficiently large (case 1), order quantity of the environmental product increases with CEA, but order quantity of traditional product keeps a constant with CEA (see Fig. 8
                              ). Figs. 9 and 10
                              
                               show that order quantities increase with CEA in case 2 and case 3 which are in accordance with Proposition 6.

In other words, when d exceeds a certain threshold (or the range of CEA is sufficient large), case 1 and case 2 (producing two types of products) are better than case 3 (producing one product) for the firm. With the increase of d (or the range of CEA becomes larger), the firm will benefit more by providing two types of products that have larger difference in their environmental quality.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

This study examines how to effectively coordinate the manufacture and the retailer considering the impact of consumer environmental awareness within a one-manufacturer one-retailer supply chain, where two types of substitutable products: the environmental and the traditional products were considered. Consumers and businesses are increasingly making an effort to ‘be eco-friendly’, and the market for eco-friendly products is growing (Brécard, Hlaimi, Lucas, Perraudeau, & Salladarré, 2009). How to proactively increase their market competitiveness riding this trend is a challenge faced by a lot of firms. Our study points out some important managerial insights regarding how to effectively coordinate the manufacture and the retailer.

Our study has four main managerial implications. First, Propositions 7 and 9 show that retailer’s profit monotonically increases while the manufacturer’s profit is convex with respect to CEA. Therefore, the retailer is the puller of the supply chain in developing the market for eco-friendly products. The retailer could make more marketing effort (e.g. consumer education, and product marketing and advertising) to outreach consumers and improve their CEA. This will provide the entire supply chain with higher value-adding opportunities and benefit both the retailers and the eco-friendly manufacturers. Because the manufacture will not have much incentive at the initial phase of green product market when consumer environmental awareness is not sufficient high, policy-makers could subsidy the manufacturer.

Second, the manufacturer could adopt the partial return credit contract for all unsold products to coordinate the supply chain with two substitutable products from Theorem 5. A return contract provides a win–win solution for the manufacturer and the retailer. However, the retailer will not benefit from a high return credit because a high return credit is corresponding to a high wholesale price. The manufacturer will obtain more profit from a high return credit.

Third, Proposition 11 shows that the capacity constraint is no biding when the capacity limit is sufficiently large. When the capacity limit is less than the threshold points, the bargaining power will affect both parties’ profits. If the retailer is the follower in the supply chain, he should balance the bargain loss and the over capacity waste. If the retailer has a great bargaining power, the manufacturer will still sell the products with the same wholesale prices as no capacity constraint; or else, the retailer will incur profit losses due to the increase of wholesale prices. And a return contract can still effectively coordinate the channel with a capacity constraint.

Finally, CEA affects order quantities of both the environmental and the traditional products. The impact of CEA on order quantities of the traditional product is contingent on the difference of environmental quality between the two products. The manufacturer and the retailer could produce and sell products with differential environmental quality adapting to the distribution of CEA in the market. With the increase of the range of CEA, the manufacture and the retailer could introduce two types of products with differential environmental quality to maximize their profit. The larger the range of environmental awareness, the bigger the difference of environmental qualities between the two products.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

While our model has certain limitations, it presents opportunities for future research. First, our model is based on the assumption that CEA is a uniform distribution. In our future research, we shall consider normal distribution or other distributions. Second, one may consider developing a multi-retailer model with stochastic demand in which each retailer competes for higher profitability. Third, the thresholds of the upper bound of CEA (

We could further explore when two or more types of products should be introduced to the market to improve profit. Fourth, it is also interesting to study the effect of cooperative advertising on CEA and supply chain management.
