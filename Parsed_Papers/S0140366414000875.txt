                  Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are constrained by limited battery energy that powers the sensor nodes, which impedes the large-scale deployment of WSNs. Wireless power transfer technology provides a promising way to solve this problem. With such novel technology, recent works propose to use a single mobile charger (MC) traveling through the network fields to replenish energy to every sensor node so that none of the nodes will run out of energy. These algorithms work well in small-scale networks. In large-scale networks, these algorithms, however, do not work efficiently, especially when the amount of energy the MC can provide is limited. To address this issue, multiple MCs can be used. In this paper, we investigate the minimum MCs problem (MinMCP) for two-dimensional (2D) wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), i.e., how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs and design their recharging routes in a 2D WRSN such that each sensor node in the network maintains continuous work, assuming that the energy consumption rate for all sensor nodes are identical. By reduction from the Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), we prove that MinMCP is NP-hard. Then we propose approximation algorithms for this problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used for structural health monitoring, scientific exploration, environmental monitoring, target tracking, etc. As sensor nodes in traditional WSNs are powered by batteries, the limited battery energy is considered as a major deployment barrier for large-scale WSNs. To elongate the lifetime of WSNs, many approaches have been proposed to harvest ambient energy from their surroundings such as solar energy [2], vibration energy [3], and wind energy [4]. However, due to the time-varying nature of renewable energy resources, the success of these methods remains very limited in practice.

The recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology [5], which allow energy to be transferred from one storage device to another via wireless with reasonable efficiency, has provided a promising way to solve this problem. Since wireless recharging can guarantee the continuous power supply and is insensitive to the neighboring environment, it has found many applications including RFIDs [6], sensors [7], cell phones [8], laptops [9], vehicles [10], smart grids [11] and civil structures monitoring [12]. With the novel technology, recent studies [12–18,1] propose to employ a mobile charger (MC) to replenish energy to sensor nodes in wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) [19–21] so that none of them in the network will run out of energy. Typically, the MC periodically traverses every node in the network and stays near every node for a short period to recharge it. Research results demonstrate that this approach works well for small-scale networks. For large-scale wireless sensor networks, a single mobile charger may not be enough. This is because the MC may not carry sufficient energy to recharge every node in a large-scale network on a single tour. Therefore, the MC needs to return to the base station after recharging a part of the network. As a result, single MC recharging algorithms become invalid and continuous working of sensor nodes can no longer be guaranteed.

To recharge a large-scale sensor network, it is necessary to use multiple energy constrained mobile chargers. In this work, we investigate the minimum mobile charger problem for wireless sensor networks. That is, how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs as well as their routes to recharge a given WRSN such that each sensor node in the WRSN can work continuously. In our problem settings, the energy consumption rate for all sensor nodes are identical, which is a practical assumption for many applications as will be elaborated. This problem is highly challenging as we should jointly consider the energy constraints of MCs and the time-sensitive charging requirements of sensor nodes when determining the routes of MCs. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and propose efficient approximation algorithms to solve it. Zhang et al. [22] also employed multiple energy-constrained MCs. However, their work focuses on only one-dimensional (1D) sensor networks, and their goal is to maximize the ratio of the amount of payload energy to the overhead energy. Our solution is designed for two-dimensional (2D) sensor networks, and concentrates on an entirely different problem compared with [22].

The contributions of this work are as follows.

                           We are the first to consider the minimum mobile chargers problem (MinMCP) in general 2D WRSNs, i.e., how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs and their recharging routes given a 2D WRSN, so as to keep the network running forever.

We prove that MinMCP is NP-hard, and propose approximation algorithms to address MinMCP. Particularly, we first consider the relaxed version of MinMCP, which is named MinMCP-R, and propose an approximation algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we present approximation algorithms to MinMCP based on the results obtained for MinMCP-R.

We conduct extensive simulations to verify our analytical findings. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In this section, we review some related works in terms of mobile charging problems where a single or multiple MCs are used.

There has emerged a considerable amount of work studying how to use one single MC to enhance the performances of WRSNs. In terms of data routing performance, Tong et al. [13] investigated the impact of wireless charging technology on data routing and deployment of sensor networks where a single MC is applied. A more practical scheme jointly considering routing and charging was reported in [15]. It aimed to maximize the network lifetime under practical constraints such as dynamic and unreliable communication environment, limited charging capability and heterogeneous node attributes. Other works were interested in the impact of mobile charging on the efficiency of data gathering. Shi et al. [14] employed an MC to periodically travel inside the sensor network to charge sensor nodes, and tried to minimize the aggregate charging time and travel time. By [23,24], a mobile charger was used to serve not only as an energy transporter that charges stationary sensors, but also as a data collector. In addition, Xie et al. [25] studied the problem of co-locating the mobile base station on the wireless charging vehicle to minimize energy consumption of the entire system while guaranteeing that none of the sensor nodes will run out of energy. Still others concentrated on stochastic event capture issues. Dai et al. [18] considered two closely related subproblems of mobile charging for stochastic event capture. One is how to choose the nodes for charging and decide the charging time for each of them, and the other is how to best schedule the nodes’ activation schedules according to their received energy. Their goal is to maximize the overall quality of monitoring.

Besides the above concerns on traditional performances of sensor networks, some literature paid attention to practical issues related to the MC. Fu et al. [26] focused on minimizing the charging delay of the MC, an RFID-reader, by planning its optimal movement and charging strategy. While most existing works on the mobile charging problem mainly concentrated on the optimal offline path planning for the MC, He et al. [27] considered the on-demand mobile charging problem, i.e., how to dynamically plan the path for the MC where the charging requests from sensor nodes come randomly. Li et al. [16] tried to maximize the number of sensor nodes to be charged by using a single MC with limited energy, which is different from the above schemes that assume the employed MC has unbounded energy.

In order to charge a large-scale WRSN, multiple MCs are needed considering their energy constraint. Zhang et al. [22] proposed the only scheme employed multiple energy-constrained MCs to collaboratively charge a linear WSN. MCs are allowed to charge each other. Their goal is to maximize the energy efficiency of charging, which is totally different from ours.

We assume that there is a collection of rechargeable sensor nodes distributed over a 2D region. A base station (BS) serves not only as a data sink, but also as an energy source of the network by periodically dispatching MCs to charge the sensor nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 1

                         to be operational. We assume that the energy consumption rate is constant and uniform for all sensor nodes, and is denoted by

                        . This assumption holds for a number of scenarios. For example, Jiang et al. [28] studied wireless power transmission for sensor nodes buried inside concrete. These sensor nodes collect valuable volumetric data related to the health of a structure, and wirelessly transmit the data to a data collection receiver directly [29]. As their transmitting power is uniform, the energy consumptions of the sensor nodes are identical to each other. In [12]
                        [30], a civil structure is instrumented with sensor nodes capable of being charged wirelessly by a mobile helicopter, which also serves as a data collector. Thus, hop-by-hop data transmissions are no longer needed, and the energy consumptions can be conserved and balanced on sensor nodes. In addition, RFID sensors in Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) [26,31,32] typically consume energy at the same rate, and they can be wirelessly charged by a mobile charger [33].

We take Fig. 2

                         when no MC charges this node during this time period, and the other is 
                           
                              U

                         when an MC is charging this node at a rate of U. Also shown in Fig. 2 is another renewable energy cycle (marked in the dashed sawtooth graph) of sensor node 2, where the battery energy is charged to

                         in non-charging period. Note that the time period of node 1 differs from that of node 2. This is because they are charged by different MCs with different recharge schedules. For more details of the renewable energy cycle, we refer the reader to [14].

Note that, on the contrary, the charging scheme in [22] requires all MCs to have uniform schedule periods, which means that the MCs finishing the charging tasks earlier have to wait at the BS for the returns of other MCs before starting the next trip. Consequently, to compensate the inefficiency of MCs caused by waiting, more MCs are needed compared with our scheme. Besides, we stress that our scheme can be easily extended to the case where uniform schedule periods for MCs are mandatory. In fact, this case is much simpler to handle.

Suppose that each MC is energy-constrained and has an energy capacity of B. Furthermore, denote by

                         the working power of each MC when it stops and charges sensor nodes. For each MC, its movements and charging process share the same pool of battery energy. Clearly, the overall energy an MC spends in traveling and charging should not exceed its battery capacity B. That is,

                        , which means that the power spent in charging sensor nodes for an MC is typically far less than the power consumed in traveling. For example, the working power of the off-shelf product–TX91501 transmitter produced by Powercast is 
                           
                              3
                              
                              W
                           
                        . When a vehicle (serves as an MC) equipped with such a power transmitter stops to charge a sensor node, the working power of the transmitter can be accounted as the unique energy consumption source, which is much less than the vehicle’s traveling power.

But there are exceptions. For instance, the helicopter in [12] which serves as an MC might spend more energy when hovering for charging sensor nodes than that when flying, i.e.,

In this section, we first find that MinMCP is difficult to tackle directly after examining the hardness of MinMCP. Then, we resort to solve its relaxed version MinMCP-R. Finally, we come up with an approximation algorithm for MinMCP based on the solution to MinMCP-R.

First, we review the following NP-complete problem.
                           Definition 2
                           Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) [34]
                           


                           Given a set of vertices in a metric space, a specified depot, and a distance bound D, find a minimum cardinality set of tours originating at the depot that covers all vertices, such that each tour has length at most D.

The following theorem shows the hardness of MinMCP.
                           Theorem 4.1
                           
                              MinMCP is NP-hard.
                           

In general, we prove the NP-hardness of MinMCP by reducing from DVRP.

To begin with, let us consider a special case of MinMCP when

Our roadmap to solve MinMCP is as follows. Due to the difficulty of tackling MinMCP directly, we first consider its relaxed version where the linear constraint 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    f
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              (
                              |
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              |
                              )
                           
                         is removed, which we call MinMCP-R.

For MinMCP-R, we first relax the nonlinear constraint 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    f
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              (
                              |
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              |
                              )
                           
                         into a linear one, and then reduce the problem to DVRP by applying a simple transformation. This approach enables us to propose an approximation algorithm.

Based on the solution to MinMCP-R, we can construct a feasible solution to MinMCP by taking into account the constraint 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    f
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              (
                              |
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              |
                              )
                           
                         again. An approximation algorithm is also provided for this case.

First of all, we define

In general, for each case, Algorithm 1 first applies a proper

                        -Constant Transformation to construct a new metric space, and then employs the algorithm for DVRP on this metric space to obtain the set of tours. Briefly speaking, the algorithm for DVRP proposed in [34] first divides the sensor nodes into several sets according to their distance to the BS. Next, it conducts the algorithm for unrooted DVRP [35] for each sensor node set and thus get a number of paths. Finally, it appends both end points of every path with edges from the BS to form tours.

After obtaining the tours, Algorithm 1 adopts the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm on each tour to refine the results, which repeatedly visits the nearest sensor node until all sensor nodes have been visited. This optimization step distinguishes the algorithm from Algorithm 1 proposed in [1].

One of the outputs of the algorithm is the relaxed constraint of

The pseudo-codes of the algorithm for MinMCP can be found in Algorithm 2. Note that at Step 8 and the final step, we employ the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for TSP to further reduce the length of each obtained tour. This improvement leads to a better performance than that of Algorithm 2 proposed in [1].

In this section, we mainly analyze the performance of the approximation algorithm for MinMCP proposed in Algorithm 2. Generally speaking, we derive the approximation ratio for four different cases, and formally present the theoretical results in the following four theorems.

In spite of its guaranteed approximation ratio, Algorithm 2 is still not quite efficient. Specifically, we find that the consumed energy of each MC is usually noticeably less than its battery capacity B. The root reason is that the DVRP algorithm, upon which our approximation algorithm based, is mainly designed to facilitate the derivation of approximation ratio and, therefore, sacrifices its

We present the details of the enhanced algorithm in Algorithm 3. Basically, this algorithm attempts to minimize the number of MCs by augmenting the input battery capacity as much as possible, while guaranteeing that the maximum consumed energy of each MC is less than the given battery capacity B.

It is easy to see that the output of the enhanced algorithm should be at least as good as that of the original approximation algorithm. We thus have the following theorem.
                           Theorem 4.9
                           
                              Algorithm 3 achieves an approximation ratio no more than that of Algorithm 2.
                           

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, we assumes that the energy consumption rate of each sensor node is constant and uniform. This assumption is, however, still somewhat strict, and not general enough. In this section, we discuss how to extend the proposed algorithms to more general cases where sensor nodes have nonuniform energy consumption rates.

Generally speaking, the nonuniformity of energy consumption rates will result in the change of constraints in MinMCP, and therefore make the problem harder to be tackled. Suppose the energy consumption rate for the sensor node

                      is a constant. The original constraint is thus transformed to the traditional constraint of DVRP.

On the contrary, the first constraint is harder to be treated. This is because 
                        
                           α
                        
                      is not a constant but a variable relating to the energy consumption rates of the nodes contained in the visiting set of sensor nodes

                      of the MC k. In the future work, we will devise new approximation approaches to deal with this problem, as well as the original problem when considering both of the constraints.

In this section, we present simulation results to verify our theoretical findings. We first introduce the evaluation setup, followed by the description of the baseline algorithm. Next, we illustrate an instance of the enhanced MinMCP algorithm, and then evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of the battery capacity

Though the algorithm proposed in [22] is related to our work, it is not appropriate to use it directly for comparison. On the one hand, it is only suitable for 1D sensor networks. On the other hand, it adopts a different assumption, namely, MCs can intentionally gather at a rendezvous point to recharge others or to be recharged without energy loss. This assumption finally leads to a completely different scheme compared with ours. For this reason, we construct the following baseline algorithm by borrowing ideas of [22] for comparison. That is, all the MCs dictated by this algorithm have uniform schedule periods, which means that the MCs that finish the charging tasks earlier have to wait at BS for the returns of other MCs before starting the next trip. The chargers plan their routes in sequence. For each charger, it consistently chooses the nearest sensor node that is not chosen by the former chargers to charge after its departure from the BS. At each step, the charger checks whether its residual energy can sustain its next move to the next node and returning back to the BS. If not, the charger goes back to the BS immediately. The length of the schedule period of each charger is set to be the average length of the schedule periods determined by our algorithm for MinMCP, such that the renewable energy cycle of each sensor node can be guaranteed.

                            for each MC, and sort the IDs of the MCs according to their energy consumption in a descending order. It can be seen that energy consumptions are roughly balanced among MCs, and none of them exceeds the maximum battery capacity, i.e., 
                              
                                 180

                           . Another important observation is that the recharge period

                            is jointly determined by the number of recharged sensor nodes and the travel distance, rather than solely by one of them. In general, the travel distance plays a more important role than the number of recharged nodes in the total energy consumption of MCs. For example, the 5th MC, which has the largest energy consumption, travels the longest distance but only recharges 3 sensor nodes. Besides, throughout the recharge period, none of the energy levels of sensor nodes drops below

                           , which can be confirmed by checking the conditions described in Eq. (3) and Inequality (4).

                            exceeds 2, the outputs of three algorithms become nearly constant. This is because in this case, the battery capacity of each sensor node is large enough to support its normal operation during a charging period and, therefore, the energy capacity of the MC serves as the sole constraint.

Again, the fact that all values of

                           , is consistent with our theoretical results. Another important observation for this figure is that

                            is 1.6 for MinMCP and 1.8 for the enhanced MinMCP algorithm. This can be ascribed to the switch from one of the four cases considered in the MinMCP algorithm to another, together with the fact that different cases have diverse approximation ratios.

In this subsection, we study the impact of energy transfer rate U of an MC on the number of required MCs. Fig. 14
                            shows that when U rises from

                           . The explanation of this phenomenon is straightforward. When the energy transfer rate U arises, the charging energy for each sensor node will be reduced. So does the charging time. As a result, the MCs can spare energy and time to charge more nodes, and its number is thus reduced.

We investigate the influence of

                            on the required number of MCs in this subsection. Intuitively, a larger 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       η

                            means an MC needs more energy to replenish the same amount of energy into the sensor node’s battery, and therefore, calls for more MCs. Fig. 15
                            validates such intuition. Furthermore, it can be seen that the performance gaps between the three algorithms become more and more conspicuous when

                            grows. The performance gains of the enhanced MinMCP algorithm over the other two algorithms achieve

                           .

We are also interested in the impact of the number of sensor nodes. As illustrated in Fig. 16
                           , the required number of MCs for three algorithm increases steadily when the number of sensor nodes scales from 40 to 180. More precisely, the number of MCs is nearly proportional to the number of nodes, which is consistent with our intuition. Moreover, the enhanced MinMCP algorithm and the baseline algorithm need almost the same number of MCs that is roughly 
                              
                                 14.4

                            less than that of the MinMCP algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have studied the problem of minimizing the number of energy-constrained MCs to cover a 2D WSN. We formulate the problem, and show that by applying appropriate transformations, it can be cast into the classical problem–DVRP. We not only prove the NP-hardness of the problem, but also propose approximation algorithms with proven performance bounds. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms as well as the correctness of our theoretical analysis.

In future work, we will try to improve the approximation bounds of the algorithms. Moreover, we will generalize the solution to the case in which sensor nodes have nonuniform energy consumption rates.
