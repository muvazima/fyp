                  Micro-array data are typically characterized by high dimensional features with a small number of samples. Several problems in identifying genes causing diseases from micro-array data can be transformed into the problem of classifying the features extracted from gene expression in micro-array data. However, too many features can cause low prediction accuracy as well as high computational complexity. Dimensional reduction is a method to eliminate irrelevant features to improve the prediction accuracy. Typically, the eigenvalues or dimensional data variance from principal component analysis are used as criteria to select relevant features. This approach is simple but not efficient since it does not concern the degree of data overlap in each dimension in the feature space. A new method to select relevant features based on degree of dimensional data overlap with proper feature selection was introduced. Furthermore, our study concentrated on small sized data sets which usually occur in reality. The experimental results signified that this new approach can achieve substantially higher prediction accuracy when compared with other methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Classification techniques have been used for analysis and interpretation of micro-array gene expression data. The information from the pattern of micro-array gene expression data has provided valuable insights for many biological problems. The main challenge in classifying gene expression data is the curse of dimensionality problem. There are a large number of genes (in biological context) or features (in classification context) compared to small sample sizes [1]. In the aspect of computation, the number of features can be treated as the number of dimensions in the feature space. Mathematically, if the number of dimensions is larger than the number of data, then no unique solution exists and achieving the high prediction accuracy is impossible. To alleviate this curse of dimensionality, some irrelevant features must be eliminated from the prediction or classification process.

Dimension reduction usually consists of two types of methods, i.e. feature selection and feature extraction [2]. Feature selection chooses a subset from original features according to classification performance. Feature selection can be organized into two categories: filter and wrapper methods. The filter method basically uses a criterion relating to rank and selects key genes for classification such as Pearson correlation coefficient method [3,4], t-statistics methods [5,6], signal-to-noise ratio method [7,8]. The wrapper method integrates the feature selection process with the evaluation of the selected features for classification such as forward feature selection [9,10], sequential backward selection [11,12], genetic algorithm [13,14]. Feature extraction projects the whole data into a low dimensional space and constructs the new dimensions (components) by analyzing the statistical relationship hidden in the data set. Many transformation methods have been applied to reduce the dimension of the data such as independent component analysis [15,16], principal component analysis [17,18], wavelet analysis [19,20].

Another popular technique is based on the evolutionary computation or algorithm. Evolutionary algorithm (EA) finds optimal solution in a complex high dimensional space. Dimensional reduction was applied to solve this problem. Genetic Algorithm (GA) [21] generates acceptable solutions by using techniques inspired by natural evolution such as selection, crossover and mutation. A population of chromosomes representing encoded candidate solutions to the optimization problem is evolved toward the better solutions as some examples reported in [22,23]. Rough set theory [24] is another concept used for dimensional reduction in large data. Rough set is a formal approximation of a crisp set similar to fuzzy set [25]. Rough set can be combined with other methods such as GAs and multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) to search for optimal solutions [26,27]. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) [28] based on the behavior of swarm is another popular method for finding an acceptable solution. PSO was adopted to the problem of identifying important gene from gene expression [29,30].

The most widely used dimensional reduction method is principal component analysis (PCA) [31]. PCA [32] rotates the bases of the feature space to the positions so that the data variance of each dimension is minimum. PCA is a popular unsupervised statistical method to find useful eigenassays [33]. One goal of PCA is to find a “better” set of eigenassays, so that the PCA coefficients are uncorrelated on the new basis, which cannot be linearly predicted from each other [34]. However, PCA does not consider the degree of overlap among classes in each dimension. For any dimension, if there is no overlap among classes, then the feature in this dimension can obviously be used as one of the principal features for achieving maximum classification accuracy.

To improve efficiency of PCA for use in feature selection, we proposed a new method called principal feature analysis of minimum distribution overlap with forward feature selection based on Support Vector Machine. The degree of class overlap is measured and used to determine the candidate bases in the feature space. The propose method was tested with four gene expression data sets and compared with the recently proposed methods.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the background and related work. Section 3 discusses the concept of our proposed method. Section 4 explains the data set and experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper with some discussions.

Our proposed method selects each feature based on the degree of overlap between classes and also the result of preliminary classifying process. Recently, Luo [9] adopted the statistical measure similar to t-test with different distance measures, e.g. Euclidean, to improve the feature selection in the original feature space. Zhang [34] proposed a weight measure which can improve the discriminant ability and preserve the local neighborhood structure of the original data. Hence the methods of Luo׳s and Zhang׳s with the concept of support vector machine are briefly summarized in the following section.

Luo [9] proposed two forward feature selection methods named as FFS-ACSA1 and FFS-ACSA2 in dichotomy classification. The target value of each feature vector is in 
                           {
                           +
                           1
                           ,
                           −
                           1
                           }
                        . The concept of this approach is to deploy the regular technique of average ensemble classifiers with a new feature selection. The proposed feature selection of Luo׳s is based on the measure of signal-to-noise ratio of each feature and a cost function defined as follows. Suppose that the considered feature corresponds to dimension i. Let a
                        
                           i
                         be the value of the ith feature:

Zhang [34] proposed an improved supervised orthogonal discriminant projection (SODP). The concept of this approach is based on the nearest neighbor classifier with a manifold learning. The proposed manifold learning of Zhang׳s maximizes the weighted difference between the non-local scattering and the local scattering. Zhang defined the weight

Support Vector Machine (SVM) [35, 36] has been very popular in solving dichotomy classification problems. It mapped the data in feature space onto a higher dimensional feature space by a set of kernel functions so that the data are absolutely separable. The values of targets are in 
                           {
                           +

                           }
                        . The data are separated by a hyperplane and the class of each datum is determined by this condition. Let

                         in between −1 and +1 is indeterminate. The most commonly used kernel function is inner product of two feature vectors.

Forward feature selection method selects one feature at a time which gives the best prediction accuracy in combination with the previously selected features. In our method this selection is implemented with SVM as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              Add one feature with the previously selected features to form a new set of candidate features.

Use the candidate set of feature with SVM in training process.

Measure prediction accuracy from testing samples.

Choose the added feature which gives the highest prediction accuracy.

The work of Luo׳s [9] suggested an interesting t-test observation. However, each feature vector 
                        
                           
                              x
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                      is still in its original feature space. No natural data distribution in the feature space is seriously considered and involved during feature selection process. This may lead to the wrong selection of each feature since global relationships between all feature pairs are ignored. We introduced a new approach by taking the natural data distribution into account. The actual bases of the feature space must be defined by the direction of data distribution in every dimension. Those bases whose degree of data overlap of classes is minimum must be used as the relevant features and the other bases must be excluded as irrelevant features. There are two major parts in our proposed method. The first part is to identify the direction of data distribution in each dimension. The second part is to measure the degree of class overlap in each dimension and select those dimensions or features with minimum degree of overlap. To ensure that those selected features possibly achieve highest classification accuracy, those preliminarily selected features must be as the input of SVM classifier. Thus our method consists of the following steps. Let

To verify the classification ability of our algorithm, it was applied to tumor classification using four data sets of gene expression data with different properties in dimensionality of samples and set size. Our results were compared with the results from FFS-ACSA1, FFS-ACSA2 [9] and SODP [34] methods.

We applied our proposed method with four public gene expression data sets to evaluate its performance. There are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) data sets of Coldren et al. [37], Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) data sets of McWeeney et al. [38], Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) data sets of Crossman et al. [39], Breast Cancer data sets of Gluck et al. [40]. The detailed descriptions of four data sets. are as follows:

According to the original literature, Crossman et al. [39] classified response to imatinib with complete cytogenetic response (CCR) within 9 months and non-response to imatinib without major cytogenetic response (MCR) after 1 year.


                                 Breast Cancer data set: The data are from the web site of ncbi, GEO Data Sets number: GSE22358 containing 158 samples with 44290 genes in each sample. Gluck et al. [40] classified samples to pathologic complete response (pCR), near-complete response (npCR) and partial response (PR). In our experiment, we used 26 samples that used trastuzumab treatment and classified response to trastuzumab with pathologic complete response (pCR) and near-complete response (npCR) and non-response to trastuzumab with partial response (PR).

For each data set, 80% of the samples were randomly selected as training set and the remaining 20% as the testing set for FFS-ACSA1 and FFS-ACSA2 methods with 5-fold cross validation for SODP and PMDO methods. The signal-to-noise ratio classifier was used to evaluate the performances of two FFS methods. kNN classifier was used in SODP method while SVM classifier was used in PMDO method. The parameter setting is as follows:

To ensure the credibility of the results, 10 folds of random experiments were conducted for FFS-ACSA1 and FFS-ACSA2 methods.

                         show the average test accuracy for FFS-ACSA1, FFS-ACSA2, SODP and PMDO on four data sets with different numbers of selected features. The x-axis denotes the number of selected features and the y-axis denotes the average accuracy. Table 1
                         shows the highest accuracy and the number of selected features of each method tested with four data sets.

Three measures were used, i.e. accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the performance of proposed method. Sensitivity indicates how well the test predicts the actual positives. Specificity measures how well the test identifies the negatives. Accuracy is expected to measure how well the test predicts both categories. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy can be computed in terms of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false negatives (FN), and false positive (FP) as follows:

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This study has some limitations. Firstly, the available data set has less than 100 samples and may result in an over fitting situation after training the data set. However, the ranking of features based on the training set of samples and N-fold cross validation was used in experiment to avoid over fitting [41]. The result from ROC curves and the stable value of narrow standard deviation produced by PMDO method as summarized in Table 1 implied no over fitting of the training process. Secondly, the proposed method uses wrapper technique that consumes higher computational cost than filter technique. Thirdly, the proposed method transforms the data to another new feature space and selects the features from this new space. However, this transformation does not effect the selected genes since each gene directly corresponds to each dimension. Only the value of that dimension is changed by the space transformation.

Our results achieved much fewer number of selected genes. This is because our approach did not concentrate on the variance of data clustered in each dimension as in the other approaches where the concept of PCA was applied for feature selection. The proposed step of sorting the degrees of overlap in all dimensions selection proved to be effective for selecting the potential candidate dimensions. It also defined the exactly feature selecting sequence during the feature selection process.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a new feature selection method using the measure of degree of class overlap in each dimension to select the candidate features was proposed. The measuring function was adopted from t-test function. A larger degree implies that the amount of overlapped data from two classes is small. Instead of selecting each feature based on the eigenvalue of each eigenvector as in the PCA feature space, the feature with larger degree is selected first. The experimental results with four tumor cancer data signified that our proposed method can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the other recent methods with fewer selected features. The proposed method is suitable for any classification problem having a larger number of given features such as gene expression classification. Furthermore, the time complexity of our method may be less than the other methods because it may not be necessary to test each feature in the forward feature selection process. The forward selection step can be completely omitted if there exists a feature whose degree of overlap is at least equal to 1.
