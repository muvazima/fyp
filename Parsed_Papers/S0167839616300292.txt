                  A Quasi Extended Chebyshev (QEC) space is a space of sufficiently differentiable functions in which any Hermite interpolation problem which is not a Taylor problem is unisolvent. On a given interval the class of all spaces which contains constants and for which the space obtained by differentiation is a QEC-space has been identified as the largest class of spaces (under ordinary differentiability assumptions) which can be used for design. As a first step towards determining the largest class of splines for design, we consider a sequence of QEC-spaces on adjacent intervals, all of the same dimension, we join them via connection matrices, so as to maintain both the dimension and the unisolvence. The resulting space is called a Quasi Extended Chebyshev Piecewise (QECP) space. We show that all QECP-spaces are inverse images of two-dimensional Chebyshev spaces under piecewise generalised derivatives associated with systems of piecewise weight functions. We show illustrations proving that QECP-spaces can produce interesting shape effects.

An extensive study of ECP-spaces was developed in a number of earlier papers Mazure (1999, 2005b, 2006, 2007, 2011a), Mazure and Laurent (1999). In particular, the class of all ECP-spaces was clearly identified in Mazure (2007), see also Mazure (2011a). With a view to describe it, consider a system

The motivation for this work is also on the practical side. Indeed, in several previous situations (see, for instance, Laurent et al., 1997; Mazure, 2011d) we have observed that allowing zero multiplicities in spline spaces can produce powerful shape effects. This will be permitted by Theorem 1.4 for splines based on QECP-spaces, which is a priori not obvious at first with QEC-section-spaces.

In Section 3 the reader will learn how to build and how to handle 
                        (
                        n
                        +
                        1
                        )
                     -dimensional Piecewise QEC-spaces (PQEC-spaces) obtained by connecting different 
                        (
                        n
                        +
                        1
                        )
                     -dimensional QEC-section-spaces. Among all such PQEC-spaces, in Section 4 we distinguish those which meet the same requirement on the number of zeroes as QEC-spaces and we call them QECP-spaces. We show that QECP-spaces really behave as QEC-spaces, and that one can build such spaces with the help of systems of piecewise weight functions. Section 5 is devoted to QECP-spaces good for design, in which ready-to-blossom bases exist and make the existence of blossoms easily perceived. As usual, the crucial and tricky point is to prove that blossoms are pseudoaffine. As was already the case for Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, pseudoaffinity is a key-point for Theorem 1.4. The proof of this theorem is given in Section 6, and some consequences are developed. The results are illustrated in Section 7 with QECP-spaces built from sections of the form 
                        
                           
                              E

                      (up to translations).

The present work was made possible by many earlier results by the same author, in particular on QEC-spaces and on ECP-spaces. Out of necessity, this article cannot be self-contained. However in order to facilitate the reading a brief commented background is given is Section 2 below.

From the next section we will be in a piecewise context. In order to facilitate the reading we have gathered here some of the most important definitions we will deal with, introducing them in the non-piecewise context, and possibly commenting on the extensions to the piecewise framework.

It is due to the presence of blossoms and to their properties (see Mazure, 2008b) that the class of all QEC-spaces good for design has been identified as the largest class of spaces (with ordinary differentiation assumptions) which can be used for design. Existence and properties of blossoms will be extended to the piecewise QEC context in Section 5.

                         is a demanding one, aimed at eliminating uninteresting cases. It is justified by our preliminary observation which enables to state:

In this section we gather the main technical points about PQEC-spaces which will be involved in the next sections. They concern in particular the connection matrices, and how they are transformed via standard operations.

The special case where 
                              E
                            contains constants is crucial for design.

                              , the unisolvence of any Hermite interpolation problem (20) is obtained as soon as it is obtained for any Hermite interpolation problem based on exactly two points in

There is hardly any difference in the proofs of the equivalences stated above between the present piecewise situation and the non-piecewise one addressed in Mazure (2008b) to which we refer the reader to. □

In Goodman and Mazure (2001) we showed how to build QEC-spaces from systems of weight functions. The theorem below is the piecewise version of this construction.

                               corresponds to property (vi) of Theorem 4.4. Accordingly, we only have to assume that

The pseudoaffinity of blossoms was not easy to achieve. It is a key-property, which is the reason why blossoms are so powerful tools. Indeed, together with symmetry and diagonal property, it is the property which makes it possible to describe in an elegant and efficient way the classical design algorithms (evaluation, subdivision) in the QECP-space

The results presented here extend similar results obtained for EC-spaces in Mazure (2011b), for ECP-spaces in Mazure (2011a), and for QEC-spaces in Mazure (2011c).

We will first work in QECP-spaces good for design where we now know that blossoms are pseudoaffine. As a matter of fact, the following lemma readily follows from the pseudoaffinity of blossoms exactly as in Mazure (2011b).

                           Remark 6.5
                           
                              Theorem 6.3 and therefore its corollary (which is exactly Theorem 1.4) have been obtained by iterated application of Theorem 6.2. It is worthwhile mentioning two most interesting consequences of Theorem 6.2.

1- Assuming that (i) of Theorem 6.2 is satisfied, we know that the piecewise function 
                                 
                                    
                                       w
                                    
                                    
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                               is positive on 
                                 (
                                 [
                                 a
                                 ,
                                 b
                                 ]
                                 ;
                                 T
                                 )
                              . Accordingly the function U is strictly increasing on 
                                 [
                                 a
                                 ,
                                 b
                                 ]
                              . We can thus define a strictly increasing sequence 
                                 a
                                 =

                               This is a Bernstein-type positive linear operator based on the QECP-space 
                                 E
                              . It reproduces constants and the function U, and it is variation-diminishing due to the quasi-Bernstein basis being normalised and totally positive. Such operators can be handled as in the case of EC- or QEC-spaces Mazure (2009, 2011b, 2011c) to which we refer the reader (also see Aldaz et al., 2009 on this subject).

                              , possessing a quasi-Bernstein-like basis relative to 
                                 (

                               obtained from (28). The second step will consist in finding additional necessary and sufficient conditions for this basis to be a “convenient” one, so as to decrease the dimension again via Lemma 3.9, and so forth… This will be the method adopted in next section.

In this section we illustrate our results with the relatively simple case where 
                        n
                        =
                        2
                      with a view to design in the four-dimensional space of continuous functions obtained by integration.

We start with only two sections spaces. We thus work with

                           We have only addressed the case where we are connecting two three-dimensional QEC section-spaces. In practice, for the construction of splines, the resulting QECP-spaces can usefully play the role of one section-space (see Laurent et al., 1997). Nevertheless, we would like to draw the reader's attention to the fact that it is possible to iterate the process. Indeed, if, for instance, we have a third QEC-section space

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article we have identified the class of all QECP-spaces. This is interesting from a theoretical side, but the illustrations provided show that their construction also permits interesting shape effects.

In a QECP-space 
                        E
                      assumed to be good for design, the presence of blossoms and their pseudoaffinity makes it possible to develop results for splines based on 
                        E
                     , with any multiplicities at the interior knots, exactly as we did for splines based on one single QEC-space in Mazure (2011d), or earlier for splines based on a given ECP-space in Mazure (1999). As usual, the forcefulness of blossoms is that their pseudoaffinity guarantees that such spline spaces satisfy all expected properties for design (development of all the classical CAGD algorithms for splines; presence of quasi-B-spline bases which are the optimal normalised totally positive bases). This is thus one step towards the identification of the largest possible class of splines (with ordinary differentiability assumptions on the sections) which can be used not only for Design, but also for Approximation, Interpolation, and even Isogeometric Analysis. The complete identification of this class, announced in Mazure (2015), will be the object of a further article.
