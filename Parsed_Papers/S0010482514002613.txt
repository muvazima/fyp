                  This work is focused on application of a new technique in the first steps of computer-aided detection (CAD) of lung nodules. The scheme includes segmenting the lung volume and detecting most of the nodules with a low number of false positive (FP) objects. The juxtapleural nodules were properly included and the airways excluded in the lung segmentation. Among the suspicious regions obtained from the multiscale dot enhancement filter, those containing the center of nodule candidates, were determined. These center points were achieved from a 3D blob detector based on Laplacian of Gaussian kernels. Then the volumetric shape index (SI) that encodes the 3D local shape information was calculated for voxels in the determined regions. The performance of the scheme was evaluated by using 42 CT images from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The results show that the average number of FPs reaches to 38.8 per scan with the sensitivity of 95.9% in the initial detections. The scheme is adaptable to detect nodules with wide variations in size, shape, intensity and location. Comparison of results with previously reported ones indicates that the proposed scheme can be satisfactory applied for initial detection of lung nodules in the chest CT images.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Advances in CT imaging technology have improved the radiographic presentation of anatomical lung structure and also increased the sensitivity in detecting pulmonary diseases at the early stages. However, the large amounts of generated image data require the radiologists to pay high attention and effort for evaluating and interpreting the CT images. Accordingly, extensive researches have been devoted, during the last two decades, on the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes for the aim of detecting lung diseases, especially lung cancer [1].

Recently, a number of various CAD methods have been introduced to assist radiologists in extracting nodule candidates from CT images. The segmentation of lung volume is the main preprocessing step in these methods that restricts the post-processes, prevents false positives (FPs) outside the lung field and reduces the computational time. In literature, most of the existing techniques for lung segmentation are classified into two major categories: low and high level groups [2]. In the first group, little information of the lung CT image is required. Thresholding [3–7] and region growing [8–11] are two typical methods in this group. After using them, 3D approaches are applied to extract the lung volume. Of course, it is necessary to specify the lung boundary after segmentation. In order to do segmentation without the loss of lung nodules and to ensure the smooth lung boundary, several methods such as curvature-based lung smoothing [12], morphological operators [13] and rolling ball algorithm [4,6] have been proposed. The second group incorporates a high level of knowledge such as an earlier information, expert-defined rules and models of a desired object. For instance, the active contour model (ACM), named as “snake model”, is inspired by deformable boundary model in which a snake evolves to fit the shape of a desired object under specific internal and external guiding forces [14,15]. For accurately obtaining lung contours in snake model, an appropriate initialization is required. It should also be mentioned that in many of the model-based approaches, 3D lung segmentation is particularly challenging, because of the large amount of data to be processed and examined [16].

Many other researches from different disciplines have turned their attention to segmentation of lung in CTs. Among them are Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) [17], probabilistic FCM [18], atlas based segmentation [19] and graph cuts [20]. Also, a hybrid lung segmentation method has been presented in a recent publication [21].

After segmenting the lung volume, initial detection of nodules will be the next step. Although detecting isolated nodules (not connected to other pulmonary structures) is a simple task, this becomes difficult if nodules attach to the pleural and/or vessels. Accordingly, the vessels and airway walls attached to the lung nodule may give rise the amounts of FPs.

Various methods have been proposed in the literature for detecting nodule candidates. Multiple gray-level thresholding [7,22], intensity thresholding with morphological processing [6], template-matching [3], morphological approaches with convexity models [23] and recently, mass-spring model [11] and 3D-iris filter [13] are a number of proposed approaches. Moreover, filtering-based methods that enhance the shape of spherical objects [4,24–26], and shape-based methods [5,27–29] which characterize suspicious regions in the lung volume, are other techniques, frequently used by many research groups.

Accordingly, although many approaches have been introduced in detecting different kinds of nodules (e.g. non-isolated or irregular shaped nodules with complicate anatomical situations), still a large number of FPs are accompanied with initial detections. Many of the CAD systems incorporate a feature-based classifier to eliminate the FPs from nodule candidates. Reducing relatively large number of FPs before classification can significantly improve the performance of a CAD. This comes from the fact that the enormous variety in types and characteristics of the suspicious nodule objects makes it hard to produce a single suitable classifier, to find the best set of features in order to discrete the true and false nodules effectively and to overcome the possible overfitting.

On the other hand, there is always a large imbalance distribution between nodules (positive or minority class) and non-nodules (negative or majority class) in the nodule candidates. The performance of conventional classifiers is highly affected by the imbalanced data distribution. Typically, classifiers attempt to reduce global errors without taking into account the data distribution. As a result, a large number of instances are misclassified since the conventional classifiers show a strong bias towards the majority class. It is notable that the sensitivity of traditional classifiers depends on the degree of imbalance distribution [30]. Over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class have been common methods to re-balance the class distribution [30]. These two techniques must be carefully used because oversampling a minority class may lead to overtraining to a specific pattern of the samples belonging to the minority class, and under-sampling a majority class may lose some valuable patterns of majority class samples. Many of the errors revealed in the classification stage are originated from lack of proper attention to these issues.

The present work is focused on the first steps of CAD systems and aims to develop a new method in order to accurately specify the lung search space and distinguish suspicious regions, leading to significant reduction of FPs. A novel nodule detection algorithm is introduced to find nodule candidates by seeking the suspicious regions, in the enhanced image, that contain center points of possible nodules and calculating 3D local shape feature. The proposed algorithm provides two main benefits before classification stage; first, simplifying the imbalance data classification problem, and second, reducing the high computation cost due to significant reduction of nodule candidates.

Details of the proposed method for lung segmentation and nodule candidates detection, based on filtering methods and 3D shape analysis, are given in this study. The used dataset and the parameters adjustment are described. Results of the detection scheme are subsequently discussed and compared with other previously published works.

The block diagram of the proposed method for detecting pulmonary nodule candidates is shown in 
                     Fig. 1. At the first step, an isotropic interpolation is performed for each CT image. Then lung volume is segmented based on minimum error thresholding and 3D connected component analysis. At the next step, suspicions regions, i.e. regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted using multiscale dot enhancement filtering as well as 3D blob detector with Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) kernels. Then volumetric shape index is obtained for each of the voxels in the ROIs. In this way, many of the normal tissues are removed and nodule candidates are precisely determined. Following are explanations about the steps of the proposed algorithm.

Generally, the spatial resolution within each slice in CT examinations is different from the spatial resolution along the axial direction (slice thickness). Thus, to provide equal size voxels in each of the three dimensions, linear interpolation, because of its computational simplicity, is used along the axial direction for each of the CT images [31]. This step of processing is essential, since the detection scheme relies on the 3D analysis of CT images.

The lung segmentation is performed to separate the voxels corresponding to lung tissue from other regions, such as muscles, fat, bone, mediastinum, and background (the air around the body). Lung segmentation is a challenging problem due to heterogeneity in the lung region. Nevertheless, accurate segmentation of the lung is an inevitable matter with direct consequences for subsequent processing steps. The mask obtained from lung segmentation is used to ensure that nodule detection is performed within the lung volume only.

The lung segmentation procedure, used here, is similar to those previously reported [29,32]; however, was improved here. The main advantages for this part of the work, in comparison with previous attempts, are selecting a suitable threshold value for binarization, incorporating effectively the pleural nodules and excluding bronchi. The general scheme is described in the following sections.

In many of the earlier works, a single pre-determined threshold value has been used to separate the lung from the surrounding anatomy [4,6]. There are also some works that have employed optimal thresholding [3,13,24] or Otsu’s method [32] for this task. Otsu’s thresholding method is based on the idea of finding a threshold value that minimizes the within-class variance of resulting foreground and background classes. The method is robust, and it gives reasonable thresholding results in a vast variety of cases. However, this method has been shown to break down for a certain range of object-to-background pixel population ratios [33]. With respect to this point, in the present work, the minimum error thresholding algorithm [33] is used to automatically select a threshold for each image volume based on the unique characteristics of each data set.

The gray-level distribution of the voxels of a representative 3D chest CT image is presented in 
                           Fig. 2. According to this figure, two major regions with different density distribution exist: (i) the low-density region, including the background air, lung parenchymal and airways (trachea and bronchial tree), and (ii) the high-density region containing the thoracic cavity, muscles, fat, bones, vascular tree and lung nodules.

Using minimum error thresholding technique, the separation of the two regions is done automatically. The principal idea behind the method is to optimize a function of the average voxel classification error rate. The automated threshold selection

In order to find the best threshold value for separation and reducing the criterion function, the above mentioned iterative algorithm was used here. The algorithm is stated in following steps:

First step: choosing an arbitrary initial threshold,

Fourth step: terminating the computing, if the new threshold equals the old one; else, going to the second step.

The estimated threshold value, corresponding to the minimum of the criterion function, is actually relevant to the minimum overlap area between the two Gaussian distributions. The threshold value for separating the voxels of a typical CT image is shown in Fig. 2. According to the work done by Glasbey [35], the iterated version of Kittler’s minimum error algorithm is found to be the best in comparison with eleven other histogram-based global thresholding algorithms. The Kittler algorithm is one of the simplest to compute and appears to fail rarely in finding the best threshold.

After applying thresholding, in this step, the lung region should be extracted from other low-density regions, air around lung and background voxels. The 3D connected component labeling, by considering 26-connected neighborhoods for each voxel, was used to identify the lung voxels. The lung regions were then specified from these labeled volumes based on their volume size. The two largest components in the volume should be retained, with the additional constraint that the second-largest volume should be larger than half of the first one; otherwise, it will be put aside.

The noise formation caused by scanning systems or other sources are inevitable in the experiments. Further, applying thresholding in the first phase may intensify noise [36]. Therefore, the smoothing low-pass filter was used to smooth the images and reduce noise. Then, a morphological hole filling operator was applied slice-by-slice to fill the holes that are normally nodules or vessels. Similar procedures have been proposed in Refs. [29,32].

At the previous step, many of the pulmonary vessels and pleural nodules contacting the lung boundary were excluded, since their densities were higher than that of the lung parenchyma. There are several methods to solve this problem as mentioned in introduction section. However, these methods have some limitations. Accordingly, finding a properly sized rolling ball that works well for all juxtapleural nodules is a difficult task [37]. In the method introduced in Ref. [12], as another case, a large processing time is required to specify the whole lung boundary, and it often fails to complete this duty. Moreover, 3D smoothness cannot be proper, because indentations in the lung boundary may appear differently across axial slices [38]. In practice, the shapes of juxtapleural nodules vary greatly from round and oval to cone, triangular and flat; therefore, 3D smoothness may fail for juxtapleural nodules with tubular or cone-like shapes.

To include every juxtapleural nodule in the segmented lung volume and to obtain a smooth lung mask, contour correction method, based on chain code analysis [5,7], was used here, which consists of the following steps:
                              
                                 I.
                                 A chain code was employed for each of the 2D slices of the segmented lung object contour.

To remove noise from the initial lung contour, a Gaussian smoothing filter was applied to the chain codes.

The gradient of the filtered chain codes was calculated and critical points, as endpoints of concave regions, were detected by thresholding the obtained gradient.

The distance between each pair of critical points was calculated. The pairs with distance value within the range of nodules diameter were joined and their concave regions were filled. Others were put aside.

Since densities of airways are close to those of the lung tissue, the obtained results from the lung extraction step still contain the airways. The airway tree in the human chest is like a binary tree structure, in which, the trachea is divided into two main bronchi; each enters into the left or right lung. The trachea is the only significant air component in the beginning of a thoracic CT scan. Thus, based on the anatomical knowledge, the trachea and main bronchi were identified in the gray-level image using a 3D region growing method, nearly similar to the method proposed by Yim and Hong [38]. In this regard, to initialize, the seed point for growing was automatically determined by searching for a round and connected region near the center of the first few axial slices in each data set that had an intensity value lower than the threshold value obtained in the first step. The solid red regions in 
                           Fig. 3 show the results of segmentation in different slices of a CT image that were identified at this step. Finally, the segmented trachea and main bronchi were removed from the regions extracted in the previous step and the ensured lung region was obtained.

The initial detection and discrimination of nodule candidates from other surrounding structures with similar densities, is an important and difficult duty in CAD schemes. The recognition process requires considering precise information of intensity, shape, and connections between the pulmonary structures.

In the present method, suspicious regions were first detected and segmented using multiscale dot enhancement filter, established on eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian matrix in 3D image space as well as a 3D blob detector with LoG kernels which finds points that can be considered as the possible centers of lung nodules. Applying these two techniques aimed to minimize the nodules search and data analysis space while maintaining high detection sensitivity levels. Then the volumetric shape index was calculated for every voxels within the extracted regions and nodule candidates were specified.

In order to give rise the sensitivity for initial nodules detection, the multiscale dot enhancement filter [39], was applied for simultaneous enhancement of spherical structures such as dot-like nodules and disappearance of normal anatomic structures, included in the lung regions such as line-like blood vessels and planar-like airway walls.

As was mentioned, dot enhancement filter is based on the eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian matrix in each location. The calculation of the Hessian matrix of the intensity function is highly sensitive to noise, since involves second-order partial derivatives. Moreover, different size spherical objects (nodules), within the range

                           . So, the image resolution should be taken into account in the calculation of the Gaussian smoothing with different scales. Since the voxels in each of the CT images are not usually isotropic, as it was mentioned in Section 2.1, the interpolation technique was employed to make the size of each voxel equal in the three dimensions.

For each of the smoothing scales,

The obtained dot-enhanced image was thresholded with a fixed, empirically selected value for the separation of suspicious regions from other structures inside the lung. A 3D connected-component labeling method was then used and many of the small objects that are mainly due to noise were eliminated. The remaining objects were considered to be the regions containing nodule candidates.

The multiscale selective dot enhancement filter has been used widely and analyzed with many methods in several publications [4,24–26]. The main problem of using this filter is the high amount of FP detections, especially in the vicinity of vessel branches and junctions [26]. It is since, as was mentioned in Section 2.3.1, the calculation of the Hessian matrix is highly sensitive to noise. Consequently, smoothing of data at multiscales is required. Due to noise and smoothing, junctions are characterized by a high ratio of eigenvalues and so tend to be enhanced by applying nodule enhancement filter [40].

In this stage, the 3D blob detector was used for better estimation of the location of nodule centers and to reduce the FPs (non-nodule regions). Lung nodules are usually appeared in CT images as blob-like patterns brighter than the surrounding pulmonary background. Blob structures, can be specified as candidate markers for lung nodules, in a multiscale setting with the aid of LoG kernels. Actually, blob structures correspond to local minimum points of LoG filtered image.

Considering the sphere-like shape of pulmonary nodules and the shapes of other soft tissues such as cylinder-like vessels, the volumetric shape index is capable of distinguishing different shapes, while it does not depend on the position or orientation of the object and is less sensitive to the image intensity. Volumetric shape index is a 3D local geometric feature, which was derived from the principal curvatures. For each voxel

                            values, respectively. For each voxel, the maximum obtained value according to Eq. (16), among the N different scales, given by Eq. (9), was the precise value assigned to the shape index.

With respect to the fact that the average of shape index values for a nodule is higher than that of the blood vessel; in this stage, the regions having the average shape index bigger than 0.83 and also containing at least one voxel with a shape index bigger than 0.92 were retained. These two limits were experimentally found by working on five datasets and were initially estimated close to the previously reported values [5,29]. Other detected suspicious regions were removed from the list of nodule candidates.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using images from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) [42], a database of thoracic CT scans as a reliable imaging research resource as well as from LIDC–IDRI [43] as a product of the association between LIDC and the Image Database Resource Initiative. Four expert chest radiologists have drawn outlines for the nodules with effective sizes of 3mm or more. The ground truth has been established based on a blinded reading and a subsequent un-blinded reading.

In the nodule containing CT scans, 47 CT images were randomly collected. 26 scans were from the LIDC cases within 13614193285030024–13614193285030141 and the remaining from LIDC–IDRI cases, randomly from 0001 to 0368. All of the annotated nodule segmentations of these images were used for evaluation. To found the precise boundary of those nodules which were specified by at least two radiologists, the overlapped manual segmentations were determined.

Among the collected dataset, five CT images were randomly chosen and specified for tuning and setting the parameters. Other 42 CT images were used as the independent dataset for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. These include 124 nodules with wide variations in size, shape, intensity, and location. The number of slices in the evaluated independent images ranges from 101 to 411 and the average of 174 for each scan. Further, the slice thickness varied from 1.25mm to 3.00mm. Each slice has a resolution of 512×512pixel while the pixel size ranges from 0.51 to 0.94mm. This dataset covers various types of nodules, consisting isolated nodules, vascular nodules, juxtapleural nodules and also nodules with low contrast intensity known as ground glass opacity (GGO) nodules.

For each thoracic CT image, at the first step, the lung volume was segmented using minimum error thresholding and 3D-connected component analysis. 
                     Fig. 4 presents the results of relevant sub-stages of the lung volume segmentation in a typical CT scan slice, containing a juxtapleural nodule. It can be observed that this nodule was correctly included in the segmented lung region mask. The corresponding 3D representation of the CT image before and after removal of trachea as well as main bronchi is also presented in 
                     Fig. 5.

In the next step, the suggested method for detecting nodule candidates was applied on the segmented lung volume. The dot enhancement filter was used to enhance the spherical objects and consequently detect suspicious regions. The N was set at 5 which is adequate for many of the applications in medical imaging and for a nodule enhancement filter [39]. Therefore, five smoothing scales were used, 0.8, 1.3, 2.4, 4.2, and 7.5, corresponding to the size of nodules with equivalent diameter within the range of 3.0 to 30.0mm. This range of scales allowed the shape of both large and small objects to be detected. In order to obtain ROIs, the nodule enhanced image was thresholded with a fixed, selected value of 6, then objects smaller than 30 voxels were considered to be non-nodules and were eliminated. These two values were empirically obtained from the five CT scan processing.

Among the suspicious regions obtained, those which contain the center of nodule candidates were determined and the ROIs were provided. The possible points representing the centers were determined by a 3D blob detector based on six normalized LoG kernels with different sizes. Finally, by calculating the shape index feature for voxels within the ROIs, many of FP selected regions such as vessel branches or junctions were removed.

The results of the above described different steps for detecting nodule candidates, applied to a segmented lung image are shown in 
                     Fig. 6 for three typical slices. The nodules are indicated by red arrows. The nodules in the first and second cases are attached to blood vessels, and the third case has two juxtapleural nodules.

As it is clear in Fig. 6(b) and (c), applying the 3D multiscale dot enhancement filtering and thresholding the results, all the nodules, including the low contrast one in the second case, were greatly enhanced and specified. It can also be seen that the majority of non-nodule objects in the input images with intensity values similar to those of nodules, like most blood vessels and specially the vessels attached to the nodules were substantially eliminated. The red points in Fig. 6(d) represent the center of possible nodules, obtained by applying 3D blob detector with LoG kernels on the input images. These points were fitted with the regions segmented in the previous step, and only areas including these points were retained. It is notable that since the detector works three dimensionally, we can see some areas in Fig. 6(e) that may not include any red points shown in Fig. 6(d). Each suspicious area contains a point that appears in one of the slices relevant to the CT data. The disappearance of some regions in Fig. 6(f) compared with Fig. 6(e) is due to removal of regions not satisfying the criteria defined in Section 2.3.3 for the shape index feature. The 3D view of the separation and detection of a nodule from other structures by the presented method is shown in 
                     Fig. 7. This nodule corresponds to the left nodule of the third case in Fig. 6.

Ultimately, using the proposed method, a total of 1749 nodule candidates were detected, where the minimum number of candidates in each exam was 11 and the maximum 154. Among these nodule candidates, a total of 119 nodules were correctly detected. Thus the presented scheme achieved a sensitivity of 95.9% with an average 38.8 FPs per scan (0.22 per slice). The detection performance of the proposed algorithm in different steps is shown in 
                     Table 1. As it can be seen, the dot enhancement filter exhibits a much better sensitivity and specificity than the 3D blob detector. In many of the works based on the LoG filtering, the output is pruned according to several rules like applying thresholding and analyzing the components [41]. In the proposed method here, these pruning rules were not applied in 3D blob detection. Therefore, this is the reason of generating too many nodule candidates, reported in the second row of Table 1.

Examples of some nodule candidates and the only five very small nodules that our proposed initial detection technique failed to detect are shown in 
                     Fig. 8.

After thoroughly inspecting the output results in all steps of proposed lung segmentation and nodule candidates detection, it was revealed that all of the nodules, especially juxtapleurals, and those attached to lung vessels near the aorta and other obscuring structures were correctly included in the lung mask. However, the three left nodules in Fig. 8(c) were failed to meet the minimum shape index requirements. The failure is due to these nodules’ irregular shapes that did not have any local spherical element. The other two nodules, at the right hand side image of Fig. 8(c) were undetected (when determining the center of candidates using 3D blob detector) because of their too small size and low contrast. Using adaptive image smoothing methods for noise reduction may improve the detection capability for such cases.

In the method used here, nodule candidates detection performance relies on different shape index thresholds. Therefore, in order to evaluate the discriminative power of the SI feature, the ROC curves with regards to the different shape index thresholds, are presented in 
                     Fig. 9. In the first case (Fig. 9a), 13 sets of average index thresholding values, ranging from 0.8 to 0.92 and in the second case (Fig. 9b) different high shape index thresholding values ranging from 0.82 to 0.98 were used. The results indicate that the previously selected and used values of 0.83 and 0.92 for the average shape index and the high shape index thresholding, respectively, provide a good performance regarding the sensitivity and FP criteria. Accordingly, the overall detection rate of the proposed method in the optimal high shape index thresholding is 95.9% and the average FPs about 38.8 per scan, based on the 42 processed images.

The obtained results of initial nodule detection, before applying any FP reduction method, usually demonstrate how effective the steps of preprocessing, lung segmentation, enhancement, and initial nodule identification methods are. Of the existing publications on CAD, only a few ones have reported the results of initial detection. Meanwhile, the comparison between the results needs the same datasets with similar nodule type and size. However, similar datasets are not available, thus, a relative comparison is promising. For this aim, we selected a number of recently reported CAD systems that have used the LIDC database [6,7,26,44–46] and also a number of works that have used their own databases [4,13,25].


                     
                     Table 2 compares the proposed method for initial nodule detection with the recently reported ones. It can be observed that all these works exhibit reasonable sensitivity for initial pulmonary nodules detection; however, few of them have reported low level average FPs, whether per scan or per slice. Based on the comparison with the systems operating on the similar dataset, the number of FPs in this work is significantly low while a relatively high sensitivity is preserved. These favorite results can be attributed to the methods of ROI detection and segmentation, in which combination of multiscale enhancement filtering and LoG kernels have been applied.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work a new method was developed to analyze chest CT images, in order to detect pulmonary nodule candidates.

Since pulmonary nodules have their own spherical structures that are distinct from other pulmonary objects, the 3D analysis of the images gives rise to the nodule detection accurately. In this research, using multiscale dot enhancement filtering, spherical objects were enhanced and simultaneously normal anatomic structures such as blood vessels and airway walls were mostly suppressed. Also, the center of the nodule candidates was obtained by applying LoG kernels. As a result, the combination of these two algorithms led to the significant improvement of the performance of the initial nodule detection. Furthermore, calculating volumetric shape index was suitable to describe nodule candidates, based on the principal curvatures concept. This index has the special advantage that does not depend on the position of the object and it is less sensitive to the image intensity.

The proposed algorithm was evaluated using 42 CT images from the LIDC database. Taking into account the presence of very small nodules and also nodules with very low contrast intensity, the results indicate the effectiveness of the method for detection of suspicious regions. The algorithms used in this work can also be adopted as the first detection stage for other CAD schemes. Compared to other reported works, the present method was shown to significantly reduce the number of FPs after initial candidates’ detection, while maintaining a high sensitivity.
