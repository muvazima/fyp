                  Group-independent component analysis (GICA) is a well-established blind source separation technique that has been widely applied to study multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The group-independent components (GICs) represent the commonness of all of the subjects in the group. Similar to independent component analysis on the single-subject level, the performance of GICA can be improved for multi-subject fMRI data analysis by incorporating a priori information; however, a priori information is not always considered while looking for GICs in existing GICA methods, especially when no obvious or specific knowledge about an unknown group is available. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract the group intrinsic reference from all of the subjects of the group and then incorporate it into the GICA extraction procedure. Comparison experiments between FastICA and GICA with intrinsic reference (GICA-IR) are implemented on the group level with regard to the simulated, hybrid and real fMRI data. The experimental results show that the GICs computed by GICA-IR have a higher correlation with the corresponding independent component of each subject in the group, and the accuracy of activation regions detected by GICA-IR was also improved. These results have demonstrated the advantages of the GICA-IR method, which can better reflect the commonness of the subjects in the group.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Independent component analysis (ICA) has been successfully applied to the study of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data as a data-driven method [1,2] since it was first introduced for single-subject fMRI data analysis by McKeown et al. [3]. ICA attempts to separate independent sources that have been mixed together. Based on different modeling assumptions, the conventional ICAs can be used to analyze the fMRI data in three different dimensions, namely, the spatial [4,5], temporal [6,7] and spatiotemporal dimensions [8]. This paper concerns ICA for the spatial dimension (spatial ICA, sICA), which models the fMRI data as a linear mixture of spatial independent components.

In some cases, ICA is used for multi-subject fMRI data analysis, often referred to as group ICA (GICA) [9]. The fMRI data of multiple subjects are typically grouped in three different ways with different hypotheses imposed upon the multi-subject fMRI data, including spatial concatenation, temporal concatenation and tensor concatenation. The spatial concatenation method concatenates the multi-subject fMRI data along the spatial dimension assuming that all of the subjects have common temporal information in each corresponding independent component (IC) [10]. The temporal concatenation method concatenates the multi-subject fMRI data along the temporal dimension with an assumption that all of the subjects have common spatial independent components (ICs) [11–13]. The tensor probabilistic ICA concatenates the original multi-subject fMRI data along a separate third dimension with the hypothesis that different subjects have common group spatial ICs and time courses but a subject-specific magnitude [14,15]. The temporal concatenation method works better than the spatial concatenation method for fMRI data analysis because the temporal variations in the fMRI signal are larger than the spatial variations [16]. A comparison of the temporal concatenation method and tensor probabilistic ICA method indicates that the temporal concatenation method works better for most fMRI studies [17]. Thus, only the temporal concatenation GICA will be considered in this paper.

As a blind source separation technique, classical ICA is not dependent on any a priori information, but some works have suggested that incorporating a priori information into the estimation process can improve the potential of ICA as a method for fMRI data analysis [18]. Several algorithms and methodologies have been proposed to account for a priori information on an ICA problem, such as a constrained ICA [19,20], ICA with a reference (ICA-R) [21,22] and other extension work [23,24]. Existing studies have demonstrated that these methods have better performance due to the use of a priori information, such as temporal a priori information [25], spatial a priori information [26,27], or spatiotemporal a priori information [28,29]. There are several reasons to incorporate a priori information into an ICA model when available. For example, compared to the classical ICA, ICA-R takes advantage of the a priori information to extract only the desired independent sources without extracting the whole data set of sources, and therefore, this method avoids computing the uninteresting sources and facilitates subsequent applications [30]. In addition, the incorporation of a priori information improves the quality and accuracy of the separation of interested components, and the computation time and storage requirements are reduced simultaneously [31].

However, the existing approaches with a priori information usually consider only specific knowledge on the sources, such as a specific template of spatial activation or a particular feature of a source. While this knowledge about the sources is not always known, how to extract the underlying information from the existing data itself is an important consideration. Recently, the group independent components (GICs) computed by GICA have been used to guide ICA on the single-subject level, and this method is able to obtain subject specific ICs with stronger independence and better spatial correspondence across different subjects in addition to higher spatial and temporal accuracy [32]. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there are no reports on how to obtain some information from each subject in the group and incorporate this information into the GICA extraction procedure for multi-subject fMRI data analysis on the group level, especially when no obvious or specific knowledge is available on an unknown group of sources. In this paper, we present such a method, which we have called GICA with intrinsic reference (GICA-IR).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the relevant knowledge and theory of the GICA-IR method will first be presented followed by the simulated data, hybrid data and real data experimental tests, which were designed to evaluate the performance of GICA-IR compared with FastICA. Finally, the results and analysis will be presented together with interpretations and conclusions related to the advantages and limitations of this new data analysis method.

The classic ICA model assumes that the source signals are not observable, statistically independent, and non-Gaussian. Let X

M is a T×N unknown mixing matrix that mixes the N independent source signals to generate the observed fMRI images, where each column of M representing the time course of a source signal. The goal of ICA is to estimate an N×T, unmixing matrix W

An error term representing residual variability in the observed data can be added to X

                        MS, which leads to the probabilistic ICA model [33,34]. The most commonly used ICA algorithms included Infomax [35], FastICA [36] and so on.

To incorporate the reference into ICA, a distance criterion is defined to measure the closeness between the output signal y and reference signal r, and we denote the distance as ɛ(y, r), where y and r are column vectors with the same number of voxels in the brain. Several functions can be used as ɛ(y, r), e.g., mean square error (MSE), correlation or negative correlation. Then, the problem of ICA-R can be modeled in the constrained ICA framework as a constrained optimization problem

                         via introducing a slack variable c. Then, the Lagrange multiplier method was utilized to search for the solution using a Newton-like learning algorithm [21] or a fixed-point learning algorithm [22].

Among the existing GICA approaches, the most commonly used method is temporal concatenation GICA. Specifically, let X
                        i be a T×V matrix representing the observed fMRI data from subject i(i=1, …, K). Temporal concatenation GICA temporal concatenates data across the K subjects and then decomposes the KT×V group data as

In this section, we provide the detailed contents of the proposed GICA-IR. Assuming a total of K subjects in the group, all of the subjects have T time points and V voxels after normalization.

First, ICA was implemented on each of the subjects in the group. As introduced in Section 2.1, for the subject i, ICA was defined as

                            is a column vector of size V×1.

For simplicity, we assume that each subject of the group has just one interested IC corresponding to the GIC. The correspondence of the ICs across the different subjects corresponding to the GIC can be measured using the absolute value of the spatial correlation [37].

Next, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the intrinsic reference signal from the ICs that are decomposed by ICA in Section 2.4.1.

We denote the location set of voxels in the mask of subject i as VLS

When the intrinsic reference r was extracted from the subjects of the group, the ICA-R [26] introduced in Section 2.2 can be used for the group fMRI data analysis by incorporating r into the extraction procedure of the GICA introduced in Section 2.3 as a reference signal, namely, GICA-IR. To evaluate the performance of GICA-IR, the classical ICA [36] without prior information introduced in Section 2.1 was also performed on the group level for the purpose of comparison.

The experimental tests consist of simulated data, hybrid data and real data experiments. For the real data experiments, the task-related network and the related default mode network (DMN) were considered in the task-related experiment and the resting-state experiment, respectively.

The simulated fMRI data were generated by linearly mixing a set of spatially independent sources with distinct simulated hemodynamic time courses using software (http://mlsp.umbc.edu/simulated_fmri_data.html) [38]. Each simulated dataset corresponding to one simulated subject's fMRI data had 100 mixture images, which were generated by mixing eight fMRI-like source images (60×60 pixels) with the associated time courses (100 time points). Among the eight sources, the task-related source has a time course with a block-like shape mimicking an experimental paradigm. In our experiment, a group simulated dataset consisting of 10 simulated subjects was generated from the same template sources/TCs by adding subject-specific variability. The spatial variation of the sources was simulated by adding Gaussian noise to the source images, and amplitude modulation was applied to the time courses to simulate temporal variation.

To assess the performance of GICA-IR for multi-subject fMRI data analysis, the hybrid data experiment was designed. We simulated the signal S with a cubic size of 7×7×7 (unit: voxel), which was added to the normalized resting-state fMRI data of five subjects at an amplitude equal to 0.02 times the average amplitude of the signal within the cubic. The signal changes in the anterior two regions corresponded to the same mixing function, which are presented in Fig. 1
                         
                        [39].

The resting-state data set was downloaded from the public neuroimaging database (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon1000/). This dataset was released by Dr. James J. Pekar and Dr. Stewart H. Mostofsky. In total, 23 healthy subjects (eight males and 15 females) were involved in this study. The BOLD fMRI data were acquired on a Philips 3.0T scanner using a multi-element receiver coil to allow partial parallel image acquisition with a single-shot SENSE gradient echo EPI with 47 slices providing whole-brain coverage and 123 volumes, a TR of 2.5s and a scan resolution of 96×96. The in-plane resolution was 2.67mm×2.67mm, and the slice thickness was 3mm. In this study, the BOLD fMRI data of five healthy subjects were randomly selected to perform the group analysis.

A visual task-related fMRI dataset with five subjects were involved in this study. All five subjects were informed of the study aims and provided written informed consent prior to inclusion. The visual paradigm was OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON in 20s block. During the “ON” state, a visual stimulus corresponded to a radial blue/yellow checkerboard, reversing at 7Hz. During the “OFF” state, the participants were required to focus on the cross at the center of the screen. The BOLD fMRI data of two of the subjects were acquired using single-shot SENSE gradient echo EPI with 37 slices providing whole-brain coverage and 70 volumes, a TR of 2.0s and a scan resolution of 64×64. The in-plane resolution was 4mm×4mm, and the slice thickness was 4mm. The data from the other three subjects were acquired using single-shot SENSE gradient echo EPI with 40 slices providing whole-brain coverage and 70 volumes, a TR of 2.0s and a scan resolution of 80×80. The in-plane resolution was 3mm×3mm, and the slice thickness was 3mm.

The resting-state dataset including 10 subjects was involved in this study. The BOLD fMRI data were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3.0T scanner using a 12-channel phased-array receiver-only head coil with the implementation of parallel imaging scheme GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions) with a gradient echo EPI with 40 slices providing whole-brain coverage and 160 volumes, a TR of 3s and a scan resolution of 64×64. The in-plane resolution was 3.5mm×3.5mm, and the slice thickness was 3.5mm. The functional images were collected parallel to the AC-PC (anterior commissure–posterior commissure) plane, with whole brain EPI acquisition from the vertex to the cerebellum.

All of the computations in this study were performed on a workstation with an operating system platform consisting of windows 7 Unlimited Service Pack1, with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-1620 3.60GHz processor and 40GB RAM. All of the preprocessing and processing algorithm steps of ICA and GICA-IR were run on the Matlab platform (Matlab, 2013a, Math-Works Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA).

Common preprocessing of all of the experiments except simulated experiment was performed in SPM8 (
                           http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/
                        ), including slice timing; motion correction; spatial normalization; and smoothing with the Gaussian kernel, which was set to 4mm on the hybrid data and task-related data and 8mm on the resting-state data, where SPM was a tool for fMRI data preprocessing including jSIPRO for the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging analysis [40]. In all of the experiments, the single-subject ICA and temporal concatenated GICA were involved. All of these methods were performed using GIFT software (v2.0e) (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/). FastICA was performed at both the single-subject level and the group level, and GICA-IR was only performed at the group level. To obtain reliable ICs and GICs, ICASSO [41] with 20 runs and both ‘RandInit’ and ‘Bootstrap’ were used for FastICA. MDL [42] was used to estimate the number of GICs for the real data. Furthermore, the location and display of these networks were assessed using MRIcro software (http://www.mricro.com).

@&#RESULTS AND ANALYSIS@&#

In this section, we will compare the performance of the proposed GICA-IR method with that of FastICA without any prior information for the group fMRI data analysis.

The simulated data experiment is used to demonstrate that the correlation is improved between the GIC and the corresponding IC of each subject in the group, which are obtained using GIC computed by GICA-IR. The correlation between the GIC and the corresponding IC of each subject in the group by FastICA are also shown for comparison. The corresponding eigenvector of reference is [0.3059, 0.3355, 0.3159, 0.3107, 0.3369, 0.3291, 0.3147, 0.2875, 0.3079 0.3150], which represents the contribution of each subject in the reference.

                         represents the specific IC of subject i corresponding to the GIC. The correlation coefficients calculated by GICA-IR are significantly higher than those calculated by FastICA using the T test with a confidence level setting of 95%, which means that the GIC computed by GICA-IR can better reflect the commonness of the subjects in the group.

The hybrid data experiment is used to simulate group task-related fMRI data, such that the time courses of voxels in the regions where the simulated signal was added are similar to the corresponding mixing function in each subject. The corresponding eigenvector of reference is [0.5199, 0.1786, 0.5893, 0.5134, 0.2948], which represents the contribution of each subject in the reference. A comparison of experimental results between GICA-IR and FastICA are shown in Fig. 3
                        .


                        Fig. 3 presents the simulated signal regions and activation regions corresponding to the GICs computed by GICA-IR and FastICA, respectively. The activation regions detected by GICA-IR are much closer to the real regions where the simulated signal was added.

For the task-related data set, several metrics are applied to evaluate the functional detecting ability of the proposed GICA-IR by comparing the experimental results of GICA-IR with FastICA, which are shown in Fig. 4
                           . All of the results are obtained using GICs computed by GICA-IR and FastICA, respectively. The block of the visual paradigm is used to replace the hemodynamic response function because it is unknown to us from the real fMRI data. The corresponding eigenvector of the reference is [0.4691, 0.4467, 0.4643, 0.4273, 0.4269], which represents the contribution of each subject in the reference.


                           Fig. 4(A) presents the line chart of the correlation coefficients between the GIC and the corresponding IC of each of the five subjects with the GICs computed using GICA-IR and FastICA, respectively. The correlation of GIC computed using GICA-IR with the corresponding IC was clearly improved for subjects 3, 4, and 5. Fig. 4(B) presents the line chart of the correlation coefficients between the block and the average time course of the activated regions revealed by GIC in each subject, where the GICs are computed using GICA-IR and FastICA. The mathematical formation of the correlation coefficient can be given as

Fig. 4(C) presents the distribution histograms of the added voxels and removed voxels by using GICA-IR in comparison with the voxels detected by FastICA in the different subjects. These voxels are obtained based on the correlation coefficient between the block and the time course of each voxel. The time courses of most of the added voxels have a high correlation with the block, but the time courses of most of the removed voxels have a low correlation with the block in each subject. Fig. 4(D) presents the line chart of the correlation coefficients between the block and the average time courses of the added voxels and removed voxels by using GICA-IR in comparison with the voxels detected using FastICA in different subjects. The result shows that the average time course of the added voxels has a high correlation with the block, but the average time course of the removed voxels has a low correlation with the block in each subject. Taken together, the results show that the proposed GICA-IR method can improve the detection ability of functional regions.

The resting-state data experiment is used to demonstrate that the correlation can be improved between the group-level DMN and the corresponding DMN of each subject in the group, which are obtained using the group-level DMN computed using GICA-IR. The correlation between the group-level DMN and the corresponding DMN of each subject in the group by FastICA are also shown for comparison. The corresponding eigenvector of the reference is [0.0650, 0.0641, 0.1155, 0.3970, 0.4318, 0.2087, 0.6363, 0.4050, 0.1481, 0.0002], which represents the contribution of each subject in the reference.

                            presents some spatial maps of the group-level DMNs obtained using GICA-IR and FastICA. Many areas have clear improvements upon using GICA-IR. Fig. 6
                            presents the line chart of the correlation coefficients between the group-level DMN and the corresponding DMN of each of the 10 subjects, which are obtained using the group-level DMNs computed by GICA-IR and FastICA, respectively. The correlation coefficients calculated using GICA-IR are significantly higher than those calculated using FastICA with the T test with a confidence level of 95%, which means that the group-level DMN computed by GICA-IR can better reflect the commonness of the subjects in the group.

In this study, we have presented an effective method to obtain an intrinsic reference from the subjects’ fMRI data of a group and then incorporated this reference into the estimation process of GICA for the group fMRI data analysis, which we named GICA-IR. As a data-driven method, GICA-IR does not require any specific knowledge about the group sources. The experimental results have shown that the GICA-IR method is effective to improve the accuracy of detecting functional areas. Figs. 2, 4(A) and 6 have shown that the GIC has a higher correlation with the subject-specific IC computed using GICA-IR on the simulated data and real data, respectively, which means that the GIC computed using GICA-IR can better reveal the commonness of the subjects in the group. Figs. 3, 4(B-D) and 5 have shown that the GICA-IR method can more accurately detect the function regions compared to FastICA.

In this paper, GICA-IR was implemented on the group level by a fixed-pointed algorithm. Therefore, to maintain consistency of the comparison of the experimental results, FastICA was implemented on the subject level and the group level without a reference. However, the proposed GICA-IR method was not only applied to FastICA. In Appendix 1, we have presented the experimental results between GICA-IR and Infomax, which are shown in Fig. s1. The results have also demonstrated the success of the proposed GICA-IR method.

In addition, the voxel time courses have a high correlation with the a priori block pattern if the voxels are activated on the visual-task-related experiment. Therefore, the voxels were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed GICA-IR method. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed GICA-IR method could simultaneously add some voxels with a high correlation and remove some voxels with a low correlation. ATCi was the average time course of voxels in the activated region from subject i; these voxels have the same location with the voxels activated in GIC, which were obtained using GICA-IR and FastICA. The higher correlation between ATCi and the block demonstrated that GIC obtained by the corresponding method could better reveal the activated commonness of all of the subjects. The experimental results also demonstrated the advantage of the proposed GICA-IR method. Similar methods to evaluate fMRI data can be found in [43,44].

Finally, the results shown in Fig. 4(B) could also be calculated using the component time course obtained from the back reconstruction of group ICA and the block timing convolved with an HRF estimate. In Appendix 2, this result is presented in Fig. s2, where the a priori block was replaced by convolving the block timing with an HRF estimated by a gamma function with a 1.8-s delay in the function, and the average time course ATC
                     
                        i
                      of each subject was replaced by the corresponding component time course. We found from the figure that the results were similar to these calculated by the average voxel time course and plain block timing.

The average method can also be used to extract the intrinsic reference from the group fMRI data in this paper, namely,

                     . Because the differences between the subjects (e.g., the differences of the spatial structure) lead to differences between the subject functional components (e.g., the default mode network), when we perform the group analysis for the fMRI data, the GIC can reveal the commonness between the subjects to the largest extent. Therefore, PCA rather than the average method is used in this article for the purpose of improving the representative of GIC.

                      used in this research, we will study whether we can get a more optimal method if we do not use the absolute values in our further study. Our future research will focus on improving the method of extracting the intrinsic reference and then incorporating this into GICA for multi-subject fMRI data on the group level.
