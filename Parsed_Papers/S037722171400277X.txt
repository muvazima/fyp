                  Subgroup additivity requires that a rule assigns the same expected ‘relative’ utility to each agent whether an agent’s expected relative utility is calculated from the problem involving all agents or from its sub-problems with a smaller number of agents. In this paper, we investigate its implications for the queueing problem. As a result, we present characterizations of five important rules: the minimal transfer rule, the maximal transfer rule, the pivotal rule, the reward based pivotal rule, and the symmetrically balanced VCG rule. In addition to some basic axioms and subgroup additivity, the characterization results can be obtained by additionally imposing either a strategic axiom or an equity axiom.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The queueing problem has the following set-up. There is a group of agents who must be served in a facility.
                        1
                        In this paper, we assume that there is no initial queue. For models with an initial queue, see, for example, Curiel, Pederzoli, and Tijs (1989), Borm, Fiestras-Janeiro, Hamers, Sanchez, and Voorneveld (2002), Hamers, Klijn, and van Velzen (2005), van Velzen (2006), Grundel, Çiftçi, Borm, and Hamers (2013).
                     
                     
                        1
                      The facility can serve only one agent at a time and agents incur waiting costs. We are interested in finding the order in which to serve agents and the (positive or negative) monetary transfers they should receive. We assume that the waiting cost is constant per unit of time, but that agents differ in their waiting costs. Furthermore, we assume that agents have quasi-linear preference and, in particular, the utility of an agent is the amount of his monetary transfer minus his waiting costs. The queueing problem (and its generalization with non-identical processing time called sequencing problems) has been analyzed extensively from a strategic perspective (Dolan, 1978; Suijs, 1996; Mitra, 2001; Mitra, 2002 and others) as well as from a normative perspective (Maniquet, 2003; Chun, 2006a; Chun, 2006b; Chun, 2011 and others).
                        2
                        A similar analysis can be done for scheduling problems in which agents have the same waiting costs, but the processing time for jobs can differ (see, for example, Cres & Moulin, 2001; Moulin, 2007).
                     
                     
                        2
                     
                  

The axiom of 
                        
                           s
                        
                     -subgroup additivity requires that a rule assigns the same expected relative utility to each agent whether an agent’s expected relative utility is calculated from the problem involving all 
                        
                           n
                        
                      agents or from its sub-problems with 
                        
                           s
                        
                      agents where the sub-problems are formed from the original set of 
                        
                           n
                        
                      agents. The relative utility of an agent from a rule (and given a group) is the utility of the agent in a given state relative to his identical expected utility (that is, utility that he expects to derive when all others’ preference coincides with his and he gets each of the queue position with equal probability). We investigate its implications for the queueing problem. As a result, we present characterizations of five important rules in the queueing problem: the minimal transfer rule (Maniquet, 2003), the maximal transfer rule (Chun, 2006a), the pivotal rule, the reward based pivotal rule (Mitra & Mutuswami, 2011), and the symmetrically balanced VCG rule (Suijs, 1996; Kayi & Ramaekers, 2010).
                        3
                        Here VCG rule is due to Vickrey (1961), Clarke (1971), and Groves (1973).

Our notion of subgroup additivity can be compared with converse consistency, which requires that if, whenever for some problem a feasible alternative has the property that for all proper subgroups of agents the solution chooses the restriction of the alternative to the subgroup for the associated reduced problem this subgroup faces, then the alternative should be the solution for the problem. The most common form of converse consistency is defined for 2 agent problems. Converse consistency is appealing from both practical and computational point of views as it tells us that to evaluate an outcome for some possibly large group, it is enough to do so at the two-agent level (Peleg, 1986; Thomson, 2004). We ask a related question: Is it possible to solve the 
                        
                           n
                        
                     -agent problem by solving sub-problems with 2 or 3 agents? Instead of introducing a reduced problem, we try to find an answer by solving sub-problems directly obtained from the original problem. Also, we note that subgroup additivity is an important issue in other contexts such as poverty measures and has been studied extensively under the name of decomposability (Foster, Greer, & Thorbecke, 1984).

In this paper, first, we show that, given any set of 
                        
                           n
                        
                      agents, for each 
                        
                           s
                           ∈
                           {
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                           -
                           2
                           }
                        
                     , if a rule satisfies 
                        
                           s
                        
                     -subgroup additivity, queue efficiency, Pareto indifference and equal treatment of equals, then it also satisfies 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           +
                           1
                           )
                        
                     -subgroup additivity implying that 2-subgroup additivity is the strongest requirement among the class of rules satisfying queue efficiency, Pareto indifference and equal treatment of equals. Using 2-subgroup additivity, we provide characterizations of the minimal transfer rule, the maximal transfer rule, the pivotal rule and the reward based pivotal rule. By using 3-subgroup additivity, we provide characterizations of the symmetrically balanced VCG rule.

Given the subgroup additivity axiom and some basic axioms like queue efficiency, equal treatment of equals, and Pareto indifference, we impose additionally two types of axioms to characterize these five rules. The first type of axioms are strategic where we weaken the notion of strategyproofness. Strategyproofness requires that truth-telling is a dominant strategy for all agents in all announced states. The second type of axioms are equity-based, where we strengthen the notion of egalitarian equivalence. Egalitarian equivalence requires that all agents are indifferent between his allocated bundle and a reference bundle (Pazner & Schmeidler, 1978). We adjust this notion of egalitarian equivalence by imposing a restriction on the reference bundle. What comes out of our analysis is that each strategic axiom in our characterization results can be replaced by an appropriate equity axiom for the four rules that are 2-additive. This type of substitutability between strategic and equity axioms also works for the symmetrically balanced VCG rule.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the preliminaries that include the structure of the queueing problem, the basic axioms, and the five rules important of our analysis. In Section 3 we present our main axiom of subgroup additivity, highlight its important properties, and show that all the five rules satisfy some version of this property. In Section 4 we provide our characterization result of the four 2-subgroup additive rules using strategic properties, and in Section 5 using equity properties. In Section 6 we characterize the symmetrically balanced VCG rule using 3-subgroup additivity along with either a strategic axiom or an equity axiom. In Section 7 we conclude our analysis.

We introduce basic axioms on the rules. Queue efficiency requires that the rule should choose an efficient allocation. Budget balance requires that the sum of all transfers should be equal to zero. Pareto efficiency requires that the rule should choose an allocation which is queue efficient and budget balanced. Pareto indifference requires that if an allocation is chosen by a rule, then all other feasible allocations which assign the same utilities to each agent should be chosen by the rule. Equal treatment of equals requires that two agents with the same waiting cost should end up with the same utilities. Finally, for any given positive integer

                        , s-equal treatment of equals requires that equal treatment of equals holds for all s agent problems.

We characterize five rules that have been well studied in the queueing literature. The minimal transfer rule (Maniquet, 2003) selects an efficient queue and transfers to each agent a half of his unit waiting cost multiplied by the number of his predecessors minus a half of the sum of the unit waiting cost of his successors. The maximal transfer rule (Chun, 2006a) selects an efficient queue and transfers to each agent a half of the sum of the unit waiting cost of his predecessors minus a half of his unit waiting cost multiplied by the number of his successors. These two rules are obtained by applying the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953), one of the most widely discussed solution in cooperative games, to appropriately designed cooperative games of the queueing problem. For the minimal transfer rule, the worth of a coalition is defined to be the minimal waiting cost incurred by its members under the assumption that they are served before the non-coalitional members. For the maximal transfer rule, the members of the coalition are served after the non-coalitional members.

The next three rules satisfy strategyproofness, that is, truth telling is a dominant strategy for each agent and for each (announced) state. The first rule, which can be called the symmetrically balanced VCG rule, was first obtained in the context of sequencing by Suijs (1996) and later characterized, in the queueing context by Kayi and Ramaekers (2010).

There is a class of mechanisms, called 
                           
                              k
                           
                        -pivotal mechanisms, that were characterized by Mitra and Mutuswami (2011) using EFF, ETE, pairwise strategyproofness and weak linearity. While weak linearity is a technical requirement, the axiom of pairwise strategyproofness states that, as long as there is no further side payments across agents, there does not exist any pair of agents that can benefit by deviating from truth-telling. Moreover, all 
                           
                              k
                           
                        -pivotal mechanisms are weakly group strategyproof, which requires that any subgroup of agents can not be made strictly better off by deviating. The pivotal and the reward based pivotal rules belong to the class of

One can make a comparison between subgroup additivity and converse consistency. Suppose that we want to assign utilities to each agent by solving 
                              
                                 s
                                 (
                                 <
                                 n
                                 )
                              
                           -agent problems instead of solving an 
                              
                                 n
                              
                           -agent problem. If a rule satisfies 
                              
                                 s
                              
                           -subgroup additivity, then each agent 
                              
                                 i
                              
                            will end up with the same utility whether an 
                              
                                 n
                              
                           -agent problem is solved or whether we take an appropriately weighted sum of all the utilities assigned to this 
                              
                                 i
                              
                           -th agent in all 
                              
                                 s
                              
                           -agent problems that includes him. As in the case of converse consistency, subgroup additivity provides a way of finding an allocation for the 
                              
                                 n
                              
                           -agent problem by focussing on problems with a smaller number of agents. However, the difference between converse consistency and subgroup additivity comes from the difference in the initial situation and in the nature of aggregation. For converse consistency we start with the 
                              
                                 n
                              
                           -agent problem and we look at the desirability of a feasible alternative simply by looking at the restriction on 
                              
                                 s
                              
                           -agent problem that results when all but these 
                              
                                 s
                              
                            agents have left with their components. This is different from subgroup additivity where the starting point is the 
                              
                                 s
                              
                           -agent problems and the weighted additivity aspect takes us to the 
                              
                                 n
                              
                           -agent problem.

We first investigate the relation between subgroup additivity axioms with different sizes of subgroups.

We introduce a weakening of strategyproofness by requiring that it is applied separately to agents with extreme costs. Strategyproofness for the highest cost agent requires that an increase in the highest waiting cost should not affect the utility of the agent with the highest cost. Strategyproofness for the lowest cost agent requires that a decrease in the lowest waiting cost should not affect his utility.

The minimal and the maximal transfer rules correspond to the Shapley values of appropriately defined coalitional games and these two rules satisfy 2-subgroup additivity and are not strategyproof. However, it is interesting to note that the minimal transfer rule does not give an agent with the highest waiting cost an incentive to misrepresent his true waiting cost and the maximal transfer rule does not give an agent with the lowest waiting cost an incentive to misrepresent his true waiting cost.

Next we ask whether it is possible to find rules that satisfy both 2-subgroup additivity along with strategyproofness or something stronger like weak group strategyproofness? If we are willing to sacrifice the requirement of budget balance the answer is yes. The pivotal rule

                      and the reward-based pivotal rule 
                        
                           
                              
                                 φ

                      are such examples. Moreover, these two rules can be characterized by replacing budget balance with exactly one of the two following axioms.

As shown in Chun, Mitra, and Mutuswami (2013), there is a restricted family of rules satisfying queue efficiency, egalitarian equivalence and strategyproofness. Moreover, none of these rules satisfy 2 or 3-subgroup additivity. For the characterization results of this section, we limit our requirement of egalitarian equivalence only to 2 person problems and obtain characterizations of

For our next result we use two stronger versions of egalitarian equivalence where, in the first version, the queue position in the reference bundle is fixed for all two agent problems and, in the second version, the queue position in the reference bundle is fixed for all two agent problems and it is also required that there exists at least one profile for the 2-agent problem for which the reference transfer is non-zero.

Of the five important rules only the symmetrically balanced VCG rule 
                        
                           
                              
                                 φ

                      fails to satisfy 2-subgroup additivity since it is defined for all problems with more than two agents. However, as shown in Proposition 3.5,

                      is 3-subgroup additive. In this section we provide two characterization results of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 φ
                              
                              
                                 G
                              
                           
                        
                     . The first characterization imposes a strategic axiom and the second an equity axiom.
                        Definition 6.1
                        A rule 
                              
                                 φ
                              
                            is strategyproof for extreme cost agents (E-SP) if it is both H-SP and L-SP.

Our second characterization of the symmetric balanced VCG rule uses the following axiom which requires that for each 3-agent problem, there is an agent indifferent to all three bundles. It is an equity requirement saying that the allocation should not favor one agent at the expense of another from the perspective of at least one agent.

                      in Theorem 6.3 it is obvious that given EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE and 3-subgroup additivity, the extreme cost strategyproofness axiom (E-SP) and the 3-positional equivalence axiom (3-PEq) are substitutes. Also, it is easy to show that in our Theorem 5.5 (E1), we can impose 2-positional equivalence instead of 2-EEf.

In this paper we have introduced subgroup additivity as the core axiom along with queue efficiency, equal treatment of equals and Pareto indifference to characterize five important rules from the queueing literature. These five rules were obtained and characterized in the queueing context from different normative and/or strategic considerations. This paper shows that these rules have a common type of subgroup additivity. Given subgroup additivity of these rules, the characterizations become simpler since what matters now is the set of axioms only on 2 agent or 3 agent problems. What our analysis shows is that in such a scenario strategic axioms (like weaker versions of strategyproofness) and equity axioms (like stronger versions of egalitarian equivalence) can act as substitutes. It must be noted that if we try to identify allocation rules that satisfy EFF, SP and EE, then we do get a non-empty class of allocation rules (see Theorem 3.2 in Chun et al. (2013)). However, none of the five important allocation rules characterized in this paper is included in this non-empty class of allocation rules satisfying EFF, SP and EE. Therefore, for substitutability between strategic and equity axioms, sub-group additivity at the two and three player level plays a significant role.
