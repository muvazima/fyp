                  In this paper, we present a new statistical pattern recognition method for classifying cytotoxic cellular responses to toxic agents. The advantage of the proposed method is to quickly assess the toxicity level of an unclassified toxic agent on human health by bringing cytotoxic cellular responses with similar patterns (mode of action, MoOA) into the same class. The proposed method is a model-based hierarchical classification approach incorporating principal component analysis (PCA) and functional data analysis (FDA). The cytotoxic cell responses are represented by multi-concentration time-dependent cellular response profiles (TCRPs) which are dynamically recorded by using the xCELLigence real-time cell analysis high-throughput (RTCA HT) system. The classification results obtained using our algorithm show satisfactory discrimination and are validated using biological facts by examining common chemical mechanisms of actions with treatment on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The development of methods for quick, efficient, and accurate cytotoxicity screening has been motivated by the continually increasing number of chemical compounds produced by industrial processes which impose serious consequences on human health and environment. Many chemicals may cause diverse changes in cellular morphology and growth rate if they are presented with sufficient concentration levels. Some may cause toxic effects to cells such as apoptosis and necrosis (Raffray and Gerald, 1997) while others may induce uncontrolled cellular proliferation (Butterworth et al., 1992). In the past, several methods have been used to assess the toxicity of chemicals (Pan et al., 2013a). One common method is the use of in vivo assays. In vivo assays investigate the toxic effects of chemicals on living organisms and explain detailed mechanistic understanding of the molecular targets (Houck and Kavlock, 2008). However, performing in vivo assays is time consuming and expensive, and usually requires a large number of samples to be observed. Furthermore, biological contamination and the ethics of causing distress and pain on living organisms are potential concerns (Institute for Laboratory Animal, 1999).

As an alternative to in vivo assays to effectively screen chemicals, cell-based in vitro assays play an integral role in today's drug discovery (Hosseinkhani et al., 2006). They have become a key component of research fields such as chemical screening, and safety assessment (Przyborski, 2011) and are now compatibly adopted for automated high-throughput screening (HTS) of large chemical libraries, providing in situ analysis for a variety of biological targets due to the use of multi-well plates (González et al., 1999; Silverman et al., 1998). Quantitative high-throughput assays have become a crucial and effective tool in drug discovery and development, because they can be used for the existing chemicals and even be expanded to cover new chemicals that need to be evaluated for human health risk assessment (National Research Council, 2007). The main advantages of bio-activity profiling using high-throughput assays are to reduce the cost and time required for toxicological screening of environmental chemicals and the need for animal testing (Judson et al., 2008).

For some current multi-dimensional phenotypic profiling approaches, such as gene expression profiling and cell line cytotoxicity-based profiling, only a single time point is usually chosen to assess the toxicity of chemicals. Therefore, the results are based upon the time instant at which samples are processed. Consequently, other activities that may exist outside the selected time instant may be neglected. As a crucial factor in cell-based kinetic profiling approaches, time plays a key role in assessing chemical activities because it is related to the modulation of the target by the chemical or consequent manifestation of the cellular response (Abassi et al., 2009).

The xCELLigence real-time cell analysis high-throughput (RTCA HT) system is used as a non-invasive and effective tool to perform long-term cytotoxicity assays. It generates multi-concentration time-dependent cellular response profiles (TCRPs) that provide an interpretation of dynamic cytotoxicity effects of toxicants on cells (Hartigan and Downey, 2010; Abassi et al., 2009; Limame et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2005). Compared with conventional endpoint cell-based assays, the real-time and continuously monitoring system allows label-free assessment of cell responses, such as cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and death, and further allows for the calculation of time-dependent physiological values. It can give more information than single-value endpoints of classical toxicity testing such as the XTT-based viability assays (Öztürk et al., 2011). This system has been used in cytotoxicity assessment (Pan et al., 2013a), analysis of cell invasion and migration (Bird and Kirstein, 2009), etc.

The TCRPs reflect series of physiological events such as changes in cell population, cell morphology, and cellular functions that characterize an adverse biological response. These series of physiological events are referred to as mode of action (MoOA) (Escher and Hermens, 2002; Nowicki and Scatton, 2008; Gies and Landry, 2008). As the patterns of TCRPs indicate physiological responses of the living cells to given toxic chemicals and reveal key biochemical events at the cellular level which characterize MoOA, TCRPs can be considered as a novel means in the classification and discovery of chemicals (Xing et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2009).

Supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms (clustering analysis) have been studied for many years in statistics and widely applied in many areas. By being separated into densely populated regions termed as clusters, a multi-dimensional dataset is decomposed into smaller components (Chen et al., 1996). There are extensive applications of clustering in the fields related to biology including DNA microarray data analysis (Tibshirani et al., 1999; Brown et al., 2000), protein–protein interaction (Brohee and van Helden, 2006), clustering of biological networks (Fung et al., 2011), etc. In these applications, each object (e.g., gene, protein) to be classified is represented by a time series as a datum in the classification. To the best of our knowledge, the clustering problems of chemicals represented by time-dependent cellular response profiles are not fully explored. In this study, each object (i.e., chemical) to be classified is represented by a group of time series as a datum. At the same time, the number of time series is different from an object to another. Specifically, due to the design of the experiments using xCELLigence RTCA HT system, multiple concentrations are tested in order to fully elucidate cellular behaviors to different chemicals and further the information about Mode of Action. The data through the novel experiments are multi-dimensional. Because some of TCRPs for chemicals do not indicate distinguishable cellular responses with respect to the control line profiles, to effectively classify chemicals into clusters where chemicals with similar TCRP patterns are grouped together, a TCRP selection procedure is used to screen out profiles close to control profiles. Different numbers of profiles are retained for different chemicals after the selection. Traditional clustering algorithms cannot address this complicated case because those methods are used to classify data points represented by a sole time series. However, in our case, not only are there multiple time series representing each data point, but also the number of retained TCRPs for the data point varies after the selection. The proposed algorithm in this paper addresses this particular complexity in the problem.

In this paper, to utilize the dynamic response of cells following exposure to chemicals and further classify chemicals based on profile similarity, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) were treated in vitro with 65 chemicals, with 11 levels of concentration each and monitored over 75h continuously. A large information-rich dataset of TCRPs is then collected and treated with a 4-step data preprocessing method to remove disturbance from the experiments and generate informative data with better quality. Afterwards, a systematic model-based hierarchical classification approach incorporating principal component analysis (PCA) and functional data analysis (FDA) for feature extraction is proposed to classify chemicals into groups based on the similarity of the patterns of TCRPs. The advantage of the proposed method is to quickly assess the toxicity level of an unclassified toxic agent on human health. The classification results obtained using our proposed method are validated using biological facts by examining common biological processes known as mechanism of action (MeOA) explained in the discussion section. By this validation, we can consider that TCRPs can be used to classify and interpret Mode of Action of chemicals.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) (Order # HB-8065, Cat # 30-2003) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in an incubator with a set temperature at 37°C, with 95% relative humidity and a CO2 level of 5%.

Stock solutions of 65 chemicals obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) were prepared using water (H2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or ethanol (EtOH) separately. Solutions were diluted into eleven working concentrations in a serial ratio 1:3. Information about chemicals including their solutions and concentration ranges is provided in Table 1
                        .

The experiments of chemical assays were performed using the xCELLigence RTCA HT system with HepG2 cell line exposed to the 65 chemicals. The principles behind RTCA HT system are described by Abassi et al. (2009), Slanina et al. (2011), and Xing et al. (2005). Briefly, all the cells were grown in the E-plates initially for 24h and treated with chemicals in 11 concentrations afterwards. Additionally, 75h were used to monitor and record the cellular responses to the chemicals. In order to achieve robust and reliable data, each experiment for each chemical was repeated 4 times. The median time series of all replicated experiments were selected as the representative one (Pan et al., 2013b).

As the collected raw data contain noise that may possibly affect the classification results, a 4-step data preprocessing method is presented to generate informative data with better quality as follows:


                     Step 1: Calculation of normalized cell index To reduce the variational effects from inter-experiments and compare the assays in the same baseline, the TCRPs are normalized by dividing cell index (CI) at each time instant by CI(0) which is the cell index at the exposure time. Only the initial 72h are taken into consideration (Pan et al., 2013b). Therefore, normalized cell index (NCI) equals to 1 at the exposure time point.


                     Step 2: Denoising technique Before using the collected data in the proposed classification approach, a denoising technique is necessary in order to cope with noise and outliers that may disturb and affect further analysis. We employed a denoising algorithm introduced by Pan et al. (2013b) to detect and interpolate the abnormal “velocity of cell population change” termed as ΔNCI.


                     Step 3: Calculation of relative normalized cell index After denoising the TCRPs, in order to reduce the impact induced by different batches of experiments and to distinguish the TCRP patterns of chemicals from the control lines, the relative NCI (termed as RNCI) is calculated by dividing NCI of the chemical compound (termed as NCI

                     Step 4: Eligible TCRP selection An eligible TCRP is a cellular response to a specific concentration of a toxicant that indicates distinguishable toxicity effect with a clearly different shape from the TCRP of the control which is a toxic-free cellular response. We measure this “distinguishability” of a TCRP from the TCRP of the control (a unity line in the normalized frame) by a screening index which is expressed as

A chemical will be excluded from being used in our proposed classification if at most two TCRPs are selected as eligible TCRPs. In this case, we consider the chemical illegible and without meaningful patterns, possibly because of experimental disturbance or design. For this reason, the inclusion of such chemicals may be misleading. In our classification method we categorize the illegible chemicals into “unclassified group”.

After ineligible TCRPs and chemicals are excluded, each retained chemical is then represented by different numbers of eligible TCRPs which are formulated as columns in its RNCI matrix X
                     (j) where j
                     =1, …, N is the serial number of chemicals; N is the number of eligible chemicals. The number of columns of X
                     (j) is different from one chemical to another.

Several clustering algorithms such as K-means, self-organizing map have been well-studied and applied in unsupervised classification of time series data or functional data in various applications. The functional data ranges from time-course gene expression data in biomedical application to geostatistical data in an engineering application (Romano and Verde, 2012; Warren Liao, 2005; Ma et al., 2006; Tarpey and Kinateder, 2003). In these cases, each functional data point is represented with one feature vector which is subsequently used in above mentioned clustering algorithms. In this paper, chemicals are represented by several TCRPs viewed as functional data. There are two main challenges involved in the classification problem of chemicals based on TCRPs. First, each chemical is represented by several TCRPs corresponding to various concentrations. That is, we have a multi-dimensional functional data as opposed to one-dimensional functional data generally discussed in the literature. Further, after data preprocessing, the ineligible TCRPs are screened out for each chemical. Thus, each chemical is now represented by different number of TCRPs, making the clustering problem more challenging.

A two step feature extraction procedure is now explained which addresses both the challenges encountered in the present application. In this first step, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to compress the information in the RNCI matrix X
                     (j) into principal component (PC) space. By selecting the first PC score for 
                        
                           
                              {
                              
                                 X
                                 
                                    (
                                    j
                                    )
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                           
                              j
                              =
                              1
                           
                           N
                        
                     , the information in each chemical is compressed into a one dimensional PC space. That is, each chemical can now be represented as a vector s
                     (j) of length K where K is the number of sampling instants. In the second step of feature extraction, functional data analysis (FDA) is used to represent the data points s
                     (j) with feature vectors of length smaller than K. Here, each PC score s
                     (j) is represented as a linear combination of B-spline basis functions. The advantage of this two step feature extraction strategy is that each chemical is now represented by a feature vector (with fewer entries than K) capturing the characteristics of the original TCRPs. Finally, an agglomerative model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to the obtained feature vectors. The agglomerative model based hierarchical clustering is an iterative clustering procedure in which clusters are merged based on the maximization of likelihood function at each iteration. Each of these steps is now explained in brief below. Fig. 3
                      illustrates briefly how this approach realizes the classification of chemicals.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to reduce dimension by extracting the essential data patterns out of a set of correlated variables using orthogonal transformation (Wold et al., 1987). This technique can retain the dominant patterns of the original data with a fewer number of latent variables. The projected variables, termed as principal components, construct a new coordinate system in a way that the largest variance is determined by the first principal component, the second largest variance on the second principal component, and so on. The coordinate values in the new system, termed as principal component scores, are used to represent the projected data and can reflect the similarity among the data points. Therefore, the main advantages of PCA lie in the simpler description of the data covariance structure and the smaller dimension of data points (Nomikos and MacGregor, 1994).

After excluding ineligible TCRPs (see step 4 in Section 2), each chemical is represented by different number of eligible TCRPs. This makes the comparison (based on similarity of TCRPs) among the chemicals difficult.

                        , is extracted as the synthesized information from each RNCI matrix. The extracted PC score captures the major profile tendency from the original TCRPs for each eligible chemical. Thus, each chemical is consistently represented by its first PC score. All the chemicals with different numbers of TCRPs are able to be compared uniformly.

Functional data analysis (FDA) is a statistical means to interpret data from a functional perspective. Instead of treating observed values at sampling instants as the units of data in traditional statistical methods, functions are considered as the data units in FDA (Song et al., 2007). As a way to reduce the dimensionality of data, FDA can describe the tendency of profiles with fewer parameters while retaining much information about the curve shape. This technique has been applied in many areas such as modeling of gene expression data (Song et al., 2007), life course data in criminology (Ramsay and Silverman, 2002), etc. The significance of FDA in analyzing time-dependent cellular responses lies in two main aspects: to reduce the dimension of time series data after applying PCA and to make full use of the information in the slopes and curvatures of curves (Ramsay et al., 2009).

As piecewise cubic polynomials are able to approximate the characteristics of a curve with satisfactory performance, they are usually chosen to construct the basis functions.

The smoothness of fit can be better controlled by attaching an additional term to the regression objective function. The value of the smoothing parameter λ determines the degree of smoothness (Ramsay et al., 2009). In our study, the value of λ is suggested as 10.

The significance of FDA lies in smoothing curves and further removing noise from the measurements. Meanwhile, as long as basis functions are given, data can be expressed with fewer coefficients (Ramsay et al., 2009; Coffey and Hinde, 2011).

                         is input to an agglomerative model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm developed via Gaussian finite mixture models and the MCLUST algorithm by Fraley and Raftery (2002). The algorithm is aimed to build the hierarchical relationships among the columns of the feature matrix, i.e., feature vectors. From the situation where each feature vector is in its own cluster, the feature vectors are iteratively combined until all of them are connected altogether. Different from the traditional hierarchical clustering methods which merge two closest branches using some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, City Block distance, Mahalanobis distance), the agglomerative model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm merges branches such that a likelihood function is maximized at each iteration given a model structure (Martinez and Martinez, 2004).

As a separate function in Model-based Clustering Toolbox in MATLAB® (R2011b, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) developed by A. Martinez and W. Martinez, “agmbclust” is used to achieve the agglomerative model-based clustering of the feature matrix for convenience purposes.

@&#RESULTS@&#

By synthesizing the PCA and FDA based feature extraction and the model-based hierarchical clustering approach, this section will illustrate the pattern recognition application on data denoted by different numbers of TCRPs and show its efficiency. As shown in previous sections, chemical cellular response profiles contain multi-concentration data plotted with time as the x-axis and RNCI as the y-axis. Eleven concentrations were tested in order to fully elucidate Modes of Action for chemicals. However, as we have mentioned, excluding the ineligible TCRPs leads to the difference in TCRPs number for each individual chemical. This difference makes shape similarity based classification difficult. Therefore, PCA is used to unify and format the data by extracting out the first PC score. FDA is then aimed to indicate the extracted PC score with fewer coefficients and remove the noise simultaneously. The model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm merges clusters with the maximum likelihood at each iteration to cluster the feature matrix.

Specifically, to perform PCA with standardized variables based on correlation, a normalization is applied to the RNCI data matrix. Columns of each X
                        (j) are normalized. The normalized matrix is input into PCA to generate the PC scores. FDA is then applied to the PC scores using the basis functions to calculate the coefficients. In our study, sixteen cubic spline functions are used to construct the basis functions. The coefficient feature vector for each chemical is therefore a 16-by-1 vector. Similarly, the data matrices associated with the eligible chemicals are formulated in the same way. The feature matrix is generated for model-based hierarchical clustering.

A dendrogram is generated for users to analyze after the feature matrix is input into the model-based hierarchical clustering algorithm. One challenging problem is the determination of the cluster number using the dendrogram. Although hierarchical connection in hierarchical clustering can avoid this problem, there is no indication about the relationship among groups in parallel.

A two-level hierarchical dendrogram cutting strategy is utilized to deconstruct the hierarchy among chemicals. This strategy is based on users’ interpretation and requirement as well as distinguished hierarchical heights among levels. The two-level hierarchical dendrogram cutting strategy can avoid the situation where the dendrogram is cut uniformly at a height without considering the local connection of chemicals under each branch. In our study, the cluster number is identified such that the discrimination of chemicals is reasonable according to shape similarity.

The hierarchical dendrogram cutting uses partial information of the feature vectors at different levels to classify chemicals. In the first level, the coefficients of the first PC scores with respect to the slopes of TCRPs are used; in the second level, the coefficients of the first PC scores with respect to TCRPs are used. Slopes of TCRPs indicate the variational degree of cellular changes while TCRPs reflect the actual values of cell indices. These two measurements are combined to depict the shapes of TCRPs more comprehensively in order to guarantee better classification results.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the dendrogram of chemicals generated via the classification approach based on coefficients of the first PC scores that reflect ΔRNCI. Three subtrees are marked in different colors. The slope, ΔRNCI, is an important indicator to reflect the degree of profile changes in patterns of TCRPs. It measures the variation of RNCI within each time interval. The coefficients of the first PC scores on slopes of TCRPs then reflect the main variation of curve trends among all eligible TCRPs and can effectively discriminate chemicals with apparent changes in the slope.

Chemicals in each subtree which is generated previously are clustered again using our classification algorithm by considering the coefficients of the first PC scores that reflect RNCI values. The information about RNCI values is used to discriminate chemicals further. Fig. 5
                         shows the clustering results by cutting the dendrogram of subtree 1. The dendrogram is cut off at the location where the variation in height between two adjacent levels of nodes is distinctive and the number of generated clusters is not large. Other dendrograms at the second level are cut at proper heights similarly. Figs. 6 and 7
                        
                         show the dendrograms of chemicals marked in color under other subtrees at the second level of hierarchical dendrogram cutting.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, the obtained classification results are validated using biological facts. The target class labels for the selected 65 chemicals used in experimentation are taken from GRAC-based classification (Alexander et al., 2011). These targets refer to the molecular structures that produce effects upon going through a particular interaction with chemicals. A chemical's mechanism of action (MeOA) refers to both the static target as well as the dynamic chemical-target interactions that are observed in living organisms (Imming, 2008). These interactions at the molecular level lead to changes in the cell numbers, cell morphology, and cellular function, followed by alteration of a physiological function at the tissue and organ levels (Nowicki and Scatton, 2008; Gies and Landry, 2008). The characteristic set of physiological and behavioral responses resulting from chemical-target action that describes an adverse biological response is known as a chemical's mode of action (MoOA) (Escher and Hermens, 2002). For this work, MoOA is defined as the observable behavior of chemical compounds at the cellular level.

The main objective of this work is to examine a pattern recognition strategy that enables the use of TCRPs to assess the toxicity of chemical compounds. The feasibility of the proposed method relies on the concept that chemicals with similar MoOA display similar patterns as indicated by TCRPs. Classification based on multi-concentration TCRPs captures the dynamics of cellular changes over time and considers the factor of concentration in assessing the toxicity. PCA and FDA based hierarchical classification approach can handle classification of chemicals represented by different numbers of TCRPs and generate reasonably homogeneous clusters.

To ensure reasonable classification results, some parameters are advised to be tuned properly. The δ value in Eq. (2) determines the number of TCRPs for the classification algorithm. The larger δ is, the smaller the number of eligible TCRPs is. To guarantee an adequate number of TCRPs for pattern recognition and reasonable features, the variation of negative control is suggested as reference. Coefficient of variation (CV, %) is used to measure the inter/intra-plate reproducibility of the experiments. As calculated, the CVs of all intra-Plates are less than 17.9%; the δ value should be greater than the maximum CV of negative control. Therefore, δ
                     =0.2 is suggested.

In FDA, the smoothing parameter λ determines the smoothness of curves. The larger λ is, the less complex the fitted function is. In other words, a larger λ constrains the order of the fitted function not to be too high. If λ approaches infinity, the functional form x will approach approximately a linear function structure. On the contrary, as λ approaches zero, the functional complexity is not constrained. x can be rough as s and it will pass the data points exactly. Based the property of the roughness parameter, λ is chosen to be 10 to make the curve smooth and informative in shape simultaneously.

In principle, the observable mode of action should be directly proportional to the mechanism of action; however, this is not the case as adaptive detoxification and cellular defense mechanisms often lead to disproportionality between the mode and mechanism of action (Escher et al., 2011). Nonetheless, this implies that, if the proposed method correctly separates chemicals into different MoOA, some common MeOA should be seen among chemicals grouped together. Based on this concept, the MeOA was used to justify the algorithm.

To justify the degree of matching between the results of the proposed classification approach and mechanisms of action for chemicals, the dataset composed by those eligible chemicals is divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset has 25 chemicals and the testing dataset has 22 chemicals. The classification results of the proposed approach on the training data are listed in Table 2
                      without highlight. The testing data used for justification are highlighted in Table 2. Testing data are selected such that they represent GRAC target labels to the maximum extent and are not biased towards specific target labels. The complement, termed as training data, is used to build the classification model. The model is then applied to group the testing data. Specifically, the proposed approach takes the testing data as input. Their feature vectors are then associated with clusters of the training data by the minimization of L
                     1 distance. Thus, the testing data are absorbed as new members in the existing clusters that were trained from the training data. Mechanisms of action for chemicals are then analyzed for commonalities among chemicals grouped together (including both training and testing chemicals) to examine the rate of matching which is defined as follows:
                        
                           (6)

                              ×

                     where N
                     
                        c
                      is the number of testing chemicals which are correctly classified. Here, the criteria for correctly classified chemicals are listed as follows: (1) TCRPs of testing chemicals are similar to TCRPs of training chemicals within the corresponding cluster; (2) the MeOA of testing chemicals are common with those of training chemicals within the corresponding cluster. N
                     
                        t
                      is the overall number of testing chemicals.


                     Table 2 shows the MoOA classification results for 65 chemical compounds. The target activity column lists key words that describe each chemical's mechanism(s) of action. Training chemicals were considered as mechanistic discrepancies if their target activity did not match the target activity of any other training chemical within the cluster. Testing chemicals were identified as mechanistic discrepancies if their target activity did not match the overall target activity represented by the training chemicals within the cluster. From the results, a 90.9% match of molecular mechanisms was observed. This means that most of the testing chemicals were found to have MeOA matched to the MeOA of training data within the corresponding cluster. A review of the target activities proves this to be the case as one or more MeOA key words are common among individual clusters and shared between training and testing chemicals. Of the testing data, only two chemicals were grouped into clusters in which they do not share a MeOA with the training chemicals. In cluster 1, Valproic acid is considered a mechanistic discrepancy due to its target activity affecting ions and DNA/RNA which clearly does not match the target activities of the training chemicals Cytochalasin D, Cytochalasin B, FAK Inhibitor 14, and HA1100 hydrochloride which all affect actin. The chemical Exo 1 in cluster 6 is also treated as another mechanistic discrepancy in the sense that it is the only chemical in the cluster that does not affect DNA/RNA.

The classification results in Table 2 show that chemicals with different MeOA are classified into the same MoOA and that chemicals with similar MeOA are grouped into various different MoOA. Cluster 4 in particular contains a large group of chemicals that have DNA/RNA as their target activity and another group of chemicals that affect ions. This is consistent with the concept that a MoOA can be described by one or more MeOA (Escher and Hermens, 2002). Recall that the MoOA, as we have defined it, refers to the adverse biological response to a chemical at the cellular level and that the MeOA refers to the chemical-target interaction at the molecular level (Escher and Hermens, 2002; Imming, 2008). Thus, cells may respond with similar adaptive detoxification or defense mechanisms to different chemical targets (different MeOA) resulting in similar observed responses (Escher and Hermens, 2002; Escher et al., 2011). When analyzing the results for multiple clusters, it is also observed that chemicals with the same GRAC label, implying similar MeOA, are classified into different clusters. This observation can be explained by the following: Although the term MeOA includes the dynamics of chemical-target interaction, current models of these dynamics are only speculative (Imming, 2008); differences in the dynamics of chemical MeOA may cause variation in the observed MoOA.

Based on these results, PCA and FDA hierarchical classification can be used to screen chemical compounds with unknown properties and classify them accordingly based on similarity of cellular response.

The ultimate goals of this research is outlined in “Toxicology Testing in the 21st Century”; these goals include prioritizing substances for further comprehensive toxicological evaluation, identifying MoOA for further analysis, and developing predictive models for in vivo biological responses (National Research Council, 2007). Although these goals are clearly stated, several challenges have created difficulty in achieving them at a practical level. One challenge is that high-dimensional biological and chemical data lack conceptual frameworks to handle it. Another challenge is the collection of high-dimensional data from a large number of chemicals tested on the same culture environment is often very expensive. Using practical statistical methods based on multi-concentration TCRPs, this work presents noticeable progress on MoOA identification with a HTS system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, a PCA and FDA based hierarchical classification method was developed and implemented on TCRPs of chemicals which were measured by the xCELLigence RTCA HT system in in vitro assays. Experiments in which HepG2 cells were exposed to 65 chemicals with 11 concentrations each were used for the proposed classification method. By using biological facts, it was concluded that the designed classifier was able to distinguish chemicals based on the similarity of TCRPs and had the potential in classifying chemicals by their behavior at the cellular level.
