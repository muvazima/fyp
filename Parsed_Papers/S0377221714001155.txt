                  Numerical preference relations (NPRs) consisting of numerical judgments can be considered as a general form of the existing preference relations, such as multiplicative preference relations (MPRs), fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), interval MPRs (IV-MPRs) and interval FPRs (IV-FPRs). On the basis of NPRs, we develop a stochastic preference analysis (SPA) method to aid the decision makers (DMs) in decision making. The numerical judgments in NPRs can also be characterized by different probability distributions in accordance with practice. By exploring the judgment space of NPRs, SPA produces several outcomes including the rank acceptability index, the expected priority vector, the expected rank and the confidence factor. The outcomes are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation with at least 95% confidence degree. Based on the outcomes, the DMs can choose some of them which they find most useful to make reliable decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In decision making, preference relations are used to collect the preferences provided by decision makers (DMs). Then by prioritization methods, priorities can be obtained to rank the compared objectives in the preference relations. If input data in a preference relation are numerical values, then we can call it a numerical preference relation (NPR). NPRs have wide applications in multi-criteria decision making (Büyüközkan & Çifçi, 2011; Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 1998; Ho, Xu, & Dey, 2010; Saaty, 2008; Vaidya & Kumar, 2006; Zhu & Xu, 2014), where multiplicative preference relations (MPRs) (Saaty, 1980) and fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) (Orlovsky, 1978) are two basic ones.

Based on a 1–9 scale, the DMs provide deterministic point estimates as judgments to represent their preferences over paired comparisons of objectives to construct MPRs. Based on a 0.1–0.9 scale, FPRs can be constructed in a similar way. When considering uncertainties, many other possible representations of judgments can be used according to practice, such as intervals and random variables. To analyze the representations of judgments in multi-criteria decision making methods, Hahn (2003) gave systematic investigations shown in Fig. 1
                     . With respect to the typology in Fig. 1, Type A and Type B indicate that errors in judgments are assumed to be nonexistent. When judgments are made with some degrees of error, they can be represented by intervals as in Type C. In Type D, the judgments are considered as a realization of stochastic phenomena.

With respect to NPRs, Types A and B correspond with FPRs and MPRs, respectively. Type C corresponds with interval MPRs (IV-MPRs) (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and interval FPRs (IV-FPRs) (Xu, 2004b). It is clear that MPRs and FPRs are two special cases of IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs respectively. If some judgment(s) in NPRs are indicated by stochastic variable(s), then the NPRs are with probability interpretations.

The prioritization methods for NPRs in Types A, B and C are deterministic procedures, but Type D is with stochastic procedures. Hahn (2003) argued that the prioritization methods with deterministic procedures are special cases of their stochastic counterparts. So the stochastic methods represent a generalization of the deterministic ones. Many valuable prioritization methods with deterministic procedures have been developed, such as the classic eigenvector method (Saaty, 1977), the goal programming methods (Choo & Wedley, 2004; Fan, Ma, Jiang, Sun, & Ma, 2006; Xu, 2004a; Xu & Chen, 2008), the least deviation method (Xu & Da, 2005), the chi-square method (Wang, Fan, & Hua, 2007), the least-square method (Gong, 2008) and the fuzzy linear programming method (Zhu & Xu, 2014).

For the prioritization methods using stochastic procedures associated with stochastic variables that indicate judgments in Type D, Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996), Rosenbloom (1997), Levary and Wan (1998, 1999), and Banuelas and Antony (2006) developed some simulation methods based on MPRs in analytical hierarchy process, where probability distributions are used to describe the judgments.

From the discussion above, we find that the prioritization methods for NPRs depend on the representations of judgments. However, considering the common characteristic of NPRs that consist of numerical judgments, is there a general prioritization method? In this paper, we develop stochastic preference analysis (SPA) as a new prioritization method for NPRs from a stochastic point of view, where the NPRs can be with different representations of numerical judgments. The results produced by this method are with probability interpretations. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic concepts, then develops the concept of NPRs. In Section 3, we develop SPA. Section 4 gives two numerical examples. Section 5 provides a necessary discussion. The paper ends with some conclusions in Section 6.

In this section, we introduce the basic forms of numerical preference relations (NPRs), that are multiplicative preference relations (MPRs) and fuzzy preference relations (FPRs). Some consistency measures are also introduced, which are used to develop stochastic preference analysis (SPA) in the next section.

Using numerical values to represent judgments, NPRs encompass MPRs, FPRs, IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs as special cases. We give a definition as follows.
                        Definition 5
                        A NPR on X is represented by Z
                           ∊
                           X
                           ×
                           X, Z
                           =(zij
                           )
                              n
                           
                           ×
                           
                              n
                           , where zij
                            indicates the degree(s) that xi
                            is preferred to xj
                            in the form of numerical value(s), such as a single numerical value, an interval numerical value, or several possible numerical values.

Generally, for one NPR, the numerical values should be given based on the same scale, such as the 1–9 scale associated with MPRs or the 0.1–0.9 scale associated with FPRs. So NPRs can be MPRs, FPRs, IV-MPRs or IV-FPRs etc., which are also the preference relations we take into account in this paper. Moreover, hesitant fuzzy preference relations (Zhu & Xu, 2013) and hesitant multiplicative preference relations (Xia & Xu, 2013) are also special cases of NPRs.

SPA is a decision support method to aid the decision makers (DMs) to make informed decisions. It is motivated by a stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) method, originally introduced by Lahdelma, Hokkanen, & Salminen, 1998. SMAA is a family of methods for supporting multi-criteria decision making problems, including SMAA-2 (Lahdelma & Salminen, 2001), SMAA-O (Lahdelma, Miettinen, & Salminen, 2003), etc. SPA is developed by analyzing the judgment space of NPRs. It is carried out by Monte Carlo simulation which can guarantee reliable results for a large enough number of iterations. By a step by step procedure, SPA provides constructive suggestions for the DMs.

Since MPRs and FPRs are special cases of IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs respectively when uncertainties among the judgments tend to zero, we set a NPR as

                        ={ζij

                        . To begin with SPA, it is required to derive priorities from ζ by a prioritization method associated with MPRs or FPRs. For example, as mentioned in Introduction, we can refer to the classic eigenvector method, the goal programming methods, the least deviation method, the chi-square method, the least-square method and the fuzzy linear programming method.

Among these prioritization methods, the goal programming methods are convenient to be used in practice, which can directly produce results by solving mathematic models based on consistency measures (Aull-Hyde, Erdogan, & Duke, 2006; Grošelj & Stirn, 2012; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012; Tanino, 1984, 1988; Xu, Driessen, Sun, & Su, 2012). Therefore, we develop a general goal programming model in this paper, that is to calculate consistency discrepancy based on one of the consistency measures shown in Eqs. (1)–(3).

NPRs can be IV-MPRs or IV-FPRs, the judgments in NPRs can be discrete or continuous. For illustration, we now give two examples with respect to an IV-FPR, where the judgments are continuous, and an IV-MPR, where the judgments are discrete.
                        Example 1
                        Considering a decision making problem involving five alternatives {x
                           1,
                           x

                           x
                           5} for comparison, we assume a set of expected values, denoted by

It is helpful to graphically examine the rank acceptability indices which indicate the acceptable probabilities of the alternatives for each rank by a three dimensional column chart shown in Fig. 3
                     . If the expected ranks of the alternatives receive relative high confidence degrees, the expected ranks should be reliable. Particularly, x
                     5 is the best alternative with 100% confidence degree in this example.

                      are assumed to be the integers or reciprocals of the integers between the two bounds of each interval following the uniform distribution. For example, there are seven components in the interval [1/3,5] as 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, where these values are with the same probability 1/7. Let Eq. (1) be the consistency measure, the outcomes of SPA are shown in Table 2
                     .

By a three dimensional column chart, the rank acceptable probabilities of the five alternatives for each rank are depicted in Fig. 4
                     .

With respect to the rank acceptability indices, it is clear that x
                     1 receives high acceptable probability of ranking the first; but x
                     2 and x
                     3 receive approximate acceptable probabilities for the ranks 2 and 3; x
                     4 and x
                     5 receive approximate acceptable probabilities for the ranks 4 and 5. So x
                     2 and x
                     3 compete for the ranks of two and three, and x
                     4 and x
                     5 compete for the ranks of four and five. According to the expected ranks and the confidence factors, we can also find that the expected rank of x
                     1 with the confidence degree 98.38% can be considered as reliable. But other alternatives receive relative low confidence degrees for the expected ranks.

The outcomes in Table 2 are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. To better understand this simulation process, we depict 10,000 simulation results of priorities and mark the expected priorities shown in Fig. 5
                     .

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

SPA can deal with NPRs which allow different representations of numerical judgments. For example, in fuzzy theory, different representations of fuzzy numbers can be used to represent the judgments, where the fuzzy numbers can be based on Type-2 fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1975), fuzzy multisets (Yager, 1986), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Atanassov, 1986), or dual hesitant fuzzy sets (Zhu, Xu, & Xia, 2012), etc. As a common tool, NPRs can be used to collect these fuzzy numbers. Then SPA can be applied to the NPRs. Moreover, the values of judgments in NPRs can be characterized by different probability distributions, such as discrete, continuous, uniform or normal distributions. When required in practice, more possible distributions can be used to sincerely reflect actual situations.

Another advantage of SPA is its adaptive characteristic, that is to be combined with different prioritization methods. To begin with SPA with respect to a NPR, it requires to stochastically get a preference relation (a FPR or a MPR) from the NPR, and then utilizes a prioritization method to derive priorities from the preference relation. All the related existing prioritization methods associated with the preference relation can be combined with SPA. In this paper, we develop a goal programming model to deal with the stochastically obtained preference relation due to its simplicity in computation.

SPA is performed by Monte Carlo simulation which can be easily accomplished in the Matlab environment. Similar to the results of stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (Tervonen & Lahdelma, 2007), the values of outcomes of SPA can be concluded to be normally distributed by the limit theorem if the numbers of iterations are large enough. Since the accuracy of the outcomes of SPA all depend on the total number of Monte Carlo iterations, to achieve accuracy d with

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have defined a concept of numerical preference relations (NPRs) which encompass all the existing preference relations consisting of numerical judgments as special cases, then have developed stochastic preference analysis (SPA) as a new prioritization method to deal with NPRs. The values of numerical judgments in NPRs can be characterized by different probability distributions according to actual situations, such as discrete, continuous, uniform and normal distributions. By exploring the judgment space of NPRs, SPA produces several outcomes, including the rank acceptable index, the expected priority vector, the expected rank and the confidence factor, to aid the decision makers to make better decisions. Particularly, by a visible three dimensional column chart, all the acceptable probabilities of the objectives in NPRs for each rank can be clearly described. And the competitive objectives that share some similar ranks with approximate acceptable probabilities can also be clearly identified. The further research for SPA can concentrate on the analysis of the outcomes to produce new valuable results.
