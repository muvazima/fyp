                  In this paper, we consider a two-state (up and down) network consisting of n links. We study the D-spectrum based dynamic reliability of the network under the assumption that the links are subject to failure according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Several mixture representations are provided for the reliability function of residual lifetime of used networks, under different conditions on the status of the network or its links. These representations enable us to explore the residual reliability of operating networks in terms of the reliability functions of residual lifetimes of upper record values. The distribution function of inactivity time of a network is examined under the condition that the network has failed by inspection time t. Stochastic ordering properties of the residual lifetimes of networks under conditional D-spectra are investigated. Several examples and graphs are also provided to illustrate the established results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Communication networks play an important role in communication theory, and so their reliability analysis is of great interest. A network is a collection of nodes and links in which some particular nodes in the network are called terminals. As examples of nodes, one can think of rail stations, road intersections, telecommunication centers, etc.; similarly, as examples of links, one can think of rail ways, communication channels, connections between the components of a system, etc. A network model can be considered as a triplet

                      is the set of all terminals. The network is said to be T-connected if all the terminals are connected to each other. In the reliability viewpoint, the links (or nodes) are subject to failure which may occur according to a stochastic mechanism. Failure of the links (or nodes) may change the state of the network. The states of a network are defined based on whether there are connections between the terminals or not. Two terminals are said to be connected if there is a set of links connecting them.

In many situations, the networks involve multi-states. However, in what follows, we assume that the network has only two states, viz., up and down, and assume that the links are subject to failure. If the failure of a single component (link or node) either does not change the state of the network or changes it by decreasing by one, then the network is said to be a single-step network. Otherwise, we call it a multi-step network. In this paper, we assume that the network is single-step and denote the network links, that are subject to failure, by

One important concept useful in the study of network reliability is D-spectrum which depends only on the structure of the network; see Gertsbakh and Shpungin (2011) for general multivariate case wherein the networks are multi-steps. In order to explain a D-spectrum, we first need to define an anchor. Let

                      is the distribution function of the number of components to be destroyed to induce the transition from an up state to down state. It is of interest to mention here that the vector D-spectrum defined above is identical to the signature vector, defined by Samaniego (1985), used extensively in the study of coherent systems.

The study on the reliability of the networks under different aspects, has been considered by researchers for many years (see, for example, Agrawal and Barlow (1984) and the references cited therein). Recently, there has been much interest and focus on the lifetime network and system reliability based on the concept of signatures; see, for example, Boland, Samaniego, and Vestrup (2003), Navarro, Balakrishnan, and Samaniego (2008, 2010), Navarro and Rychlik (2007, 2010), Zhang (2010), Gertsbakh and Shpungin (2009, 2011, 2012), Levitin, Gertsbakh, and Shpungin (2011), Eryilmaz (2011, 2012) and Balakrishnan and Asadi (2012). The developments on the reliability and lifetime properties of coherent systems, however, are mainly based on the assumption that the system has n independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) (or independent and exchangeable) components. Under this assumption, the signature 
                        
                           s
                        
                      of the coherent system is defined as a n-dimensional probability vector whose ith element is

                           =

                           )
                        
                     , where T is the lifetime of the system and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 i
                                 :
                                 n
                              
                           
                        
                      is the ith ordered lifetime of the components. In order to investigate the reliability characteristics of the system lifetime, the main idea used in the above mentioned references and many others in the literature is the fact that the signatures are distribution-free and that the theory of order statistics of the component lifetimes is applicable.

                        Remark 1.2
                        It is useful to observe that the reliability function in (4), which is a mixture representation of the network reliability in terms of reliability functions of the first n records from the sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s, is analogous to the mixture form of the reliability function of a n-component coherent system in terms of reliability functions of order statistics from a sample of size n, due to Samaniego (1985).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, under the assumption that the network is operating at time t, we obtain a mixture representation for the reliability of residual lifetime of the network in terms of the residual reliability of upper record values. In this process, we arrive at a vector of time dependent D-spectrum that enables us to get some stochastic ordering results comparing two different networks. Section 3 is devoted to the inactivity time of the network. Herein, we obtain a mixture representation for the reliability of inactivity time of the network under the condition that the network has already failed by inspection time t. Several stochastic ordering results are presented in this section. In Section 4, we study the residual lifetime of the network under two different conditions. First, we obtain the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network working at time t with exactly k failed links at that time. Then, in the sequel, we obtain the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network after the failure of the kth link in the network. These two cases lead to the definition of a new concept called dynamic D-spectrum. Different representations and stochastic ordering results are presented as well in this section. To illustrate the importance of the results established here, various examples and graphs are also provided.

Throughout the paper, increasing (decreasing) is used to mean non-decreasing (non-increasing).

With T denoting the lifetime of a network as described above, and assuming that the network is up at time t, the residual lifetime of the network is simply given by the conditional random variable

The network never fails when only one link fails. Therefore,

                            permutations of four links, it is easy to find out that the network fails when exactly two (three) links fail in 20 (4) situations out of 24. After the failure of three links, the network is always down. Hence, the D-spectrum of the network in this case is

Consider the network with 32 links, 16 nodes and four terminals presented in Fig. 2
                           . Assume that the network fails whenever at least two terminals are disconnected. In this case, (Gertsbakh & Shpungin, 2009) estimated the corresponding D-spectrum by using Monte Carlo method, and their results are presented in Table 1
                           .

In this section, we study the inactivity time of the network when the failures of links follow a NHPP described in Section 2. The results of this section are mostly similar to some of the results derived in the preceding section. Hence, in most cases, we do not furnish the details of the proofs. If we know that

In this section, we explore some results on the residual lifetime of network under some scenarios on the status of the network or the lifetimes of its links. In what follows, the D-spectrum of the network is assumed to be of the general form in (11).

Consider a used network known to be working at time t, and suppose there are exactly k failed links at that time, i.e., we have 
                           
                              {
                              T

                              t
                              }
                           
                         and 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              ⩽
                              t
                              <
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                    +
                                    1
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                        . This information on the status of the network leads to a new and useful concept termed “dynamic D-spectrum”, which is similar in principle to the ‘dynamic signature’ introduced and studied in Samaniego, Balakrishnan, and Navarro (2009). We then use the concept of dynamic D-spectrum to study the residual lifetime of the network.

Consider the network in Fig. 5
                               having 10 links, five nodes and five terminals. Links are subject to failure, and the network is up if and only if all the terminals are connected to each other. It can be shown that the D-spectrum of this network is given as

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present work, we have considered a two-state (up and down) network consisting of n links. We have investigated the D-spectrum based dynamic reliability of the network under the assumption that the links are subject to failure according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Under the assumption that the network is operating (has failed) at time t, we have obtained a mixture representation for the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of the network in terms of the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of upper record values. Using these representations, and based on the concept of conditional D-spectra defined here, several stochastic ordering results on the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of the network have been established. We have also studied the residual lifetime of the network under the condition that the network is working at time t with exactly k failed links at that time. The reliability of the residual lifetime of the network after the failure of the kth link in the network has been studied which resulted in the definition of a new concept called dynamic D-spectrum. To illustrate the importance of the results, various examples and graphs have also been provided. We should remark on some points here. Although, in this study, we have assumed that the links of the network are subject to failure, the results continue to hold if one assumes that the nodes of the network are subject to failure. Throughout the paper, it has been assumed that only one link fails at each time. However, a more general case, which would be of interest and can be considered for a future study, is to assume that more than one link can fail simultaneously at each time. As a final remark, we have to point out that the results continue to hold if one considers any system that stops after K events, where K has probability mass function
