                  Enhancing 2D angiography while maintaining a low radiation dose has become an important research topic. However, it is difficult to enhance images while preserving vessel-structure details because X-ray noise and contrast blood vessels in 2D angiography have similar intensity distributions, which can lead to ambiguous images of vessel structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and fast vessel-enhancement method for 2D angiography. We apply filtering in the principal component analysis domain for vessel regions and background regions separately, using assumptions based on energy compaction. First, we identify an approximate vessel region using a Hessian-based method. Vessel and non-vessel regions are then represented sparsely by calculating their optimal bases separately. This is achieved by identifying periodic motion in the vessel region caused by the flow of the contrast medium through the blood vessels when viewed on the time axis. Finally, we obtain noise-free images by removing noise in the new coordinate domain for the optimal bases. Our method was validated for an X-ray system, using 10 low-dose sets for training and 20 low-dose sets for testing. The results were compared with those for a high-dose dataset with respect to noise-free images. The average enhancement rate was 93.11±0.71%. The average processing time for enhancing video comprising 50–70 frames was 0.80±0.35s, which is much faster than the previously proposed technique. Our method is applicable to 2D angiography procedures such as catheterization, which requires rapid and natural vessel enhancement.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Two-dimensional X-ray angiography is the most commonly used imaging modality for artery diseases monitoring and facilitating catheter-based procedures, such as FFR, IVUS, OCT, stent or peacemaker implantation. Briefly, it provides online two-dimensional projections of considered vessel to the clinician, which manually injects the contrast agent into the vessel since blood itself does not absorb enough amounts of X-rays to be visible. As a consequence, patients and medical staff can be exposed to X-ray radiation for prolonged periods. To minimize this harmful exposure, very low levels of X-ray dosage are used. However, this leads to considerable degradation of image quality through quantum noise [1,2]. Therefore, the ability to enhance images while maintaining a low radiation dose has become an important research topic.

There have been a number of studies on vessel enhancement methods. One popular technique is based on the second-order Hessian matrix [3–6]. And there are approaches with other filters that use information from neighboring pixels, such as the directional filter-bank-based method [7,8], the method using morphological connected-set filters [9–11], and the method using curvilinear filters [12]. To use more information, several nonlocal filters have been proposed for both the spatial domain and the frequency domain. Buades et al. [13] proposed a weighted nonlocal filtering in spatial domain. In this method, noises are removed by a pointwise estimate of the image where each pixel is obtained as a weighted average of pixels centered at regions that are similar to the region centered at the estimated pixel. Because all pixels of image can be used for averages, the estimates are non-local. One popular technique that uses a nonlocal filter in the frequency domain is block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) [14]. BM3D filter uses a procedure termed grouping and collaborative filtering. Grouping procedure is the step to find mutually similar 2D image patches and stack them in 3D blocks. And collaborative filtering procedure is the step to estimate all grouped 3D blocks by filtering them jointly by using hard-threshold or wiener filter in transform-domain. Video block-matching and 3D filtering (VBM3D) [15] applies BM3D successfully to a video system. In this method, groups are 3D blocks of mutually similar 2D patches extracted from a set of consecutive frames of the video sequence. BM3D and V-BM3D schemes are applied in medical imaging applications [16–18].

Using the assumptions related to sparse representation in BM3D, it is possible for noise-free images to be sparsely represented in the transform domain. Even though the temporal Fourier transform is effective in making the signal sparse when the image undergoes periodic motion, other transforms might be more efficient for other types of motion. Unlike the Fourier transform, the principal component analysis (PCA) transform is data dependent. It is well known that the PCA transform gives optimal energy compaction, with most of the energy accounted for by only a few coefficients [19]. Here, energy relates to image information such as the brightness magnitude and the variation of brightness between neighborhoods. Our method is based on these assumptions. The 2D angiography used in clinical practice involves the flow through the blood vessels of a contrast medium, which is a substance used in medical imaging to enhance the X-ray images of fluids within the body. The resulting images will contain more motion, both general and periodic, than those for other video applications. This fact enables sparser and less noisy images to be produced by using the PCA transform and removing low-energy coefficients. In addition, we are obtaining the PCA transform matrix of each vessel region and background region from difference of motion properties, which will preserve important information about the blood-vessel structures.

In this paper, we present a novel vessel enhancement method based on removing separately the noise in the extracted vessel region and in the background region within the PCA domain. Conventional approaches enhance images by combining neighboring pixels in a 3D kernel which includes temporal information of those neighboring pixels. However, our method uses only temporal information without the convolution's operation, which decreases the computation time by removing the convolution calculations required in a spatial domain, enhances images non-artificially and reduces the number of parameters to be optimized. Furthermore, we enhance the vessel region and the background region separately in PCA domain. And, it removes noise while preserving the details of vessel structures.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed three-step method for 2D-angiography vessel enhancement. Section 3 presents the results of the application of the proposed method to clinical datasets in comparison with other previous methods. Finally, we discuss results/correctness analysis, novelty and future work in Section 4 and summarize our method in Section 5.

The proposed method comprises three main steps, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . First, we extract an approximation of the whole vessel structure from the 2D angiography and partition the whole image into a vessel region and a background region. Second, all pixels are transformed from the spatial domain to the time domain, with all pixels transformed to a new coordinate system having a basis in each region obtained by PCA. Finally, frames are enhanced using a hard threshold in the PCA domain, and each region is converted back from the PCA domain to the spatial domain by an inverse transformation.

In this step, we extract an approximate vessel region that will include most of the flowing vessels for each frame of the input 2D angiography. This process is a necessary step in distinguishing between intensity variation caused by noise and that caused by the contrast medium. A blood vessel emphasized by the contrast medium is the most important structure in 2D angiography. The structure should be preserved and distinguished from noise.

To extract the vessel region, we construct a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) by subtracting the average of images obtained after injecting contrast medium into the blood vessels from the average of images before the injection. Because the overall noise distribution approximates a Poisson distribution in X-ray imaging, the expectation of noise asymptotically approaches zero. Averaging the images therefore has a denoising effect. We find candidate vessels via the Hessian-based method of multiscale vessel enhancement [3]. We then remove wrongly extracted noise and connect broken vessels by applying a morphological operator. In addition, we make the edges of the vessel region robust by including an area beyond the calculated extent of the blood vessels (see Fig. 2
                        ).

In this step, we transform N 2D X-ray images (consecutive frames of the angiography) from the spatial domain to the N-dimensional time domain. In other words, if the intensity value of the ith time image at location (x,y) is I
                        
                           i
                        , each pixel at (x,y) is mapped to (I
                        1, I
                        2, I
                        3,…,

                           N
                        ) in the N-dimensional time domain. Therefore, k pixels (width×height) transform to the time domain by having an N-dimensional feature vector (Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                        ).

                        where 
                           N
                         is the frame number, and

                         is the image size.

We assume that the true signal is well approximated by a linear combination of just a few basis elements. That is, the signal can be sparsely represented in the PCA transform domain. Therefore, we are able to estimate the true signal effectively by preserving the few high-magnitude PCA transform coefficients that convey most of the true-signal energy and removing the rest, which are mainly caused by noise. This assumption is used by most transform-domain image denoising methods. Fig. 5
                         illustrates the enhancement of 2D angiography and the removal of noise in the PCA domain.

In high-dose 2D angiography, the coefficients of most eigenvector bases other than those corresponding to large eigenvalues are small values close to zero. Fig. 6
                         compares coefficients of low-dose 2D angiography with high-dose 2D angiography in the PCA domain. Both low-dose and high-dose 2D angiography have high-magnitude coefficients (i.e., bright) in a basis corresponding to a large eigenvalue. However, in other bases, high-dose angiography is relatively noise free, with coefficients lower (i.e., dark) than for low-dose angiography, which has more noise. This shows that the assumption about energy compaction is reasonable.

By using the inverse matrix of the PCA transform matrix obtained from Eq. (2), we transform the enhanced data from the PCA domain back to the time domain, where the data in the time domain represent the 2D enhanced angiography directly. Because the PCA transform matrix is orthonormal, the inverse matrix is the same as the transpose matrix. We can obtain the inverse matrix of the PCA transform matrix easily (Fig. 7

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In this section, we first evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm by calculating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). We determined the optimal value of parameter which maximizes CNR with 10 clinical training data sets and validated our method with 20 clinical evaluation data sets, each of which was acquired from a different patient. We compared the result of our method with that of high-dose image as noise-free image. All our implementations and test were performed on an Intel® Core™ i7 2.8GHz CPU and 8GB of main memory.

Our clinical data sets contained 70–150 frames per angiogram. The scanning parameters of low-dose image were 77kVp, 65mA, 2.76Gym2 and a 1024×1024 pixel matrix with 0.31mm×0.31mm pixel size per frame. And, the scanning parameters of high-dose image were 71kVp, 486mA, 45Gym2 and a 1024×1024 pixel matrix with 0.31mm×0.31mm pixel size per frame. We applied our method for datasets of hepatic portal vein. And, datasets of hepatic portal vein had small motion variation because the patient held his/her breath when injecting contrast medium into the blood vessels. All datasets were obtained using a Siemens AXIOM-Artis X-ray system. Low-dose images were acquired using 2% of the X-ray radiation used for high-dose images. Fig. 8
                         shows comparison of image quality between low-dose image and high-dose image in clinical datasets.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

To evaluate quantitatively the results of the proposed 2-axis PCA method, we measured the enhancement quality of the proposed method by calculating the CNR. We estimated the CNR as described in [20].

The CNR was measured for the original image, the results from our method and the high-dose 2D angiography image, which was assumed to be free of noise. The 5 sub-regions of blood vessel and non-blood vessel were chosen per 1 frame in order to calculate CNR. Table 1
                         summarizes the CNR and the enhancement rate. The average value for the vessel enhancement rate was 93.11±0.71%. Anything better than 85% of the CNR for the high-dose image is generally acceptable in clinical practice, where high-dose images involve about 50 times the radiation dose for low-dose images. Therefore, the proposed algorithm would be considered to be an accurate enhancement scheme for the X-ray images in 2D angiography in clinical practice.


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the images at intermediate steps in the process of our proposed method. Step 2 images of Fig. 9 are log-magnitudes in PCA domain. And, black regions of step 3 images of Fig. 9 mean zeros by Eq. (3). Fig. 10
                         shows the enhancement results for each frame. It appears that the proposed method enhanced 2D angiography images preserving detail blood-vessel region. Because low-dose clinical testing datasets were acquired by using hand-injector, which uses small quantity of contrast medium and injects contrast medium by low pressure, blood-vessel region observe faintly. However, under these circumstances, the proposed method enhanced blood-vessel region removing noises of X-ray noises.

To evaluate the computational performance of the proposed method, we measured the total processing time. The processing time, averaged over multiple tests for all the datasets, was 0.8±0.35s, of which 0.2±0.05s was required for the extraction of the vessel region and 0.6±0.3s for the PCA-based enhancement. Because our method does not require convolution calculations, the processing time is relatively short.

We compared the results using our method with those using VBM3D [15], which is the state-of-the-art solution to video denoising. As already discussed, VBM3D is the method to apply the BM3D method to a video system. VBM3D improves the image quality by utilizing spatial information as well as temporal information. However, VBM3D fails to preserve detailed vessel structures and produces artificial images, in contrast to our method. To produce non-artificial images, our method uses only temporal information (see Fig. 11
                        ).


                        Table 2
                         summarized the average CNR measurement of VBM3D and proposed method. The average values of CNR of VBM3D and our method are 3.53±0.11 (dB) and 3.95±0.03 (dB) respectively. And considering high dose images as noise-free images, enhancement rate of VBM3D and our method are 83.85±2.61 (%) and 93.11±0.71 (%) respectively. Also, VBM3D requires considerable processing time for the block matching and the per-patch 3D transformation. We compared the processing time for the proposed method and for VBM3D. The average processing time of VBM3D and our method are 42.08±3.26 (s) and 0.8±0.35 (s) respectively (Table 3
                        ). These comparisons overall demonstrated that the proposed 2-axis method is successfully devised to remove X-ray noises non-artificially preserving blood vessel structures and enhance frames of 2D angiography very quickly.

We determined the optimal values of parameters to maximize CNR in training datasets. In our method, there is only one threshold value to set via Eq. (3). The threshold in Eq. (3) could influence enhancement degree of images since it determines the movement range of pixels in PCA domain. If a very low value for this threshold is used, the intensity of all pixels in the PCA domain is fixed. The output images would then be the same as the low-dose input images. If a very high threshold value is used, all pixels are projected to the principal basis corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, with fine vessel structures being lost. Depending on the threshold value, the extent of removing noises and preserving the detailed blood vessel structures is changed (see Fig. 12
                        ). The optimal parameter value of the threshold including top 12% eigenvalues was determined as 3.95dB to maximize CNR (see Fig. 13
                        ).

We process the enhancement of the vessel region and the background region separately, aiming to preserve the details of vessel structures. To clarify this point, we observed the point distribution for the vessel region and the background region (see Fig. 14
                        ). We are able to account for this difference in terms of the difference between the periodic motion caused by the contrast medium spreading through blood vessels in the vessel region and the motion caused by X-ray noise alone in the background region. If the frames were to be enhanced by using mixed information from both regions, we would lose some details of the vessel structures (see Fig. 15
                        ). Therefore, we should enhance frames by using the PCA transform matrix to represent accurately the motion of each region. Table 4
                         summarizes the CNR and enhancement rates for both 2-axis PCA and 1-axis PCA (Ta).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our method enhanced low-dose X-ray angiography preserving vessel structures in Figs. 10 and 11. Compared with state-of-the-art method, our method improved CNR and processing time. And, we extracted rough vessel regions due to 2-axis PCA, which was processed for vessel regions and background regions separately. Therefore, there was not false positive results. However, it might cause false negative results assuming that small coefficient value in PCA domain always supposes noise. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to exploit optimization method. Therefore, we are planning to utilize L1-minimization for suppressing coefficients in PCA domain to be sparse representation under constraints considering estimated noise variance.

The target audience of our method is people that it is necessary to enhance low-dose X-ray angiography of static vessels (in brain or liver for example). However, in case of highly dynamic vessels such as coronaries in heart, our method causes some problems due to errors of extraction of approximation vessel region and calculating bases of PCA domain. Therefore, we will research motion estimation for robust enhancement under large motion variance. And, our method has one parameter to configure, which is threshold of Eq. (3). We set this parameter by maximizing CNR of training datasets. Therefore, if the target audience configures threshold to eigenvalue ranked top-10% in sorted eigenvalues, they reach presented accuracy in this paper.

Previous studies enhanced images by using neighboring pixels in a 3D kernel. However, our method used only temporal information without the convolution's operation, which decreased the computation time by removing the convolution calculations required in a spatial domain, enhanced images non-artificially by removing a operation such as averaging and reduced the number of parameters to be optimized because our method was not necessary additional information of kernel-based method such as kernel size, sigma and so on. Furthermore, we enhanced the vessel region and the background region separately in PCA domain. And, it removed noise preserving the details of vessel structures and important feature points as a rib.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents a novel low-dose 2D-angiography enhancement method using 2-axis PCA. The main contribution is that we enhance frames by using an optimal energy-compaction PCA transform and partition the images into a vessel region and a non-vessel background region, enabling the regions to be enhanced separately using different PCA coordinates. Combining the results preserves the vessel structure. Our method has several advantages compared with the state-of-the-art method. As described earlier, we obtain natural enhanced X-ray images, whereas other approaches produce artificial results caused by the number of convolution operations in the spatial domain. In addition, the processing time for our method is very small.
