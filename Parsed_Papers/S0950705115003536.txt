                  Due to the potential important information in real world networks, link prediction has become an interesting focus of different branches of science. Nevertheless, in “big data” era, link prediction faces significant challenges, such as how to predict the massive data efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we propose two novel node-coupling clustering approaches and their extensions for link prediction, which combine the coupling degrees of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair with cluster geometries of nodes. We then present an experimental evaluation to compare the prediction accuracy and effectiveness between our approaches and the representative existing methods on two synthetic datasets and six real world datasets. The experimental results show our approaches outperform the existing methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

With the rapid development of internet technology, the amount of information in social networks increases significantly. While accessing useful information from social networks has become more and more difficult [1]. Social networks contain large number of potential useful information that is valuable for people’s daily lives and social business [2]. Therefore, social network analysis (SNA) has become a research focus to mine latent useful information from massive social network data. As part of this research, how to accurately predict a potential link in a real network is an important and challenging problem in many domains, such as recommender systems, decision making and criminal investigations. For example, we can predict a potential relationship between two persons to recommend new relationships in the Facebook network. In general, we call the above problem as link prediction [3].

As a subset of link mining [4], link prediction aims to compute the existence probabilities of the missing or future links among vertices in a network [5,6]. There are two main difficulties in the link prediction problem: (1) huge amount of data, which requires the prediction approaches to have low complexity and (2) prediction accuracy, which requires the prediction approaches to have high prediction accuracy. However, traditional data mining approaches cannot solve the link prediction problem well because they do not consider the relationships between entities, but the links between entities in a social network are interrelated.

To overcome the above two difficulties and meet the practical requirements, many similarity-based methods have been proposed. These methods are mainly based on local analysis and global analysis [7]. The approaches based on local analysis consider only the number or different roles of the common neighbor nodes, which results in lower time complexity. At the same time, they have lower accuracy because of insufficient information. On the other hand, the approaches based on global analysis have higher prediction accuracy and higher time complexity due to accessing the global structure information of a network [5,8]. So these methods are not satisfying solutions that can overcome the aforementioned two difficulties.

In this paper, we propose two novel node-coupling clustering approaches and their extensions for the link prediction problem. They consider the different roles of nodes, and combine the coupling degrees of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair with cluster geometries of nodes. Our approaches remarkably outperform the existing methods in terms of efficiency accuracy and effectiveness. This is confirmed by experiments in Section 5.

The contributions of this paper consist of the following three aspects: (1) We propose two novel node-coupling clustering approaches and their extensions, which define a novel node-coupling degree metric. (2) We consider the coupling degrees of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair, by which some links that the existing methods cannot predict are accurately predicted. (3) We use the clustering coefficient to capture the clustering information of a network, which makes our approaches have lower time complexity compared with the existing clustering methods. (4) We use the clustering information that is important information for predicting links, which can improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluation demonstrates our approaches outperform other methods in terms of accuracy and complexity. Our approaches are very suitable for large-scale sparse networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the overview of the related works of link prediction. Some preliminaries are briefly introduced in Section 3. Section 4 presents the idea of our approaches, and gives their complexity analysis. Experimental study is presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper and the future work.

The existing link prediction approaches can be divided into three categories: the methods based on local analysis and global analysis [7], maximum likelihood estimation methods [5], and machine learning methods [5].

The methods based on local analysis and global analysis exploit the similarity of nodes in a network. The methods based on local analysis consist of Common Neighbors

                     , Rooted PageRank and SimRank in the methods based on global analysis. These methods capture the global structure information of a network (i.e. the path set of a specific length). These above methods are described and discussed in [5,7]. Besides, Liu and Lü introduced a local random walk approach that provides good prediction accuracy [9]. Furthermore, Zhou et al. proposed two similarity-based methods – Resource Allocation 
                        
                           (
                           RA
                           )
                        
                      and Local Path 
                        
                           (
                           LP
                           )
                        
                     . They verified the performance of these two methods on six real-world datasets [10]. In practice, since the methods based on local analysis focus only on the local structure information of a network, they have lower computational complexity than those based on global analysis, and are suitable for large-scale networks. However, as there are no sufficient information in the local-based methods, these methods have lower prediction accuracy than those based on global analysis.

Maximum likelihood estimation methods apply some presumed rules and parameters with the maximum probability of the known structure to predict the potential links in a network. Clauset et al. proposed a missing-links prediction method based on hierarchical structure in the incomplete networks [11]. Guimera and Sales-Pardo presented a stochastic block model approach in link prediction [12].

Machine learning methods use the learned model to predict links by extracting the latent structure information of a known network. O’Madadhain et al. applied several classifiers to predict the potential links from probability theory in the networks based on events [13]. Hasan et al. treated link prediction as a supervised learning task, which predicts the link of a predicted node-pair by identifying a negative or positive example. They extracted the features of a co-authorship network and evaluated the prediction results of several classifiers [14].

Although the above latter two groups methods provide competitively accurate prediction compared with the methods based on local analysis and global analysis, they are only suitable for small scale real networks and impractical for large-scale sparse networks because of their high computational complexities. Therefore, Li and He et al. presented a clustering-based link prediction method (i.e. CLPA). They considered the clustering and free scale feature of a network for link prediction in their method [15]. In this paper, we will propose two novel node-coupling clustering approaches and their extensions to solve this problem.

In graph theory, clustering coefficient is a metric that can evaluate the extent to which nodes tend to cluster together in a graph [16]. It can capture the clustering information of nodes in a graph [17]. An undirected network can be described as a graph 
                           
                              G

                              AUC
                              )
                           
                         and Precision. In general, a link prediction method can compute a score 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    xy
                                 
                              
                           
                         for each unknown link to evaluate its existence probability and give an ordered list of all unknown links based on these 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 
                                    xy
                                 
                              
                           
                         values [18].

It can evaluate the overall performance of a link prediction method. As described in [5,8], the AUC value can be considered as the probability that the 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       xy
                                    
                                 
                              
                            value of an existing yet unknown link is more than that of a non-existing link at random. That is, we randomly select an existing yet unknown link in the test set and compare its score with that of a non-existing link at a time. There are N independent comparisons, where the times that the existing yet unknown links have higher

In this section, we present our approaches for link prediction. Firstly, we present a new node-coupling degree metric – node-coupling clustering coefficient. Then, we present the process of our approaches. Finally, we give the complexity analysis of our approaches.

Many similarity-based methods only consider the number or degrees of common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair in link prediction, and few exploit further the coupling degrees among the common neighbor nodes and the clustering information to improve the prediction accuracy. Based on the above reason, we propose a new node-coupling degree metric – node-coupling clustering coefficient (NCCC), which can capture the clustering information of a network and evaluate the coupling degrees between the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair. It also considers different roles of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair in a network. Now, we introduce this metric through a simple example.


                        Fig. 1
                         shows an example for predicting the link between nodes M and N in two networks. Two original networks are described in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Fig. 1(c) and (d) are two subgraphs that consist of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         and their common neighbors in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. We aim to predict which link between nodes M and N is more likely to exist in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In general, we find that the coupling degrees of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         and their common neighbors are higher in Fig. 1(c) than (d). Thus, we believe the link of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         in Fig. 1(a) is more likely to exist than in Fig. 1(b). If we apply 
                           
                              CN

                              RA
                              ,
                              
                              PA
                           
                         to predict the link of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         in these two original networks, we can gain the same prediction result for each method. The reasons are as follows: from Fig. 1(a) and (b), we can see that the common neighbor set 
                           
                              {
                              bdf
                              }
                           
                         of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         are the same, and every corresponding common neighbor node has the same degree value in these two original networks. The similarity metric is the number of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair in CN. CN has the same prediction results because of the same common neighbor node set 
                           
                              {
                              bdf
                              }
                           
                         of nodes 
                           
                              M
                              ,
                              
                              N
                           
                         in these two original networks. 
                           
                              RA
                              ,
                              
                              AA
                           
                         are based on the degree values of the common neighbor nodes. RA has the same prediction probability as AA because of the same degree value of every corresponding common neighbor node in 
                           
                              {
                              bdf
                              }
                           
                         in these two original networks. For the same reason, PA provides the same prediction result because that there are the corresponding same degree values for nodes M and N in these two original networks. However, the link probabilities between node M and node N in Fig. 1(a) and (b) are not likely to be the same.

In the above case, inspired by [10,19], we propose a new node-coupling degree metric based on the clustering information and node degree – node-coupling clustering coefficient. This metric cannot only resolve the above prediction problem in Fig. 1, but also capture the clustering information of a network. If node n is a common neighbor node of the predicted node-pair

                              )
                           
                        , can be defined as follows:

From the above computing results, we find that the potential link between node M and node N is more likely to exist in Fig. 1(a) than in Fig. 1(b). Algorithm 1 describes the process of our above approach.

The traditional CN method is based on the number of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair [7]. Its similarity metric is defined as follows:

Although CN has low complexity in the link prediction problem, it does not consider the different roles of the common neighbor nodes of a predicted node-pair. This results in low prediction accuracy. Here, we propose a new link prediction approach based on CN, which combines the different contributions of different nodes to the connecting probability with the clustering information of a network. In our approach,

                         is a predicted node-pair. Node n is a common neighbor node of the node-pair

We obtain the same prediction result as NCCPT. From this example, we find that our node-coupling clustering approaches can provide better prediction results than the traditional methods. Algorithm 1 illustrates the process of our above approach.

To further improve the performance of link prediction, we extend NCCPT and NCCCN by adding its clustering coefficient information of every selected common neighbor node,

From the above prediction results, we find that ENCCPT and ENCCCN have the same prediction results as NCCPT and NCCCN. Moreover, we notice that the prediction results of ENCCPT and ENCCCN have more obvious differences than NCCPT and NCCCN in the same example, respectively. This results in better prediction results compared with our baseline approaches (i.e. NCCPT, NCCCN), and it shows the importance of the clustering information in the link prediction. Algorithm 1 describes the process of our above extended approaches.

In real applications, most link prediction methods are based on local analysis and global analysis. CN is the simplest link prediction method in these methods. As a representative of the methods based on local analysis, CN has low complexity and suitable for large-scale networks. Its time complexity is

In our experiments, we apply AUC metric to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the tested methods. Firstly, we divide a dataset into a training set TS and a test set PS. Then, we compute the similarity score,

                           , of every unknown link in TS by a specific method. Finally, we compute AUC based on

                         as introduced in Section 2. Here, we conduct our experiments on the above mentioned eight datasets with different ratios of the edges that the training set includes in the total edges of a dataset (i.e. Ratio of the known edges) – 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9. Moreover, we set

                         in CLPA. In our experiments, we will analyze the prediction performance of the above approaches in two aspects: prediction accuracy and time cost.


                           Fig. 2
                            provides the prediction accuracy comparison results of the approaches, NCCPT, NCCCN, and other traditional methods on all tested datasets. From Fig. 2, we find that NCCPT and NCCCN have better prediction accuracy than the other traditional methods on all tested datasets in most cases, and they produce more prediction accuracy compared with the other traditional methods as the ratio of the known edges grows in each dataset. The main reason is that our approaches use the coupling degrees information of the common neighbor nodes and the clustering information of a network while the different roles of nodes are considered. Even though in the worst cases such as 
                              
                                 S

                                 300
                                 )
                                 ,
                                 
                                 Karaclub
                              
                            and PBl with 0.1 ratio of the known edges, the prediction accuracy of NCCPT and NCCCN is higher than CN. Meanwhile, we also find that NCCPT and NCCCN have the similar prediction accuracy under the specific ratio of the known edges in most cases, especially in high ratio of the known edges. This further proves that the node-coupling clustering idea in our approaches is very effective to improve the prediction results.

In addition, we also have the following findings: Firstly, the prediction accuracy of each studied method increases with the growth of the ratio of the known edges in most tested datasets. This is because there are more useful information that can be used to predict with the growth of the ratio of the known edges in each tested dataset. But the prediction accuracy of PA in Karaclub dataset does not always increase with the growth of the ratio of the known edges. The main reason is that PA is only related with the degree values of a predicted node-pair while Karaclub is a small world network and its node degree follows the Poisson distribution (i.e. the degree values of most nodes are identical). Secondly, as the representatives of the methods based on global analysis, 
                              
                                 Katz

                                 ACT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 CosRW
                              
                            have as good or better prediction accuracy compared with 
                              
                                 CN
                                 ,
                                 
                                 AA
                                 ,
                                 
                                 RA
                              
                            in most tested datasets, especially when the ratio of the known edges is low. This indicates we can obtain better prediction accuracy using the global structure information than the local structure information, especially under the ultra sparse of a network. Moreover, PA and the methods based on global analysis (i.e. 
                              
                                 Katz
                                 ,
                                 
                                 ACT
                              
                           ,and CosRW) have better prediction accuracy than our methods (i.e. NCCPT and NCCCN) in PBl when the ratio of the known edges is small (0.1, 0.3). The main reasons are as follows: (1) PBl is a free scale network and has “the Rich get Richer” feature. This satisfies the mechanism of PA and (2) the methods based on global analysis have more global information to use than our methods when the ratio of the known edges is small, such as 0.1, 0.3. Thirdly, RA has almost the same prediction accuracy as AA. This is because they are both based on the degree of nodes in a graph/network. Finally, GD has the worst prediction accuracy under the specific ratio of the known edges on all tested datasets in all selected methods. This is because there is insufficient information for link prediction in GD.


                           Fig. 3
                            shows the different prediction accuracy of our baseline approaches (i.e. 
                              
                                 NCCPT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 NCCCN
                              
                           ) and their extensions (i.e. 
                              
                                 ENCCPT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 ENCCCN
                              
                           ) on all tested datasets. Apart from the above findings as shown in Fig. 2, we also find the following three points in Fig. 3: Firstly, ENCCPT has better prediction accuracy than NCCPT even though there are no significant differences in their prediction results. ENCCCN has better prediction accuracy than NCCCN as well. This indicates that our extended approaches have a little better prediction accuracy than their corresponding baseline approaches. The main reason is that our extended approaches include the clustering information of the selected common neighbor nodes compared with their corresponding baseline approaches. The results verify that the extended approaches are more effective than the corresponding baseline approaches for the link prediction problem. Secondly, we find that 
                              
                                 NCCPT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 NCCCN
                                 ,
                                 
                                 ENCCCN
                              
                            and ENCCPT have the similar prediction accuracy when the ratio of the known edges is low, e.g., 0.1 and 0.3. However, the prediction performance of the extended approaches (i.e. 
                              
                                 ENCCPT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 ENCCCN
                              
                           ) is better than the corresponding baseline approaches (i.e. 
                              
                                 NCCPT
                                 ,
                                 
                                 NCCCN
                              
                           ) with the growth of ratio of the known edges in each tested dataset, especially when the ratio of the known edges is high. This is because there are more clustering information used to predict the potential links in the extended approaches than the corresponding baseline approaches with the growth of ratio of the known edges in each tested dataset. Thirdly, our approaches (i.e. 
                              
                                 NCCPT

                           ) have better prediction accuracy than CLPA when the ratio of the known edges is high (i.e. 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) on all tested datasets. CLPA has only a little better prediction accuracy than our approaches when the ratio of the known edges is low, such as 0.1 on most tested datasets. This is because the free scale feature is used for link prediction with 0.1 ratio of the known edges in CLPA. But the time performance of CLPA is significantly worse than our approaches, especially in large-scale datasets, e.g., Facebook and Ptop. The results are shown in Tables 2–6
                           
                           
                           
                           
                           . Overall, the above three findings prove further the importance of the clustering information in link prediction.

To understand further the prediction performance of the above related approaches, we use the average relative performance to evaluate each related approach in our experiments. Here, there are three baselines: Random predictor (RP), Graph distance (GD) and common neighbors (CN). Random predictor is a prediction method that simply selects some predicted node-pairs to predict at random in social networks. Fig. 4
                            shows the accuracy performance of each approach on all tested datasets, in terms of the factor improvement over random predictor. Figs. 5–9
                           
                           
                           
                           
                            show the average relative performance of several related prediction approaches versus three baselines: Random predictor (RP), Graph distance method (GD) and common neighbors method (CN). We can see that the other approaches significantly outperform the random predictor. This means that there is indeed useful information for link prediction contained in the network topology structure.

In practice, a prediction method should have high prediction accuracy and low time complexity to meet the practical requirements. Therefore, it is important to analyze the time performance of a prediction method as well. Table 2–6 show the running time of the studied prediction approaches on all tested datasets under different ratios of the known edges – 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, respectively. For each prediction approach, its running time increases as the data size of the tested dataset grows. But there is no absolute clear difference between the running time of each prediction approach under different ratios of the known edges on a tested dataset. CN has the best time performance because its running time is shorter than the other approaches in all tested datasets. In contrast,

Through the experimental analysis from the above two aspects: prediction accuracy and efficiency, we have the following findings: (1) Although CN has good time performance and is suitable for massive data, it has low prediction accuracy. (2) Although

                           , but also have the same complexity as CN (as shown in Section 4.4) and better time performance (as shown in Table 2–6). (4) According to SP (see Table 1), we know that PtoP is an ultra sparse dataset. We find our approaches have better prediction accuracy than other methods from Figs. 2 and 3. This implies that our approaches are suitable for any sparse datasets. Hence, our approaches in this paper are suitable and robust to predict links in all kinds of datasets.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this paper, we propose node-coupling clustering approaches and their extensions for link prediction. Our approaches not only combine the coupling degrees of the common neighbor nodes with the clustering information of a network but also consider the different roles of nodes for predicting links. Experiments on two synthetic and six real datasets have shown that our approaches have comparatively good prediction results. Specifically, our approaches capture the clustering information of a network using the clustering coefficient of every node, which requires low time complexity. As a result, our approaches are very suitable for large-scale networks.

In the future research work, we plan to test our approaches in massive datasets and datasets from different domains. Furthermore, we also plan to evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches for bipartite networks and weighted networks.
