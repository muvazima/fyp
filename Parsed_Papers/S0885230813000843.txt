                  This paper presents a study on the importance of short-term speech parameterizations for expressive statistical parametric synthesis. Assuming a source-filter model of speech production, the analysis is conducted over spectral parameters, here defined as features which represent a minimum-phase synthesis filter, and some excitation parameters, which are features used to construct a signal that is fed to the minimum-phase synthesis filter to generate speech. In the first part, different spectral and excitation parameters that are applicable to statistical parametric synthesis are tested to determine which ones are the most emotion dependent. The analysis is performed through two methods proposed to measure the relative emotion dependency of each feature: one based on K-means clustering, and another based on Gaussian mixture modeling for emotion identification. Two commonly used forms of parameters for the short-term speech spectral envelope, the Mel cepstrum and the Mel line spectrum pairs are utilized. As excitation parameters, the anti-causal cepstrum, the time-smoothed group delay, and band-aperiodicity coefficients are considered. According to the analysis, the line spectral pairs are the most emotion dependent parameters. Among the excitation features, the band-aperiodicity coefficients present the highest correlation with the speaker's emotion. The most emotion dependent parameters according to this analysis were selected to train an expressive statistical parametric synthesizer using a speaker and language factorization framework. Subjective test results indicate that the considered spectral parameters have a bigger impact on the synthesized speech emotion when compared with the excitation ones.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The research on expressive speech synthesis has gained considerable importance in the last few years. Usually, controllability of the expression of the synthetic speech according to the user's intentions or feedback is desirable. To achieve this, text tags can be used to represent the user's input. These tags are eventually conveyed to the frontend of a text-to-speech system to synthesize speech with the desired style. The synthesis of the speech signal with a desired style or expression can be highlighted depending on the choice of prosodic, spectral and excitation parameters, since some parameters are more emotion dependent than others (Maia and Akamine, 2012). It is common knowledge that long-term prosodic information have a significant effect on the emotion of the synthesized speech, e.g. (Tao et al., 2006). However, when it comes to the family of statistical parametric speech synthesizers (Zen et al., 2009) the question to be asked is how short-term spectral and/or excitation parameters, the commonly used features which represent a source-filter model of speech production (Deller et al., 2000), affect the desired style or expression of the synthesized speech.

Some studies have reported on the connection of glottal source parameters with the speaker identity (Plumpe et al., 1999), the speaker's phonation style (Airas and Alku, 2007), and the speaker's emotion (Airas and Alku, 2006; Székely et al., 2011). These analyses have been mostly based on parameters of the Liljencrants–Fant (LF) model (Fant et al., 1985) or the normalized amplitude quotient, extracted directly from samples of glottal pulses (Alku and Backstrom, 2002). As for the short-term spectrum, in (Salvi et al., 2010) a cluster analysis indicates that the spectral envelope changes when speech shifts from neutral to sad or happy states, and in (Přibilová and Přibil, 2009) a spectral modification approach for unit concatenation-based expressive speech synthesis is proposed. These works indicate that there might be a connection between short-term spectral and excitation parameters and the speaker's emotion under the framework of statistical parametric speech synthesis.

This paper presents an investigation on the importance of the choice of the spectral and excitation parameterization for conveying the appropriate style in emotional statistical parametric speech synthesis. Spectral parameters commonly used, such as Mel cepstrum and Mel line spectral pairs (LSP) were analyzed. Among the excitation parameters, features related to the breathiness of speech and that control the mixture of voiced and unvoiced components, such as the band-aperiodicity parameters (Zen et al., 2007) were taken into account. In addition, parameters that are related to the glottal flow, such as the anti-causal cepstrum (Quatieri, 2002) and time domain group delay (Banno et al., 1998) were also considered. The analysis is conducted on a high-quality emotional corpus, recorded on studio by a professional actress. Initially, analyses using K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are employed to determine the most emotion dependent features among the ones considered. Based on this analysis, the parameters that have the strongest connection with the speaker's emotion are then utilized to train an expressive statistical parametric synthesizer based on a speaker and language factorization (SLF) framework (Zen et al., 2012). The SLF framework allows better estimation of the statistical models by combining all the common factors on the emotional data (Wan et al., 2012) through the combination of cluster dependent decision trees (Yu et al., 2011). The synthesis of speech with different styles at the stream level can be performed by selecting the cluster weights appropriately (see Section 4.6.1 for a short explanation of SLF). Finally, subjective tests were conducted to verify whether spectrum or excitation parameters have significant influences on the speaking style of the synthesized speech.

This work is a follow up to our previous study on this subject (Maia and Akamine, 2012). This time the parameters are extracted with higher precision by using higher complex cepstrum analysis orders followed by frequency warping. The group delay feature is calculated directly from the complex cepstrum for consistency and to avoid phase unwrapping mistakes. Furthermore, a different emotional database with higher quality, recorded by a professional actress with supervised distinct emotions is utilized here. Finally, in order to synthesize speech with higher quality by combining the common properties of all the emotions, the SLF framework was used rather than emotion dependent models, trained on small databases, as performed in Maia and Akamine (2012). In this way, the artefacts related to the poor quality of training on a small corpus are reduced, and focus can be directed to the speaking style itself during the subjective evaluation.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the procedures of analytical tests of emotion dependency based on K-means clustering and GMM; Section 3 introduces the assumed speech model, shows how speech can be factorized using complex cepstrum analysis, describes the spectral and excitation parameters utilized in the analysis, and discuss their relationship with the speech production mechanism. Section 4 shows experimental results, in Section 5 we discuss the experimental results, and the conclusions are presented in Section 6.

Two different methods are employed to analyze which features are more dependent on the speaker's emotion: (1) K-means emotion clustering; (2) GMM emotion classification.

                         illustrates our GMM-based approach to measuring which features are more emotion dependent. For each feature, emotional GMMs are separately trained. By using the emotional test data, a confusion matrix can be constructed by evaluating the likelihood of each test data given each GMM, where the more diagonal is the matrix the more emotion dependent is the feature. Each element of a feature dependent confusion matrix can be calculated as

The parameters used in this work compose a digital source-filter model of speech production (Deller et al., 2000).

We assume a model in which a two-pitch period speech, s(n), segment centered at the glottal closure instant, is produced by the convolution of a causal minimum phase impulse response, h

                         shows the speech model, which is widely used in statistical parametric synthesizers (Zen et al., 2007). Assuming that s(n) is mostly mixed phase (Deller et al., 2000; Quatieri, 2002; Rabiner and Schafer, 1978), the all-pass filter, H

                           m
                        (z), results in the phase response of the speech signal, s(n).

Synthesis filter and glottal flow parameters can be derived by complex cepstrum analysis (Quatieri, 2002). Assuming that s(n) is a two-pitch segment of speech, selected through an appropriate window with center at the glottal closure instant (GCI), the complex cepstrum of s(n) is given by

                         shows examples of natural and synthetic waveforms for the vowel “e” uttered on different emotions. The synthetic waveforms were produced through overlap-and-add of h(n) at the corresponding analysis instants. Note that the similarity between the natural and synthetic versions indicates that most of speech information is indeed represented by h(n).

                           The reader may be interested to compare with the waveforms in the right side of Fig. 5, produced through minimum-phase synthesis.
                        
                     

However, for statistical parametric synthesis it is interesting to factorize h(n) because the glottal flow excitation and the vocal tract resonance play different roles in the speech production mechanism, and consequently should have separate decision trees (Maia et al., 2013a). In the following we show two factorizations of the complex cepstrum that can be suitable for statistical parametric synthesis.

Any stable system represented by its impulse response h(n) can be decomposed as a convolution of a minimum-phase and an all-pass impulse responses (Oppenheim, 2010): h(n)=

                           (n). In the cepstral domain this convolution becomes a summation:

                           . The literature shows that the anti-causal cepstrum is one possible representation of the glottal pulse, e.g. (Drugman et al., 2011). However, for this decomposition the all-pass impulse response h

                           (n) represents the phase information of the glottal excitation since its amplitude response is one.

In this case it can be shown that the impulse response h
                           
                              ac
                           (n) is related to the glottal flow. Fig. 8
                            shows examples of waveforms created through the overlap-and-add of h
                           
                              ac
                           (n) and h
                           
                              ca
                           (n) at the GCIs, for the vowel “e” uttered in different emotions. The gain term has been removed by making 
                              
                                 
                                    h
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                              (
                              0

                              0
                           . It can be noticed that in this case the glottal pulses produced by h
                           
                              ac
                           (n) seem more distinctive across the emotions. Amplitude spectra of the waveforms in Fig. 8 are shown in Figs. 9
                            and 10
                           , where the spectral tilt of the of the amplitude response of h
                           
                              ac
                           (n) changes from the more intense emotions: anger and happiness, to the least intense ones, neutral and sadness.

Basically, the difference between the two factorizations regards the effect of the glottal flow. In the all-pass/minimum-phase decomposition the glottal flow amplitude response is included in the minimum-phase cepstrum, while the all-pass cepstrum represents the phase response of the glottal flow. In the causal/anti-causal decomposition the separation between vocal tract and glottal flow parameters is more explicit.

The line spectral pairs (LSP) basically represent an efficient form of encoding the linear prediction coefficients. The LSP usually present better quantization and interpolation properties (Kabal and Ramachandran, 1986). They also have a strong relationship with the formants of the short-term spectrum of s(n) (Kleijn and Paliwal, 1995). Considering the M-order all pole model of (22), two polynomials of order M

Improved speech models that use sophisticate excitation signals have been largely used in statistical parametric synthesizers recently, e.g. (Yoshimura et al., 2001; Zen et al., 2007; Maia et al., 2007; Cabral et al., 2007; Drugman et al., 2009; Raitio et al., 2011). Some methods are based on models of the glottal flow, e.g. (Cabral et al., 2007; Raitio et al., 2011), others attempt to model the residual signal, e.g. (Maia et al., 2007; Drugman et al., 2009), and others rely on the application of vocoding techniques to statistical parametric synthesis, e.g. (Yoshimura et al., 2001; Zen et al., 2007). According to (12), in this work the excitation signal consists of: (1) glottal flow phase representation through the filter h
                        
                           a
                        (n); (2) mixture of the voiced and unvoiced excitation components through the zero-phase filters 
                           
                              h
                              v
                           
                           (
                           n
                           )
                         and h
                        
                           u
                        (n), respectively. In the following we present two parameterization for the phase information of the glottal flow: the anti-causal cepstrum and the time domain group delay. Finally, the band-aperiodicity parameters is used for controlling the breathiness of speech.

We have seen in Section 3.2 that the anti-causal cepstrum contains information on the glottal flow. At synthesis time this information can be used to implement the all-pass filter H
                           
                              a
                           (z), as shown in Section 3.2.1. Alternatively, the same set of parameters can be used to implement a “glottal filter”, according to shown in Section 3.2.2. In the first case, the amplitude response of h
                           
                              a
                           (n) would be one, and it can be demonstrated that its phase response would be

                        . A total of 459 sentences were uttered in each one of the emotions above.

The data was segmented at the phone level using three-state left-to-right no-skip phone hidden Markov models (HMMs), where each state emission corresponded to a 5-ms duration. Each feature vector consisted of 12 Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, frame energy, and corresponding first and second derivatives.

GCIs and fundamental frequencies were extracted from the data using the Entropic Signal Processing Software. The GCIs were used for complex cepstrum analysis, as described in Section 4.2.

(2012), through the following steps: (1) pitch synchronous spectral analysis; (2) phase unwrapping and linear phase component removal; (3) interpolation of amplitude and phase responses over 5-ms frames. We used L
                        =4096 to alleviate aliasing problems and to make the phase unwrapping task easier (Maia et al., 2013a). After that, complex cepstrum for each frame with cepstral order C

From each complex cepstrum sequence, 40 Mel cepstral coefficients (M

The analysis was conducted at the phone level. This was preferred over the clustering and GMM training of all the phones together because different phones exhibit different characteristics in terms of spectral envelope and glottal flow (Deller et al., 2000).


                        K-means clustering was conducted using data from all the emotions, as mentioned in Section 2.1. Centroid initialization was done by randomly selecting K vectors from the data. The distortion measure in (1) was used.

GMM training was conducted in each data separately as described in Section 2.2 using the expectation-maximization algorithm (Bishop, 2006). The number of mixtures for each emotion was J
                        =64 and diagonal covariances were used.


                        Fig. 11
                         shows the normalized mutual information for each phone after the clustering. According to this analysis, the spectral features are more emotion dependent than the excitation ones. Mel cepstral coefficients and Mel LSP achieve similar results while band-aperiodicity parameters are the most emotion dependent among the excitation features. The time domain group delay shows a slight better performance than the Mel anti-causal cepstrum. Table 1
                         summarize the results as the average across the phones, where one can see the same tendency as the results for individual phones.

According to the GMM method described in Section 2.2, for each emotion dependent GMM, the likelihood of different emotion dependent test data given the GMM was taken as illustrated in Fig. 2, and a confusion matrix for each feature was constructed.


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the plots of the confusion matrices obtained for each feature, where light colors represent small numbers and strong colors large numbers. To produce these results, only vowels were considered. It can be seen that among the spectral features, the Mel LSP present the strongest diagonal line, indicating that this feature is the most emotion dependent one according to this analysis. Among the excitation features, the band-aperiodicity parameters present the best performance in terms of emotion dependency. These results confirm what was obtained using K-means clustering. By comparing the anti-causal cepstrum and group delay, in this case it is not clear which one of these two features is more emotion dependent. However, both features present some horizontal trends, which means that the angry test data present the highest likelihood regardless of the emotional GMM that is being tested on. For the other parameters, it is interesting to note that there is a similarity between the neutral and happy databases.


                        Fig. 13
                         shows frame accuracy results (see Section 2.2 to see how the frame accuracies are calculated) for the vowels. It can be seen that Mel LSP and Mel cepstrum have the best performance regardless of the emotion. Among the excitation parameters, again the band aperiodicity parameters are the most emotion dependent ones, with exception to the angry class. In this case the group delay and anti-causal cepstrum are more emotion dependent. It is also interesting to notice that the gap between spectral and excitation parameters is smaller for the most intense emotions: angry and happy. Table 2

Again, there is no difference between the anti-causal cepstrum and time domain group delay.

An expressive statistical parametric synthesizer was trained using the entire emotional corpus described in Section 4.1. The speaker and language factorization framework was used (Zen et al., 2012). This approach was chosen rather than emotion dependent models as used in (Maia and Akamine, 2012) because of the size of the database (459 samples per emotion). The SLF framework is a good choice in this condition because it provides a good estimation of the statistical models by the use of cluster dependent decision trees (Wan et al., 2012). Furthermore, synthesis of speech with different styles can be done by appropriately adjusting the cluster weights at synthesis time. In the following we provide a short description of SLF. For more detailed information on SLF, the reader is encouraged to read the paper by Zen et al. (2012).

The speaker and language factorization framework provides a way to factorize different styles/characteristics of the database through statistical models. In the original framework proposed in Zen et al. (2012), the constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) (Gales, 1998) method was used as speaker transform while the cluster adaptive training (CAT) (Gales, 2000) with cluster dependent decision trees (Yu et al., 2011) was used for language transforms. For the present work, since it is a mono-speaker database, the CMLLR transforms are dropped and CAT is used for emotions.

Based on the results shown in of Section 4.5, Mel LSP parameters were chosen as spectral features, and the anti-causal cepstrum was selected as the glottal flow phase parameter. Finally, band-aperiodicity parameters were also used to control the mixture between glottal pulse and noise in the excitation signal. To train the acoustic models, each observation vector,

Acoustic model training was done as follows. Initially, an emotion independent model was trained by using the entire emotional data. After that, an SLF model was initialized. The number of clusters was set to P
                           =5: one bias plus four emotional clusters. The bias cluster decision-trees and corresponding cluster dependent means were initialized as the ones from the emotion independent model. The covariance matrices were also initialized as the ones from the emotion independent model. After that, emotion specific tags were assigned to clusters p
                           =2, …, P, and the decision trees for these clusters were initialized as single root nodes with mean vectors set to zero. Finally, the CAT interpolation weights were initialized as follows

The CAT regression classes were three: silence, pause, and phones, and the number of components was one for all the streams except for the ln

                           0 related ones (streams 3, 4 and 5). After the initialization, the acoustic models were trained following the algorithm shown in Zen et al. (2012) without the CMLLR transforms.

The procedure to synthesize speech in a given emotion ι is done as follows. For a given input text, a set of full context labels is obtained. According to the labels, one leaf node from each one of the cluster dependent decision trees can be selected. Since each leaf has an associate mean vector, the final emotion dependent mean,

                            is selected according to the central phone that is intended to be synthesized: silence, pause or phone. The covariance matrices are the ones of the bias cluster. After obtaining a sequence of means and covariances, the usual process of parameter generation can be utilized (Zen et al., 2009).

To synthesize speech using different emotional parameters, the means were obtained as in (43), with weights selected at the stream level for the intended emotion. The models were classified as

Speech waveforms were produced according to the speech model shown in Fig. 3. Generated Mel LSP were converted into Mel linear prediction coefficients and implemented directly into a Mel generalized log spectral approximation filter structure (Koishida et al., 2000). Band-aperiodicities were converted into the impulse responses

To test the impact of the emotional spectral and excitation parameters on the expressiveness, listening tests were conducted through a web-recruitment system. A minimum requirement of sixteen judgments per test utterance was set. A total of 50 test sentences were synthesized in several versions with varying spectrum and excitation, as explained in Section 4.6.3. In average, 100 subjects took part in each test. The subjects were asked to compare synthesized versions of a given sentence with a natural reference version and rate the similarity in terms of speaking style from 1 to 5, where:

                            shows the results of the four tests in which prosody and excitation are kept fixed while spectrum is varied. According to these evaluations, the Mel LSP are indeed emotion dependent. Fig. 16
                            shows the results when prosody and spectrum are kept fixed and excitation is changed. In this case, however, there is no difference in similarity degree to the reference style, which implies that the strength of the anti-causal cepstrum and band-aperiodicity parameters are weak in terms of emotion dependency within the statistical parametric synthesis framework.

It is interesting to note that the results of the subjective tests are consistent with the ones obtained with the analysis using K-means clustering and GMM, which are: (1) spectral parameters are more emotion dependent than excitation ones; (2) there is a similarity between the classes neutral and happy (see results of tests 2 and 3 in Fig. 15).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The glottal pulses derived from the anti-causal cepstrum shown in the left side of Fig. 8, as well as their amplitude responses in Fig. 9 indeed show that there is a connection between the speaker's emotion and the glottal excitation. However, the results of the analysis using K-means and GMM, as well as the subjective tests with synthetic speech, have not indicated that this connection is strong. One possible reason could be the fact that the anti-causal cepstrum itself is not a good parameterization in terms of emotion identification. Another reason could be inaccuracies during complex cepstrum analysis. For instance, inaccurate GCI marks greatly compromises the estimation of the anti-causal cepstrum as a glottal flow parameterization.

Another aspect of the results concerns the strength of the spectral parameters in terms of emotion dependency. One could possibly claim that such strength occurs because the amplitude response of the glottal flow is included in the spectral parameters.

                        See Appendix A for details.
                      However, if this was the reason for the emotion dependency of the spectral parameters, the same performance would have been achieved by the anti-causal cepstrum.

                        Indeed, a spectral tilt can be observed in Fig. 9.
                      Therefore, the fact of including the spectral tilt of the glottal flow may not be the main reason for the apparent connection of the spectral parameters with the speaker's emotion.

Finally, a more explicit separation between vocal tract and glottal parameters could have been simulated through the derivation of the spectral parameters from the causal cepstrum rather than the minimum-phase cepstrum. At synthesis time, in order to use the synthesis engine shown in Fig. 3, the minimum-phase cepstrum,

                     , can be obtained from the causal and anti-causal cepstrum according (15).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

An analysis of the impact of short-term parameterizations for expressive statistical parametric speech synthesis has been presented. Two parameterizations for the minimum-phase synthesis filter, regarded here as spectral parameters, were tested: the Mel cepstrum and the Mel line spectral pairs. Three parameters that are used to construct the excitation signal were also analyzed: the anti-causal cepstrum, which is a representation of the glottal flow; the time domain group delay, which represents solely the phase response of the glottal flow; and the band-aperiodicity parameters, which are related to the breathiness of the speech signal. Ideas for analyzing the connection of each one of these parameters with the speaker's emotion were proposed, based on K-means emotion clustering and GMM emotion identification. The results of this analysis indicated that: (1) spectral parameters are more emotion dependent than parameters that are used to construct the excitation signal; (2) the Mel line spectral pairs appear as the most emotion dependent features; (3) the band-aperiodicity parameters have the strongest connection with the speaker's emotion among the excitation parameters. Subjective results on speech synthesized by a system trained under a speaker and language factorization framework have shown that: (1) Mel LSP are more important for enhancing expressiveness of synthesized speech than excitation parameters; (2) the impact of the anti-causal cepstrum and band-aperiodicity parameters on the speaking style is not as relevant as that of the parameters of the minimum-phase synthesis filter.

Future work includes the use of complex cepstrum analysis methods that are less sensitive to the GCIs (Maia et al., 2013b), and use of other parameterizations for the glottal flow.

                        Therefore, assuming that the anti-causal cepstrum represents the glottal flow information, the minimum-phase cepstrum includes the glottal flow magnitude response while the all-pass cepstrum represents its phase response.
