                  We formulate the multiple knapsack assignment problem (MKAP) as an extension of the multiple knapsack problem (MKP), as well as of the assignment problem. Except for small instances, MKAP is hard to solve to optimality. We present a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem approximately but very quickly. We first discuss three approaches to evaluate its upper bound, and prove that these methods compute an identical upper bound. In this process, reference capacities are derived, which enables us to decompose the problem into mutually independent MKPs. These MKPs are solved euristically, and in total give an approximate solution to MKAP. Through numerical experiments, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Although the algorithm is weak for small instances, we find it prospective for large instances. Indeed, for instances with more than a few thousand items we usually obtain solutions with relative errors less than 0.1% within one CPU second.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This article is concerned with the multiple knapsack assignment problem (MKAP), as an extension of the multiple knapsack problem (MKP, Kellerer, Pferschy, & Pisinger, 2004; Martello & Toth, 1990; Pisinger, 1999), as well as of the assignment problem (Burkard, Dell’Amico, & Martello, 2009; Kuhn, 2005; Pentico, 2007), where we are given a set of n items

Such a problem may be encountered by a marine shipping company in drawing up a cargo plan. Here items are to be shipped to respective destinations, and we have m ships for this transportation. Let

MKAP is

                     -hard, since the special case of 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           1
                        
                      is simply an MKP, which is already 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hard. For recent works on MKP, readers are referred to Chekuri and Khanna (2006), Dawande, Kalagnanam, Keskinocak, Ravi, and Salman (2000), and Lalami, Elkihel, Baz, and Boyer (2012). Since MKAP described as above is a linear 0–1 programming problem, small instance of this problem may be solved using free or commercial MIP (mixed integer program) solvers such as Gurobi (2012). However, as we shall see later, solvers can solve only small instances within a reasonable CPU time.

Instead of solving MKAP exactly, we present an approach to solve larger instances approximately, but very quickly. More specifically, we first apply the Lagrangian relaxation to (2), and obtain an upper bound quickly. Here, we show that only one multiplier suffices to eliminate these mK inequalities, and the obtained upper bound is shown to be identical to the upper bound derived by the continuous (LP) relaxation of MKAP. In addition, we present an efficient way to solve this LP problem by decomposing it into K independent continuous knapsack problems.

We exploit the result of this computation to derive a heuristic solution, which gives a lower bound to MKAP. Through numerical experiments on a series of randomly generated instances, we evaluate the quality (CPU time and relative errors) of the obtained solutions.

To discuss upper bounds, without much loss of generality, we assume the following.

                              λ
                           
                        ) is totally unimodular. Then, this theorem follows immediately from Theorem 10.3 (p. 172) of Wolsey (1998).

In preliminary numerical experiments, we find that many variables in CMKAP take non-integer values in optimality, and thus it is not practical to expect a good approximate solution to MKAP by rounding those variables either to 0 or 1. As an alternative approach, we propose to allocate (from the total knapsack capacity C)

                      is obtained in Section 2.3 as a solution to TP, and hereafter referred to as the reference capacity.

Next, we try to assign knapsacks, i.e., determine 
                        
                           y
                        
                     , so that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 u

                      is most closely approximated. This may be accomplished heuristically, as we shall discuss in Section 3.1.

Finally, once knapsacks are thus assigned to subsets, we obtain an approximate solution, and correspondingly a lower bound to MKAP, by solving (exactly or approximately) the resulting K independent MKPs.

We evaluate the performance of the MKAP algorithm developed in the previous section through a series of numerical experiments. We implemented the algorithm in ANSI C language and conducted computation on a DELL Precision T7400 computer (CPU: Xeon X5482 Quad-Core×2 3.20gigahertz×2, RAM: 64gigabyte), with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 operating system.

These sizes come from the following considerations: in SMALL we intend to compare the upper and lower bounds against the optimal objective values; thus to solve instances exactly the problem size has to be limited. On the other hand, LARGE explores the behavior of the heuristic algorithm for large (or huge) instances.

                        . CPU time for computing these bounds was far less than a second in these instances, and thus negligible.

From this table, we see that MKAP can be solved easily to optimality by MIP solvers if instances are as small as 
                           
                              n
                              ⩽
                              40
                           
                        . For larger values of n we often encounter difficulty, irrespective to the correlation types and the values of K and m.

It is clear that the quality of the heuristic solution is unsatisfactory for these SMALL instances, with relative errors sometimes higher than 100%. In particular, upper bound is far from the optimal value in instances with 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              20
                           
                        , although errors decrease rapidly as n increases. The relative error of the lower bound remains less than a few dozens percent for all values of n, and decreases with the increase of n.

To investigate the behavior of the heuristic algorithm for small to large n, Table 2
                         gives the gap between the bounds (absolute error=

                        , where we give the results for larger instances.

We may attribute this strength for larger instances to a sort of ‘granularity effect,’ as explained below. We note that in our experiments the knapsack capacity was determined by (17), which means

In such a circumstance, each knapsack will be packed with many small objects, and it is natural to conjecture that objects of smaller weights (relative to knapsack capacities) can be packed to near capacity in many different ways, whereas when object weights are large relative to capacity, heuristic packings may end up far from capacity. This fact is obvious for ordinary 0–1 knapsack problem, and we observe the similar phenomenon for MKAP.

                         with correlation types varied. The observations from Table 3 are:

                              The heuristic algorithm described in Section 3 gives quite accurate approximate solutions for LARGE instances in small CPU time, irrespective of the values of 
                                    
                                       ρ

                                  and m within the range of experiments tested. Indeed, except for a few instances, relative errors are far less than a percent, and CPU time is less than one second.

Parameter

From Table 4, we observe the following.

                                  and n tested, the algorithm remains efficient, irrespective of the correlation types of the problem.

So far, in the experiments we assumed that

                        . Table 5
                         gives a result of the sensitivity analysis with respect to this range, i.e., we compare the cases of

                         and 
                           
                              R

                        . Although the absolute error increases commensurately with R, the algorithm stably produces approximate solutions of at most a few percent relative errors, irrespective of the correlation type of the instance.

Finally, Table 6
                         compares the results of BINARY against those of UNCOR. In both of these types, absolute errors decrease monotonically with the increase of 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                        . This may be explained as follows. As 
                           
                              ρ
                           
                         increases, we have knapsacks of capacities sufficiently large to accept almost all the items of larger relative efficiency (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              /
                              
                                 
                                    w
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                        ), irrespective of specific assignment of knapsacks to subsets. The remaining capacities will be filled with items of smaller efficiency, but this does not make big difference in objective values. This is especially significant in BINARY with 
                           
                              ρ
                              =
                              0.75
                           
                        , where knapsacks will include all the items of

                              =
                              100
                           
                         (and in addition some of

                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ). Absolute errors are also smaller for larger n, as we have observed in Table 2.

Except for the case of 
                           
                              ρ
                              =
                              0.75
                           
                        , relative errors are larger in BINARY than in UNCOR, but throughout the experiments tested these are always less than a few per cent. Indeed, no significant differences were observed (both in accuracy of solutions and computing time) between BINARY and other type of instances.

We have formulated MKAP, and developed a solution algorithm to solve this problem approximately, but very quickly. For small instances, the quality of the solutions produced remains poor. Such a problem may better be solved using MIP solvers, although exact solutions are hard to obtain by this method as well. Through numerical experiments we found our algorithm prospective for larger instances. We discussed this strength of the heuristic algorithm for larger instances in relation with the granularity effect of the knapsack problem.

Finally, we mention the cost of assignments which has been ignored in our formulation of the problem. It is natural to consider that different knapsack-subset pairs would incur different assignment costs. Thus, instead of (1) the objective function may be modified as

We need some different approaches to explore such an important issue related to MKAP, and we leave this as a future research direction.
