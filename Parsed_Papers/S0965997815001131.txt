                  A global sensitivity analysis and parameter adjustment of a simplified physical fire model applied to a well measured experimental example is developed in order to validate the model. The fire model is a simplified physical 2D wildland fire model with some 3D effects that takes into account the wind, the slope of the orography, the fuel load and type, the moisture content, the energy lost in the vertical direction and the radiation from the flames. The simplicity of the model and the numerical techniques proposed allow very competitive computational times.

The aim of a wildland fire model is to take fuel, topography, weather conditions, ignition and fire suppression as input data and predict the spread of a fire in a time shorter than the real time scale of the fire spread so that it can be a useful tool by firefighters.

In recent years, advances in computational power and the increase in the capabilities of spatial information technologies offer great potential for the effective modeling of the behavior of wildland fires. Usually most of reviews in fire behavior modeling classify fire models according to the nature of their construction as being physical, semi-physical or empirical [1–5]. According to the physical system modeled, wildland fire mathematical models may be classified as surface fires, crown fires, spotting and ground fires models [2]. Surface fire spread modeling has been one of the most important task carried out in wildland fire research. In the literature there are two regimes in the propagation of surface fires, wind-driven fires and plume-dominated fires [6].

The fire model we summarize here is a simplified physical model for wind-driven surface fires. It is based on the fundamental physics of combustion and fire spread, together with some appropriate assumptions, that by making use of efficient numerical and computational tools, allow that the simulation time be shorter than the real time.

This simplified physical model follows the ideas proposed in [7–9], and previous fire models developed by the authors in [10] where a two phase model is presented and in [11–13] where several modifications and ideas were developed. The current simplified physical model is described with detail in [14,15] where is applied to a real case. The model takes into account the radiation from the flames, the wind, the slope of the orography, the fuel load and type, the moisture content, and the energy lost in the vertical direction.

This simplified physical model depends on several input variables and three model parameters. In order to validate the model, a global sensitivity analysis [16,17] of the input factors, input variables and model parameters, was carried out, allowing us to determine which input factors are the most influential on model outputs. In the analysis proposed, the model outputs are the rate of spread and the fire thickness. The results of the sensitivity analysis allows to select the most relevant parameters, so that, the parameter adjustment can be carried out in a more efficient way. The sensitivity analysis and the adjustment of parameters have been done using the set of laboratory experiments reported in [18].

The global sensitivity analysis and the parameter adjustment involve the solution of the problem many times and consequently an efficient numerical solution of the direct problem is needed. The numerical solution proposed attempts to reduce the computational time by defining the active nodes and making use of parallel computation.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recap the fire model, in Section 3 we explain the numerical scheme. In Section 4 we address the sensitivity analysis of the input factors, and in Section 5 the parameter adjustment, both for the same experimental example for which there are available data [18]. Finally, some conclusions are given in Section 6.

In this section we describe briefly the mathematical equations corresponding to the one phase model which follows the works developed by the authors in [11–13]. In particular, a model with local radiation is reported in [11], the idea of a multivalued operator for enthalpy is presented for the first time in [12], and a model with no local radiation is developed in [13]. Additionally, in [14] the model was tested modeling a real fire and in [15] we consider the model with data assimilation.

It should be noted that in the burned zone the multivalued operator does not represent the physical phenomena exactly, since the water vapor is no longer in the porous medium. This drawback can be avoided by setting

The convective term, β

In order to deeply understand the meaning of the parameter β we should explain how this one phase model (mainly solid phase model) can be considered a simplification of a gas-solid two phase model where we have retained the enthalpy transported in the gas phase. The transported enthalpy in the gas phase is

In the following we differentiate between input variables and model parameters. Input variables are magnitudes that can be measured with more or less precision, and they are summarised in Table 1
                        . Model parameters are unknowns, although their physical meaning can provide an approximate idea of their range, as explained above for β. The three parameters of our fire model are listed in Table 2

In practice, Eqs. (19)–(21) are solved only in a neighborhood of the fire flame front.

As radiation essentially comes from the flames we shall consider a physical model in which the gases produced by pyrolysis burn above the fuel layer, producing a flame over that layer. The flame emits radiation reaching the points ahead of the flame heating the non burned fuel around it, allowing the propagation of the fire.

To evaluate radiation from flames we distinguish the case without wind (vertical flame with rectangular section) and the case with wind (tilted flame).

In [15] we obtain for a rectangular flame the energy per unit area at the point x which is given by

                            is the radiation matrix. In practice only the terms in the neighborhood of the flame are calculated.

When wind is present, a radiation matrix Rℓ corresponding to each layer of the tilted flame is considered. The radiation matrix is computed only once (outside the time loop).

A first step to validate any mathematical model is the global sensitivity analysis [16,17] of its factors (input variables and model parameters)

                      in order to determine which are most influential in model outputs Y. The aim of sensitivity analysis is precisely to assess the importance of each factor in the values of the output variable of the model. This is crucial when both the input variables (available data) and model parameters are affected by uncertainties, and fire propagation models are a good example of this situation. Global sensitivity analysis also allows the significance of interactions between the input variables to be quantified, which is frequently of great importance, in particular for parameter adjustment. The sensitivity analysis is not only critical for model validation but also serves to guide future research efforts by focusing on the factors mainly responsible for the uncertainty in the model. Global sensitivity analysis is widely used in environmental models [25] and, particularly, in forest fire propagation models [26].

There are many ways to perform global sensitivity analysis [27]. One of the most effective way to implement global sensitivity analysis is based on the decomposition of the variance of the output Y in a unique additive series of the variance of independent functions of increasing dimensionality

                     . This decomposition permits the effect on the model output uncertainty of each input variable, Xi
                     , to be assigned through the variances of the main effects, and of any group of input variables through higher-order variances (interaction effects). The sum of the main effect and all the variances in Eq. (25), where a certain variable Xi
                      is present, is the total effect. A small value for the total effect will be enough to state that the variable analyzed is not important, while the main effects will be useful to quantify the direct effect of variables on the output factor, although small values of the main effects are not sufficient guarantee to reject a variable since it may have a strong influence on the output variable through the interactions. The variances calculated for the main and total effects divided by the total model output variance give the sensitivity indices of first-order and total respectively, which allow the input variables to be ranked quantitatively.

Global sensitivity analysis assigns the uncertainty of the output variable to the uncertainty of input factors by the sampling approach of probability density functions (p.d.f.) associated with input factors: each of the input factors is varied simultaneously in a given interval following a given p.d.f., and the sensitivities are calculated over the whole range of variation of the input factors.

Two widely used global sensitivity analysis methods are the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) [28] and Sobol’s method [31], both included in the Simlab program (version 2.2) [32] used in this work. Both methods take into account the effect of the p.d.f. of each factor, consider the effect of the simultaneous variation of all factors, do not require that the model be additive or linear, and can treat grouped factors. Both Extended FAST and Sobol’s method provide first-order and total sensitivity indices.

The aim of the sensitivity analysis of our fire propagation model is on the one side, to verify the adequacy of the model, and on the other side, to design the parameter adjustment as efficiently as possible. For both, sensitivity analysis and parameter adjustment, the most expensive part in terms of computational time is the model evaluation. With the goal of reduce the computational cost, the sensitivity analysis and the parameter adjustment of our fire propagation model was carried out in this paper for a set of laboratory experiments reported in [18]. Experimental results are always necessary to adjust and validate any type of model. In the case of wildland fire models, there are experimental results with very different scales: from real wildland fires to experimental fires in a laboratory. Although the aim of the model described here is to simulate real wildland fires, experimental work at the laboratory scale is significant: in a real wildland fire it is costly and extremely difficult to obtain measurements of many of the variables whereas more accurate measurements can be made in laboratory experiments. In addition, from the point of view of the computational cost of the numerical simulations to be performed, the experimental scale is much more affordable.

The experiments reported in [18] were carried out in a low speed wind tunnel, on beds of Pinus pinaster needles. The wind tunnel has a bench of 3.00 m × 1.20 m where the last 2.00 m are movable between 0° and ±15°. The fuel bed consisted of a layer of Pinus pinaster needles of 2.0 m × 0.70 m on the center of the bench, with a depth of approximately 40 mm and an oven dry load of

The propagation fire model was implemented in C++, using the API OpenMP [29] in order to take advantage of the multiprocessor platforms to reduce the computational time. It was compiled using the GNU Compiler (GCC) version 4.9. These simulations were computed on a Dell Precision T7610 workstation, equipped with 2 Intel Xeon E5 2670 v2 processors (10 cores, each one working at a frequency of 2.50 GHz; 20 cores altogether) and 64GB RAM.

                     summarized in Tables 1 and 2, and two output variables, the rate of spread ROS, computed as the slope of the linear regression line used to fit the position of the fire front at each instant of time of the simulation, and the fire thickness FTH computed as the mean fire thickness measured at each instant of time of the simulation, both measured along the last 2.00 m.

Prior to the sensitivity analysis, we organize the variables into sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables using the Buckingham Π theorem [30], which provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. The aims of this dimensional analysis are to minimize the number of input factors to be considered and the interaction effects between them, and to get results as independent as possible of the dimension.

We assume that the output variable Y (ROS or FTH) can be written as a function of input variables and model parameters (input factors), more precisely,

                     1/2, ΔT. The number of fundamental dimensions to be considered are 4, i.e., mass, length, time and temperature. So from the Buckingham Π theorem, we can group all the variables into 7 dimensionless groups in the general case. Then we can put the output variable Y as a function of 6 dimensionless parameters Πi

A straightforward computation gives the expressions of the dimensionless factors Πi
                      shown in Table 3
                     , as well as their ranges computed from the values and ranges of the variables and parameters described above for the experimental example.

The sensitivity analysis was carried out for the 6 (resp. 5) dimensionless groups in (26) (resp. (27)), with a sample of size 
                        
                           N

                           4998
                        
                      for the Extended FAST method and a sample of size 
                        
                           N
                           =

                      for Sobol’s method in order to ensure a good estimation of the sensitivity indices [16,17], using the Simlab (version 2.2) software for sensitivity analysis [32]. Since there is no additional information, in a first approximation a uniform probability density function was selected for each of the dimensionless parameters. Both methods, Extended FAST and Sobol, provide very similar results, so for simplicity all figures correspond to the Extended FAST method.

In Fig. 2
                     , the first-order (black bars) and total (white bars) sensitivity indices computed with the Extended FAST method for the rate of spread ROS are represented for several slopes and no wind. The total indices for ROS are close to the first-order indices, so the correlation is minimal. Independently of the slope, without wind, the most relevant parameter is the one associated to the mean absorption coefficient,

                     . This shows that in low wind conditions the dominating mechanism of heat transfer in a wildland fire is radiation, as could be expected.

For the second output variable, the fire thickness FTH, the correlation is higher as can be seen in Fig. 3
                      where the values of first-order (black bars) and total (white bars) sensitivity indices are different. The results again, do not depend on the slope, and the most relevant parameter is also the one associated to the mean absorption coefficient,

                      becomes the most relevant input factor for ROS, independently of the slope, but depends strongly on the wind magnitude, since when wind is important wildland fire spread is dominated by convection. The order of importance of the other five input factors remains equal to conditions without wind, see Fig. 4

The sensitivity analysis allows us to state that our model reflect the most important fire heat transfer in each situation and provides insights about how to devise the parameter adjustment.

The global sensitivity analysis developed allows us to conclude that in conditions without wind the most influential parameter in terms of the rate of spread is the mean absorption coefficient of the radiation term a, and in terms of the fire thickness we can not discard the natural convection coefficient H. Under windy conditions, the correction factor of the convective term β is critical. The experimental examples selected allow us to fix the values of the other input factors with more accuracy and focus on the adjustment of the unknown parameters a, H and β of the model, first a and H without wind, and then β under windy conditions, in order to validate the model proposed and test out the order of magnitude of the model parameters.

An initial proposal for the objective function could be in terms of the two output variables used in the global sensitivity analysis but this has proved very weak due to two basics reasons, the lack of data about the fire thickness in [18] and the fact that the richer the objective function, the better the adjustment is. The objective function we proposed takes into account the time ti
                      that the fire front needs to arrive to a distance xi
                      from the initial fire line, from

We used a direct search method to solve the optimization problems (28) and (29). These methods do not require any information about the gradient of the objective function, and search a set of points around the current point, looking for one where the value of the objective function is lower than the value at the current point. This kind of methods are widely used, also in fire modeling, [33]. In particular, for problem (28), we employed a Hooke and Jeeves method [34] consisting of an application of the cyclic coordinate method in addition to a pattern search. In addition, a golden section search method is implemented to minimize along each search direction. For problem (29), we use a Fibonacci method. The parameters should be positive, so it is a constrained optimization problem, for the convergence of direct search algorithms for constrained minimization see [35].

In Table 4
                     
                      we summarize: (1) the rate of spread (ROSe
                     ) measured in the experiments of [18] for the different slopes and moisture contents mentioned above, in conditions without wind; (2) the adjusted values of a and H computed with the described Hooke and Jeeves method performed in C++, with a mean computational cost of 748 s and one iteration of the Hooke and Jeeves algorithm; (3) the corresponding rate of spread (ROSc
                     ) computed for these adjusted values with the model. As might be expected, the adjusted values of the mean absorption coefficient of the radiation term a do not vary significantly neither with the slope nor with the moisture content and flame temperature, always within the same order of magnitude. The Pearson variation coefficient of a, that is, the relative standard deviation (rate of standard deviation and mean expressed as a percentage) is 11%, so the variation of the adjusted values of a is small. Even though the lack of data about the fire thickness in [18] limits our options, we obtain a good adjustment of the natural convection coefficient H within the same order of magnitude, and a small Pearson variation coefficient 9%.

In the case the wind is present (Table 5), we adjust the correction factor of the convective term β minimizing (29) with a Fibonacci method implemented in C++, with a mean computational cost less than 30 s. The variability of β is higher but the obtained values remain within an appropriate interval from the physical point of view (see (6) and its explanation).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Some attempts have been made to validate the simplified physical fire model developed by authors.

The model is simple enough to depend on a few parameters but sufficiently precise to reflect important phenomena for the evolution of a fire, taking into account the orography, the fuel load and type, the temperature, the humidity and the wind, and the most important mechanisms of heat transfer: convection and radiation.

The model has been applied to a set of experimental examples for which data were available. The experimental scale allows to obtain measurements of many of the involved variables more feasible and accurate than in real fires, and reduces the computational cost of the numerical simulations to be performed.

A global sensitivity analysis has been carried out over the simplified physical fire model at experimental scale, focus the analysis on the model parameters and the input variables difficult to be measured. The results obtained from this analysis allow us to conclude that the model properly reflects the importance of radiation in no wind conditions, and convection in windy conditions.

The adjustment of the model parameters has been designed according the results of the global sensitivity analysis and available data. Each of the three model parameters a, H and β remains in the same order of magnitude independently of fuel moisture, slope and wind conditions, which gives validity to the model.
