                  Back injury caused by sudden loading is a significant risk among workers that perform manual handling tasks. The present study investigated the effects of load handling position on trunk biomechanics (flexion angle, L5/S1 joint moment and compression force) during sudden loading. Eleven subjects were exposed to a 6.8 kg sudden loading while standing upright, facing forward and holding load at three different vertical heights in the sagittal plane or 45° left to the sagittal plane (created by arm rotation). Results showed that the increase of load holding height significantly elevated the peak L5/S1 joint compression force and reduced the magnitude of trunk flexion. Further, experiencing sudden loading from an asymmetric direction resulted in significantly smaller peak L5/S1 joint compression force, trunk flexion angle and L5/S1 joint moment than a symmetric posture. These findings suggest that handling loads in a lower position could work as a protective strategy during sudden loading.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Each year in the United States, work-related back injury causes over one hundred million lost work days (Guo et al., 1999) and billions of dollars of direct (e.g. medical) and indirect (e.g. lost productive time) costs (Frymoyer and Cats-Baril, 1991; Maetzel and Li, 2002; Stewart et al., 2003; Yelin and Callahan, 1995). According to the United States national data, back injury accounts for 42% of all reported occupational musculoskeletal disorders with even higher rates reported from occupations that involve manual handling tasks such as nurses (53%), nursing aides (55%), and laborers (44%) (BLS, 2012).

During the performance of manual handling tasks, sudden loading due to loss of control or external impact can cause back injuries (Manning et al., 1984; McCoy et al., 1997; Omino and Hayashi, 1992). When the human trunk experiences sudden loading, both reflexive and voluntary muscle contractions are initiated to increase stability and regain balance (Cholewicki et al., 1997). However, such instantaneous muscle reactions elevate spinal compression (Granata and Marras, 2000) especially when the load is unexpected (Marras et al., 1987). Previous studies have reported that the magnitude of mechanical loading on spine (such as spinal compression and shear forces) is directly associated with the risk of back injuries (Bakker et al., 2007; Norman et al., 1998). When such loading exceeds the tolerance limit, tissue damage may occur (Marras, 2000). Therefore, to mitigate the risk of back injury during manual handling, it is critical to develop load coping strategies that can reduce the biomechanical impacts to the spine caused by sudden loading.

A number of protective strategies have been previously investigated. Studies have shown that the presence of warning signals prior to a sudden loading event significantly reduced the average muscle activation level by 49.8% (Lavender et al., 1989), reduced the spinal compression force by 16% (Lavender and Marras, 1995), and increased spinal stability (Mawston et al., 2007). In addition, appropriate training practices and increased experience helped reduce spinal compression force by 29% and peak L5/S1 joint moment by 25% (Lavender et al., 1993; Lawrence et al., 2005). A recent study discovered that maintaining a staggered foot stance during the impact of sudden loading could significantly reduce trunk flexion angle by 4.1° and L5/S1 joint moment by 6.6 Nm compare to parallel stance (Zhou et al., 2013). Although the above methods have been explored to develop protective strategies to cope with sudden loading, the effect of load handling position on trunk biomechanics has not been investigated.

Granata and colleagues discovered elevated trunk muscle co-activation with an increase of load vertical height when performing static weight holding tasks (Granata and Orishimo, 2001). Such an increase of trunk muscle activity enhances trunk stiffness and stability; however, it also increases spinal loading and the associated risk of back injury (Lavender et al., 1993). Another study explored the impact of sudden loading on trunk biomechanical responses during stoop lifting. Results of that study discovered significantly larger postural disturbance and spinal loading when the subject experienced sudden loading in more flexed trunk postures (i.e. lower load height) (Chow et al., 2003).

Furthermore, asymmetric lifting has been shown to elevate the risk of LBP due to increased torsional and spinal shear loadings caused by axial trunk rotation and lateral bending (Waters et al., 1993). However, much less is known regarding the biomechanical impact of a sudden loading from an asymmetric direction. One study investigated the effect of load dropping direction (symmetric or asymmetric) on trunk muscle activity and found 37% increase and 55% decrease in muscle activation levels of contralateral and ipsilateral trunk extensor muscles respectively when load was dropped from an asymmetric direction (Lavender et al., 1989). However, in that study the dropping load had a larger moment arm in the asymmetric condition and spinal loading was not estimated. A recent study investigated the impact of an asymmetrically released hand load on the biomechanical responses of human trunk when standing still and facing forward (i.e. without trunk rotation) (Zhou et al., 2013). Interestingly, the results of this study demonstrated that when trunk rotation is eliminated and load moment arm is controlled, an asymmetrically released load caused smaller trunk flexion and L5/S1 joint moment in comparison to load released from a symmetric position. Despite the previous evidence, however, the potential interaction effect between the load releasing height and horizontal position (i.e. asymmetry) on trunk biomechanical responses during sudden loading has not been investigated.

The present study was designed to understand whether load handling position can be used in the design of protective strategies against back injuries caused by sudden loading. More specifically, the objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of load handling height and load asymmetry (created by arm rotation but not trunk rotation) on trunk biomechanical responses when experiencing sudden loading. According to the previous findings, we hypothesized that one will experience greater spinal compression force, but smaller postural perturbation when a load is handled at a higher position and released suddenly. As suggested by previous research (Zhou et al., 2013), we expect to observe smaller trunk flexion when the load is handled and suddenly released from an asymmetrical position than in a symmetrical position.

@&#METHOD@&#

Eleven male subjects with mean (SD) height, mass, and age of 176.6 (3.4) cm, 71.2 (6.5) kg, and 26.7 (2.0) years respectively volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects with no previous training or working experience in manual material handling were recruited from the student population of West Virginia University, and none reported a previous history of low back pain or upper/lower limb injuries. The experimental procedure was approved by the university's Research Integrity and Compliance Committee.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

Two independent variables were involved in the current experimental design: vertical load handling position (HEIGHT, three levels) and transverse load handling position (ASYM, two levels). These two independent variables collectively describe the location of both hands and the load (the load was always in the hands (Fig. 1
                        ) before the sudden releasing event). In all testing conditions, trunk remained forward facing. The three HEIGHT levels were defined with respect to participants' anthropometry: ‘High’ (eyebrow level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of eyebrows), ‘Middle’ (shoulder level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of clavicle bone), and ‘Low’ (umbilicus level: the initial holding height of the load aligns with the height of umbilicus). The two ASYM load positions were: ‘Symmetry’ (in the midsagittal plane) and ‘Asymmetry’ (45° leftward to the midsagittal plane). The effect of transverse load handling location has been previously investigated (Zhou et al., 2013). In the current study the interaction between HEIGHT and ASYM was explored. The combination of the two independent variables created six different load handling positions (Fig. 1). To control the effect of distance of the load on spinal loading, the straight line distance between the projected location of the load center of mass and the center of the subjects' ankles were kept constant at 45 cm across all conditions. Each subject performed a total of 24 trials (four repetitions for each of the 6 conditions) with the sequence completely randomized.

Three dependent variables were considered in the current study: 1. Increase of trunk flexion angle: the magnitude of increase in trunk flexion angle from initial trunk posture to the peak trunk flexion during the sudden loading; 2. Increase of L5/S1 joint moment: the difference between the initial joint moment and the maximum joint moment during the sudden loading; 3. Peak L5/S1 joint compression: the maximum spinal compressive force during the sudden loading as computed by an EMG-assisted biomechanical model (described in detail in the ‘Biomechanical model’ section below).

A wood structure was created to hang the load at different height levels. The load was made from standard disc weights and secured through their centre holes using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe which also served as a handle for subjects to hold (Zhou et al., 2013). The total weight of the load was 6.8 kg (15 lbs).

A surface electromyography (EMG) system (Model: Bagnoli, Delsys Inc, Boston, MA, USA) was used to record EMG signals at 1000 Hz from eight trunk muscles: left and right rectus abdominis (electrodes placed 2 cm above the umbilicus and 3 cm from the midline of the abdomen); left and right external obliques (10 cm from the midline of the abdomen and 4 cm above the ilium with an angle of 45° to the midline of the abdomen); left and right erector spinae (4 cm from the midline of L3 vertebra); left and right multifidus (2 cm from the midline of L4 vertebra). An eight camera (MX-13 series) 3D optical motion tracking system (Vicon, Nexus, Oxford, UK) was used to capture trunk and upper extremity kinematics at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Eleven reflective markers were placed over the following positions: C7, T12, and L5 vertebrae; the most dorsal point of the acromioclavicular joint of the left and right shoulders; the most caudal point of the lateral epicondyle of the left and right elbows; the ulnar side of both wrists; the middle of the third metacarpal bone on both hands. Nexus 10.7 software (Vicon, Nexus, Oxford, UK) was used to record and synchronize both EMG and kinematics data. During the trunk muscle maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials, a lumbar dynamometer (Humac Norm, CSMi, MA, USA) and the attached back flexion-extension module were used to restrict subjects' pelvis and lower extremity and provide static resistance against trunk muscle maximum exertions.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

The experimental procedure was first explained to the subjects and the signed informed consent was obtained. A brief warm-up session was provided after the measurement of subjects' basic anthropometric data (body stature, mass, trunk length (from L5/S1 joint to the top of head), width (at iliac and xiphiod process levels) and depth (at iliac and xiphiod process levels)) to warm up muscles and have subjects practice the sudden loading tasks and familiarize with the experiment protocol. Eight bi-polar EMG surface electrodes were then attached to the skin of the aforementioned muscles after the skin was swabbed with alcohol. At the beginning of the data collection subjects first performed three repetitions of isometric maximum trunk extension/flexion exertions at a 20° trunk flexion posture against a static resistance provided by the dynamometer. Each MVC exertion lasted for 5 s and at least 2 min of rest was provided between repetitions to prevent muscle fatigue. EMG signals recorded during the MVC trials were later used to normalize the experimental EMG data.

Following the MVC trials, eleven reflective markers were fitted to the aforementioned locations and subjects then performed all 24 experimental trials in a completely randomized order. During data collection, subjects were instructed to stand straight and hold the load such that the distance between the projected location of the center of the load and the midpoint of the subjects' ankles remained constant (45 cm) among all conditions and trials (controlled by labels on the ground and assistance from experimenters). In the current study, elbow joint angles were not controlled in order to achieve designated postures. In asymmetrical load position conditions, subjects rotated their arms leftward, kept their torso forward and maintained the same horizontal load distance as in the symmetrical conditions. In each trial, subjects stood with eyes closed, feet shoulder width apart, and were required to hold the load firmly but without supporting the weight of the load; the load was then suddenly released by an experimenter without notice (Fig. 1). Subjects were instructed to immediately arrest the falling load, carry it back to approximately its original position, and hold it stably at this position for 3 s. At least 2 min of rest was provided between trials to prevent muscle fatigue.

EMG signals were first filtered (band-pass filtered between 10 and 500 Hz and notch filtered at 60 Hz and its aliases) and rectified, then smoothed with a 200 sample (0.2 s) sliding window. EMG signals from all experimental trials were then normalized with respect to the maximum EMG activities collected during MVC trials for each muscle. The exported three dimensional coordination data of the reflective markers were used to calculate trunk and upper extremity kinematics. The trunk flexion angle was defined as the angle formed by the line connecting the C7 and L5 reflective markers and the transverse plane (Ning et al., 2011).

In the present study, the external moment at the L5/S1 joint was estimated using a multi-segment dynamic model in which seven body segments (trunk, left and right upper arm, forearm, and hand) and the external load were included. The mass and center of mass of all body segments were estimated according to previous work (Pheasant, 1986). A previously established and validated EMG-assisted biomechanical model (Marras and Granata, 1997) was used to calculate the muscle forces and the corresponding internal moment and spinal compression force at the L5/S1 joint. In this model, L5/S1 joint internal moment was estimated using equation (1), in which “Gain
                        
                           i

                           i
                        ” represent muscle gain value, the normalized EMG and muscle cross-sectional area of trunk muscle i respectively; “f(l
                        
                           i
                        
                        )” and “f(v
                        
                           i
                        
                        )” are the muscle force-length and force-velocity modulation factors of muscle i respectively (Davis et al., 1998; Marras and Granata, 1997). These five factors can be used to estimate force generated by muscle i. The additional factor “r
                        
                           i
                        ” is the moment arm vector of the trunk muscle i. The L5/S1 joint compression forces were estimated according to trunk muscle forces, trunk kinematics and geometry (e.g. line of action). The subject-specified moment arms (r) and cross sectional areas (A) of the trunk muscles considered in the model were estimated using the predictive equations from earlier studies (Jorgensen et al., 2001; Marras et al., 2001) with the measured anthropometry (body height, mass; trunk length, width and depth) as inputs. The maximum muscle stress (gain) value was then determined by matching the internal and external moments at the static load holding period (the last 3 s) of all trials.

Minitab statistical software (Minitab v.15, Minitab Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The assumptions of the ANOVA were first tested (Montgomery, 2005). Dependent variables that violated the assumptions were transformed using deterministic mathematical function. When all assumptions were satisfied, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were performed to reveal the statistical significance of independent variables HEIGHT and ASYM as well as their interaction effect on all dependent variables. Variables with significant effects were then analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with ‘subject’ considered as a blocking factor. Finally, Tukey–Kramer post-hoc tests were conducted on dependent variables that were significantly affected by HEIGHT to further investigate the differences between each two HEIGHT levels. The criteria p-value was set as 0.05 for all statistical tests.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Results of MANOVA revealed significant effects of HEIGHT, ASYM, and their interaction. Univariate ANOVA results demonstrated that both HEIGHT and ASYM significantly affected all three dependent variables. Only the increase of trunk flexion angle and L5/S1 joint moment were significantly influenced by the interactive effects between HEIGHT and ASYM (Table 1
                     ).

The effects of HEIGHT on all dependent variables are demonstrated in Figs. 2 to 4
                     
                     
                     . A significant increase of the peak L5/S1 joint compression force (on average from 2111N to 2486N) was observed with an increase of load height (Fig. 2). Reduced trunk flexion was also observed (on average from 6.5° to 3.8°) with an increase in load height (Fig. 3). Finally, significantly a greater L5/S1 joint moment (83.5 Nm) was observed at the ‘Middle’ height condition, while the difference between ‘Low’ and ‘High’ conditions was not statistically significant (Fig. 4).

The effects of ASYM on all dependent variables are shown in Table 2
                     . Significantly smaller increases of trunk flexion angle, L5/S1 moment, and peak L5/S1 joint compression force were found under the ‘Asymmetry’ condition. Furthermore, significant interaction effects between HEIGHT and ASYM for the increase of trunk flexion angle and L5/S1 joint moment were observed (Fig. 5
                      and Fig. 6
                     ). In the ‘Symmetry’ condition, the increase of load height resulted in smaller increase of trunk flexion. However, in the ‘Asymmetry’ condition the largest increase of trunk flexion was found in the ‘Middle’ condition. As showing in Fig. 6 the largest L5/S1 joint moment was observed in the ‘Middle’ height condition in both ASYM conditions. However, the smallest L5/S1 joint moments were found in the ‘High’ and ‘Low’ levels in symmetric and asymmetric postures, respectively. These data also further indicated that the main effect of ASYM is primarily caused by the differences in the ‘High’ and ‘Low’ levels, but less by the variation in the ‘Middle’ level.

In addition to the three dependent variables, several related kinematics variables were also analyzed. We found that HEIGHT significantly affected the magnitude of arm rotation (changes of sagittal angle from initial arm posture to the maximum downward arm rotation during sudden loading), initial trunk posture, initial load moment arm and the change of moment arm about L5/S1 joint (changes of load moment arm from initial posture to the point where peak moment was observed). As showing in Table 3
                     , significantly greater arm rotations were observed in the ‘High’ and ‘Middle’ height levels, compared with the ‘Low’ level. Significantly smaller initial trunk flexion angle was observed in the ‘Low’ than the ‘Middle’ and ‘High’ HEIGHT conditions. Initial load moment arm about L5/S1 joint was significantly smaller in the ‘High’ level than the ‘Middle’ and ‘Low’ levels. During the sudden loading event, the peak L5/S1 moment occurred with reduced load moment arm (the load is closer to the body) in the ‘Low’ level, but increased load moment arm (the load is further away from the body) in the ‘Middle’ and ‘High’ levels.

To explain our results, muscle EMG data were also examined. Normalized EMG (NEMG) (with respect to MVC) data prior to the sudden loading event were first examined, results showed that the average (SD) activities of erector spinae and multifidus are 4.8% (0.2%) and 4.1% (0.2%), respectively, which indicated that the back extensor muscles were relatively relaxed before the sudden loading event (Jin et al., 2012). In addition, the effect of HEIGHT on the trunk muscle peak NEMG during sudden loading was also investigated. Results demonstrated significantly elevated muscle activities among back extensor muscles and external oblique with the increase of HEIGHT (Fig. 7
                     ).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Confirming our initial hypotheses, results of the present study demonstrated increased spinal compression force and reduced trunk flexion at higher load handling positions. These results can be explained by the stability and muscle co-contraction levels associated with different load handling height conditions. An earlier study demonstrated that the increase of load height elevated trunk muscle co-contraction during static weight holding due to reduced trunk stability (Granata and Orishimo, 2001); this increased trunk muscle activity would consequently increase spinal compression (Granata and Marras, 2000). Results of the current study supported the previous findings (Fig. 7). Because of the strong positive association between spinal compression and the occurrence of low back injury (Kerr et al., 2001); our results indicated that handling load at lower height (i.e. the umbilicus level) helps reduce the risk of back injury when experiencing sudden loading during material handling.

The increase of load handling height also resulted in smaller trunk flexion (Fig. 3). As we have discussed above, the increase of load handling height may elevate the trunk muscle co-contraction (Granata and Orishimo, 2001), which results in higher global trunk stiffness, and smaller trunk bending under external impact (Granata and Marras, 2000). On the other hand, the magnitude of sagittal arm rotation may have also influenced trunk motion during sudden loading. As is shown in Table 3, significantly larger arm rotations were observed in the ‘High’ and ‘Middle’ height levels; such an increase in arm rotation may compensate for trunk motion and result in reduced trunk flexion.

In the current study the largest increase of L5/S1 joint moment was observed at the ‘Middle’ height level (Fig. 4). According to the multi-segment model, the external moment on the L5/S1 joint is affected by the magnitude of external loads and their corresponding moment arms. In-depth analysis of the kinematic data revealed that even though the horizontal distance between the load and the centre of ankles was controlled, subjects maintained slightly extended initial trunk postures when grasping load in the ‘High’ condition. This posture increased lumbar lordosis and decreased the initial moment arm between the L5/S1 joint and the load. Such reduction in moment arm could result in a smaller moment during sudden loading. In addition, although the initial moment arms of the external load were similar between the ‘Low’ and ‘Middle’ levels, when releasing the load from the ‘Low’ position the natural arm rotation brought the load closer to the human body which decreased the moment arm (an average decrease of 33.3 mm from the initial posture to the point that peak moment was observed) of the external load. In contrast, moment arms increased during sudden loading in both ‘Middle’ and ‘High’ levels (on average 60.6 mm and 20.4 mm increases from the initial posture to the point of peak moment respectively, as shown in Table 3). Consequently, the changes of moment arms in different conditions largely determined the results of the L5/S1 joint moment.

Results of the present study demonstrated a significantly smaller increase of trunk flexion angle, L5/S1 joint moment, and peak L5/S1 joint compression force in the ‘Asymmetry’ load releasing position than the ‘Symmetry’ position (Table 2). These results were in agreement with the findings of a previous study (Zhou et al., 2013). It has been suggested that asymmetric trunk posture increases torsional and lateral moment during lifting, therefore elevate the risk of back injury (Hooper et al., 1998). However the asymmetric load handling posture tested in the current study did not involved trunk twisting motion (subjects were instructed to always face forward). Therefore, minor changes in spinal shear loading (both anterior-posterior and lateral shear forces) were generated due to the relatively small magnitude of posture perturbations (e.g. on average 5.0 degrees of trunk flexion). It should be noted that the current results only stand when handling relatively light load (e.g. 6.8 kg) with the forward facing trunk postures. It is very likely that when handling a heavier load in flexed and/or rotated trunk postures, the sudden impact from an asymmetric direction could generate much higher torsional and shear spinal loading thereby elevates the risk of back injury.

Interestingly, a significant interaction effect between HEIGHT and ASYM was also observed (Figs. 5 and 6). In the ‘Symmetry’ condition, the increase of load height consistently reduced the magnitude of trunk flexion. However in the ‘Asymmetry’ condition the largest trunk flexion was found in the ‘Middle’ condition instead of in ‘Low’ condition (Fig. 5). In addition, the largest L5/S1 joint moment was consistently found in the ‘Middle’ height condition in both ASYM conditions. However, the smallest L5/S1 joint moments were found in the ‘Low’ and ‘High’ conditions when holding the load in asymmetric and symmetric postures, respectively (Fig. 6). In asymmetric load positions, the direction of external load and the sagittal plane formed a 45° angle, which resulted in shorter moment arms to the rotation axis of sagittal trunk flexion than in symmetric conditions; therefore sudden loading in asymmetric conditions could generate less trunk flexion which was supported by the previous study (Zhou et al., 2013). In the current study this effect was more pronounced when holding the load at the ‘Low’ condition with lower trunk flexion angle and the resultant L5/S1 moment observed.

There are several noteworthy limitations of the present study. First, due to the relatively small trunk flexion during sudden loading, only spinal compression force was evaluated. More comprehensive spinal loading (compression force, shear force and torsional force etc.) should be assessed in future studies especially when experiencing larger trunk posture perturbations. Second, in the current study, the horizontal distance between the external load and the mid-point of the ankles was controlled to help maintain constant initial moment arm from the centre of the load to the L5/S1 joint. However this purpose was not attained due to the slight trunk hyperextension postures subjects maintained in higher load handling positions. Although our results are very unlikely to be caused by these changes (despite having the greatest spinal compression, the load moment arm in ‘High’ condition (487.5 mm) was even smaller than the ‘Middle’ and ‘Low’ conditions (518.7 and 515.0 mm respectively), but we observed the greatest spinal compression in the “High” condition (Table 3)). Third, this study was conducted in a controlled lab environment with all subjects recruited from the student population, and a comparatively light load (6.8 kg) was used. The response of experienced workers to a much heavier load in a real working environment warrants future investigation. Forth, in the current study the asymmetric load position was created by rotating arms toward the left side of the body, yet the impact of handedness was not considered.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The results of the present study provided important information regarding the impact of sudden loading on trunk biomechanical responses when handling load at different height and asymmetry positions. And it must be noted again that the straight line distance between the load and the centre of ankles was kept constant in all experimental conditions, and asymmetric posture was formed by rotating arms while keeping trunk facing forward. According to our results, it was concluded that handling sudden loading at a lower (e.g. umbilicus) height could help reduce the risk of low back injury compared with the other tested height levels. The asymmetric loading handling position generated by arm rotation resulted in smaller spinal compression and L5/S1 joint moment, however, its impact on torsional and shear spinal loading needs further investigation.
