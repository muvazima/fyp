                  The aim of this study is to predict the core and skin temperatures of human wearing protective clothing in hot environments using the coupling system. The coupling system consisted of a sweating manikin Newton controlled by a multi-node human thermal model, and responded dynamically to the thermal environment as human body. Validation of the coupling system results was conducted by comparison with the subject tests. Five healthy men wearing protective clothing were exposed to the thermal neutral and high temperature environments. The skin temperatures of seven body segments and the rectal temperatures were recorded continuously. The predictions of core temperatures made by the coupling system showed good agreement with the experimental data, with maximum difference of 0.19 °C and RMSD of 0.12 °C. The predicted mean skin temperatures fell outside of the 95% CI for most points, whereas the difference between the simulated results and measured data was no more than 1 °C which is acceptable. The coupling system predicted the local skin temperatures reasonably with the maximum local skin temperature of 1.30 °C. The coupling system has been validated and exhibited reasonable accuracy compared with the experimental results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, researches about the physiological responses of firefighters in hot environments have aroused extensive concern, which are important for the heat stress assessment and the design of the personal protective clothing (PC). The personal protective clothing, the only and irreplaceable protection for firefighters, includes a thermal layer and a moisture barrier layer to prevent heat and hot water passing through the material to the human body (Barr et al., 2010; Holmer, 2006; Park et al., 2015). However, personal protective clothing may cause discomfort and even lead to intolerable heat strain in hot environments, as the multi layers limit the heat exchange with the environmental conditions (Havenith, 1999; Perroni et al., 2014; Song et al., 2011).

In the past decades, methods including the subject test, manikin experiment, and thermal model simulation have been used to study the human physiological responses, such as the skin temperature, core temperature, heart rate, and heat exchange between human body and environment. The manikins have been widely applied in the measurement of clothing thermal properties and the evaluation of the local heat exchange. However, the manikin cannot simulate human physiological responses and perceptions (Psikuta et al., 2013). Several human thermal models have been developed to simulate human physiological responses (Fiala et al., 2001; Stolwijk et al., 1973; Tanabe et al., 2002; Zolfaghari and Maerefat, 2010). Most of those thermal models focused on the heat transfer process in normal temperatures, in which, the upper limit of ambient temperature usually does not exceed 40 °C (Weng et al., 2014). Nelson et al. (2009), Weng et al. (2014), and Yang et al. (2014) presented thermal models to simulate the human physiological responses in hot environments. Kim et al. (2013), Raimundo and Figueiredo (2009), Richards and Fiala (2004), and Yokota et al. (2014) predicted the human physiological responses for the human wearing protective clothing. Those models only used the thermal insulation and evaporation resistance to simulate the heat and moisture transfer in the protective clothing. However, the heat and mass transfer in the multi-layer protective clothing was quite complex. It is likely to be inaccurate for the thermal models to predict the physiological responses of firefighters in hot environments (Havenith, 2001; Wang et al., 2011).

Based on the limits of the two methods, several studies (Burke et al., 2009, 2010; Redortier and Voelcker, 2010) have coupled the manikin with thermal model to predict human physiological responses in the environment temperatures from 30 °C to 47.5 °C. Psikuta et al. (2008a) developed the single-sector and multi-sector physiological coupling systems. Compared to the multi-sector coupling system, the single-sector one can simulate the mean skin and core temperatures more accurately. However, in this single-sector coupling system,the local skin temperatures cannot be obtained. Blood and Burke (2010) developed a coupling system to simulate the core and mean skin temperatures in the environments range from 5 °C to 47.5 °C, but the maximum difference between the simulated results and the experimental data was close 1.5 °C for the mean skin temperatures. Rugh and Lustbader (2006) developed a coupling system to simulate skin temperatures, but the predicted deviation of the local skin temperature was up to 4.2 °C. Those coupling systems demonstrated better performance in conditions close to thermo-neutral, but none of them exhibited high accuracy in a wide range of environmental conditions (Psikuta et al., 2013). In fact, firefighters often work in hot environments. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a coupling system to accurately predict physiological responses of the whole body and local segments in hot environments for practical use.

The core temperature is one of the most important physiological variables and skin temperature is a useful indicator for the body (Psikuta et al., 2012). The core and skin temperatures were simulated by the coupling system in hot environments with two types of protective clothing. Human subjects tests were conducted in climate chamber, and local skin temperatures and rectal temperatures were recorded continuously. The simulated results of the coupling system were then validated against the experimental data.

@&#METHODS@&#

Five healthy male college students volunteered to participate in the study (mean ± standard deviation (SD): age25.4 ± 2.1 yr, height 173.6 ± 3.2 cm, body weight 66.5 ± 5.0 kg, body surface area 1.8 ± 0.1 m2). This study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Tsinghua University and all subjects signed the consent form prior to their participation. All the subjects were not allowed to perform intensive activities and drink alcohol before the experiments.

Two types of protective clothing (PC1 and PC2) for firefighters were selected for each subject. In addition the accessories include firefighter boots, gloves, and helmet. Both PC consist of four layers: an outer shell to resist heat source, a waterproof but vapor permeable moisture barrier, a thermal barrier and an inner comfort layer (Table 1
                           ). According to ASTM F1291-05 (2005) and ASTM F2370-05 (2005), the total thermal insulation and evaporative resistance of the two types of PC were measured by the sweating manikin Newton, which are 2.19 clo and 0.18 kPam2/W for the PC1, and 2.35 clo and 0.30 kPam2/W for the PC2, respectively.

Local skin temperatures and rectal temperatures were measured. The rectal temperature senor (YSI 402, Measurement specialties Inc., USA, ±0.1 °C) was inserted into the anal sphincter. Seven skin temperature sensors (YSI 427, Measurement specialties Inc., USA, ±0.1 °C) were taped on the forehead, chest, upper arm, hand, thigh, calf, and foot (Fig. 1
                           ). The skin temperatures and core temperatures were recorded with an interval of 5 s during the tests. Dubois seven point method (Dubois and Dubois, 1989) was used to calculate the mean skin temperature by the skin temperature of seven segments (1–7 refers to the head, trunk, arm, head, thigh, calf and foot) as follows:

Two sets of experiments were conducted in two climate chambers, marked as chamber A and chamber B (Fig. 2
                           ). The temperature and the humidity of those chambers were controlled independently, which were kept at 29 °C and 40%, and 45 °C and 40%, respectively. Before the tests, the subject was sedentary in the climate chamber A for an hour. The participators dressed with PC were then exposed to two environments for an hour: the thermal neutral (Phase 1) and high temperatures (Phase 2) for each half an hour, respectively. Each subject was randomly selected and performed trails with PC1 and PC2 at the same environmental conditions. All the experiments were conducted during the same period of day to eliminate circadian rhythms.

The 20-zone sweating thermal manikin Newton (Measurement Technology Northwest, USA) has the size of an average adult Asian male body. The temperature, heat, and sweating rate of each zone could be independently controlled with the software ThermDAC. The manikin can be controlled using either a constant temperature mode or a constant heat mode. The temperatures of each zone were measured by an array of temperature coefficient resistance wire sensors, which are about 0.5 mm under the shell with the precision of ±0.1 °C. A well-fitted knit cotton fabric about 0.1 mm in thickness was used as ‘skin’ which holds the water inside the body and helps the manikin distributing water throughout its surface (Ueno and Sawada, 2012).

A multi-node thermal model (Yang et al., 2014) was used to simulate human physiological responses under transient conditions. It has 20 body segments as that of the manikin Newton, and consists of the passive system and active system. The model needs the input of human–clothing–environment parameters, including the air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, thermal insulation and evaporation resistance of clothing.

The model was validated by comparison with the results of semi-nude subject tests both in neutral and hot environments, with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of core temperatures, mean skin temperatures, and local skin temperatures no more than 0.07 °C, 0.25 °C, 0.70 °C, respectively. The maximum differences between the simulated data and the measured results were less than 0.13 °C for the core temperature and 0.59 °C for the mean skin temperature (Yang et al., 2014).

The coupling system consisted of the thermal sweating manikin Newton controlled by the multi-node thermal mode (Fig. 3
                           ). The manikin can be seen as a sensor which simplifies the complex clothing and environmental heat transfer into local heat loss measurements from the skin (Rugh and Lustbader, 2006). The skin temperature and sweating rate for each manikin segments were adjusted according to the simulation results of the thermal model (Perroni et al., 2014). The measured heat flux was used as the feedback for the thermal model to predict the physiological responses for the next time interval (Psikuta et al., 2008b). The coupling system was operated by repeating the cycles of data exchange. As the model stepped forward, the coupling system could provide skin temperatures in real-time. Other physiological parameters such as core temperature and blood flow rate could also be calculated by the thermal model.

Before the tests, the manikin was seated in a wheel chair in the climate chamber A for an hour. During the tests, the manikin wore either the PC1 or the PC2 and was then exposed to the stepwise changes in environments as those in subject tests. The trunk core temperatures predicted by the coupling system were compared with the measured rectal temperatures. The flux measurement error by the manikin influences the prediction of the thermal model. The mean relative error the flux measured in manikin was 2% of the measured value for majority of cases and 7% for the small gradient (e.g. 5 °C) between the ambient and the surface temperature. The simulated core temperature and mean skin temperature varied by less than ±0.01 °C and ±0.18 °C for the 2% heat flux error measurement, and up to ±0.11 °C and ±0.40 °C for the 7% heat flux error measurement, respectively (Psikuta et al., 2008a).

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is frequently used to assess the good-of-fit between the measured results and predicted values for the core temperatures and skin temperatures (Castellani et al., 2007; Field, 2009; Wang et al., 2011). The RMSD was defined as follows:

                         is the predicted temperatures from the coupling system, °C; n is the number of subjects.

Generally, if the value of RMSD is smaller than that of standard deviation (SD), the predicted values from the coupling system coincide with the measured data from subject tests. Thus, it can be concluded that the coupling system could predict data acceptably (Bogerd et al., 2010). The 95 confidence interval (CI) was also used in this study. If the coupling system output falls outside of the 95% CI, the predicted data are more than two times higher than the mean standard deviation of the experimental data (Wang et al., 2013).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The coupling system was able to accurately predict the core temperatures both in the neutral temperature environment and hot environment (Fig. 4
                        ). All of the simulated values from the coupling system fell within the measured 95% confidence interval. The RMSD and SD values of core temperature were 0.02 °C and 0.38 °C for the PC1, and 0.12 °C and 0.28 °C for the PC2, respectively. The RMSD values for the core temperature were less than the SD values.

For the core temperature, a difference of 0.5 °C is considered “good agreement” between the simulated values and measured ones (Wissler, 1985). The maximum core temperature differences between simulation results and experimental data in the two phases were 0.02 °C and 0.05 °C for the PC1, and 0.18 °C and 0.19 °C for the PC2, respectively.

Most of the predicted mean skin temperature values fell outside of the 95% confidence interval (Fig. 5
                        ). The RMSD and SD values of the mean skin temperatures were 0.65 °C and 0.50 °C for the PC1, and 0.60 °C and 0.41 °C for the PC2, respectively. The RMSD values for the core temperature were higher than the SD values.

The coupling system over-predicted the mean skin temperatures. The maximum mean skin temperature differences in the two phases were 0.77 °C and 0.89 °C for the PC1, and 0.92 °C and 0.95 °C for the PC2, respectively. The differences of 1 °C between the measured and simulated mean skin temperatures were considered “acceptable” (Wissler, 1985). Haslam and Parsons (1994) considered a mean skin temperature difference of 1.6 °C to be “reasonable” for the calculated and measured values. Based on those criterions, the predictions of mean skin temperatures from the coupling system was acceptable.

The skin temperature differences between the simulated and measured values varied with local segments (Fig. 6
                         (a) Head, (b) Trunk, (c) Arm, (d) Hand, (e) Thigh, (f) Calf, (g) Foot). The simulations fell into the 95% confidence interval for the segments of head, arm, and hand. A large number of the simulated local skin temperature values fell outside the 95% confidence interval for the segments of trunk, thigh, calf, and foot. The values of RMSD were less than those of SD in the segments of head, arm, and hand for the PC1, and head, arm, hand, calf, and foot for the PC2.

The coupling system over-predicted the skin temperatures for the segments of trunk and thigh in the neutral environment, and over-predicted those for the segments of trunk, thigh, calf, and foot in the hot environment. The maximum local skin difference in the human segments of head, arm, hand, and foot was no more than 1 °C. Large differences were observed in the segments of trunk, thigh, and calf with the values of 1.27 °C, 1.30 °C, and 1.09 °C, respectively. Based on the study from Haslam and Parsons (1994), the coupling system can reasonably predict the skin temperatures.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the neutral environment, the measured local skin temperatures exhibited slight change over time for most segments, which was due to the fact that the temperature regulation of the human body is minimal in the thermally neutral environment (Munir et al., 2009). Under this condition, the rate of body heat storage is almost zero and the temperatures remain stable. However, the skin temperatures obtained by the coupling system showed increasing trend with time for most segments. The temperatures differences between the initial and ultimate values in the trunk and thigh were more than 1 °C. It can be explained by the reliability of the thermal model and the manikin. The model deviation would affect the predictive accuracy of the coupling system. Moreover, the insufficient cooling by the sweating manikin also influenced the predictive accuracy. The sweat rates were low in the neutral environment, and the released moisture could not spread out from each outlet sufficiently to reach the neighboring sensor (Psikuta et al., 2008b). Therefore, the heat flux measured by the manikin was smaller than the true value, resulting in the high temperatures predicted by the coupling system.

In the hot environment, the mean skin temperatures predicted by the coupling system were higher than those measured in the subject tests. This can be probably explained by the initial values of the coupling system and the limitation of the manikin. The measured skin temperatures were used as the initial values for the coupling system in the first phase, while the initial values in the second phase were obtained by the coupling system. The initial skin temperature differences obtained by the coupling system and those measured in the subject tests in the second phase affected the prediction results of the coupling system. In the hot environment, the manikin gained heat from the environment, which possibly making the surface temperature deviate from the values obtained from the thermal model. Consequently, this deviation affected the simulation of the coupling system in the subsequent time interval. This phenomenon is most obvious in the hot environment due to the longer time required for cooling down to the set point temperature required by the thermal model (Psikuta et al., 2013).

According to the values of RMSD and difference between the measured results and the predicted data, the coupling system tended to perform better for the core temperatures with the PC1 than those with the PC2. The coupling system with the PC2 slightly under-predicted the core temperature in the neutral environment and at the beginning of the hot exposure. However, this trend reversed at the 40-min where the coupling system began to over-predict core temperatures. More important, the simulated core temperatures with the PC2 showed a substantial increase than the experimental values after 10 min exposure to the hot environment, which is owing to the fact that the PC1 and the PC2 had the similar thermal insulation, but the evaporation resistance of the PC2 was almost two times greater than that of the PC1. The higher the thermal insulation, the more amount of heat the clothing will hamper. The greater the evaporative resistance, the more amount of moisture the clothing tends to block. The small quantity of sweat was not sufficient to cool the surface temperature sensor of the manikin at the beginning of the hot exposure. The over-predicted skin temperature caused the manikin deliver more water than the truth value (Blood and Burke, 2010). Sweat stored a lot of heat, while the protective clothing with high evaporation resistance severely impeded heat exchange by sweat evaporation.

The temperature differences between the two clothing samples indicated that the protective performance of clothing was different. The core temperatures measured from the subject test with the PC2 were higher than those with the PC1. This similar trend was also found for the coupling system. The differences between the predicted core temperatures with the PC1 and PC2 became larger over time in the hot environment (up to 0.35 °C at the 60-min). The protective performance is greatly affected by the formed micro-environment within the clothing, with different heat and mass transfer ways (Fu et al., 2013). The convection and radiation became a source of body heat gain in the hot environment, and the evaporation was the only way to dissipate heat from human body. The moisture retention and re-evaporation in clothing micro-environment strongly affected the physiological responses. The subjects with the PC2 sweated more than those with the PC1 in the high temperature environment, and the stored heat in the clothing caused the higher core temperature with the PC2.

Theoretically, the coupling system integrated the advantages of the thermal model and the manikin. However, large differences between the simulations and the experimental ones were observed among all of the coupling systems (Wang, 2011). The RMSD value of the core temperature was up to 1.26 °C in the work of Psikuta et al. (2008a). The predicted deviation of the local skin temperature was up to 4.2 °C in the work of Rugh and Lustbader (2006). In this study, the predicted maximum difference of the local skin temperature was only 1.3 °C.

Improvements should be made both for the manikin and the thermal model. The manikin has its technology problem which does not have the cooling system, unlike human body. It took a long time for the manikin to reach steady state in the hot environment (Rugh and Lustbader, 2006). The thermal model requires more comprehensive validations. In addition, the effect of the thermal model on the prediction results of the coupling system should be studied in the future work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, a multi-node human thermal model was coupled with the sweating manikin Newton. The coupling system was validated against the subject tests with two types of protective clothing both in the neutral and hot environments. Comparisons between the predicted results and the experimental ones indicated that the coupling system predicted the core temperatures, mean skin temperatures, and local skin temperatures reasonably. Therefore, it can be a useful tool to predict the core and skin temperatures in the hot environment, and can be applied in the assessment of the heat stress. However, the coupling system used in hot environment is still a challenge because of the technology limitations. In this work, the manikin was used in climate chamber and seated in a wheelchair. Future studies will focus on more practical conditions in which the manikin can simulate walk and breathe under transient conditions.
