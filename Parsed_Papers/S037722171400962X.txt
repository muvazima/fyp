                  This paper develops a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which introduces the risk attitude of decision makers (DMs) in the aggregation process. First, under the general framework of utility function, we provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and study its properties which are suitable for any utility function. Then, under the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, we propose another new operator named as the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and further investigate its families including a wide range of aggregation operators. To determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. Considering that different DMs may have different opinions toward decision-making and their opinions can be characterized by different orness measures, we construct a new optimization model to determine the optimal weights which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a method for the multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) is developed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the GOWUA-HARA operator to the MAGDM.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) considers the problem of evaluating or selecting alternatives that are associated with incommensurate and conflicting criteria by a cooperative group, known as the group decision-making (Vahdani et al., 2013). To choose a desirable alternative, decision makers (DMs) often present their preference information which needs to be aggregated via some proper approaches. There are many methods for aggregating information (Canós & Liern, 2008; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Herrera, & Alonso, 2007; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Fullér & Majlender, 2003a, 2003b; Liu, 2013; Llamazares, 2004; Maes, Saminger, & De Baets, 2007; Merigó, 2008; Merigó & Casanovas, 2010a, 2010b; Merigó, Casanovas, & Yang, 2014; Merigó, Casanovas, & Zeng, 2014; Merigó & Gil-Lafuente, 2010, 2011, 2013; Merigó & Yager, 2013; Mesiar, 2007; Ribeiro & Pereira, 2003; Xu, 2004, 2006a, 2006b; Xu, Yang, & Wang, 2006; Yager, 1988, 2004, 2010; Yager & Filev, 1994, 1999; Yang, 2001; Yang, Yang, Liu, & Li, 2013; Zeng, Merigó, & Su, 2013; Zhang, 2013; Zhou & Chen, 2014). One of the most popular methods for aggregating decision-making information is the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator developed by Yager (1988). It provides a general class of parametric aggregation operators and has shown to be useful for studying many different kinds of aggregation problems. Up to now, the OWA operator has been used in a wide range of applications (Merigó & Gil-Lafuente, 2010, 2011; Yager, 2010).

Motivated by the OWA operator, an extension of the OWA operator is the generalized OWA (GOWA) operator, which combines the OWA operator with the generalized mean operator (Yager, 2004). It generalizes a wide range of aggregation operators such as the OWA operator, the ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator (Xu & Da, 2002a), the ordered weighted harmonic averaging (OWHA) operator (Yager, 2004). Based on the optimization theory, Zhou and Chen (2010) presented the generalized ordered weighted logarithm averaging (GOWLA) operator, which is an extension of the OWGA operator. Other extension of the OWA operator can be found in literature (Merigó, 2008; Yager & Filev, 1999). However, the above aggregation operators only focus on using the mean to eliminate the difference, and do not consider the DMs’ risk attitude in the aggregation process.

Another important issue of applying the OWA operator for MAGDM is how to determine the associated weights. Many researchers have focused on this issue and developed some useful approaches to obtaining the OWA weights. For example, O'Hagan (1988) suggested a maximum entropy approach to obtaining OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Yager (1993) suggested an interesting way to compute the weights of the OWA operator using linguistic quantifiers. Fullér and Majlender (2003a) proposed an analytic approach for obtaining maximal entropy OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Wang and Parkan (2005) proposed a minimax disparity approach for obtaining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Majlender (2005) developed a maximal Rényi entropy method for generating a parametric class of the OWA operators and the maximal Rényi entropy OWA weights. Wang, Luo, and Liu (2007) constructed the chi-square (χ
                     2) model for determining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Other extension approaches to determining the OWA operator weights can be found in literature (Ahn, 2010; Amin & Emrouznejad, 2010; Filev & Yager, 1998; Merigó, 2008; Sang & Liu, 2014; Xu, 2006a, 2006b; Xu & DA, 2002b, 2003; Yager, 1988, 2009a, 2009b). The methods mentioned above assume that any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal aggregated weighting vector, and correspondingly there is only one orness measure to characterize the DMs’ attitude toward decision-making. As a result, there is only one set of the OWA operator weights to be generated. However, this is not consistent with the real situation. In fact, multiple DMs may join in decision-making process to reach a holistic opinion that reflects a collective view of all the participants. In the decision-making process, different DMs may have different orness measures, and therefore the corresponding OWA operator weights may also be different. So it is necessary to introduce a new method to aggregate all the participants’ preference in MAGDM.

This paper aims to develop a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which incorporates the risk attitude of DMs in the aggregation process. Under the general framework of utility function and based on an optimal deviation model, we firstly provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and then by studying its properties we find that it is commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent. These properties are suitable for any utility function. Furthermore, we focus on the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, which is rather rich, e.g., by suitable adjustments of the parameters, power utility function and exponential utility function can be obtained respectively. Under the HARA utility, we propose another new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and study its families which contain a wide range of aggregation operators such as the OWGA operator, OWA operator, OWHA operator, GOWA operator, maximum operator, minimum operator. The main advantage of the GOWUA-HARA operator is that it cannot only reflect the DMs’ risk attitude toward the aggregation information, but also provide a very general formulation including a wide range of aggregation operators.

In order to determine the weights of the GOWUA-HARA operator, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator, which is an extension of the orness measure of the GOWA operator presented by Yager (2004). We further investigate some properties associated with this orness measure. Noting that different DMs may have different perspectives toward decision-making, which can be characterized by different orness measures, this situation leads to different sets of the GOWUA-HARA operator weights corresponding to different orness measures. We then construct a new nonlinear optimization model to determine the optimal weighting vector of the GOWUA-HARA operator which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. The main advantage of the nonlinear model is that it cannot only minimize the differences between the orness measures provided by each DM and the comprehensive orness measure corresponding to an optimal weighting vector, but also produce as equally important weights as possible.

Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a new approach for MAGDM is developed. This approach is also effectively applicable to different group decision-making problems such as engineering management and financial management. In the end, we provide an application of the new approach for MAGDM in an example of the investment selection.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the OWA, OWGA and GOWA operators and introduces an HARA utility function. Section 3 presents a GOWUA operator and analyzes its properties. Especially, we provide a GOWUA-HARA operator and identify its families. Section 4 proposes an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and discusses its properties. In particular, we further construct a nonlinear model for determining the optimal weights which can aggregate each DM's opinion. Section 5 develops an approach for MAGDM under the GOWUA-HARA operator. An illustrative example is provided in Section 6 and the conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

This section briefly reviews the OWA, OWGA and GOWA operators and introduces an HARA utility function which later will be used to develop a new aggregation operator in this paper.

                              , and λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞).

By taking different values of the parameter λ in the GOWA operator, a group of particular cases can be derived. For example, the GOWA operator reduces to the OWA operator when λ = 1; the GOWA operator degenerates to the OWGA operator when λ → 0; the GOWA operator reduces to the OWHA operator as λ = −1.

In general, the basic feature of all aggregation operators is the non-decreasing monotonicity, expressing the idea that “an increase of any of the input values cannot decrease the output value”. The desirable properties of each aggregation operator are commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent (Xu & Da, 2002a). Each aggregation operator mentioned above satisfies these properties. However, these operators cannot reflect the risk attitude of the DMs in the aggregation process. Therefore, when aggregating the input arguments, we can introduce the utility function which not only satisfies the basic feature and desirable properties of aggregation operators, but also can reflect the risk attitude of the DMs toward the input argument information.

Generally, utility function u(x) is a non-decreasing real valued function, which just captures the idea of aggregation operator that “an increase of any of the input values cannot decrease the output value”. We investigate the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function (Grasselli, 2003; Jung & Kim, 2012), which is defined as:

                        Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1965) suggested the risk aversion coefficient r(x) = − u''(x)/u'(x) which is called the Pratt–Arrow measure of absolute risk aversion. The absolute risk aversion coefficient of HARA utility is r(x, γ, β, η) = β(1 − γ)/(βx + η(1 − γ)), which implies that with the relative risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increasing, the risk attitude of DM's involved in the evaluation of decision information will become more prudent.

In this section, we firstly present a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator for the general utility function. Then, under the HARA utility function, we propose another new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator and identify its families.

Since u(yi

                              ) > 0, we obtain that ∂f/∂yi
                               > 0, which implies that f monotonically increases w.r.t. yi

From Eq. (19), we find that the GOWUA-HARA operator may focus on its structure and importance of arguments rather than the weighting pattern, which leads to the fact that the GOWUA-HARA operator with more effectively theoretic basis is superior to other aggregation operators including the OWA operator, the OWGA operator, the OWHA operator, etc.

Note that HARA is a utility function, then according to Property 1 to Property 5, we can conclude that the GOWUA-HARA operator is commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent.

The following theorems and corollaries show that by taking different values of λ, β, η, γ in the GOWUA-HARA operator, we can obtain different types of aggregation operators including the OWGA operator, OWA operator, OWHA operator, GOWA operator, maximum operator, minimum operator, OWUGA-HARA operator, OWUA-HARA operator, OWUHA-HARA operator, etc.


                              Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If β = 1 − γ, η → 0, γ → 1 and λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞), then

According to Eq. (19), it is easy to derive the conclusion.  □


                              When λ = 1, by choosing different values of β, γ, η, we can obtain the following different aggregation operators:

If γ < 0 and λ → +∞, we have that λγ → −∞. Just as the above proof, we can get the minimum operator.

The theorem is proved. □


                              Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. When λ → −∞, by choosing different values of γ, we have the following statements.

                                       If 0 < γ < 1, then f(x
                                       1, x
                                       2, …, xn
                                       ) = yn
                                        (i.e., minimum operator).


                                       If γ < 0, then f(x
                                       1, x
                                       2, …, xn

                                       1 (i.e., maximum operator).

Similar to the proof of Theorem 5, the conclusion is easily obtained. □

If we consider the possible values of the weighting vector W = (w
                              1, w
                              2, …, wn

                               in the GOWUA-HARA operator, we can obtain a group of particular cases shown as follows:

The maximum operator is found if w
                                 1 = 1 and wi
                                  = 0 (i ≠ 1).

The minimum operator is derived if wn
                                  = 1 and wi
                                  = 0 (i ≠ n).

In order to determine the weights of the GOWUA-HARA operator, we propose an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. We further construct a new optimization model which can aggregate DMs’ opinion and obtain an optimal weighting vector for the GOWUA-HARA operator.

This subsection introduces an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator. The orness measure was presented by Yager (1988).

                              ), the degree of “orness” associated with this operator is defined as:

It can be shown that when W = (1, 0, …, 0), orness(W) = 1; when W = (0, 0, …, 1), orness(W) = 0; when W = (1n, 1/n, …, 1/n), orness(W) = 1/2.

The orness measure is also called the attitudinal character of the aggregation, which can be regarded as the OWA aggregation of the arguments xi
                               = (n − i)/(n − 1) for i = 1, 2, …, n. By using this method, Yager (2004) presented the orness measure of the GOWA operator:

Following Yager (2004), we can define an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator.

It can be shown that for the GOWUA-HARA operator: When W = (1, 0, …, 0), orness(W) = 1; when W = (0, 0, …, 1), orness(W) = 0. In particular, if β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ → 1, then the orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator will degenerate to the orness measure of the GOWA operator (Yager, 2004).

Based on Theorem 5, it is easy to obtain that lim
                                 λ → +∞orness(W) = 1 and lim
                                 λ → −∞orness(W) = 0. In addition, if λ
                              1 ≥ λ

Based on the orness measure and the dispersion measure, O'Hagan (1988) developed a maximum entropy method to determine the OWA operator weights, which requires the solution to the following constrained nonlinear optimization problem under a given orness measure:

As pointed out in Wang and Parkan (2007), the above three approaches all imply the use of more information from all attributes, and there are no significant differences among the three alternative approaches except for computational simplicity or complexity. Considering the importance of the OWA weights, Wang et al. (2007) constructed the chi-square (χ
                        2) model for determining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure:

However, these approaches mentioned above suppose that any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal weighting vector, and correspondingly there is only one orness measure to characterize the DMs’ attitude toward decision-making, and only one set of the OWA operator weights to be generated. This situation is not consistent with the reality. In fact, different DMs may have different perspectives, which can be characterized by different orness measures. As a result, there exist different sets of the OWA operator weights corresponding to different orness measures. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new method to aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights.

In order to determine such an optimal aggregated weighting vector for the GOWUA-HARA operator in MAGDM, we propose a new method for determining the weights.

It is hoped that each deviation variable ɛ
                           k
                        (k = 1, …, l) tends to be zero as much as possible, and meanwhile, following Wang and Parka (2007), the aggregation operator weights should be equally important and all the arguments can be equally aggregated. Therefore, by taking into account the orness measure constraint, the model should make all the weights as close to each other as possible.

Based on the above analysis, the following nonlinear optimization model is constructed to determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights.

If there is only one DM participating in the decision-making process or any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal aggregated weighting vector, then ɛ
                           k
                         will be zero. In these cases, the objective function of model (39) will degenerate to the case of model (38). The main advantage of nonlinear model (39) is that it cannot only minimize the differences between the orness measure provided by each DM and the orness measure corresponding to an optimal weighting vector, but also produce as equally important weights as possible. In addition, note that the model (39) for determining the GOWUA-HARA operator weights does not follow a regular distribution, which is also the merit of the model.

This section develops a new approach for MAGDM based on the GOWUA-HARA operator.

For a MAGDM problem, let X = {x

                      is the relatively important weight of the kth DM (k = 1, …, l). In addition, we suppose that each decision maker provides his/her own decision matrix

                      is given by the decision maker dk

In general, MAGDM problems follow a common resolution scheme (Herrera & Martínez, 2000; Roubens, 1997), composed by the following three phases:

                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Information processing phase: Different attributes may have different measurement scales in MAGDM problem, then it is necessary to standardize the attributes so as to avoid the variance among different attributes.


                              Aggregation phase: It combines the individual preferences to obtain a collective preference value for each alternative.


                              Exploitation phase: It orders the collective preference values to obtain the best alternative(s).

In the following we shall utilize the GOWUA-HARA operator and the weighting model (39) to propose an approach to MAGDM problem.

                        
                           
                              Step 1.
                           
                           Standardize the decision matrixes.

We suppose that there are two types of attributes, i.e., profit type attribute and cost type attribute. Let I
                              1 be a set of benefit attributes and I
                              2 a set of cost attributes. The decision matrixes

Calculate the weights of the attributes.

Considering that each DM provides the corresponding decision-making matrix and different DMs may have different preferences for the same attribute, it is necessary to calculate the weight of attributes under each DM. In this case, we only need to consider the orness measure of this DM, in other words, ɛ

This section provides a numerical example to examine the validity of the approach developed in Section 5. First, following Zhou and Chen (2014), we study an investment selection problem where the investor is looking for an optimal investment, and examine the effective of our approach. Second, to illustrate the influence of DMs’ risk attitude on the decision-making result, we provide a sensitive analysis of the parameters in HARA utility with respect to the best alternative.

Following Zhou and Chen (2014), we suppose that an investment company wants to invest money in the best possible option, and there is a panel of five possible alternatives to invest: (1) x
                        1 is a computer company; (2) x
                        2 is a car company; (3) x
                        3 is a furniture company; (4) x
                        4 is a food company; and (5) x
                        5 is a chemical company. The investment company must consider the following six attributes while making the choice: (1) c
                        1 stands for expected benefit; (2) c
                        2 denotes technical ability; (3) c
                        3 indicates competitive power on market; (4) c
                        4 represents ability to bear risk; (5) c
                        5 expresses management capability; and (6) c
                        6 refers to organizational culture. Suppose that there are four decision experts d
                        1, d
                        2, d
                        3 and d
                        4.

Based on the assumption of Zhou and Chen (2014), we suppose that the decision experts’ assessments for alternatives are shown as in Tables A.1–A.4 (see Appendix A). Throughout the numerical analysis, to simplify the calculation, we assume that λ = 2 in the GOWUA-HARA operator, and that the relatively important weight of DMs and the relatively important degree of total deviation in model (39) are respectively θ
                        1 = θ
                        2 = θ
                        3 = θ
                        4 = 1/4 and φ = 0.5. Noting that different DMs may have different perspectives toward decision-making which can be characterized by different orness measures, we then assume that there are four DMs whose orness measures αk
                        (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are 0.60, 0.50, 0.70, 0.40, respectively. In addition, the parameters’ values of HARA utility are respectively given by: β = 4, η = 2 and γ = 0.3, which are drawn from Cox and Huang (1989) who discussed the problem of portfolio selection for an investor with HARA utility.

According to the approach developed in Section 5 and the given parameters, we can rank the order of enterprises by applying MATLAB or Lingo software package. The concrete steps are shown as follows.

                           
                              
                                 Step 1.
                              
                              Standardize each decision matrixes B
                                 (k) into the matrices R
                                 (k)(k = 1, …, 4) via Eq. (40), which are shown as in Tables A.5–A.8 (see Appendix A). Here we use only Eq. (40) due to the attribute uj
                                  ∈ I

Thus, the best investment alterative is the computer company x
                        1. This result coincides with the case of Zhou and Chen (2014), which implies that our method is effective.

Note that introducing the utility function influences not only the DMs’ evaluation about the input argument information (See formula (18)), but also the weights of attributes and the DMs (see formula (39)). From the formulas of (18) and (39), however, it is difficult to find that what role the parameters of HARA utility function play in the selection of the best alternative.

Based on the parameters given by Subsection 6.1, the following Table A.9 (see Appendix A) shows the impact of changing the parameters of HARA utility function on the best investment alternative, including the changing of single parameter (no. 1 to no. 15), two parameters (no. 16 to no. 30), three parameters (no. 31 to no. 35), respectively.

From the single parameter change in Table A.9, we find that the selection of the best alternative will change with the single parameter γ(or η) decreasing or with the parameter β increasing to a certain point (see, no. 1 to no. 15). In other words, the changing of single parameter has an influence on the selection of the best alternative.

For example, the best alternative will change from x
                        1 to x
                        4 as the parameter γ(resp. η) decreases from 0.9 to 0.01(resp. from 5 to 0.6) (see, no. 1 to no. 10), while this change will happen as the parameter β increases from 0.1 to 15 (see, no. 11 to no. 15). Moreover, the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) will decrease with the rise of γ or η, while it will increase with the rise of β (see, no. 1 to no. 15). This can be explained by the first partial derivative of the absolute risk aversion coefficient. Note that the first partial derivative of r(x, γ, β, η) for HARA utility is r'
                           γ
                        (x, γ, β, η) = −β
                        2
                        x/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 ≤ 0, r'
                           η
                        (x, γ, β, η) = − β(1 − γ)2/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 < 0 and r'
                           β
                        (x, γ, β, η) = η(1 − γ)2/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 > 0, respectively. Then, we can conclude that r(x, γ, β, η) will decrease with the increasing of γ or η, while it will increase with the increasing of β.

In addition, we see that from Table A.9 the changing of two parameters (or three parameters) will also affect the selection of the best alternative. In particular, the best alternative will change with the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increasing to a certain point, and this changing tendency is also suitable for the single parameter case.

For example, under the condition of single parameter γ, the best alternative will change from x
                        1 to x
                        4 when the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.18 to 0.95 (see, no. 1 to no. 5). For the case of two parameters γ and η, the best alternative will change from x
                        1 to x
                        4 when r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.37 to 1.14 (see, no. 16 to no. 20). Under the changing of three parameters, the best alternative will change from x
                        1 to x
                        4 when r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.54 to 1.33 (see, no. 31 to no. 35).

This situation can be understood by the meaning of r(x, γ, β, η). Notice that with the absolute risk aversion coefficient increasing, the risk attitude of DM's involved in the evaluation of decision-making information will become more prudent. In other words, the higher the risk aversion is, the more conservative the DM is (Arrow, 1965; Pratt, 1964). From Tables A1 to A4, we find that the alternative x
                        4 is better than the alternative x
                        1 with respect to the attributes c
                        1, c
                        3, c
                        4 and c
                        5. Recall that c
                        1, c
                        3, c
                        4 and c
                        5 respectively denote the expected benefit, competitive power on market, ability to bear risk and management capability. These attributes, for the security of the investment in reality, draw more attention than those of c
                        2 (technical ability) and c
                        6 (organizational culture). Therefore, from the viewpoint of investment safety, the alternative x
                        4 is superior to the alternative x
                        1 with the increasing of r(x, γ, β, η).

In addition, Table A.9 shows that no matter what the changing of parameter (single parameter, two or three parameters) is, the best alternative is still x
                        1 if the value of r(x, γ, β, η) is less than 0.95, while it will become x
                        4 when the value of r(x, γ, β, η) is larger or equal to 0.95. Here, we should note that the point of r(x, γ, β, η) equal to 0.95 is only suitable for this example because the calculation of the best investment alternative involves other factors such as the values of attributes, weights of attributes and experts, orness measure, the relatively important weight of DMs, the relatively important degree of total deviation.

Compared with the existing aggregation approaches, the main characters of our developed approach can be concluded as follows.

                           
                              (1)
                              By introducing the utility function in aggregating process, the GOWUA-HARA operator can reflect the DMs’ risk attitude toward input argument information which is characterized by the three parameters (γ, η and β) of HARA utility function, while the existing aggregation operators do not take into account this point. For instance, the aggregation operator derived by Zhou and Chen (2014) mainly focuses on its structure and importance of arguments, and does not consider the DMs’ risk attitude toward the input argument information.

A new weighting model is constructed to determine the weights of DMs, which aggregates all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. That is, the different perspectives of different DMs can be characterized by a comprehensive orness measure, which overcomes the case of the existing weighting methods only using one orness measure to characterize DMs’ perspectives. For example, Zhou and Chen (2014) put forward the generalized least squares method (GLSM) to calculate the weights of DMs, and they supposed that each DM's weights were equal to the optimal weights of DMs. In this case, this method neglects the fact that different DMs may have different perspectives characterized by different orness measures.

Compared with the existing aggregation approaches, in our approach, the DMs’ risk attitude characterized by the three parameters (γ, η and β) may influence the selection of the best alternative. Indeed, in practice, the DMs’ subjective attitude toward the evaluation of arguments has an impact on the choice of the best alternative.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have developed a new operator called the GOWUA operator and investigated its properties. We have found that it is commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent, which are suitable for any utility function. Furthermore, under the HARA utility function, we have proposed a GOWUA-HARA operator and discussed its families including a wide range of aggregation operators. In order to determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights, we have addressed an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator. Based on this orness measure, we have constructed a new model to determine the optimal weighting vector of the GOWUA-HARA operator. Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a new approach for MAGDM has been developed. The main advantages of the approach can be concluded from two aspects. First, in the aggregation process, the GOWUA-HARA operator can reflect the DMs’ risk attitude toward aggregation information by introducing the HARA utility function, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional aggregation operators. Second, the model for determining the weights of DMs can minimize the differences between the orness measures provided by each DM and the comprehensive orness measure corresponding to an optimal weighting vector. This improves the existing weighting methods which only use one orness measure to characterize DMs’ perspectives.

This approach can also be applied effectively to different group decision-making problems such as engineering management and financial management. While when using the GOWUA-HARA operator to MAGDM, it involves in a tedious calculation for the HARA utility function contains three parameters. In addition, we do not consider the relative gain/loss of attribute values when introducing the utility function, then it will be very interesting to introduce prospect theory in the GOWUA-HARA operator. Nevertheless, we leave that point for future research since our methodology cannot be applied to that extended framework, which will result in more sophisticated calculation and which we cannot tackle here.
