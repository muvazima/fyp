                  Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) was introduced as a blood conservation technique to reduce patient exposure to allogenic blood transfusion during surgery. Despite years of research and experience, the best practice procedure, efficacy and safety of ANH remain in question. In this work, a numerical model is developed for the ANH procedure based upon a multi-compartmental, fluid model of the body. The model also analyzes the most commonly used acellular fluids for ANH or for fluid therapy following hemorrhage. The model allows user input of critical ANH parameters, providing the ability to simulate the patient׳s response in real time to many clinical scenarios, using various types of resuscitation fluids. First, the patient׳s response to a representative, clinical ANH protocol and surgery was simulated. Then, the effect of several variables was investigated including: type/amount of resuscitation fluid, number of blood units collected during ANH, and amount of surgical blood loss. Our simulations highlighted the importance of osmotic molecules within the blood in preventing excessive fluid retention and initiating fluid clearance after surgery. The developed model can be utilized as a tool to simulate and optimize a variety of proposed protocol related to the ANH procedure and surgery. It can also be utilized as an educational or training tool to become familiar with the ANH procedure.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Certain risks and disadvantages associated with allogenic blood transfusion have spurred efforts to find alternative strategies to manage patients with surgical blood loss. In the 1970׳s, acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) emerged as a potential strategy to reduce allogenic blood transfusions during the perioperative period. Given its potential for blood conservation, ANH continues to be an active area of research [1–18]. The ANH procedure involves removal of a patient׳s blood prior to surgery and simultaneous replacement with crystalloids, colloids, or both to keep the patient normovolemic. During this process, the patient׳s blood becomes diluted until a ‘target hematocrit’ is reached or the desired blood volume is removed. As a result of the induced anemia, blood lost during surgery contains fewer blood cells per unit volume, and the total loss of red blood cells is reduced. Also, fresh, autologous blood is available to provide a supply of red blood cells and clotting factors. The ‘transfusion trigger hematocrit’ refers to the lowest red blood cell concentration that is safely tolerated during surgery. If the hematocrit reaches this threshold, collected blood is transfused back to the patient to maintain the blood׳s oxygen carrying capacity. Blood is generally transfused in the opposite order of collection, leaving the highest quality blood for last. If the transfusion trigger threshold is not reached during surgery, collected blood is saved until the end of major surgical blood loss, at which point it is transfused.

ANH provides several theoretical advantages over other blood saving techniques, such as preoperative autologous donation (PAD). ANH is a “point-of-care” (POC) strategy that can be performed on the day of surgery in the operating room. It also utilizes the patient׳s own blood and nearly eliminates the risk of mistransfusion (transfusing blood to the wrong patient), since blood is kept at the patient׳s bedside. There have been many successful implementations of ANH in the clinical setting. Monk et al. [19] concluded that ANH could replace PAD as a standard of care for autologous blood procurement in radical prostatectomy because it is less costly and equally effective. Similarly, a randomized trial comparing ANH and PAD in total hip arthroplasty concluded that ANH is safe, while providing an equally effective, less costly method for reducing exposure to allogenic RBC׳s [20]. ANH also reduced the number of patients that required allogenic blood transfusion in major liver resection surgery [21]. Although risks associated with ANH have not been fully quantified, they appear to be minimal when performed correctly by a skilled, experienced clinician [22]. Despite these advantages, ANH remains underutilized compared to PAD, due to unanswered questions regarding efficacy and safety [23,24]. Additionally, several important ANH protocol have still not been standardized, including the target hematocrit, transfusion trigger hematocrit, the amount of blood to be withdrawn, the type and amount of acellular resuscitation fluid. A large variety of surgical procedures, dissimilar patient populations, varying surgical blood loss levels, and blinding/randomization difficulties have all contributed to difficulties in protocol standardization.

Given the large number of relevant variables, mathematical models are more practical to provide better insight into the ANH procedure. Previous mathematical descriptions of ANH have utilized the isovolemic, dilution equation developed by Bourke and Smith [25]. This equation models the decreasing concentration of a constituent (red blood cells) within an isovolemic fluid, by incrementally replacing this constituent with fluid. The solution to this differential equation results in an exponential relationship between blood volume removed/lost and the change in hematocrit. Brecher and Rosenfel developed an iterative program based upon this equation to determine the red blood cell volume savings provided by ANH [26]. More recently, Weiskopf utilized the same equation to describe the efficacy of ANH as a function of the fraction of blood volume lost [27]. These mathematical studies have shown that, in terms of red blood cell savings, the benefits of ANH are modest. However, these models only relate red blood cell savings to the hematocrit. An improved mathematical model of ANH would simulate the patient response to the procedure over time. Ideally, the model would accept input of ANH parameters and simulate the patient׳s response, as determined by several vital signs.

Recently, more advanced mathematical models regarding the body׳s response to hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation have been developed. These models generally describe the body as several, well-mixed fluid compartments. Exchange of fluid and constituents between compartments is governed by time-dependent ordinary differential equations and various auxiliary equations. One of the first fluid compartment models of hemorrhage was developed by Pirkle et al. [28]. An extensive, multi-compartment fluid model was developed by Gyenge et al. [29] and subsequently validated for several fluid resuscitation scenarios [30]. Other researchers have used similar models to validate and investigate various hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation scenarios [31,32]. This type of model provides the ability to simulate various scenarios and predict the dynamic changes of fluid, protein, and solute concentrations in each of the compartments. This means that predictions of important, clinical parameters such as plasma volume, red blood cell volume, blood pressure, etc. can be made as a function of time. Although these models have been applied many times to hemorrhage and resuscitation, they have not yet been used to model the body׳s response to the ANH procedure. We investigated this aspect and our effort represents the first such application of the multi-compartment fluid model to the procedure of ANH. The developed computer model accepts input of critical ANH parameters and allows for simulation of the patient׳s response over time. Furthermore, the model incorporates resuscitation with various fluids including 0.9% saline, 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES), 6% Dextran (DEX), and 5% human serum albumin (ALB).

@&#METHODS@&#

This fluid-exchange model was developed based upon previous models of microvascular exchange, specifically those introduced by Gyenge et al. [29] and Carlson et al. [31]. The fluid within the body is divided into two compartments: the intravascular space and the interstitial space. The intravascular space was further divided into the plasma volume and red blood cell volume. Mathematical equations describe fluid/protein exchange between the vascular and interstitial compartments. The ANH procedure and surgery can be modeled as changes to the vascular compartment, via infusion or hemorrhage. Lymphatic function [29] and urinary dynamics [33] were also incorporated into the model. Intracellular components of the interstitial space were not taken into account, as they do not play a central role in fluid exchange during the perioperative period [32,35]. It was assumed that the properties of all plasma proteins could be represented using those of albumin. A schematic of the fluid compartment system and relevant transport is shown in 
                     Fig. 1. Average values for important fluid model parameters are shown in 
                     Table 1.

The differential equations governing fluid exchanges can be obtained using a volumetric or mass flow balance between fluid compartments. The balances for plasma volume, VP

                     , and interstitial volume, VINST

Additional equations used in the model to govern transcapillary exchange, lymph transport, and urinary dynamics can be found in Appendix A 
                     [29,31,33]. Further explanation will focus on the methods specific to this model and unique to the ANH procedure and surgical period. In this work, a Simulink-based algorithm was created using blocks within the Simulink Library. All ordinary differential equations were solved using an ode-45 solver based upon the Runge–Kutta method. Computations were carried out within the Simulink software on a PC with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor (Sony VAIO). The model allows the user to input important considerations for the ANH procedure to be performed. These include: cutoff hematocrit, blood collection rate, transfusion trigger hematocrit, blood transfusion rate, and acellular fluid replacement options. Different types of acellular fluid can be utilized, including isotonic saline, 5% Albumin (ALB), 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES), and 6% Dextran 70 (DEX).

In order to accurately model the ANH procedure, several additions were made to previous models. First, volume kinetics for HES and DEX were established, since these fluids are routinely used for replacement during ANH. Using existing colloid osmotic pressure data [36], a linear correlation between concentration and colloid osmotic pressure was created for these two molecules, as was done previously by Gyenge et al. [29] for other osmotic molecules such as ALB. Additionally, the surgical procedure was modelled to allow a user-input (constant) rate and duration of blood loss. Acellular fluid replacement during surgery also follows a user input. Finally, an algorithm was developed for the collection and transfusion of blood based upon hematocrit ‘triggers’. The algorithm iteratively calculates the patient׳s hematocrit (based upon plasma and red blood cell volumes); blood is collected for ANH until the hematocrit drops below the ‘cutoff hematocrit’ input by the user. The constituents of the collected blood (plasma volume, red blood cell volume, protein concentration) are also calculated iteratively. As blood is collected, it is dynamically allocated to hypothetical, 450ml blood bags. When each blood bag is ‘full’, the algorithm creates a new blood bag and begins to fill that one. In this way, blood bags are created with a calculated hematocrit and protein concentration. Just like the real procedure, the hematocrit of the first bag that is collected is higher than subsequent bags. These bags are then available for transfusion when the patient׳s hematocrit falls below the transfusion trigger hematocrit. When this happens, the algorithm utilizes these blood bags (in the reverse order of collection) to transfuse the patient.

In this study, we utilized the model to evaluate the patient׳s response to various ANH protocol. The patient parameters utilized in this study to monitor the patient׳s response are clarified in 
                     Table 2.

The patient׳s level of anemia was monitored over the time-course of the surgery via the hematocrit. The patient׳s fluid retention was evaluated by the change in interstitial volume. The tendency to retain/clear fluid was assessed by the gradient between the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) and capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pcap
                     ). This gradient, which has been termed the colloid osmotic-wedge pressure gradient (COWPG), has been shown to be an indicator for the development of pulmonary edema [37]. The retention of a certain volume of fluid has also been correlated previously with the development of edema [38].

First, we simulated the patient׳s response to a clinically relevant ANH protocol utilized by Monk et al. [19] in radical prostatectomy surgery. This procedure was utilized because it represented a moderate and successful implementation of ANH with moderate surgical blood loss. To follow this procedure, an average of 1622mL of blood was collected during hemodilution, taking an average of 49min. The first 1000mL of removed blood was replaced with 6% HES and subsequent volumes of blood loss (during ANH and surgery) were replaced with crystalloid solution to maintain normovolemia. The surgical procedure lasted 240min, resulting in 1555mL of total operative blood loss. Blood collected during ANH was transfused when the patient reached a transfusion trigger hematocrit of 25%. If transfusion was necessary during surgery, the patient was transfused at a rate equal to the rate of blood loss until the end of the operation. Otherwise, the remaining blood was transfused at the end of surgery.

Subsequently the model was utilized to explore the effect of several variables: the type/amount of colloid fluid used during ANH, the amount of blood removed during ANH, and the amount of blood lost during surgery. In each case, the aforementioned clinical scenario was used as a basis to explore each of these cases. For investigating each of these variables, all other variables remained unchanged from the aforementioned clinical ANH/surgery scenario. First, the patient׳s response was assessed to varying amounts of HES, ALB and DEX during the ANH procedure. In each case, saline was administered in addition to these colloids to maintain normovolemia. The model was then utilized to determine the effect of changing the amount of blood units collected during ANH or the amount of blood lost during surgery.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The model was utilized to monitor the patient׳s response to the outlined clinical ANH protocol and radical prostatectomy procedure. The time-course of hematocrit showed good agreement with the data points that were available for validation during the perioperative period (
                     Fig. 2A). In this simulation, patients presented with a preoperative hematocrit of 40%. Removal of blood during hemodilution resulted in a decrease in hematocrit to 28.9%. The patient reached the transfusion trigger hematocrit (25%) during surgery. Directly after the transfusion of collected blood, the hematocrit had increased to 30.1%. After the transfusion, the patient was still in a state of very mild hypervolemia (Fig. 2C). Excess blood volume resulted in an under-estimation of the actual, final hematocrit for the patient. The hematocrit continued to increase slowly until normovolemia was restored, at which point it levelled at 31.9%. Over the course of the procedure, 1L of 6% HES and 6.7L of isotonic saline were administered. Acellular fluid resuscitation resulted in a net accumulation of 4.7L in the patient׳s interstitial space by the end of surgery (Fig. 2B). Accumulation of more than 4.7L of fluid in the interstitial space is associated with edema risk. However, transfusion of collected blood reversed transcapillary flow to favor movement from the interstitial space to the vascular space, initiating the clearance of accumulated fluid. The accumulation or clearance of fluid corresponded directly to COWPG. During surgery, COWPG decreased to a point below the normal range as fluid accumulated in the interstitial space. However, a normal level of COWPG (above 9mmHg) was restored quickly after transfusion of collected blood (Fig. 2D). Increased COWPG assisted in the clearance of fluid from the interstitial space, and the risk of edema development was alleviated.

Subsequently, the model was utilized to investigate the patient response to changing the amount HES administered during ANH, keeping the rest of the clinical scenario the same. The patient׳s hematocrit, interstitial volume and COWPG responses were simulated for various amounts of HES administered during ANH including 0.0L HES, 0.5L HES, and 1.0L HES (
                     
                     Figs. 3 and 4). The amount of HES administered during ANH did not have a pronounced effect on the patient׳s final hematocrit (Fig. 3). This is due to the fact that only blood removal or transfusion should affect the hematocrit, given that the patient is kept normovolemic.

Administering more HES during ANH resulted in less interstitial fluid accumulation during surgery and improved interstitial fluid clearance after the procedure (Fig. 4A). Administering less than 1L of HES resulted in unsafe levels of fluid accumulation during the procedure as well as reduced fluid clearance after the end of the procedure. Administering more HES during ANH also resulted in a higher COWPG throughout the entire procedure (Fig. 4B). Administering at least 1L of HES was necessary to achieve a normal value of COWPG after surgery.

Thus, for a given scenario, interstitial fluid volume change and COWPG can be used as a basis to determine the amount of colloid that should be administered during ANH. Enough colloid should be administered to prevent fluid accumulation from reaching unsafe levels (about 4.7L). Colloid should also be administered such that a normal value of COWPG (about 10.5mmHg) results. For the clinical scenario being considered in this paper, recommendations were made for the amount of HES, DEX, or ALB to be administered during ANH (
                     Fig. 5). These recommendations are the lowest amount of each type of colloid that meets both of these conditions.

Administering colloids during ANH maintains plasma COP throughout the entire procedure, helping to keep fluid within the vascular space. Without the use of colloids during ANH, fluid administered during surgery escapes very easily into the interstitial space. Therefore, if no colloid is used during ANH, much more fluid is needed during surgery to maintain plasma volume. For various colloids used during ANH, the amount of saline needed to maintain normovolemia during surgery was simulated (
                     Fig. 6). For each colloid, the recommended infusion volume determined in Fig. 5 was used during ANH. In the case of ‘no colloid’, only saline was administered during ANH. Saline was infused during surgery as needed to maintain normovolemia, counteracting the effect of surgical blood loss. Without infusing any colloid during ANH, the amount of saline needed during surgery was abnormally high, about 8.6L. The amount of saline needed to compensate for surgical blood loss was around 3L lower when colloids were used during ANH (depending on the type of colloid used). Thus, an explanation is provided for the reduced fluid retention seen with the use of colloid in Fig. 4A. Administering colloid during ANH reduces the amount of saline needed during surgery, thus reducing the amount of fluid retained in the patient׳s interstitial space.

The model was then utilized to investigate the effect of the number of units of blood collected during the ANH procedure. The patient׳s hematocrit response was simulated for various degrees of ANH prior to surgery including: no ANH, 2 unit ANH, and 4 unit ANH (
                     Fig. 7). As expected, collection of more blood during ANH resulted in a higher post-operative hematocrit. However, when more units of blood are collected during ANH, the patient starts the surgery with a lower hematocrit. Thus, patients undergoing aggressive ANH reach the transfusion trigger hematocrit more quickly. This means that the blood collected during ANH must be transfused at an earlier point during the surgery. It is interesting to note that the number of ANH units collected does not have a large impact on the post-operative fluid retention or final value of COWPG. Although the patient׳s plasma COP is reduced after ANH, all of this blood is returned to the patient (along with its osmotic proteins).

For a given surgical procedure, each case will likely result in a different total volume of blood loss during surgery. The model was subsequently used to assess the patient response to different amounts of surgical blood loss. Patients that undergo a larger volume of blood loss during surgery will have a lower post-operative hematocrit (
                     Fig. 8). Larger volumes of blood loss also corresponded to earlier transfusion of ANH collected blood. In other words, patients with more surgical blood loss reached the 25% transfusion trigger hematocrit more quickly.

Patients that suffer higher amounts of surgical blood loss require larger volumes of fluid resuscitation to maintain normovolemia. These patients also lose more plasma proteins during the course of surgery, which results in lower COWPG. The patient׳s interstitial volume response was simulated for different amounts of surgical blood loss (
                     Fig. 9A). For cases with higher surgical blood loss, more fluid accumulated in the interstitial space over the course of the procedure. Furthermore, the simulation showed that cases with higher surgical blood loss showed reduced clearance of the accumulated fluid after the procedure. These findings correlate directly with the simulated COWPG response for different amounts of surgical blood loss (Fig. 9B). Patients with more surgical blood loss showed a lower post-operative COWPG, due to the additional loss of plasma proteins during surgery. With a lower COWPG, fluid clearance from the interstitial space to the plasma is reduced. Patients with blood loss greater than 2L will experience unsafe levels of fluid accumulation and a drop of COWPG out of the normal range. However, these patients will also likely require transfusion of allogenic blood due to reduced hematocrit, which will help restore COWPG and clear fluid accumulations.

In practice, the values of the input parameters (blood loss, colloid infusion volume, etc.) are not known exactly, but will likely fall within a given range. Given the potential variation of inputs to the model, it is necessary to understand the effect of this variation on the patient response (model output). A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the variation in certain model outputs based upon changes in model inputs. In this analysis, the patient response (model output) was determined at a given time after surgery (t=8 hours) as a function of input parameter variation from a low value (A) to a high value (B). In each case, only one input parameter is varied, while all other parameters assume the values assigned in the ANH protocol utilized by Monk et al. [12]. Due to the large number of input parameter combinations, this analysis only includes a representative subset of possible combinations. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in 
                        Table 3. Based on the sensitivity analysis, when the colloid infusion volume (HES infusion volume) increased from 0.5L to 1L, the hematocrit decreased from 31.5 to 31.0 which is only a 1.6% change (Fig. 3, dotted and dashed lines). However, when the HES infusion volume increased from 0.5L to 1L, there was a substantial reduction in the interstitial volume by 27.6% (Fig. 4A, dotted and dashed lines). This was caused by the increased COPWG (26.7%) (Fig. 4A, dotted and dashed lines) which resulted in increased fluid flow from the interstitium to the plasma compartment dictated by the Starling׳s equation of fluid transfer. The sensitivity analysis also showed that when the volume of collected ANH blood before the surgical procedure was doubled from 2 units to 4 units, the final hematocrit after 8h increased by only 1.6% (Fig. 7, dotted and dashed lines). On the other hand, COPWG decreased by 6% which resulted in a 13.2% rise in the interstitial volume compartment. Therefore, we can conclude that doubling the amount of ANH blood before a surgical procedure may not be beneficial and the physiological consequence of this increase might be tissue edema due to fluid accumulation in the interstitial space. Finally, if the predicted blood loss increased from 1.5L to 2L, hematocrit decreased substantially by 6.6% (Fig. 8, dotted and dashed lines). Hence, the loss in blood volume during surgery and subsequent fluid resuscitation to resume normovolemia further diluted the blood leading to decreased hematocrit. When the blood loss increased and the blood was diluted, it resulted in decreased COWPG (10.5%) (Fig. 9A, dotted and dashed lines) in the vascular space causing a rise (4.8%) (Fig. 9B, dotted and dashed lines) in the interstitial volume.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this study, a fluid distribution model has been applied to the acute normovolemic hemodilution procedure. The model provides the ability to simulate the patient׳s response over time to a variety of ANH protocols and surgical procedures. Specifically, the ANH protocol and surgery outlined by Monk et al. [19] was used as a basis for this study due to its acceptance as a moderate, successful practice of ANH. The model provided the ability to monitor some important patient vitals (hematocrit, blood volume, interstitial volume, COWPG, etc.) throughout the perioperative period. In doing so, the patient could be monitored for risk of fluid overload (edema) and reduced hematocrit (anemia). The model was utilized to determine the amount and type of colloids that would be appropriate for a given ANH protocol. The model was also used to show the effect of the number of blood units collected during ANH and the amount of surgical blood loss on the patient׳s response.

The simulated hematocrit response showed good agreement with hematocrit data provided during the perioperative period. Validation of the fluid distribution response was difficult due to limited time-course data of the specific ANH procedure. However, the model provided reasonable predictions for the time-course of blood volume, interstitial volume change (fluid accumulation), and COPWG. Particularly, the simulations demonstrate the importance of the COWPG in maintaining fluid balance during and after the procedure. During ANH, the plasma COP is reduced due to removal of blood and its plasma proteins. The use of colloids during ANH can significantly help maintain plasma COP during ANH. However, the plasma COP declines quickly during surgery due to blood loss and resuscitation with crystalloids. Generally colloid cannot be administered during surgery due to dose limitations. However, one benefit of ANH is that transfusion of collected blood toward the end of surgery can restore plasma COP back to normal. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the increased COWPG due to transfusion results in a switch from fluid retention to fluid clearance. Fluid from the interstitial space begins to return to the plasma, which is cleared from the body via the urine. Thus, the transfusion of collected ANH blood at the end of surgery may help reduce the risk of fluid retention and overload after surgery.

Further investigation showed that the amount and type of colloid used during ANH was also an important factor in determining fluid retention and clearance. Simulations showed that, for this particular procedure, using less than 1L of HES during ANH led to abnormally low COWPG and insufficient fluid clearance. This gives some validation for the administration of 1L of HES in the ANH protocol outlined by Monk et al. [19]. Without the administration of any colloid, fluid retention reached unsafe levels (nearly 8L) and fluid clearance was not seen. Fluid retention was decreased and fluid clearance was improved as the colloid dose increased. Simulations were done to investigate fluid retention and clearance with other colloids, including Dextran and albumin.

For the outlined ANH protocol and surgery, recommendations were made for the amount of colloid to administer during ANH based upon fluid accumulation and COWPG. It was determined that at least 1055mL of HES, 695ml of DEX, or 1515mL of ALB would provide favorable fluid balance for ANH/surgery. Our simulations also showed that administering colloid during the ANH procedure reduced the amount of crystalloid that was needed to replace surgical blood loss. Administering colloid during ANH results in a higher plasma COP during surgery which helps keep fluid in the vascular space. Thus, during surgical blood loss, less of the administered fluid escapes into the interstitial space and less fluid is needed overall. Administering less crystalloid during surgery has several benefits, including less fluid retention and reduced surgical costs.

Our simulations showed that the number of blood units collected during ANH did not play a big role in the fluid balance during and after surgery. Since this blood is transfused by the end of the surgery, the patient receives any osmotic blood proteins that were removed during blood collection. The major benefit of collecting more blood during ANH is the increased post-operative hematocrit. However, collection of more blood during ANH results in an earlier transfusion time during surgery. Thus, the benefit of each additional unit collected during ANH is less than the previous unit. For this particular procedure, the benefit of collecting more than 3 or 4 units is quite small. Our simulations did show that the amount of surgical blood loss was an important factor in fluid balance during and after surgery. Patients that lose less blood during surgery will require less crystalloid to maintain blood volume. Additionally, patients that lose less blood will have a higher plasma COP, which corresponds to lower fluid retention. For this particular procedure, severe blood loss greater than 2L (about 50% blood volume) may result in low COWPG and high fluid retention. However, patients that reach this amount of blood loss will likely require allogenic blood, which will help restore the COWPG.

Although our computer-based fluid model provides additional insight into the ANH procedure, there are several limitations to this model. Currently, there is a lack of time-course data for the fluid distribution of a patient during surgery with ANH. Thus, it is difficult to directly validate the predictions made (at each time point) by this model for plasma volume, interstitial fluid volume accumulation and COWPG. However, fluid transport parameters used in creating this model have been validated previously for a variety of cases of hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation. One important note is that the fluid distribution results were found to be especially sensitive to the fluid filtration coefficient (k) and Protein Permeability-Surface Area Product (PS). Values for these parameters were selected from Tatara et al. [32] in which they were validated for resuscitation in both normovolemic and hemorrhagic states. Trauma and inflammation during surgery may require additional fluid resuscitation than was predicted by this model, due to increased capillary leakage [35]. Additionally, many of the parameters have been estimated using average values that are patient or tissue specific. For example, the reflection coefficient for ALB, HES, and DEX is different in each tissue. Thus, the specific tissue that is affected by surgery may affect fluid transport and resuscitation requirements. However, this model is based upon previous fluid distribution models, which have provided useful insight into fluid requirements for the average patient or surgery. In this study, transcapillary transport of ALB, HES, and DEX was assumed to be coupled to transcapillary fluid flow, as was done previously for plasma proteins by Gyenge et al. [29]. Kinetics and clearance of infused ALB, HES, DEX have been simplified in this regard and may vary from patient to patient. The permeability-surface area product for HES was assumed to be approximately equal to that of DEX based on their nearly equal hydrodynamic radii [41,42]. Also, no consideration was given to potentially adverse side effects that some patients may experience. In this study, surgical blood loss was assumed to occur at a constant rate. Although actual surgical blood loss profiles may not be constant, this method provides a simple way of representing blood loss during surgery. If the blood loss profile is known, this can be readily incorporated into the model to replace the constant rate assumption. Furthermore, it was assumed that there was no post-operative blood loss. Depending on the type of surgery, post-operative blood loss may be an important consideration. Since data regarding post-operative blood loss was not included by Monk et al. [19], this was not incorporated in our study. Finally, no computer-based model can incorporate all of the physiological mechanisms that are at work to maintain homeostasis during surgery. However, a computer-based model, such as that presented here, can be very helpful in analyzing the dynamic nature of fluid transport and provide important insights into different resuscitation techniques.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This effort represents the first attempt to apply a multi-compartmental, fluid model to the ANH procedure and corresponding surgery. Previous computer-based models of ANH have utilized a simple exponential hemodilution equation to relate blood loss and hematocrit changes. This model allows the user to input critical ANH parameters and simulate the patient׳s response to ANH and surgery in real time. The user can also select from several types of resuscitation fluid including saline, albumin, hydroxyethyl starch and Dextran. Different ANH protocol, surgical blood loss profiles, and fluid resuscitation methods can be investigated utilizing this model. First, the model was utilized to simulate the patient׳s response to a clinically utilized ANH protocol. Simulation of the patient׳s hematocrit closely matched perioperative hematocrit data. Although many studies regarding ANH consider changes in hematocrit, this study highlighted the importance of fluid balance when looking at ANH protocol. Our simulations showed that the maintenance of osmotic molecules within the blood is an important factor in preventing excessive fluid retention and initiating fluid clearance after surgery. The amount and type of colloid that is utilized during the ANH procedure can be tailored to provide the patient with a normal plasma COP level after surgery based upon the ANH protocol and expected surgical blood loss. The use of colloids during ANH resulted in a reduced need for crystalloid resuscitation during surgery and reduced fluid accumulation. For the clinical scenario considered in this study, recommendations were made for the amount of HES, DEX, or ALB that should be used during the ANH procedure. Although this model does have simplifying assumptions and limitations, it has proven useful to investigate a variety of ANH protocol and resuscitation techniques.
