               Abstract
               
                  This research addresses a single machine scheduling problem with uncertain processing times and sequence-dependent setup times represented by intervals. Our objective is to obtain a robust schedule with the minimum absolute deviation from the optimal makespan in the worst-case scenario. The problem is reformulated as a robust traveling salesman problem (RTSP), whereby a property is utilized to efficiently identify worst-case scenarios. A local search-based heuristic that incorporates this property is proposed to solve the RTSP, along with a simulated annealing-based implementation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed heuristic are compared to those of an exact solution method in the literature.
