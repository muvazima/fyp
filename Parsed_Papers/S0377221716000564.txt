                  In this paper, we generalize a formula for the discrete Choquet integral by replacing the standard product by a suitable fusion function. For the introduced fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals we discuss and prove several properties and also show that our generalization leads to several new interesting functionals. We provide a complete characterization of the introduced functionals as aggregation functions. For

                      several new aggregation functions are obtained, and if symmetric capacities are considered, our approach yields new generalizations of OWA operators. If n > 2, the introduced functionals are aggregation functions only if they are Choquet integrals with respect to some distorted capacity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Choquet integral (Choquet, 1953) is a distinguished tool in several domains of decision making , e.g., in economics, psychology, social sciences, etc. It merges the information contained in a capacity, which expresses the weights of the considered sets (of criteria, for example), and in observed quantity values (in a score vector, for example) into a single representative value. The Choquet integral was generalized in several directions. Not considering generalizations of the domains of capacities and integrated functions (e.g., from reals to intervals; Bustince, Galar, Bedregal, Kolesárová, & Mesiar, 2013), we can recall the Choquet-like integrals (Mesiar, 1995), concave integrals (Lehrer, 2009), universal integrals (Klement, Mesiar, & Pap, 2010) or copula-based integrals (Klement, Mesiar, Spizzichino, & Stupňanová, 2014). All these generalizations are monotone functionals. However, in the case of integrating with respect to capacities, these generalizations need not be aggregation functions or translation invariant, and therefore they violate some of the genuine properties of the Choquet integral.

The aim of our paper is to introduce a generalization of the Choquet integral without this imperfection. Generalizing a formula for the discrete Choquet integral based on a comonotone representation of the considered integrand, we introduce a class of fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals, all of them being translation invariant.

Formally, fusion functions can be seen as operations on the unit interval [0, 1], i.e., ([0, 1], F) is a grupoid. However, we prefer the terminology “fusion functions” because these operations generalize several kinds of particular functions known from information fusion, including monotone measure and integral theory (Klement et al., 2010), multicriteria decision support (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, & Pap, 2009) or fuzzy logics (Baczynski & Jayaram, 2008; Klement, Mesiar, & Pap, 2000), such as aggregation functions, t-norms, t-conorms, semicopulas, implication functions, and also overlap functions (Bedregal, Dimuro, Bustince, & Barrenechea, 2013; Bustince, Fernandez, Mesiar, Montero, & Orduna, 2010), grouping functions (Bustince, Pagola, Mesiar, Hüllermeier, & Herrera, 2012), etc. Recall that aggregation functions A: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], deeply studied, e.g., in Beliakov et al. (2007) and Grabisch et al. (2009), are characterized by monotonicity and the boundary conditions

Nevertheless, they satisfy a weaker form of monotonicity that is linked to the same increase of both arguments. This weaker type of monotonicity, which is called a weak monotonicity (Wilkin & Beliakov, 2015), is often considered, e.g., in image processing. Note that the weak monotonicity is monotonicity in the direction given by the vector

In this paper, we will only consider finite spaces X (e.g., sets of criteria). Hence, without loss of generality, we will deal with the space 
                        
                           X
                           =
                           N
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                           ,
                        
                      for some natural number 
                        
                           n
                           ∈
                           N
                           ,
                        
                      
                     n ≥ 2, and with the σ-algebra 
                        
                           S
                           =
                           
                              2
                              N
                           
                        
                     . Moreover, we will only consider normed monotone measures and call them capacities (Grabisch et al., 2009). The set of all capacities m: 2
                        N
                      → [0, 1] will be denoted by 
                        
                           M
                           n
                        
                     . The considered functions will have their range in [0, 1] (score in single criteria, for example), and they will be denoted by x, x ∈ [0, 1]
                        n
                     , which reflects the fact that each 2
                        N
                     -measurable function on N with range in [0, 1] can be viewed as an n-dimensional vector from [0, 1]
                        n
                     . Though the next result, which is often called the “discrete Choquet integral”, can be derived directly from the formula (1), it also follows from the above mentioned properties of the Choquet integral.

                        Proposition 1

                            → [0, 1] be a capacity. Then for any 
                           x ∈ [0, 1]

Note that though the permutation ( · ) considered in (2) need not be unique, the output of (2) does not depend on the chosen permutation. For more details on the discrete Choquet integral (2) we recommend Grabisch (1995) and Chapter 5 of the monograph Grabisch et al. (2009).

This fact has inspired us to substitute the product by a binary fusion function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] (see Bustince et al., 2015) and define a generalization

The first step in the proposed approach was done and some examples were given in our recent paper (Lucca et al., 2016). Note that the definition of a binary fusion function requires F to be a [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] function only. As already mentioned in the previous section, the permutation ( · ): N → N with the property

                      which is considered in formulas (2) and (3), need not be unique. Thus formula (3) defines a functional

                      correctly only if its evaluation does not depend on the considered permutation. Obviously, if there are no ties between the input values

                      then the permutation ( · ) is unique. Now, suppose that there are some ties, for example, let

It is important to stress that if

                           ∈

                      satisfies F(x, y) ≤ x for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], then it also satisfies condition (iv) in Proposition 2 and hence the corresponding function

                           m

                      is a fusion function. In general, the reversed implication does not hold, see Example 3. However, if for 
                        
                           F
                           ∈

                      it holds that

                           (

Comparing Corollary 2 and Proposition 5, we can see that in the framework of F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals, idempotency and translation invariance are equivalent.

Summarizing, we have proved that for any n > 2, an F-based discrete Choquet-like integral 
                        
                           C
                           m
                           F
                        
                      is an n-ary aggregation function for any 
                        
                           m

                      if and only if it is the Choquet integral with respect to the capacity m distorted by a function f generating F, i.e.,

                     .

Finally, let us note that the functions f
                     * and f
                     * (introduced in Section 3) are the extremal elements of the class 
                        
                           G
                           f
                        
                      of all functions f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] generating functions 
                        
                           F
                           ∈
                           G
                        
                     . Moreover, the function F considered in Example 6(iii), belongs to 
                        G
                      and is generated by the function f given by

In this paper, we have proposed and discussed fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals generalizing the discrete Choquet integral. We have shown that in the framework of n-ary aggregation functions, for any fixed n > 2 our F-based discrete Choquet-like integral is in fact a Choquet integral, but the underlying capacity m must be appropriately modified. Note that for

                      our approach generates a new kind of binary aggregation functions. Interesting cases are also those which lead to F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals that are weakly monotone pre-aggregation functions. Considering a symmetric capacity

Recall that in the binary case, an OWA operator OWA: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is given by

In the future, we intend to study an F-based generalization of the Choquet integral acting on an arbitrary measurable space. The basic idea is the approximation of the integrand f by a simple function fn
                     , and subsequent processing of this simple function fn
                      in the form of a discrete F-based Choquet-like integral.

Finally, let us note that our theoretical proposal was motivated by practical problems in image processing. Moreover, we expect applications of F-based Choquet-like integrals in several domains of multicriteria decision support, especially in domains where the Pareto principle need not be completely satisfied.
