                  For constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for the ratios of means of several lognormal distributions, we propose a new parametric bootstrap method, which is different from an inaccurate parametric bootstrap method previously considered in the literature. Our proposed method is conceptually simpler than other proposed methods, which are based on the concepts of generalized pivotal quantities and fiducial generalized pivotal quantities. Also, our extensive simulation results indicate that our proposed method consistently performs better than other methods: its coverage probability is close to the nominal confidence level and the resulting intervals are typically shorter than the intervals produced by other methods.

The lognormal distribution is widely used for analyzing positive right-skewed data; see, e.g., Oldham (1953), Koch (1966), Zhou et al. (1997), Lacey et al. (1997), Julius and Debarnot (2000), and Shen et al. (2006). We use the notation

                      are possibly unequal. This problem arises in the context of multiple comparisons of several treatments when the response variable is positive and has a right-skewed distribution, as is often the case in biological or medical studies; for example in bioequivalence studies for comparing several drug formulations; see Hannig et al. (2006) and Schaarschmidt (2013).

Inferences about the mean of a lognormal distribution, based on a single random sample, have been considered by Land (1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1988), Angus (1994), Zhou et al. (1997), and Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2003). The problem of comparing two lognormal means 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           =
                           2
                           )
                        
                      was considered by Zhou et al. (1997), Zhou and Tu (2000), Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2003), and Chen and Zhou (2006). Li (2009) proposed a procedure for testing the equality of several lognormal means. For constructing SCI for the ratios of means, Hannig et al. (2006) proposed a procedure based on fiducial generalized pivotal quantities (FGPQ) and Schaarschmidt (2013) proposed two procedures based on generalized pivotal quantities (GPQ).

In this paper, we propose a parametric bootstrap (PB) approach for constructing SCI for the ratios of means. The PB approach has been successfully used in other contexts (mainly testing problems) involving nuisance parameters; see, e.g., Krishnamoorthy et al. (2007), Ma and Tian (2009), Tian et al. (2009), Krishnamoorthy and Lu (2010), Li et al. (2011), Xu et al. (2013), and Sadooghi-Alvandi and Jafari (2013). In fact Zhou and Tu (2000) and Chen and Zhou (2006) considered a PB procedure for constructing confidence intervals for the ratio of the means of two lognormal distributions 
                        
                           (
                           k
                           =
                           2
                           )
                        
                     , but their proposed confidence intervals perform rather poorly. In view of this, the PB approach has not been considered for the 
                        k
                     -sample problem: as Schaarschmidt (2013, p. 269) commented regarding the PB approach: “The simulation results of Chen and Zhou (2006) do not motivate to consider this approach any further”. Our proposed PB procedure, however, is different from the PB procedure considered by Chen and Zhou (2006) and is more accurate. In fact, our extensive simulation results indicate that it performs better than other methods: its coverage probability is close to the nominal confidence level and the resulting intervals are typically shorter than the intervals produced by other methods.

Our proposed PB procedure is presented in Section  2 and our simulation results are presented in Section  3. In our simulations, we first compare our PB procedure with the PB procedure considered by Zhou and Tu (2000) and Chen and Zhou (2006) for the case 
                        k
                        =
                        2
                     . We then consider the case 
                        k
                        ≥
                        3
                      and compare our proposed PB procedure with the procedures proposed by Hannig et al. (2006) and Schaarschmidt (2013). Our simulation results indicate that our proposed PB procedure consistently performs better than these procedures.

In this section we report the results of our simulation studies, regarding the performance of our proposed PB procedure compared with other procedures. We first considered the case 
                        k
                        =
                        2
                      and compared our proposed PB procedure with the PB procedure considered by Zhou and Tu (2000) and Chen and Zhou (2006). The simulation results confirm that our proposed PB procedure is more accurate, and its coverage probability is close to the nominal level. We then considered the case 
                        k
                        ≥
                        3
                      and compared our proposed PB procedure with the procedures proposed by Hannig et al. (2006) and Schaarschmidt (2013). The procedure proposed by Hannig et al. (2006), which is based on the concept of fiducial generalized pivotal quantities, will be denoted by FGPQ. Schaarschmidt (2013) actually presented four methods, based on generalized pivotal quantities, but recommended two of his methods, which he referred to as GPQ and GPQB. So his procedures will be denoted by GPQ and GPQB. (The “B” in GPQB stands for Bonferroni adjustment.) To assess the performance of each procedure, we calculated the empirical coverage probability as well the average length of the confidence interval, when 
                        k
                        =
                        2
                     , or the average volume of the confidence region (the product of the lengths of confidence intervals), when 
                        k
                        ≥
                        3
                     .

Note that all the procedures considered in this paper require using Monte Carlo methods to evaluate the appropriate “critical value” (for example the value of 
                        
                           
                              q
                           
                           
                              α
                           
                           
                              B
                           
                        
                      for our proposed PB method—see the computational procedure of Section  2). In our simulations, these “critical values” were calculated using 
                        M
                        =
                        100
                        ,
                        000
                      Monte Carlo samples, for all methods. Also, our simulations were based on 
                        N
                        =
                        10
                        ,
                        000
                      “runs” (the number of independently generated data sets). More specifically, we used the following procedure to estimate the true coverage probabilities (similarly for average length or average volume):

                     Simulation results I. We first considered the case

                        =
                        2
                      and compared our proposed PB procedure with the PB procedure considered by Zhou and Tu (2000) and Chen and Zhou (2006), which is denoted by ZT–CZ PB in Table 3.1
                     . For the configurations considered in Chen and Zhou (2006), we calculated the coverage probability (CP) and the average length (AL) of the intervals obtained by these procedures. For completeness, in our simulations we also included the GPQB and FGPQ procedures. Note that for 
                        k
                        =
                        2
                      the GPQB procedure is the same as the GP procedure of Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2003). The results, given in Table 3.1, show that the ZT–CZ PB procedure can be very inaccurate (the actual coverage probability can be as low as 80%); whereas the coverage probability of our proposed PB procedure is very close to the nominal level. (Note that since the coverage probability of the ZT–CZ PB procedure is unreliable, its average length is irrelevant.) As compared with GPQB and FGPQ procedures, our proposed PB intervals were always shorter (in each one of the 10,000 runs), as reflected in the average lengths.

It is seen that the coverage probability of the PB procedure is close to the nominal level, and the resulting confidence intervals are typically shorter than the intervals produced by the other three methods (as reflected in the average volume). Note that the PB intervals can be much shorter than the intervals produced by the other methods, depending on the values of

Note also that the standard errors for the PB procedure are smaller than the standard errors for the other three methods; so the PB procedure is also more stable than the other procedures.

In fact in our simulations the length/volume of PB intervals was almost always smaller than the length/volume of FGPQ, GPQ, and GPQB intervals (i.e., the PB method had the smallest length/volume in almost all the 10,000 runs). The only exceptions were (i) when the three sample sizes were all equal to 125 and

                     , obtained by using the four methods, are given in Table 4.2

                        N

                        000
                      runs.) However, in this example the main concern is the comparisons of groups 2 and 3 (the treatment groups) with group 1 (the control group)—see Schaarschmidt (2013). Therefore the modified versions of the four methods, for comparing several treatments with a control, should be used (for the modification of the PB method, see Section  2). The results are given in Table 4.3
                     . It is seen in both tables that the PB method produces shorter intervals than the other methods.

In this paper, we have proposed a parametric bootstrap method for constructing SCI for the ratios of means of several lognormal distributions. This method is conceptually simpler than other proposed methods, which are based on the concepts of generalized pivotal quantities and fiducial generalized pivotal quantities. Also, our extensive simulation results indicate that our proposed method consistently performs better than other methods: its coverage probability is close to the nominal confidence level and the resulting intervals are typically shorter than the intervals produced by other methods. Therefore, in view of its conceptual simplicity and better performance, our proposed method may be more useful than other methods.
