                  Microtubules (MTs) are intra-cellular cylindrical protein filaments. They exhibit a unique phenomenon of stochastic growth and shrinkage, called dynamic instability. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for applying Compressive Sensing (CS) to the sampled data of the microtubule length in the process of dynamic instability. To reduce data density and reconstruct the original signal with relatively low sampling rates, we have applied CS to experimental MT lament length time series modeled as a Dichotomous Markov Noise (DMN). The results show that using CS along with the wavelet transform significantly reduces the recovery errors comparing in the absence of wavelet transform, especially in the low and the medium sampling rates. In a sampling rate ranging from 0.2 to 0.5, the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) decreases by approximately 3 times and between 0.5 and 1, RMSE is small. We also apply a peak detection technique to the wavelet coefficients to detect and closely approximate the growth and shrinkage of MTs for computing the essential dynamic instability parameters, i.e., transition frequencies and specially growth and shrinkage rates. The results show that using compressed sensing along with the peak detection technique and wavelet transform in sampling rates reduces the recovery errors for the parameters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Microtubules (MTs) are linear intra-cellular polymers made of tubulin protein dimers [1–4]. Microtubules are found in all eukaryotic cells and play key roles in intra-cellular trafficking, mitosis [4], cell motility [2], and chromosome segregation [5]. Aberrations in MTs functions have been correlated with various diseases including Alzheimer׳s disease [6], Parkinson׳s disease [7], different forms of cancer [8], and transmission of bacterial infection [9]. Above a threshold concentration, tubulin dimers assemble into a hollow cylinder, typically consisting of 13 protofilaments, which can extend by polymerization to many thousands of subunits [2,4,10–12]. Mitchison and Kirschner found that MTs reach a steady state under fixed external conditions with alternating periods of polymerization (growth) and more rapid depolymerization (shrinking) [2,4]. The individual microtubules in the steady state exhibit stochastic transitions from growth to shortening (catastrophe) or shortening to growth (rescue) over time. They termed this unique behavior dynamic instability [1,4,13–15]. Switching frequencies are modulated during certain cellular transitions to change the length probability distribution and density of the filaments [13].

This stochastic switching behavior is described by a molecular timer exposed at one end of the growing MT. The exposed β-tubulin monomer undergoes a conformational change after association of the dimer into the polymer, thus increasing the probability of hydrolyzing the associated guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The GDP-bound subunits have a relatively low affinity for other tubulin dimers; therefore, GTP hydrolysis is believed to act as a switch for changing the binding affinity of the subunit. The competition between the rate of GTP hydrolysis in the MT and binding of new GTP-bound dimers is believed to be the reason for the transition from a state of high affinity dimer binding to very low affinity. Different mathematical models have been developed to evaluate quantities such as the MT length distribution and dynamic parameters , but the stochastic nature of the switching process between polymerization states complicates the procedure of sampling and construction of the distribution of microtubule lengths [16]. The mechanisms governing dynamic instability are still an active subject of both experimental and theoretical investigation [14,16–29].

Optical microscopes have been used to collect time-lapse data of cellular processes for more than 100 years. In the modern era of single molecule sensitivity and microsecond frame rates, the major limitation on data collection is typically the damage to the specimen or probe over the time course of the experiment. The specimen or probe can only be illuminated for a finite accumulated period of time, and therefore, the collected time-lapse data are often sparse with respect to the time scale of the intra-cellular events. Note that high temporal resolution observation of dynamic behavior of MT parameters is very imperative for understanding the MTs behavior and many other cellular activities. Since in practice we have substantial limitations on the sampling of the MT parameters such as experimental equipment precision, and spatiotemporal resolution, therefore, we investigate the use of Compressed Sensing (CS) to improve the resolution and the value of the time-lapse observations in life-sciences research.

Compressed sensing has recently found its applications in a variety of areas such as biomedical imaging, communications, and remote sensing [30–34]. Using the commonly applied Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, accurate capturing of a signal requires that samples to be taken at a rate at least two times faster than the signal bandwidth to avoid losing information or aliasing [35]. The general concept for CS is that signals can be represented by only a few non-zero coefficients, where the number of samples required recovering a signal without error is determined by its bandwidth. In CS, a nonlinear optimization can recover a signal by using considerably fewer measurements rather than suggested by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem [30,36–38]. In this regard, CS will find its application in many areas of life-sciences research, where time-lapse is a significant problem. To the best knowledge of the authors, CS has not yet been applied to reconstruct MTs and improve the MT dynamic instability parameterization.

This study is focused on using a CS based framework for the reconstruction of the MTs filament length and estimation of the characteristic parameters based on minimum sampling measurements. MT length is a stochastic signal which is also generally characterized by four parameters, growth and shrinkage rate, catastrophe and rescue frequencies [28,29]. These four parameters are also evaluated from sampled data of the MTs length through microscopy. As such, an accurate estimation of them depends upon the time-lapse observations (sampling) of the MT length and the frequency of this observation. We use experimental data as the original signal, and by applying CS with different sample rates, we try to recover the original signal and validate the method. The reason we are using the experimental data as the original data is to evaluate the CS recovery method. We also apply the peak detection technique to the wavelet coefficients to detect and closely approximate the growth and shrinkage of MTs for computing the essential dynamic instability parameters, i.e., transition frequencies and growth and shrinkage rates. We hope that this study combined with state-of-the-art experimental assays paves the way to the use of CS-based methods for biologists interested in the observation and characterization of microtubules and other biological filaments such as actin or intermediate filaments.

Microtubules are growing and shrinking with constant rates but the time spending in the growth and shrinkage is random. This growth and shrinkage can be interpreted as random switching (transitions) between growth and shrinkage state. Let X(t) be a continuous positive random variable, representing the length of the MTs under study. The rate of change of X(t), the velocity v(t), is randomly switching between positive and negative constant levels (v

Distinct from the Fourier transform, in which the basis functions are sinusoids, wavelet transforms are based on small waves with varying frequency and limited duration, i.e., wavelets. These time-limited basis functions help to determine the corresponding frequency and its usage in the expansion. Eq. (2.3) describes a 1D-discrete-time function, which is expanded, by wavelet basis functions in the time and frequency domain as [41]:

Unlike Fourier transforms, where we have either time or frequency resolution, wavelets not only offers the benefit of working with sparse coefficients, but also provides us with simultaneous time–frequency resolution. This property of simultaneous time–frequency resolution in wavelets can be exploited in our case to find the peaks present in the MTs length time series. Peak detection plays an important role in detecting the switching points in MTs, and thus by using that information we can fit MTs time series to the DMN model. Peak detection in wavelet domain is done based on the Energy Packing Efficiency (EPE) as in [42]. EPE gives us a measure of total energy preserved in a specific sub-band after some thresholding condition is applied with respect to the total energy preserved in the sub-band before any thresholding. EPE is defined as follows [42,43]:

Since we are interested in the time instants where switching occurs, we sort the significant wavelet coefficients in the lowest level in an ascending order to exploit time resolution property of wavelets. A threshold is then applied to retain a specific percentage of the significant coefficients, where each of the retained coefficients correspond to peaks in the time domain. The information from the estimated peaks are further encoded to fit our MT signal to the DMN model.

Φ must be selected such that using M samples, dimensionality reduction does not degrade the important information in s or the compressible signal. In addition, to recover x from M samples (M almost equal to K), a reconstruction algorithm is required.

In CS, the signal and images can be recovered from very few samples when two main conditions of incoherency and sparsity are satisfied [36]. In regard to incoherency, the coherency between the sensing basis

The coherency measures the largest correlation between the elements of Φ and Ψ. Therefore, when Φ and Ψ have correlated elements, μ will be large. Note that

                         is the canonical or spike basis, then the coherency between the sensing basis and the Haar wavelet is

                        . For Daubechies D4 and D8 wavelets, the coherency is about 2.2 and 2.9, respectively [30]. If Ψ is the Fourier basis, then 
                           μ
                           (

                        . If Φ is a random matrix, it is largely incoherent with any basis. By selecting Φ as a uniformly random orthogonal basis, the coherence between Φ and Ψ is about

                         with a high probability. If Φ is selected with independent identically distributed

There are two approaches for compressive sensing recovery. The first involves solving a linear programming method to minimize the l

However, several fast convex relaxation algorithms based on BP, such as the gradient projection method [47] have been proposed to solve or approximate BP. The l1 magic recovery is a BP-based recovery package [48], which uses a convex Linear Programming (LP) and a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) for seven contexts: (1) l

                        where γ is a user specific parameter [48]. The other approach is through using greedy pursuit algorithms, which are less complex than the BP algorithms [49]. However, the greedy pursuit algorithms usually have less stability than BP algorithms [49]. These algorithms iteratively try to refine and yield a better approximation of the signal. Examples of these algorithms are the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) [50], Stagewise OMP (StOMP) [51], Regularized OMP (ROMP) [52], Subspace Pursuit (SP) [53], and Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) [52]. The reconstruction complexity of these algorithms are significantly lower than the complexity of BP.

We have used a real experimental data in this study. Tubulin proteins were first purified from the bovine brain and then seeded to polymerize at 37°C. The growing and shortening dynamics of individual purified MTs were then recorded at their plus ends using the differential interference contrast video microscopy. Data points representing MT lengths were collected at 2–6s intervals. MT lengths were analyzed using the Real Time Measurement program. Any length changes equal to or less than 0.2μm over the duration of six data points were considered attenuation phases (phases in which length changes were below the resolution of the microscope). It should be noted that the experimental detection limit for length changes corresponds to about 400–800 tubulin dimers. See Rezania et al. [35] for further details.

We first apply discrete wavelet transform to get a sparse representation for MT length signal. In our work we have used Daubechies D2 (db2) mother wavelet with 8 levels of signal decomposition, which performs better than other mother families and decomposition levels in our work. The resultant sparse wavelet coefficients are sampled at varying rates using compressed sensing. The advantage of compressed sensing here is in being able to reconstruct the signal from far fewer measurements than the traditional Nyquist criteria. The recovering of the sparse signal is performed by minimizing l1-norm with bounded residual correlation in the l1-magic package [48].


                     Fig. 2
                      depicts one of the MT length datasets used for our experiments. We first used wavelet transform to get a sparse representation of the given signal and then applied CS recovery through l1 minimization for different sampling rates. Fig. 3
                      illustrates the effectiveness of CS recovery on MTs. We see that for subrates greater than 0.5, the recovered signal begins to closely trace the original signal. Although we are taking far fewer measurements than traditional Nyquist theory, it can be observed that we are able to achieve a very good approximation of the original signal at lower subrates.

As discussed in Section 2.3, we use the rich information in the wavelet domain to detect peaks in the MT signal, which in turn will help us to derive the switching states of DMN. We know that wavelet decomposition provides us with both time and frequency resolution. We will make use of the fact that here we are looking for wavelet levels with better time resolution to distinguish between different time bins where the peak instances may be detected. Therefore, we look at the significant wavelet coefficients present at the lowest level to achieve best time resolving capability. We then employ EPE as a measure to threshold the necessary significant wavelet coefficients after sorting them from highest to lowest values. We have set the threshold parameter as

                              Step 4: Sum up energy of the sorted coefficients until the threshold condition is reached.

Once the peaks are estimated from wavelet domain, we round off the recovered MT length signal to its nearest peak value to obtain an encoded signal. This encoded signal is used for our further calculations of parameters. Fig. 5
                      shows the resultant MT length signal after peak detection and rounding off the peaks for subrate 1.0. This process is done across all the subrates to obtain a MT signal to fit our DMN model. The significance of doing peak detection and encoding the MT signal underlines the fact that by this process we are trying to detect and closely approximate the shrinkage and growth of MTs for varying subrates. Thus, the overall proposed method can be summarized as in Fig. 6
                     .

From a biological perspective, it is very important to estimate some parameters pertaining MTs such as growth/shrinkage rate, their respective transition frequencies and average length of the MT to determine the state of the system. In this section, we present the error parameters and other important parameters estimated using our approach. Fig. 7
                      portrays the error estimates of the parameters calculated. As discussed earlier, peak detection is done to locate the switching instants from growth to shrinkage and vice versa (catastrophe and rescue). Thus, peak detection plays a crucial role in estimating the MTs dynamic parameters. We see that

                      errors are very small and for subrates higher than 0.5 it almost reduces to 0. As expected

                      give us the original and estimated parameters of MTs. However, we can determine the overall performance of the system by looking at Root Mean Square Error (RSME) and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for all subrates. The RSME and SNR are defined as follows:

                     Fig. 8
                      shows the RMSE of applying CS with/without wavelet transform. As it is seen, the RMSE of CS with wavelet transform have less RMSE value at all sample rates. From Fig. 8 and CS with wavelet transform, it can be inferred that for sampling rates greater than 0.5, the reconstruction error approaches 0. This implies that the reconstructed signal becomes a closer approximate of the original signal as the sampling rate increases. This fact can also be noted in Fig. 3 where the reconstructed signal evolves as a better estimate of the original signal for subrates higher than 0.5. The efficacy of the proposed approach can be further verified by looking at the systems SNR. Fig. 9
                      provides the SNR of reconstructed signal with/without wavelet transform. As it is seen, the SNR of CS with wavelet transform has better performance than CS without wavelet in all sample rates. For CS with using wavelet transform, for higher sampling rates, the SNR shoots high is indicating that our reconstructed signal is becoming a closer approximate of the original signal. As such, this is showing that using wavelets followed by a CS recovery is successful in recovering MTs with minimum error. In addition to this, wavelets offer lucrative simultaneous time–frequency domain resolution, which aids in the detection of switching time instances and transition frequencies of MTs.

It should be noted that the MT length signal might not be sparse. Therefore, if we apply CS to non-sparse MT signal, we would not obtain good reconstruction performance. However, we have shown that if we apply CS to the wavelet transform of MT length data we can better reconstruct the signal. In practice, since we have only MT length data, first we can estimate the wavelet transform of the MT-length measures, and then, we can apply CS to the wavelet estimate.

To compare the performance of the CS with another method of reconstructing signal, we have applied the piecewise linear interpolation [54] with random sampling to the MT data. Fig. 10
                      shows a RMSE comparison of CS and the interpolation technique. As the figure shows the CS technique has lower RMSE in most sampling rate.

In this paper, we introduce a CS-based sampling method exploiting reconstructions of the microtubule length in the process of dynamic instability with a minimal set of sampled measurements. We have discussed how to use CS to be able to recover the MTs filament length out of a small set of sampled data, which is obtained from the experimental data. The results show that using CS, we can reconstruct the original signal with less sampling rate if CS is applied on wavelet-transformed data. In a sampling rate ranging from 0.2 to 0.5, the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) decreases by approximately 3 times, and between 0.5 and 1, the RMSE is small. We have also applied a peak detection technique to the wavelet coefficients to detect and closely approximate the growth and shrinkage of MTs for computing the essential dynamic instability parameters, i.e., transition frequencies and growth and shrinkage rates. The results also show that using CS along with the peak detection technique and wavelet transform in sampling reduces the recovery errors for the MT length comparing when the wavelet transform is not used. Our approach presents several advantages over traditional sampling methods (the regular periodic sampling method of the data with the elapsed time and low temporal resolution) in the process of sampling of dynamic instability of microtubules. In fact, this work shows a potential of reconstructing the MT length time series as well as the dynamic parameters of the MTs with less RMSE by applying CS to the measured signal of MT length sparse representation.
