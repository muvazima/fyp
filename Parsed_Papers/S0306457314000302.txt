                  Collaborative information retrieval involves retrieval settings in which a group of users collaborates to satisfy the same underlying need. One core issue of collaborative IR models involves either supporting collaboration with adapted tools or developing IR models for a multiple-user context and providing a ranked list of documents adapted for each collaborator. In this paper, we introduce the first document-ranking model supporting collaboration between two users characterized by roles relying on different domain expertise levels. Specifically, we propose a two-step ranking model: we first compute a document-relevance score, taking into consideration domain expertise-based roles. We introduce specificity and novelty factors into language-model smoothing, and then we assign, via an Expectation–Maximization algorithm, documents to the best-suited collaborator. Our experiments employ a simulation-based framework of collaborative information retrieval and show the significant effectiveness of our model at different search levels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An information retrieval (IR) task is generally perceived as an individual process (Catledge & Pitkow, 1995). However, the analysis of user intent within an IR task has underlined the increasing need of collaboration to answer multifaceted (Kashyap, Hristidis, & Petropoulos, 2010) and multitopical queries (Castells, Vargas, & Wang, 2011) where result diversity is expected. Indeed, for such queries and more generally, for complex and exploratory ones (Denning & Yaholkovsky, 2008), collaboration between searchers favors the synergic effect towards the coverage of different aspects of the search results (Shah, 2012b).


                     Shah (2012b) defines collaboration as “a process involving various agents that may see different aspects of a problem […] (and) can go beyond their own individual expertise.” Either synchronous or asynchronous, CIR relies on the awareness, the division of labor and the sharing of knowledge assumptions (Foley & Smeaton, 2010; Morris & Teevan, 2009) for satisfying a “mutual beneficial goal” (Shah, 2012b) of different collaborators within an IR task. In this context, previous research also highlighted the large number of application domains for a collaborative search task, such as medical (Morris & Morris, 2011), academic (Moraveji, Morris, Morris, Czerwinski, & Henry Riche, 2011) or political (Mascaro & Goggins, 2010) domains.

The issue of collaboration has given rise to the need of revisiting search interfaces, IR techniques and IR models that emphasize consensual document rankings (Joho, Hannah, & Jose, 2009; Shah, Hansen, & Capra, 2012). A role taxonomy (Golovchinsky, Qvarfordt, & Pickens, 2009) has been proposed assuming that users can be assigned to different tasks or goals in order to solve a shared information need. This taxonomy states different pairs of roles, such as peers, domain expert/domain novice or prospector/minor, where the latter has already been considered in previous CIR work (Pickens, Golovchinsky, Shah, Qvarfordt, & Back, 2008). More particularly, the pair of roles of domain expert and domain novice, which is addressed in this paper, is based on the assumption that collaborators have different domain expertise levels. Examples of this pair of roles can be found in four application domains: (1) the medical domain (McMullan, 2006; ECDPC, 2011) in which patients and physicians collaborate in order to find and analyze medical information using the web considering that patients dispose of much more time and motivation and can leverage from physicians’ domain expertise in order to distinguish, for instance, similar symptoms; (2) the e-Discovery domain (Attfield, Blandford, & Makri, 2010; Privault, O’Neill, Ciriza, & Renders, 2010) in which the assessment of privileged documents is performed by experts from different trades, namely lawyers, reviewers and lead counsel; (3) the librarian domain (Rudd & Rudd, 1986; Twidale, Nichols, & Paice, 1997) in which users and librarians collaborate for satisfying users’ bibliographic information; and (4) the question–answering domain (Horowitz & Kamvar, 2010; White & Richardson, 2012) in which users collaborate with the asker for solving his/her own information need. Moreover, previous work surrounding user search behavior domain (Allen, 1991; Hembrooke, Granka, Gay, & Liddy, 2005; White, Dumais, & Teevan, 2009) found that users with these two types of roles based on domain expertise level act differently within a search session in terms of submitted queries, used vocabulary or search success. These differences in search behavior raise the question whether a single retrieval model is adequate in a CIR setting. Therefore, we assume that an adapted retrieval setting towards this pair of users may allow to enhance the users’ knowledge throughout the collaborative search session.

With this in mind, we aim to address in this paper the issue of designing a system-mediated CIR framework that considers the difference of domain expertise levels of the collaborators. This difference runs in a wide spectrum including extremums which are namely domain experts and domain novices, described in the role taxonomy (Golovchinsky et al., 2009). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for the design of a CIR ranking model built upon domain expertise-based roles differentiated by a vertical distinction highlighting a hierarchy between domain expertise levels from the most experienced user to the less experienced one. More precisely, we propose a CIR ranking model for supporting a synchronous collaborative search between the symmetric domain expertise-based roles with respect to a shared information need, i.e., novice and expert roles. The goal of the user with the highest domain expertise level towards the query topic is to refine his/her knowledge about the query topic by focusing on specific documents, while the goal of the user with the lowest domain expertise level towards the query topic is to get a better understanding of the query topic by exploring documents with a generic vocabulary. The collaborative retrieval task is an iterative and interactive process which, at each time a collaborator selects a document, ranks a list of those documents that have not been previously selected. The document ranking takes into account the division of labor principle, as detailed in Section 2.1.1, by avoiding redundancy between simultaneous displayed document lists to both users, and the characteristics of his/her role, assuming that the most experienced user towards the query topic would assess documents as relevant if they satisfy two constraints: (1) if they are specific and (2) if they offer a novelty gain with respect to his/her domain knowledge.

A two-step collaborative document-ranking model is proposed for ranking documents according to the domain expertise-based roles. It includes a document relevance scoring and a document allocation to user roles. The first step integrates document specificity and novelty according to user roles within a language model smoothing. Then, the Expectation–Maximization (EM) learning method (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) applied on the document relevance scoring, assigns documents to the most likely suited user. Finally, we ensure that currently displayed document lists do not include the same documents. In order to evaluate our proposed model, we carry out a thorough experimental evaluation for measuring the retrieval effectiveness of our model and analyzing the impact of user roles on the ranking effectiveness.

More particularly, the underlying research questions are:
                        
                           •
                           How to adapt language model smoothing to realize user domain expertise based document relevance scores? As discussed before, search behaviors of experts are different from novices’ ones, particularly in term of vocabulary technicality. Therefore, in addition to fitting the query topic, the relevance of a document also depends on the used vocabulary regarding the domain expertise level of the user. For this purpose, we propose to integrate the user domain expertise level within the smoothing parameter of a language model-based document scoring.

How to utilize user expertise-based document relevance scores in a document ranking framework for collaborative search? Considering a CIR search session, the challenge remains on how to optimize the collaboration and satisfying users, both at an individual and collective level, in so far as they can find relevant documents with respect to the shared information need and their own domain expertise and interest levels. Therefore, we focus on determining which user could be more satisfied by a document according to his/her knowledge expertise and the query topic.

In the following section, we review previous work surrounding CIR domain to put our work in context. Section 3 presents our CIR model aiming at supporting collaboration between users, characterized by different domain expertise levels. In Section 4, we focus on experiments. Section 5 discusses the proposed model, concludes the paper and introduces an overview of our future work.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

CIR has been defined as a process involving multiple users which interact with each other in order to solve a specific information need (Hansen & Järvelin, 2005). A CIR setting is characterized by two main dimensions:
                              
                                 •
                                 The human activity dimension represents collaboration as a process that encapsulates four human behavior activities, from the highest to the smallest granularity level: cooperation, coordination, contribution and communication (Shah, 2012b).

The spatio-temporal dimension is presented in (Golovchinsky et al., 2009; Shah, 2012b). On the spatial side, collocated and remote collaboration are distinguished considering the spatial closeness of the users. On the temporal side, the differentiation between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration depends upon whether or not user activities take place at the same time.

Moreover, CIR is surrounded by three principles, namely the division of labor, awareness and sharing of knowledge (Morris & Teevan, 2009; Foley & Smeaton, 2010). All of these enable avoiding undesired redundant work.

The division of labor aims at splitting up work among users. More particularly, two main lines of approaches can be highlighted:
                              
                                 •
                                 A task-based approach which assigns distinct search tasks among collaborators, such as looking for diversity or analyzing more in-depth document relevance (Pickens et al., 2008; Shah, Pickens, & Golovchinsky, 2010).

A document-based approach which (1) splits the search results in order to display to users distinct document lists (Morris, Teevan, & Bush, 2008; Shah et al., 2010; Soulier, Tamine, & Bahsoun, 2013) and/or (2) removes from document result lists those documents currently seen by collaborators (Foley & Smeaton, 2009; Soulier et al., 2013).

The awareness alerts users of already seen documents or previous submitted queries. Collaborative interfaces may support the awareness principle by means of shared workspace (Shah, 2012a), enabling users to be informed on the selected documents by the other collaborators, or shared interactive tabletops (Morris, Paepcke, & Winograd, 2006; Smeaton, Foley, Gurrin, Lee, & McGivney, 2006) enabling to synchronously see other users’ actions.

The sharing of knowledge enables the information flow among users by means of shared workspaces including annotation or bookmark facilities or adapted tools favoring brainstorming among users, such as instant messaging (Shah, 2012a; Gianoutsos & Grundy, 1996).

Authors in Joho et al. (2009) and Shah et al. (2012) identified two main lines of research to support collaboration within IR tasks. The first one, user oriented, consists of designing novel appropriate interfaces. Several interfaces have been proposed for supporting different collaborative search tasks: finding documents (Golovchinsky & Diriye, 2011; Filho, Olson, & de Geus, 2010), video (Rodriguez Perez, Whiting, & Jose, 2011) or images (Morris et al., 2006). Most of the collaborative interfaces integrate tools such as interactive tables (Morris et al., 2006), visual techniques, such as user implication representation (Erickson, 2010), or IR techniques, such as query reformulation using an evolving search experience (Morris & Horvitz, 2007).

The second line of works, more system-mediated oriented and close to our contribution, suggests revisiting traditional single-IR ranking techniques and models in the light of collaborative IR involving a group of users searching together (Foley & Smeaton, 2009; Morris et al., 2008; Pickens et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2010; Soulier et al., 2013). Among these works, we mainly distinguish two main categories depending on whether or not user roles are considered. Within the first category of works, Foley and Smeaton (2009) and Foley (2008) have proposed the implementation of the two main collaborative search policies in an IR setting: division of labor and sharing of knowledge. While the former is based on the splitting of ranked lists provided to the collaborators, the latter is expressed through a collaborative relevance feedback process for document ranking and query expansion. In order to consider users’ characteristics, the authors estimate document relevance by a relevance term-weighting formula which combines the relevance statistics of each user through users’ authority expressing the users’ expertise towards the search task. Experiments on simulated TREC based collaborative search scenarios show the value of the division of labor policy within a collaborative search and the impact of user’s authority on the search effectiveness. Nevertheless, they underline the failing impact of considering relevance feedback as a diversity factor on retrieval effectiveness. This work is the closest one to ours presented in this paper. The main line of difference relies on the fact that we predefine user roles and ensure both collaborative retrieval effectiveness and mutual benefits to users through personalized document rankings, in contrast to Foley and Smeaton (2009) who estimate the global relevance of documents by linearly combining users’ authority. Morris et al. (2008) have enriched the interface SearchTogether (Morris & Horvitz, 2007) by integrating two ranking algorithms. The smart-splitting algorithm combines division of labor policy with a clustering algorithm for displaying document lists to each individual collaborator. The groupization algorithm provides a final ranked list of documents at the collaboration group level. Both of the underlying methods are based on personalized scores estimated using a profile BM25-based weighting model. As well as work in Morris et al. (2008) and Foley and Smeaton (2009), we ensure the division of labor by displaying to users distinct document subsets. Moreover, we reinforce this principle by splitting results among users by means of the learning Expectation–Maximisation algorithm which assigns documents to the most likely suitable users by taking into account its role within the collaborative search process.

The second category of works (Pickens et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2010; Soulier et al., 2013) consider user roles detailed in a role taxonomy for CIR (Golovchinsky et al., 2009). Pickens et al. (2008) consider two asymmetric roles of users: the prospector explores new fields of the information space and the minor ensures the richness of the fields explored. For both roles, term-weighting and document-ranking functions have been proposed using relevance and freshness scores. Experiments using the TREC-vid dataset show the synergic effect of collaborative search in comparison with result merging of individual searches. Shah et al. (2010) consider two other user roles within a collaborative search: the gatherer and the surveyor. The task of the gatherer is to quickly select accurate documents, whereas the surveyor focuses on providing diversity through selected documents. The authors propose to merge selected document sets provided by both users and then to assign documents to user roles according to the k-means clustering method. The latter is applied on document scores estimated using a voting function. Experiments using TREC ad hoc dataset show promising results but emphasize the need of improving the surveyor role by enhancing search diversity. Unlike other work which consider roles within a two users-size group, Soulier et al. (2013) propose a collaborative ranking model devoted to solving a multi-faceted information need by a group of multiple users, viewed as experts of at least one facet of the query topic. These facets are identified by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method. Accordingly, both documents and experts are modeled by a multi-topical representation where each element represents a facet of the query. Collaborators perform a symmetric and interactive task in which they aim at identifying relevant documents within displayed document lists. The latter are built according to a learning algorithm which assigns documents to the most likely suitable expert with respect to its relevance towards the document query facets. Experiments on the TREC interactive dataset highlight promising results whatever the size of the collaboration group. In this previous work, users are identified according to a horizontal distinction characterized by expertise levels in different sub-topics. In contrast, our proposed model considers a vertical distinction among users with a hierarchy between expertise levels. More generally, we attempt to consider the difference in the domain expertise level of the collaborators, including expert/novice users, in order to enhance the collaborative document ranking. In addition, we consider here the particular context of collaboration between a domain expert and a domain novice for any types of information needs. Accordingly, the model has been adapted in two main aspects: (1) users and documents are modeled by a term-based representation within the proposed model and (2) the document scoring with respect to each user has been tuned with respect to the characteristics of users’ roles.

To the best of our knowledge, we address in this paper a new pair of domain expertise-based roles, namely domain expert and domain novice. The pair of users, assuming domain expert and domain novice roles, have fundamentally different skill sets compared to pairs of roles considered in (Pickens et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2010) and have, accordingly, different approaches and preferences while exploring information.

Generally speaking, two users, involved within a same search session, are characterized by a relative difference of domain expertise level towards the shared information need. Collaborative models (Pickens et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2010) assume that people are different and by collaborating, they can leverage other searchers’ expertise and skills in order to solve a shared information need. Therefore, within a collaborative setting, one collaborator can have more knowledge toward the topic compared to the other ones. Moreover, the domain expertise level difference between users can be explicitly defined within an application domain. Users are also labeled as domain experts or domain novices considering the extremums of the spectrum of their domain expertise levels.

More particularly, previous work surrounding search behavior analysis (Allen, 1991; Hembrooke et al., 2005; Hsieh-yee, 1993; Kang & Fu, 2010; White et al., 2009) have highlighted differences between domain experts and domain novices. One main difference remains on the fact that domain experts are more familiar with technical vocabulary (Allen, 1991; Hölscher & Strube, 2000; Kang & Fu, 2010; White et al., 2009) unlike domain novices who need more term suggestion for getting a better insight of the domain (Hsieh-yee, 1993; Hölscher & Strube, 2000). Accordingly, the expertise may be estimated through term specificity (Kim, 2006) but other authors assimilate the expertise level to the document reading level (Kim, Collins-Thompson, Bennett, & Dumais, 2012) which they integrate in a personnalisation model relying either on a language model (Collins-Thompson & Callan, 2004) or a predictive one (Collins-Thompson, Bennett, White, de la Chica, & Sontag, 2011). As well as query terms are more sophisticated for experts, their queries are longer and more keyword-oriented considering their facilities to formulate a well-know information need (White et al., 2009; Kang & Fu, 2010). Similarly, search strategies and success are different considering the knowledge expertise of users (White et al., 2009; Hembrooke et al., 2005). Indeed, the knowledge level of users impacts on the perception of the information need and, therefore, the search success considering that novices can be limited for linking semantic fields around a topic which may affects the relevance of retrieved documents (Hembrooke et al., 2005).

Considering their collaboration need and their search behavior differences, Filho et al. (2010) have already introduced the pair of domain expert and domain novice within their experimental protocol. Their collaborative interface has been evaluated by a user-study involving Linux experts and Linux novices where the former help the latter to solve an information need. In addition, the pair of domain expert and domain novice roles can be found in two main categories of collaboration:
                           
                              1.
                              The dialogical collaboration (Toomela, 2007), also known as a mutual benefit-based collaboration (Shah, 2012b) and more close to our contribution, operates on the principle that users initiate a collaboration in order to take advantage of its synergic effect and therefore, to get mutual benefits within the solving process of the information need. The whole set of users are active and complementary within the collaboration process. Below, we discuss two application domain examples of this type of collaboration.
                                    
                                       •
                                       The medical domain in which the main challenge remains on finding relevant information about diseases or medication process (Morris & Morris, 2011). Wald, Dube, and Anthony (2007) introduces the notion of “triangulation of patient-Web-physician” in order to characterize the relationships between this pair of users. Patients become active consumers of medical information (ECDPC, 2011) and prepare consultation (Attfield, Adams, & Blandford, 2006; Fox, 2008) whereas physicians are perceived as information searcher helpers. This statement is highlighted by a survey (Podichetty, Booher, Whitfield, & Biscup, 2006) in which 80% of healthcare professionals states that at least one of their patients during their career presents printed information extracted from the web at a consultation. Moreover, developing electronical interaction with patients is also a way to build trust-based relationships with new or prospective patients (Erdem & Harrison-Walker, 2006). In summary, McMullan (2006) asserts that patients and physicians collaborate by finding and analyzing information from the web.

The e-Discovery domain refers to the management of electronic data in order to use them in the case of a civil or criminal litigation and government inspection (Conrad, 2007). The complexities of data management, involving the review, the selection, the circulation of privileged materials requires such different responsibilities, skills and qualifications that a collaboration is needed (Attfield et al., 2010). Two collaboration scenarios can be considered:
                                             
                                                (a)
                                                The pair lead counsel–contract reviewers for which the main task of Lead counsel, viewed as experts, and contract reviewers, viewed as novices in the e-Discovery domain is to identify collaboratively privileged documents. The relevance judgement of these documents is not obvious and needs collaboration (Wang & Soergel, 2010).

The pair reviewers–lawyers, where the task is similar to the first pair. Lawyers, viewed as novices, can benefit from reviewers’ experience towards subtleties of keywords search tools (Privault et al., 2010).

The unidirectional collaboration (Toomela, 2007) operates on the principle that the information need is initiated by only one user which gets the benefits of other collaborators’ knowledge in order to solve his/her information need. In most of the cases, users who ask for collaboration are information consumers, whereas the other collaborators are information producers, as shown in the two following examples of application domains.
                                    
                                       •
                                       The librarian domain in which users, viewed as domain novices, are looking for bibliographic information and may ask for advice to information experts, namely librarians (Kuhlthau, Spink, & Cool, 1992; Taylor, 1968; Twidale & Nichols, 1996; Wielhorski, 1994). In this context, some studies have shown that supporting collaboration between users and librarians by means of information systems avoids overload for both roles. On one hand, it enables users to refine their information need and reduce the amount of time spent for solving their information need. On the other hand, librarians, which take the ownership of users’ information need, can leverage users’ skills by delegating them some information search or analysis (Rudd & Rudd, 1986). Besides helping users to find relevant information, librarians enable users through their advice to develop their search skills in the bibliographic domain (Wielhorski, 1994). Moreover, Twidale and Nichols (1996) emphasized the technical vocabulary gap between these two collaborators and have proposed the Adriane collaborative interface devoted to supporting interactions between these two types of users and promote awareness within the search session.

The question–answering domain in which the answerer helps the asker to solve his information need (White & Richardson, 2012). One of the main underlying challenges in this domain is the expert finding task which consists into identifying the most appropriate answerer, viewed as an expert, in order to give a high quality information for solving the question of another user, which can be viewed as a novice (Horowitz & Kamvar, 2010; White, Richardson, & Liu, 2011; White & Richardson, 2012). For this purpose, adapted interfaces (Horowitz & Kamvar, 2010) or expert finding models (Smirnova & Balog, 2011; White et al., 2011) have been proposed in order to match the asker with the suited domain experts with respect to his information need. Another interesting aspect of the question–answering domain relies on communications between experts and novices. Isaacs and Clark (1987) state that these users involved within a collaborative search session need to adjust their understanding of the information need. In the same way, this clarification need among these users is shown by the fact that the amount of conversations is positively correlated with the domain expertise difference between both users (Isaacs & Clark, 1987; White & Richardson, 2012).

In this section, we describe our CIR model based on the two user roles of domain expert and domain novice. We first introduce the retrieval setting and then detail the ranking model.

We focus, here, on the retrieval aspect aiming at supporting a synchronous collaborative search setting between users with symmetric roles, namely domain expert and domain novice. The aim is to provide different documents to each user in order that both of them get mutual benefits from the collaboration. As shown in Fig. 1
                           , the retrieval task involves a pair of users

Our model also ensures the division of labor principle among collaborators according to three main aspects:
                              
                                 (a)
                                 Documents are allocated according to an Expectation Maximization-based method which assigns documents to users according to the fact that one user is more likely suitable than the other for assessing the document relevance.

The intersection of document lists currently displayed to the whole set of collaborators is empty.

Documents already seen by at least one member of the collaboration group are not considered for the collaborative document ranking.

We formalize users by two main components, namely their roles and their profiles, respectively connected to their relative domain expertise level and their own domain expertise level towards the information need.

We introduce and formalize two symmetric user roles, namely domain expert and domain novice, based on the relative knowledge expertise of users. One can define domain expertise as experience and skills that have been acquired by the user through past works. Characteristics of user roles are based on the following assumptions:
                                 
                                    •
                                    Experts use a more specific vocabulary and an appropriate terminology during a search session (Hölscher & Strube, 2000; Vakkari, Pennanen, & Serola, 2003; White et al., 2009).

Previous work adopted search strategies applied on non-experts, namely novices, for educating them to detect relevant documents, such as query suggestion, and allowing to gain domain knowledge on the query topic (Hsieh-yee, 1993; Hölscher & Strube, 2000; White et al., 2009).

One challenge of document relevance is to take into consideration its novelty in addition to it similarity regarding the query topic (Harman, 2002; Soboroff & Harman, 2005). The novelty need is even more important within an iterative search process in order to avoid retrieving documents similar to already selected ones.

Accordingly, domain experts represent problems at deep structural levels and are generally interested in discovering new associations among different aspects of items, or in delineating the advances in a research focus surrounding the query topic; this led to emphasize both novelty and specificity in the information space. In contrast, domain novices represent problems in terms of surface or superficial aspects and are generally interested in enhancing their learning about the general query topic; this led to emphasize mainly novelty. Considering these statements, user roles are connected to two different measures: document novelty and document specificity, described in what follows.

                                 Step 1: A role-based document scoring in order to estimate the document relevance probability for both users given their respective roles.


                                 Step 2: A user document allocation in order to assign to each document the most likely suited collaborator according to his/her knowledge expertise modeled through his/her profile.

Considering our CIR model framework, the document relevance depends upon the query topic and the users’ characteristics. First, the document relevance probability

Here, we aim at optimizing the document relevance function over role-based scores, computed in the previous step using Eq. (7). The optimized role-based document scores are used for ranking and classifying not already selected documents to the most likely suited collaborator considering his/her domain knowledge. For this purpose, we use the Expectation Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; Marsland, 2009) which is an iterative one based on two steps. The first one, called E-Step, estimates probability

                            is estimated using a mixture model that considers, on the one hand, a gaussian probability law to model the relevance of the document for the user role and, on the other hand, an exponential probability law to model the non-relevance of the same document for the user role. The second step, called M-Step, updates the parameters of the mixture model by maximizing the likelihood of the probability. Notations are described in Table 1

In CIR domain, official datasets with collaborative search log do not exist, except proprietary ones (Morris et al., 2006; Shah, 2012a). To tackle this lack, Foley and Smeaton (2009) have proposed an experimental framework which simulates collaboration through individual search logs. Simulations present several advantages compared to user studies, mainly different scenarios or parameter tuning can be performed with less costs and less time consuming (White, Ruthven, Jose, & Rijsbergen, 2005), although at the cost of being able to generalize findings beyond the context of the simulation. As our goal is to develop a model that assigns user expertise-based relevance scores and not (yet) to assess its support in a naturalistic setting, we follow this framework in order to assess the validity of our model using a standard IR collection issued from TREC

                           1.
                           Analyzing the retrieval effectiveness at the search session level.

Analyzing the retrieval effectiveness at the users’ role level.

Analyzing the impact of the characteristics of the collaborator groups on the retrieval effectiveness.

In what follows, we describe the experimental setup and analyze the obtained results.

In our experiments, we rely on the TREC 6-7-8 interactive track, previously used within the simulation-based framework proposed in (Foley & Smeaton, 2009). One of the goals of users who perform this track is to identify several instances, namely aspects, related to the information need (Over, 2001). The used document dataset is the TREC Financial Times of London 1991–1994 Collection, which is stored in Disk 4 of the TREC ad hoc collection. The collection includes 210,158 articles with an average number of terms of 316 per article. Table 2
                            introduces the statistics of the TREC 6-7-8 interactive dataset. From the 20 TREC topics, 197 user queries have been extracted through runs of participants. After building pairs of collaborators according to four settings, as described in Section 4.1.4, we obtain from 81 to 243 collaborative queries for testing the retrieval effectiveness of our model. TREC interactive participants, namely universities, provide two types of output sets entitled “sparse format data” and “rich format data.” The first one encompasses a list of selected documents, whereas the second one proposes additional details such as the time-stamp, the submitted queries, and seen documents. For our experiments, we extracted individual meta-data for each individual user from all “rich format data.” For this aim, we evaluate 7 participants, including the query, the list of documents selected by the user and their respective time-stamp label selection. The latter expresses how many seconds after the beginning of the search session this document has been selected. The evaluated participants are: Berkeley TREC 6 (bkl6), rmitMG TREC 6 (rmitMG6), rmitZ TREC 6 (rmitZ6), Berkeley TREC 7 (bkl7), Toronto A TREC 7 (torontoA7), Toronto B TREC 7 (torontoB7) and Berkeley TREC 8 (bkl8). Fig. 3
                            illustrates meta-data described above included in the run of the user S1 of rmitMG6 participant for the TREC topic 326i. A set of meta-data is therefore assigned to each user.

Our experimental evaluation rests upon the simulation-based framework detailed in Foley and Smeaton (2009) adapted in two ways (1) user roles are identified through the computation of the domain-expertise levels of users involved in the simulation, based on the specificity of the documents they assessed as relevant; (2) evaluation metrics designed for estimating the effectiveness of collaborative search considering the iterative IR process on one hand, and the user roles on the other hand. We review in what follows the main components of the evaluation setting.

                                       Selective pooling: we consider, here, that the difference in the domain expertise level is absolute and determined in comparison with the expertise level of the overall participants. With this in mind, we built groups by combining domain experts and domain novices previously identified using a k-means classification.

Finally, a domain expert role is assigned to the collaborator with the highest specificity-based or authority-based domain expertise level; inversely, a domain novice role is assigned to the collaborator with the lowest specificity-based or authority-based domain expertise level.

A CIR setting is characterized by collaborators that share the same information need (Foley & Smeaton, 2010). We therefore consider the assumption expressed by Foley (2008) that collaborators formulate collaboratively the initial query for a particular shared information need. Moreover, this statement is strengthened by the fact that, within the TREC interactive dataset, queries include generally 3 terms and 94% have at least one word in common (Foley, 2008). We exploit the meta-data of TREC participants to extract the query

As done in (Foley & Smeaton, 2009), we assume that the maximum level of relevance recall is 30 since that users may examine around 30 documents in a list. Accordingly, we only used relevance feedback expressed at the top 30 to provide the successive document rankings.

Considering the collaborative search setting aiming at retrieving relevant documents and avoiding useless effort through the sharing of knowledge and the division of labor principles, we introduce two categories of metrics:
                              
                                 1.
                                 The precision-based measures aim at measuring the retrieval effectiveness of the collaborative search sessions. It is important to point out here that the length of the sessions in terms of the number of search iterations is irregular over the course of the whole search sessions. Indeed, the number of iterations varies between 3 and 12 according to collaborative search sessions. Highlighted irregularities of session lengths may induce a bias in basic precision measures by favoring long search sessions; to avoid this, we propose an evaluation measure for aggregating precision at the search-session level, namely the micro-averaging precision (Sebastiani, 2002), rather than at the iteration search step level. With this in mind, we define three levels of analysis:
                                       
                                          •
                                          The micro-averaging precision at the session level

                                              computes the precision of search sessions S abstracting the different intermediate-ranked lists of documents displayed within the search iterations. This measure is estimated as follows:

For evaluating the retrieval effectiveness of our model, we use the evaluation measure at rank 30, this measure fits the assumptions of the maximum relevance recall measure and allows us to compare our results to Foley and Smeaton’s model (Foley & Smeaton, 2009). Therefore, metrics are respectively noted

                           Table 3
                            introduces the number of collaborative queries (and groups) within each considered search scenarios.

We compare our model to one individual-based baseline and three collaborative-based baseline scenarios. Below are all the scenarios tested in our experiments.


                           w/oDoL. This scenario includes all the components of our model, detailed in Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 except the second aspect (b) of division of labor principle detailed in Section 3.1.2. This scenario is a collaborative-based search setting considering that the document allocation step based on the EM algorithm, and detailed in Section 3.2.2, assigns a user-oriented document score with respect to the domain expertise level of the whole set of users involved in the collaborative query.


                           w/oEM. This scenario includes only the first component of our model which estimates a user-oriented document score with respect to the domain expertise of one user, as presented in Section 3.2.1. Moreover, we ensure the division of labor principle by removing from the displayed lists documents displayed to other users, which leads to consider this scenario as a collaborative-based search setting.


                           w/oEMDoL. This scenario includes only the first component of our model which estimates a user-oriented document score with respect to the domain expertise of one user, as presented in Section 3.2.1 and in scenario w/oEM. However, the second aspect of division of labor is not ensured and the ranked list of documents provided after the role-based document-scoring step is directly displayed to the user regardless of the rest of collaborators. Accordingly, this scenario leads to an individual-based search setting.


                           Foley and Smeaton’s model, denoted FS. This scenario corresponds to the collaborative ranking model detailed in Foley and Smeaton (2009), and designed for a relevance feedback process. Authors propose both a document relevance scoring extending a probabilistic model (Robertson & Sparck Jones, 1976) and a query expansion method, adapted to a collaborative search setting. The authors propose a unique ranking expressing the global relevance of documents by taking into account user expertise-based factors, namely users’ authority. The latter is estimated through the relevance of terms included in documents selected by the user. The similarity

                           To make this scenario comparable to our model, we assume that the users’ authority expressed in Foley and Smeaton (2009), is similar to the expertise measure estimated through the selected document specificity, used for mining user roles in our experiments, as detailed in Section 4.1.2.1. Foley and Smeaton (2009) propose two versions of the authority measure: the static one assigns the same value for a user throughout the search session, whereas the dynamic one considers that the user’s value can evolve throughout the search session and that one user can be viewed as an expert at one iteration, and a novice for the following one. As our model considers predefined roles identified explicitly at the beginning of the session, we consider the static authority weight which is tuned for each setting detailed in Section 4.1.4. Similarly to Foley and Smeaton (2009), we first tuned the authority measure, and obtained, for the four settings, an optimal value for the static-based authority

                            equals to 0.6 for the most authoritative user, viewed as the domain expert, and 0.4 for the other one, viewed as the domain novice.

                               presents the results of our model, noted OurModel, and the four baselines, described in Section 4.1.5. Results show that our model generally overpasses the baselines according to both the precision-based measures and the collaborative-based ones. We do not observe distinct different statements between both settings which highlight the robustness of both indicators for identifying users’ domain expertise. More particularly, our model reaches significant improvements, namely between 17% and 49% regardless of the metrics and the settings, over the collaborative model FS. This result shows the impact of considering users’ roles within the document scoring, and more particularly the domain expertise towards a document with respect to a topic, estimated by the role-based document scoring step. Another interesting aspect underlined from the results is that the division of labor and the EM-based document allocation step enable to enhance the retrieval effectiveness in contrast to model variants with only one of these components, namely w/oEM and w/oDoL. This suggests that (1) the document allocation step is effective in the document score learning for assigning a document to the most likely suitable user and (2) the integration of the division of labor allows enhancing the relevant coverage of displayed document subsets. However, we observe that the scenario w/oEMDoL without any of these two components is slightly and not significantly more effective in terms of precision which suggests that an individual-based setting should be more effective. However, this statement is counterbalanced by the collaboration-based metrics. Indeed, the coverage-based retrieval effectiveness of our model is significantly better than the scenario w/oEMDoL with a raise from 85% to 142%. We conclude that, even if the scenario w/oEMDoL provides more effective document lists, it seems that documents are redundant over the whole set of displayed document lists, and therefore, the ratio of distinct relevant documents over the search session is lower. Thus, our model is more particularly oriented to residual precision.

We continue the results analysis by focusing on the retrieval effectiveness of our model at the iteration level. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolving micro-precision measure at each iteration k, described in Eq. (20), throughout the whole session performed by the collaborative groups based on an exhaustive pooling, as detailed in Fig. 5
                              . We notice the increasing general trend of the curves with a noticeably improvement between 115% and 119% respectively for each setting

                              , from the beginning to the end of the search session. This statement can be explained by the fact that document scores depend on both users’ roles and relevance judgement-based user profiles enable to refine the shared information need, and, therefore, get a better insight of what relevant documents might be. However, we underline that the dramatic increase at the 11th iteration might not be considered as consistant considering the low number of groups reaching this iteration, namely 4 over 243 for both settings

Here, we consider among the collaborators groups only those including domain experts and domain novices, explicitly defined through a selective pooling process, as expressed in Section 4.1.2. Table 5
                               presents the obtained results using our model and the four baselines. Results highlight similar trend as those previously obtained for the collaboration groups built upon an exhaustive pooling presented in Table 4. More particularly, we observe a global improvement in terms of precision of our model in contrast to scenarios w/oDoL, w/oEM and FS and in terms of coverage-based ratios between 29% and 123% for the whole set of scenarios. We also notice that the expertise level criteria, based either on specificity or authority, does not impact the retrieval effectiveness of our model. Moreover, the obtained results for the selective pooling process highlight that our model is also effective for the particular study case of the collaboration between domain expert and domain novice, identified through the selective pooling methodology.

We also analyze the evolving micro-precision measure of our model throughout the whole session at the iteration level. Fig. 6
                               illustrates such results for collaborative groups based on a selective pooling process. We can see that the results are similar to those illustrated in Fig. 5, except a drop at iteration 8 for setting 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          S
                                       
                                       
                                          Sel
                                          -
                                          Spec
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               which does not seem consistant considering that only one collaborative group among the 95 ones got more than 8 iterations.

These results lead to different conclusions. First, our model allows retrieving more distinct and relevant documents than the other scenarios throughout the whole search sessions. Second, the significant improvement of our model with respect to scenario w/oEM emphasizes the importance of the document allocation step using the EM-algorithm. Indeed, this learning method enables to estimate the user preference for documents with an expertise level as close as his own domain expertise. Third, considering scenarios w/oDoL and w/oEMDoL, we suspect that applying the division of labor principle may lead as a prior state to likely slightly reduce the retrieval effectiveness of collaborative ranking models. However, coverage and relevant coverage-based ratios counterbalance this statement by highlighting that our model provides more distinct and relevant documents throughout the whole search sessions in contrast to models without division of labor which are likely to display redundant documents. Thus, we advocate that collaboration may improve the retrieval effectiveness in terms of diversity and relevance in contrast to an individual setting, instantiated by the baseline w/oEMDoL, which only provides to users relevant documents but do not avoid redundancy between displayed document lists. Fourth, our model retrieval effectiveness significantly improves over the collaborative document ranking FS’ one. It can be explained by the fact that our model takes into account users’ domain expertise for assigning documents to the most suitable users, and, therefore better fits with their knowledge, whereas the scenario FS estimates a global relevance based on the whole users’ relevance judgments. Finally, our model can be applied in different cases. Collaborative groups can rely (1) on a relative domain expertise difference level, namely an exhaustive pooling, in which we consider that a collaborator is more willing to know the domain than the other one or (2) on a selective pooling which clearly identifies expert and novice users of the domain. Moreover, the expertise level of users can be estimated in different ways and results show the robustness of our model regardless of the difference in the domain expertise levels between the collaborators.

Here, we refine our analysis by focusing our experiments at the user-role level. In contrast to the previous analysis which focuses on the retrieval effectiveness regardless of users’ roles, this analysis consists in highlighting the global retrieval effectiveness of our model towards each role throughout the whole set of search sessions.


                           Table 6
                            gives a comparison between the retrieval effectiveness of different used ranking models regarding our four scenarios according to user roles. Within a search session, micro-precisions at rank 30 are estimated using ranked lists displayed to each user role as detailed in Eq. (19). We can see that our model generally overpasses the baselines for both user roles but significant improvements are noticeable only in around 
                              
                                 50
                                 %
                              
                            of the cases. Statements are similar to those obtained for the analysis at the search session level. On one hand, we note that our model provides better results, with significant improvements around 
                              
                                 8
                                 %
                              
                           , than those obtained for the baseline w/oEM, highlighting the importance of this step in the result personalization. Indeed, the EM-based document allocation enables to assign a document to the most suitable user, and, therefore, to provide a better-adapted ranked list to the users’ roles characteristics. On the other hand, we can see that the baseline w/oEMDoL provides better results, generally not significant, than our model for both user roles. One possible reason of this statement could be due to the fact that the scenario w/oEMDoL does not apply any type of division of labor and allows displaying to the a user the same top-ranked documents throughout the whole search session. In contrast, our model is more residual relevance-oriented considering that it applies a double division of labor based on the EM-based document allocation step in addition to the fact of removing currently seen documents from displayed lists. We underline that the effectiveness decreases are only significant in the case of the domain novice role within the exhaustive pooling setting. This observation can be explained by the fact that personalization depends heavily on the users’ predefined roles rather than their expertise levels in the search session.

                           , we expect that the difference in the significance results comes from the non-personalized rankings towards users having close expertise levels. This highlights another reason that probably explains these results: poor relevance feedback collected upon non-personalized document rankings, particularly for novices, might impact negatively the retrieval effectiveness. Moreover, our model obtains significant improvements ranged between

                           , is not significant for the domain novice user. This contrast may be explained by the assumptions of the collaborative baseline FS. Indeed, this collaborative ranking model does not consider user roles and more particularly any personalization within the document ranking. Even if the document relevance is estimated through users’ relevance judgments, the model applies a smoothing of documents rankings leading to an outcome that fits the users’ expertise at the average level rather than the personal one. Thus, the users are treated finally as equal, and in the light of the results obtained according to the role-based analysis, we can assume that they are considered as novices or in other terms FS’ search model is slightly as effective as our model is for novices: we note not significant improvements, from

Moreover, Table 6 highlights that the retrieval effectiveness of domain experts for the four considered scenarios is higher than the domain novices’ one. In order to analyze whether the differences of retrieval effectiveness between domain expert and domain novice roles are significant, we propose a mean comparison of precisions between domain expert and domain novice roles using Student t-test. As we can see from Table 7
                           , the retrieval effectiveness differences between domain novice and domain expert roles are not statistically significant (p-value>0.5). Thus, we cannot conclude if our model favors or not one particular user’ role in terms of displayed document ranking effectiveness.

Our last focus aims at analyzing whether our model enables to improve the search experience of users. In the same spirit, White et al. (2009) introduce the search challenge for novices to reinforce their search behaviors by, for instance, using appropriate vocabulary towards the information need. For this purpose, we aim, here, at analyzing whether domain novice users improve their knowledge about the shared information need, and more specifically, whether they leverage displayed document lists for enhancing the specificity of selected documents. To avoid the bias underlying the specificity-based domain expertise measure used for building collaborative groups, we only performed this analysis for settings relying on the authority-based domain expertise measure. Fig. 7
                            illustrates the evolving average specificity of domain novices users’ displayed documents in comparison to selected documents at each iteration.

Iteration 0 refers to the initialization step

                                       init
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , and the following ones represent iterations

                                       S

                           . First, we focus on the average specificity of displayed document lists over search sessions for evaluating to what extent our model supports the domain expertise development for domain novices. For both exhaustive and selective pooling-based collaborative groups, we highlight that the average specificity of displayed documents drops at iteration 1 which corresponds to the first iteration which begins to personalize document lists by integrating document selection within user profiles. Iteration 0 considers only the query terms as evidence source of the user profile, therefore, document lists displayed at this level are not personalized for each user’s role. From iteration 1, we notice an increasing trend for both curves representing the displayed documents, namely

                           . This trend highlights that our model gives the opportunity to the domain novice users to improve their search skills throughout the search session in so far as that our model displays document lists characterized by an increasing specificity level. Second, we aim at highlighting whether domain novice users’ knowledge is improved throughout the search session. In this aim, we focus on the average specificity of their selected documents at each iteration rather than the displayed ones. We can see from Fig. 7 that the average specificity of selected documents by novice users decreases over iterations for collaborative groups built upon an exhaustive pooling method while this measure increases for selective pooling-based collaborative groups. This highlights that collaborators previously identified as domain novices, using the selective pooling methodology, are more likely to enhance their domain expertise in contrast to users identified as novices only on the consideration of the relative domain expertise difference level among collaborators. Indeed, the exhaustive pooling-based collaborative groups might involve two domain experts with slightly different domain expertise levels.

In this paper, we presented a novel collaborative ranking model based on roles taking into account users’ domain expertise level. Our model includes a document scoring based on user roles and an Expectation Maximization-based learning method for document allocation to user roles. Collaboration is generally supported by a system-mediated approach in which the division of labor principle avoids redundancy among users’ actions, and assigns documents to the most likely suitable user. Our evaluation drawn on a TREC-based simulation framework shows that a collaborative search built on our model is effective at both session and role levels. More specifically, we showed that retrieval effectiveness in terms of precision and diversity improvements are significant. By comparing our model to a state-of-the-art collaborative ranking model, we also underlined that the proposed model is more adapted for collaboratively ranking documents within a CIR task which assumes that users have different domain expertise levels.

Another interesting contribution of our work presented in this paper is that we highlight a generic approach for collaborative ranking models for different users’ roles. Indeed, the first step of our model, namely the role-based document scoring, estimates the document relevance for a user by a role-based smoothing involving the specificity features underlying domain expert and novice characteristics. For another pair of roles, this step might be adapted by considering other roles’ features within the document relevance smoothing toward the collaborator with respect to the shared information need.

However, our collaborative ranking approach has some limitations:
                        
                           •
                           We chose a particular instantiation of CIR setting remaining on a synchronous iterative process which ranks documents after each user’s document selection in order to display new document lists to the same user which better match his evolving domain knowledge. We note, however that the system-mediated CIR ranking task can be viewed differently. For instance, the collaborative search session may be asynchronous, and in this context, interactions between users should be considered in order to analyze the information flow. Also, document lists could be updated only if users consider that these lists do not include any more relevant documents or after a query reformulation. Moreover, our model does not integrate any type of user-driven collaboration, such as interactions among users which can enable to have a better understanding of their current search strategies or their shared information need.

Our model only proposes a collaborative document ranking model at the iteration level. Unfortunately, it does not generate a final list of documents highlighting the collective relevance of both users throughout the whole search session.

Our experimental setup is a simulation of collaboration based upon individual interactive search logs. We highlight that several previous work have performed simulation-based evaluation within a relevance feedback process (Keskustalo, Järvelin, & Pirkola, 2006; White et al., 2005). To make our scenario as natural as possible, we used realistic assumptions: (1) we simulated difference levels of expertise using two indicators, namely specificity and authority, highlighting the expertise level of users (Foley & Smeaton, 2009; White et al., 2005) and (2) we relied on clickthrough data for inferring the relevance of documents, similarly to user-studies performed in Pickens et al. (2008). However, this can lead to different weaknesses. Mainly, the fact that collaboration is extracted from individual logs raise the concern if our experimental setup really reflects users’ behaviors within a collaborative search session. For instance and as mentioned above, the simulated search session does not include all the aspects surrounding a collaborative search session, namely interactions, communications and search strategies among users.

Accordingly, we plan to enhance our model by:
                        
                           •
                           Giving the possibility for users to refine their information need throughout the search session. Our model should allow users to reformulate the collaborative query during the task. Accordingly, users’ profiles could be inferred from their search history including feedback and subtopics of interest issued from the submitted queries. Moreover, we plan to enhance the retrieval model with a final step aiming to provide an aggregated list of relevant documents.

Extending the model for supporting multiple users involved within a collaborative search session. This should allow to optimize collaboration from larger user groups and also leverage collaboration from an increasing difference in the levels of users’ domain expertise.

Validating our simulation methodology by focusing more in-depth on two main aspects: (1) comparing our division of labor appliance with other forms of this principle, for instance by ensuring the topical diversity among document lists in addition to display distinct document subsets and (2) comparing our relevance feedback process, which proposes an immediate personalization ranking after each document selection, with another version which updates document lists only after a query reformulation.

Evaluating our model through a large-scale user study involving collaborators with an expertise difference level identified along the spectrum of the domain expertise. Moreover, we plan to involve dyads and triads in order to analyze the impact of the group size on the retrieval effectiveness of our collaborative ranking model.

Another direction for our future work is to mine dynamically users’ profiles and roles from a running search session using users’ interactions and behaviors. This contribution would aim at implicitly detecting roles which allows to leverage users’ skills and search strategies in which they are the most effective. This process would upstream role-based collaborative ranking models, which, as of now, explicitly assign users’ roles without any consideration of their skills and search strategies.
