@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past years, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are improved to obtain the condition for full color displays and solid-state lighting [1]. Recently, device performances such as high efficiencies and proper CIE coordinates are required in OLEDs for the practical applications. In this regards, the efficient red, green, and blue emitting materials are required. Especially, blue emitting materials are troublesome due to their wide band gap [2–7].

In the blue electroluminescent (EL) materials, anthracene derivatives have been used because of the wide-energy band gap, high quantum yield and good thermal stability [8–13]. However, their EL efficiencies and color purities are not sufficient for the practical applications. Therefore, the suitable strategies to improve their EL performances were required. Among those are the substitutions of anthracene core with the various functional groups. Particularly, the introduction of the various aromatics into C-9 and C-10 positions of anthracene has provided many materials with the efficient EL properties [14–17].

In this paper, we have designed and synthesized two blue emitting materials based on fluorene substituted phenyl anthracene derivatives, 10-(9,9′-dimethyl-2-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9H-fluoren-7-yl)-phenylanthracene (1), and 2′,7′-di-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (2). In these compounds, phenylanthracene moiety was linked by dimethylfluorene and spirofluorene. Fluorene moieties such as alkylated fluorene and spirobifluorene are expected to be good EL building units for OLED materials, due to their excellent fluorescent properties and good morphological, thermal, and electrochemical stabilities [18,19]. However, only a few systematic studies have investigated the EL properties of blue-emitting materials based on fluorene derivatives [20]. To investigate the EL properties of these materials 1 and 2, multilayered OLEDs were fabricated using these materials as the emitting layer. Moreover, to inquire into possibility of white OLED application, we fabricated another device using one of these materials with the combination of well-known red-phosphorescent iridium complex [21,22].

All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers (Aldrich and TCI, both in Seoul, Korea) and were used without further purification.


                        10-(9,9′-dimethyl-2-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9H-fluoren-7-yl)-phenylanthracene (1). 9-Phenylanthracen-10-yl-boronic acid (2.4mol) and the corresponding aryl bromides such as 2,7-dibromo-dimethylfluorene (1.0mol), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.04mol), aqueous 2.0M Na2CO3 (10.0mol), ethanol, and toluene were mixed in a flask. The mixture was refluxed for 4h. After the reaction was completed, water was added to quench the reaction. After cooling, the crude solid was collected by filtration, washed with water and ethanol. The product was purified by recrystallization from CH2Cl2/EtOH. Yield: 65%. 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500MHz, δ): 8.09 (d, J

                        2′,7′-di-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (2). Synthetic route of this compound was identical to that of compound 1, except 2,7-dibromo-dimethylfluorene was changed with 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene].

                        1H- and 13C NMR were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 300Nb or Bruker Avance III 500MHz NMR spectrometer. FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker VERTEX70 FT-IR spectrometer. Low-resolution mass spectra were measured using a Jeol JMS-600W spectrometer in the APCI mode. Elemental analyses (EA) were determined by a Flash 2000 autoanalyzer. The UV–Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra were measured in dichloromethane (10−5
                        M) using Shimadzu UV-1650PC and AMINCO-Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometers. The fluorescence quantum yields of the emitting materials were determined in dichloromethane at 293K against DPA (9,10-diphenylanthracene) as a reference (Ф
                        DPA
                        =0.90) [9]. The photoluminescence spectra in solid films were measured by the following methods; 0.05ml of compounds 1 and 2 (0.02M in dichloromethane) was dropped on quartz and then solvent was dried at the room temperature and under the atmospheric pressure. The photoluminescence spectra were measured using AMINCO-Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels were measured with a low energy photo-electron spectrometer (Riken-Keiki, AC-2). The energy band gaps were determined from the intersection of the absorption and photoluminescence spectra. The LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels were estimated by subtracting the corresponding optical band gap energies from the HOMO energy values. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a SEIKO EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 7300 unit under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10°C/min.

For fabricating OLEDs, the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin films coated on glass substrates were used, which was 30Ω/square of the sheet resistivity and 180nm of thickness. The ITO coated glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath by the following sequences: in acetone, methyl alcohol, distilled water and kept in isopropyl alcohol for 48h and dried by N2 gas gun. The substrates were treated by O2 plasma treatment with the conditions of 2×10−2
                        Torr at 125W for 2min. All organic materials and metal were deposited under high vacuum (5×10−7
                        Torr). All of the properties of the OLEDs such as current density (J), luminance (L), luminous efficiency (LE), and the CIE chromaticity coordinates of OLEDs were measured with Keithly 2400, Chroma meter CS-1000A. Electroluminescence was measured using Roper Scientific Pro 300i.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Synthetic route of 1 and 2 is shown in Scheme 1
                     . Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-cross coupling reaction between the (10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)boronic acid and the corresponding aryl bromide with moderate yields (65% and 78%). All the compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and low-resolution mass spectroscopy. High-performance liquid chromatography was carried out to check the purity of the materials. These analyses revealed that the purity of these materials was at least above 99.5%.

In the molecular structures of compounds 1 and 2, the two anthracene units are linked by a fluorene-based moiety. Decomposition temperature (T
                     d) was observed by TGA process and shown in Table 1
                     . T
                     d of DPA is 241°C and those of two compounds show high values above 400°C. It exhibits no discernible glass transition temperatures (T
                     g) and melting temperatures (T
                     m) at temperature below 350°C. It means that anthracene derivatives with linked fluorene moieties prevent intermolecular interaction, thus compounds 1 and 2 could have high thermal stability.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of 1 and 2, photoluminescent (PL) emission spectra in dichloromethane, and PL emission spectra in thin film. In the UV–Vis absorption spectra, there were three peeks which is located at around 350–400nm. These characteristic absorption peaks were caused by π–π∗ transition of the anthracene moiety. PL spectra of 1 and 2 in dichloromethane showed the maximum emission wavelength at 426nm, in the blue region of the visible spectrum. In PL spectra of 1 and 2 in thin film state, the maximum emission wavelengths showed at 439 and 449nm, respectively. The solid-state PL spectra of 1 and 2 showed bathochromic shift with respect to the corresponding solution PL spectra (ca. 13–23nm). It may be caused by the solid-state packing between adjacent molecules in solid state. Interestingly, the solid-state PL spectrum of compound 2 shows the larger red-shifted emission than that of compound 1, compared to their EL spectra in solution, respectively. The phenomenon can be explained by unexpected suppression of solid state packing in compound 1, in comparison with compound 2. The emission quantum yields in solution of two compounds were 0.83 and 0.99 respectively, and these high values would result in good EL properties in OLED devices. A photoelectron spectrometer (Riken-Keiki AC-2) was used to measure the HOMO levels, and LUMO levels were calculated by subtracting the band gap energies from HOMO levels. The HOMO energy levels of two compounds were −5.85eV and −5.84eV, and the LUMO energy levels were −2.83eV and −2.82eV.

To know the geometric structures and electron distribution of compounds 1 and 2, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out using the Becke’s three parameterized Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) functional with 6-31G∗ basis sets using a suite of Gaussian programs. Calculated dihedral angles between phenyl and anthracenyl group were nearly 90°, and also angles between anthracenyl group and fluorenyl moieties were nearly perpendicular too. Fig. 2
                      showed calculated frontier molecular orbitals of compounds. The HOMOs and LUMOs were located on two anthracene groups, indicating that the absorption and emission process may be attributed to the π–π∗ transition of anthracene moiety. These theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental observations. Because of perpendicular dihedral angles, non-planar structures would prevent the intermolecular interaction and self-aggregation. Therefore, two compounds would have excellent EL performances in OLED devices as blue emitting materials.

In order to understand the EL properties, OLED devices were fabricated with following structure: indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/4,4′-bis(N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino)biphenyl (NPB) (50nm)/blue emitting materials (1 and 2) (40nm)/Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminium (Alq3) (15nm)/lithium quinolate (Liq) (2nm)/Al (100nm). In these devices, ITO was used as anode; NPB was used as hole-transporting layer (HTL); Alq3 was used as electron-transporting layer (ETL); Liq was used as electron-injection layer; and Al was used as cathode. EL properties of the devices were summarized in Table 2
                     .


                     Fig. 3
                      shows the EL spectra of devices A and B. All devices showed sky-blue emissions. The corresponding CIE coordinates of devices A and B were (0.18, 0.25) and (0.22, 0.23) at 7V, respectively. Interestingly, the maximum emission peaks of devices A and B were 486 and 447nm, respectively. The maximum emission peak in EL of device B is similar to that in PL of emitter 2 in thin films. This implies that the emission of device B originates mainly from the singlet excitons of the emitter 2. However, EL spectrum of device A was much different from PL spectrum of emitter 1 in device A. Particularly, the broad and red-shifted peaks were observed in EL of device A. This observation suggests that the contributions of bimolecular recombination states to the EL process of device A are significant. In some multilayer OLEDs, a bimolecular recombination state known as electromer [23] or electroplex [24] was observed. The electromer is a bimolecular recombination state between hole and electron in EML. The electroplex is a charge transfer state between hole of HTL and electron of EML or hole of EML and electron of ETL, which are found at the HTL/EML interface or EML/ETL interface. The existence of electromers or electroplexes in OLEDs usually leads to a red-shifted and broadened emission spectrum [25]. Therefore, these results imply the possibility of formation of electromers or electroplexes during the electroluminescence process in device A 
                     [26].


                     Fig. 4
                      shows the current density, luminance, luminance efficiency, and power efficiency of devices A and B. Devices A and B exhibited the efficient sky-blue emission with luminance efficiencies of 3.37 and 3.14cd/A, and power efficiencies of 1.50 and 1.30lm/W, at 20mA/cm2 respectively. Devices A and B showed the similar EL efficiencies in the low current region. However, in the high current density region, device B underwent the roll-off in the EL efficiencies. For this reason, the EL efficiencies of device A are much superior to those of device B at the high current density region. Presumably, at high current density region in the device B, the quenching of excitons by charge-carriers such as electrons and holes would contribute to the reduced EL efficiencies of device B in comparison with device A. Previously, the EL properties of 2′,2′-Bis-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene], which has similar structure with compound 2 {2′,7′-Bis-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]} except the different linkage of phenylanthracene moieties with spirobifluorene, were reported [14,15]. A device using the structural isomer of compound 2 showed the efficient blue emission with luminance efficiency of 2.76cd/A and power efficiency of 1.15lm/W at 20mA/cm2, respectively. The CIE coordinate of this device was (0.16, 0.14). Compared to this device using the isomer of compound 2, device B using compound 2 showed the improved EL efficiencies in spite of the worse color purity. These observations demonstrate that the subtle structural changes of the emitting materials have the profound effects on the EL performances of OLED devices using them.

Since the performances of device A were more superior to device B, EL spectra of device A were investigated at different applied voltages, as shown in Fig. S1. Despite the increasing of applied voltages, there was little change of the intensified peaks in each of EL spectrum. As a result, stable sky-blue emission could be obtained even from low-voltage to fairly high-voltage in device A.

To test sky-blue emitting material 1 as the emitter for the efficient white light emission, multilayered white OLEDs (WOLEDs) were fabricated with a device structure: ITO/NPB (20nm)/CBP:iridium(III) bis(2-phenylquinoline)acetylacetonate (Ir(pq)2acac) (8%, 5nm)/CBP (5nm)/1 (20nm)/Bphen (30nm)/Liq (2.0nm)/Al (100nm). In this device, 1 was used in the blue emitting layer. Also, a CBP was used as the host material for a dopant and Ir(pq)2(acac) in the red emitting layer. Fig. 5
                      shows luminous efficiency and power efficiency as a function of current density for WOLED using 1. Fig. 6
                      shows external quantum efficiency-current density curves and EL spectra of the WOLEDs using 1 at 6V and 14V. The white-light device with the CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.37) at 6V and (0.33, 0.36) at 14V exhibits a luminous efficiency of 1.38cd/A, power efficiency of 0.94lm/W, and external quantum efficiency of 1.70%, at 20mA/cm2. As shown in Fig. 6, two main peaks in the EL spectra (450–520 and 570–650nm) were combined complementarily to exhibit the white emission. Fig. S2 shows CIE coordinates of WOLED using 1 at the different applied voltages. Despite the increasing of applied voltages, there was little change of the values of CIE coordinates. As a result, stable white emission could be obtained even from low-voltage to fairly high-voltage in WOLED using 1 
                     [27].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, the two blue emitting materials based on phenylanthracene-substituted fluorene derivatives have been synthesized and characterized. Particularly, a device using 1 exhibited a luminous efficiency, power efficiency, external quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates of 3.37cd/A, 1.50lm/W, 1.87% at 20mA/cm2 and (0.18, 0.25) at 7V, respectively. Furthermore, another device using combination of blue emitting material 1 and red phosphorescent bis(2-phenylquinoline)acetylacetonate [(pq)2Ir(acac)] showed the efficient white emission with a external quantum efficiency of 1.70%, luminous efficiency of 1.38cd/A, power efficiency of 0.94lm/W at 20mA/cm2 and the color coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) at 14V. This study demonstrates that a phenylanthracene-substituted fluorene derivative 1 possesses excellent properties for efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs as well as white OLEDs.
