                  Margin distribution is acknowledged as an important factor for improving the generalization performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning algorithm named Double Rotation Margin Forest (DRMF), that aims to improve the margin distribution of the combined system over the training set. We utilise random rotation to produce diverse base classifiers, and optimize the margin distribution to exploit the diversity for producing an optimal ensemble. We demonstrate that diverse base classifiers are beneficial in deriving large-margin ensembles, and that therefore our proposed technique will lead to good generalization performance. We examine our method on an extensive set of benchmark classification tasks. The experimental results confirm that DRMF outperforms other classical ensemble algorithms such as Bagging, AdaBoostM1 and Rotation Forest. The success of DRMF is explained from the viewpoints of margin distribution and diversity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Ensemble learning has been an active research area in pattern recognition and machine learning domains for more than twenty years [1,29,38,45,59]. Ensemble learning, also referred to as multiple classifier systems, committees of learners, decision forest or consensus theory, is based on the idea of training a set of base classifiers or regressors for a given learning task and combining their outputs through a fusion strategy.

A significant amount of works have been focused on designing effective ensemble classifiers [15,20,25,39]. However, an exact explanation of the success of ensemble strategies is still an open problem. Some researchers explored how an ensemble’s effectiveness is related to the large margin principle, which is regarded as an important factor for improving classification [42,51]. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning algorithm named Double Rotation Margin Forest (DRMF), which is designed to improve the margin distribution of ensembles by enhancing the diversity of base classifiers and exploiting this diversity using an optimization technique.

In general, there are two well-accepted viewpoints – diversity and margin – to explain the success of ensemble learning. Roughly speaking, the margin of a sample is its distance from the decision boundary and thus reflects the confidence of the classification. The margin distribution is acknowledged as an important factor for improving the generalization performance of classifiers [2,6,11,43,49]. In [43], Shawe-Taylor et al. gave an upper bound of generalization error in terms of the margin, while in [6] a similar bound was derived for neural networks with small weights. The large margin principle has been employed to design classification algorithms in [8,14,21,26,50].

The performance of ensemble learning methods, especially boosting, has been attributed to the improvement of the margin distribution of the training set [42,51]. In AdaBoost, each new base classifier is trained by taking into account the performance of the previous base classifiers. Training samples that are misclassified by the current base classifiers play a more important role in training the subsequent one. The success of Adaboost can thus be explained from the margin distribution, where the optimization objective is to minimize a margin distribution based exponential loss function. In [42], an upper bound of the generalization error was derived in terms of the margins of the training samples, and it was shown that the generalization performance was determined by the margin distribution, the number of training samples and the number of base classifiers. The efficacy of AdaBoost thus lies in its ability of effectively improving the margin distribution. In [51], Wang et al. showed that a larger Equilibrium margin (Emargin) and a smaller Emargin error can reduce the generalization error, and demonstrated that AdaBoost can produce a larger Emargin and a smaller Emargin error.

It is acknowledged that the diversity among the members of an ensemble is crucial for performance improvement. Intuitively, no improvement can be achieved when a set of identical classifiers are combined. Diversity thus allows different classifiers to offer complementary information for classification, which in turn can lead to better performance [28]. A number of techniques have been proposed to introduce diversity. In general, we can divide these into two categories: classifier perturbation and sample perturbation approaches. Classifier perturbation refers to the adoption of instability of learning algorithms [10,36] such as decision trees and neural networks. Since they are sensitive to initialization, trained predictors may converge to different local minima if started from different initializations, and diversity can thus be generated from trained classifiers. Sample perturbation techniques train classifiers on different sample subsets or feature subsets, and include bagging, boosting, random subspaces and similar approaches [4,7,17,41].

Since both diversity and margin are argued to explain the success of ensemble learning, it appears natural to question whether there is a connection between the two. Tang et al. [46] proved that maximizing the diversity among base classifiers is equivalent to optimizing the margin of an ensemble on the training samples if the average classification accuracy is constant and maximal diversity is achievable. Consequently, increasing the diversity among base classifiers is an effective method to improve the margin of ensembles. Our work is motivated by this conclusion, and our aim is to improve the margin distribution of ensembles.

In our proposed approach, we enhance the diversity of base classifiers by perturbing the samples using double random rotation. This idea is inspired by the PCA rotation proposed in the Rotation Forest algorithm [39]. In Rotation Forest, a candidate feature set is randomly split into K subsets and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is conducted on each subset to create diverse training samples. Diversity is thus promoted through the random feature splits for different base classifiers. In our work, the feature sets are also randomly split into K subsets. In order to introduce further diversity between the base classifiers, we apply PCA and Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA). In particular, we first perform unsupervised rotation with PCA, and then employ supervised large-margin rotation with LSDA. LSDA [12], as a supervised method, is able to derive a projection which maximizes the margin between data points from different classes. Our experimental results show that the applied Double Rotation can consistently enhance the diversity in a set of base classifiers.

We further exploit the diversity and improve the margin distribution with an optimal fusion strategy. In principle, there are two kinds of fusion strategies. One approach is to combine all available classifiers, e.g., in simple (plurality) voting (SV) [28] or through linear or non-linear combination rules [5,9,19,48]. The other method is to derive selective ensembles, or pruned ensembles such as LP-Adaboost [23] or genetic algorithm (GA)-based approaches [53], which only select a fraction of the base classifiers for decision making and discard the others. Clearly, the key problem here is how to find an optimal subset of base classifiers [32]. In the GASEN approach [55], neural networks are selected based on evolved weights to constitute the ensemble. In [54], the subset selection problem is formulated as a quadratic integer programming problem, and semi-definite programming is adopted to select the base classifiers. Both GASEN and semi-definite programming are global optimization methods and thus their computational complexity is rather high. Suboptimal ensemble pruning methods were proposed to overcome this drawback, including reduce-error pruning [31], margin distance minimization (MDM) [33], orientation ordering [34], boosting-based ordering [35], and expectation propagation [13]. In practice, users would prefer sparse ensembles since computational resources are often limited [57]. In this paper, we introduce a technique to improve the margin distribution by minimizing the margin induced classification loss. In our pruned ensembles, the weights of base classifiers are trained with 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      regularized squared loss [56]. The base classifiers are then sorted according to their weights, and those with large weights are selected in the final ensemble.

Our presented work comprises three major contributions. First, since diversity is considered to be an important factor which affects the classification margin, Double Rotation is proposed to enhance the diversity among base classifiers. Second, we present a new pruned fusion method based on the Lasso technique for generating ensembles with optimal margin and sparse weight vectors, where the weights are learned through minimization of the regularized squared loss function. Third, we present an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and explain the rationality of the proposed algorithm. We convincingly show that it can improve the margin distribution to a great extent and lead to powerful ensembles.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes our proposed algorithm, while an analysis in terms of parameter sensitivity and robustness is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results and explores the rationality of DRMF. Finally, Section 6 offers conclusions and future work.

In [42,51], it is shown that a small generalization error for a voting classifier can be obtained by a good margin distribution on the training set. Obviously, the performances of the base classifiers have a significant effect on the margin of

                           is regarded as a constant and if maximum diversity is achievable, maximization of the diversity among base classifiers is equivalent to maximization of the minimal margin of the ensemble on the training samples.
                        

It should be noted that our aim is not to maximize the minimal margin of the ensemble, but to optimize the margin distribution. We use a disagreement measure [30] to measure the diversity of the base classifiers in our approach.

In [39], Rodríguez and Kuncheva designed a method to generate ensembles based on feature transformation. The diversity of base classifiers is promoted by random splits of the feature set into different subsets. The original feature space is split into K subspaces (the subsets may be disjoint or may intersect). Then, PCA is applied to linearly rotate the subspaces along the “rotation” matrix. Diversity is obtained by random splits of the feature set.

Cai et al. [12] proposed a supervised algorithm for feature transformation, which can find a projection that maximizes the margin between different classes. For

As shown above, diversity is an important factor to improve margin distribution. In [42,51], the relationship between the generalization performance and the margin distribution of the training set was derived. It was found that if a voting classifier generates a good margin distribution, the generalization error will be small. Motivated by these results, we propose a novel technique to generate diverse base classifiers and to exploit diversity for producing good ensembles with an optimal margin distribution.

                         can lead to a good linear classifier. In fact,

                         is related to the number of base classifiers in the ensemble since if there are fewer base classifiers,

                         can be understood as the root of the squared loss of ensembles, which is determined by the margin distribution of the ensemble. Based on the theorem, we can design an optimization objective to learn the weights of the base classifiers.

The above function only considers the classification loss related to the margin distribution. The number of base classifiers is not taken into account. However, from Theorem 2 we know that only few base classifiers should be included in ensembles, and consequently the weight vector should be sparse. A sparse model is expected to improve the generalization performance [18,22,58]. In order to obtain a sparse weight vector, we add the

                        This is the well-known Lasso problem [47]. While Lasso has been employed in regression ensembles [24], we here apply it to classification tasks. Lasso can be explained as a large margin solution in classification in terms of the infinite norm [40].

Essentially, our proposed technique is an ordered aggregation pruning method based on the weights of the base classifiers, where the weights are trained by minimizing a margin induced classification loss.

There are several parameters to be set in our proposed algorithm. In this section, we discuss how these parameters affect the performance of the generated classifier.

First, we discuss how to set K, i.e. the number of splits. We do this based on numerical experiments on various UCI [3] datasets. We set K to 2, 3, 4, 5, and then compare the resulting performances of DRMF. The ratio of bootstrap samples was set to 0.75, the number of candidate base classifiers was 100 and J48 decision trees from the WEKA library [27] were used as base classifiers.


                     Table 1
                      describes the 20 classification tasks we used. For every classification task, standard 10-fold cross validation is performed.

In Table 2
                     , we report the classification performance of DRMF with different random splits. As we can see from there, K has some influence on the performance of the generated ensembles. Since random splits of the features lead to different rotations, diverse base classifiers are generated. However, if K is too large, the number of features in each subset may become too small and hence not sufficient to effectively represent the learning task, thus leading to a drop in performance. The experimental results in Table 2 indicate that DRMF produces good performance if 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                     , and we consequently set 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                      in the remainder of experiments.

In DRMF, the number of candidate base classifiers should be set before training. Hence, next we investigate how many candidate base classifiers are sufficient to lead to a good ensemble. We thus perform experiments varying the number of base classifiers L as 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100, respectively. Table 3
                      compares the classification performance of DRMF with these settings for L. As we can see from there, the overall performance improves when L becomes larger. However, if 
                        
                           L
                           ⩾
                           80
                        
                     , the difference is not significant, and we consequently use 
                        
                           L
                           =
                           100
                        
                      in the following experiments.

In Margin Based Pruning (Algorithm 2), we utilize simple voting in lines 5 and 9. That is, the class that receives the largest number of votes is considered as the final decision. In contrast, in weighted voting, the votes are weighted and the ensemble decision is the class with the largest sum of weights of votes. Since we calculate the weights in line 2 of Algorithm 2, a natural question that arises is whether applying a weighted voting strategy would give better results. To answer this, we give, in Table 4
                     , the classification accuracies and the number of selected base classifiers
                        2
                        Different fusion strategies will lead to different ensemble sizes.
                     
                     
                        2
                      using the two fusion strategies. From Table 4 we can observe that simple voting performs typically better than weighted voting, while it also leads to smaller ensembles.

To further investigate why simple voting is better than weighted voting, we perform some additional experiments to explore the relationship between the weights of the base classifiers and their classification performances. Fig. 1
                      shows the relationship between the classification accuracy and the ranking of their weights. Here, the x-axis indicates the ranking of the weight with 1 indicating the largest weight of the base classifier and 100 the smallest. From Fig. 1 we can conclude that base classifiers with large weights do not necessarily have better classification performance compared to those with small weights. Weight learning considers both the diversity among base classifiers and their performances and hence while the weights can be used to rank the base classifiers, they do not reflect their classification performances.

In our algorithm, the base classifiers are added to the ensemble one by one. Base classifiers with the large weights are included first. Fig. 2
                      plots the classification accuracies when the base classifiers are added, for both simple and weighted voting. From there, we can notice that the best classification accuracy obtained by simple voting is often higher than that of weighted voting, confirming that simple voting can produce better performance than weighted voting. We can also see that fusion based on only a subset of base classifiers is better than combining all of them, which is consistent with the findings from [55].

Margin Based Pruning has two main components. One is to learn the weights for the base classifiers via the minimization of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 J
                              
                              
                                 W
                              
                           
                        
                     , while the other is to select the base classifiers. Some of the weights might be zero, and we consequently tested whether the classification performance is affected if we remove base classifier with zero weights. For this, in Table 5
                     , we compare the fusion accuracy of base classifiers that receive non-zero weights (denoted by LASSO in Table 5) with the fusion accuracy of DRMF. It can be seen that DRMF performs better than LASSO, and thus that Steps 3–8 in Algorithm 2 are indeed useful for improving the classification performance. We also analyze the differences between the base classifiers selected by the two strategies. From Table 5 it is apparent that the average accuracy of the base classifiers in DRMF is higher than that of the base classifiers that receive non-zero weights, and the diversity among base classifiers in DRMF is also higher than that of the base classifiers with non-zero weights.

Finally, we compare the robustness of DRMF with that of Rotation Forest and J48. For that, we first generate noisy samples by randomly revising the labels of some training samples with the percentage of relabeled samples varying from 3% to 30%. Fig. 3
                      shows the variation of classification accuracies when we increase the noise rate in the training set. As is apparent, DRMF shows superior robustness compared to both Rotation Forest and J48. In particular, for DRMF the variation of the classification accuracies remains small as the rate of mislabeled samples increases.

We further consider the robustness of the algorithms with respect to attribute noise and add Gaussian noise to the features of the training data. The mean of the noise is zero, while we vary the standard deviation from 0 to 0.5, and show the results in Fig. 4
                     . As we can observe from there, DRMF is more robust with respect to attribute noise than J48, and performs similarly compared to Rotation Forest.

In this section, we compare DRMF with some other representative classification algorithms including J48, Rotation Forest, AdaBoostM1,and Bagging, on the 20 datasets from Table 1. For all ensembles, base classifiers are generated using J48. For DRMF and Rotation Forest, we set 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                     , the rate of bootstrap sampling to 0.75 and the number L of base classifiers to 100. The parameters of Bagging and AdaBoostM1 were kept as their default values in WEKA, while the number of base classifiers was also set to 100. We performed standard 10-fold cross validation to compute the classification performance. Table 6
                      gives the classification accuracies on all datasets together with the standard deviations for all evaluated algorithms.

We further employ a test for statistical significance, namely the Nemenyi test [37], to compare the algorithms. In this test, the critical difference [16] for the five algorithms and 20 data sets at significance level

                     . Consequently, DRMF was shown to perform statistically significantly better than all other methods.

Next, we discuss why, compared with Rotation Forest, DRMF is able to further boost the classification performance. First, it can be seen that the parameter K in DRMF and Rotation Forest was set to 2 in the above experiments. From Table 2 we know, that 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                      is suitable for DRMF. In order to verify whether 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                      is also suitable for Rotation Forest, the classification performances of Rotation Forest with different numbers of splits are given in Table 7
                     . From there, we can see that Rotation Forest also produces good performance if 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                        
                     .

The difference between DRMF and Rotation Forest mainly comprises two parts: the use of Double Rotation to generate the base classifiers, and Margin Based Pruning. Thus, we explore whether they are both necessary for improving the classification performance of the ensemble. For this, we test four combinations: Rotation Forest (RF); a combination of Double Rotation and the fusion strategy in Rotation Forest i.e. simple voting of all base classifiers (DRSF), a combination of PCA rotation and Margin Based Pruning (PRMF), and DRMF. The results are presented in Table 8
                     . As we can confirm from there, both Double Rotation and Margin Based Pruning are indeed useful for improving the classification performance.

Further, we compute the margin distribution of the ensembles generated using the above four classification algorithms, where the margin of a sample is computed as the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of the votes received by any wrong label [42]. A large margin is understood as a “confident” classification, and thus we would desire that large margins of the training samples are derived. Fig. 5
                      shows the margin distribution when RF, DRSF, PRMF and DRMF are used. We can observe, that compared with RF, DRMF improves the margin distribution on the training set, which confirms that both Double Rotation and Margin Based Pruning are helpful for improving the margin distribution.

So, why does Double Rotation improve the margin distribution of the training set? From Theorem 1, we know that the margin of the training samples has an underlying relationship with the diversity of the base classifiers. We thus compare the diversity of the base classifiers when employing Double Rotation and PCA rotation, and show the results in Fig. 6
                     . From there we can notice that the diversity among base classifiers is consistently enhanced after Double Rotation. However, from Fig. 7
                      we see that the average accuracies of the two kinds of base classifiers are almost the same. Consequently, we can derive that the improvements of the margin distribution come from the diversity, and not from the improved accuracies of the base classifiers.

Finally, we conducted some experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed Margin Based Pruning (Margin-P) algorithm and compared it with other ensemble pruning techniques based on the margin including MeanD-M [52] and the improved version of MDM [32,33]. MeanD-M optimizes the average margin via a backward elimination strategy. In particular, it ranks the contribution and importance of every base classifier

                      is appropriate. Here the improved version is used for comparison with our method.

In MeanD-M, base classifiers are eliminated from the original ensemble one by one and the sub-ensemble with the best accuracy on the test set is used to estimate its performance. Thus, we also use the best accuracy on the test set to estimate the classification performance for MDM and Margin-P. The results of the experiment are given in Table 9
                     . From there, we can confirm that our algorithm does indeed performs better than the pruning strategies in most cases.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

Ensemble learning is an effective approach to improve the generalization performance of a classification system. In this paper, we have proposed Double Rotation Margin Forest (DRMF) as an effective new ensemble learning algorithm. The idea of DRMF is to improve the generalization performance by improving the margin distribution on the training set. Extensive experimental results on 20 benchmark datasets confirm that DRMF provides a competent ensemble learner, and allows us to draw several conclusions: (1) Double Rotation with PCA and LSDA is able to generate diverse base classifiers; (2) The margin distribution of the ensemble system is improved if a set of diverse base classifiers is exploited by optimizing a regularized loss function, and consequently the classification performance of the ensemble is enhanced; and (3) The DRMF algorithm outperforms classical ensemble learning techniques such as Bagging, AdaBoostM1 and Rotation Forest.

Our work is motivated by the idea that diversity among base classifiers can improve the margin distribution of the ensemble. However, no deep discussion on this issue has been reported so far. Further theoretical analysis on the relationship between diversity and margin is thus required. While in this paper, we use Double Rotation to create diversity, some other techniques could also be introduced. A systematic discussion on generating diversity would therefore present an important task. Although DRMF is presented as an approach to create homogenous ensembles (e.g., based only on decision trees as the base classifiers), it is straightforward to use DRMF to learn and prune heterogeneous classifiers for ensemble learning. Exploring the effectiveness of DRMF in such a setting might be an interesting avenue.
