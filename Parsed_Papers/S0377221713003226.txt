                  This paper deals with a mean–variance optimal portfolio selection problem in presence of risky assets characterized by low-frequency trading and, therefore, low liquidity. To model the dynamics of illiquid assets, we introduce pure-jump processes. This leads to the development of a portfolio selection model in a mixed discrete/continuous time setting. We pursue the twofold scope of analyzing and comparing either long-term investment strategies as well as short-term trading rules. The theoretical model is analyzed by applying extensive Monte Carlo experiments, in order to provide useful insights from a financial perspective.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Portfolio selection represents one of the most explored topics in finance, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. The pioneering work on the analysis of wealth allocation is due to Markowitz (1952). This celebrated uniperiodal model is grounded on the basic assumptions of normally distributed returns and absence of transaction costs. These conditions ensure mathematical tractability.

Despite these rather restrictive assumptions, the original framework continues to attract scientific interest. Cerqueti and Spizzichino (2012) provide a rereading of the classical model of 1952 through the concept of semi-copula, and derive some specific behaviors of investors taking position in a mean–variance uniperiodal market, with normally distributed stock returns. Leung, Ng, and Wong (2012) derive explicit formulas for correctly estimating the optimal portfolio return. Rambaud, Perez, Sanchez Granero, and Trinidad Segovia (2009) rewrite the Markowitz’ model in a topological framework and show the connections between portfolio selection and the concept of distance in the Euclidean spaces. The most prestigious -and, maybe, most recent- reference is due to the father of portfolio selection, who has provided a survey on a half-century of research related with mean–variance approximation and expected utility (see Markowitz, 2012).

Although the relevance of the original setting, the assumptions underlying Markowitz’ model seem to be too restrictive and rather unrealistic, even if they contribute to the construction of a very nice and elegant framework. Hence, the original model has been extended in several respects by Markowitz’ followers.

Some Authors propose an extension of the classical mean–variance model in a multiperiodal setting. Amongst the others, see the classical works of Samuelson (1969), Hakansson (1971) and Mossin (1968). More recently, it is worth citing Li and Ng (2000), whose work is extended by Leippold, Trojani, and Vanini (2004) that propose also a brief literature review on the mathematical difficulties generally encountered in solving mean–variance models in a multiperiodal setting.

A different strand of literature focuses on portfolio selection models in a continuous time environment. The pioneer of this research field is Merton (1969, 1971). In this respect, several important contributions have appeared: Zhou and Li (2000), Lim (2004), Xia (2005), Li and Zhou (2006), Steinbach (2001) and Bielecki, Jin, Pliska, and Zhou (2005), only to cite a few. The last two papers are also very useful for the extensive treatment of the original Markowitz’ framework.

Continuous-time models represent a remarkable improvement of Markowitz (1952), even if they are not able to capture all the peculiarities of the structure characterizing financial markets. Two paradigmatic examples supporting this evidence are represented by transaction costs – which occur only when a transaction is performed – and liquidity deficiencies – which imply occasional trading opportunities on illiquid stocks.

In particular, the stock liquidity represents a key aspect of a trading strategy. It is commonly accepted that the frequency of trade may be viewed as a measure of liquidity, in the sense that low frequency trading is synonymous of low liquidity. In the following, infrequently traded stocks will also be denoted as thin or light stocks.

It is important to note that thin securities are rather widespread in the financial markets, mainly in emerging countries. Given the nature of infrequently traded assets, it is easy to identify a significant relationship between low trading volumes and low market quality (i.e.: wide bid/ask spreads, high volatility, low informative efficiency, high adverse selection costs, etc.). Actually, such links have been documented by several empirical studies (see, for example, Easley, Kiefer, O’Hara, & Paperman, 1996).

In this paper, we propose an extension of the mean–variance Markowitz’ model by considering the presence of light stocks. We deal with an optimal portfolio model in a mean–variance framework assuming that a riskless bond, liquid risky assets and thin stocks are traded in the market. We proceed as follows: first, we select the optimal portfolio focusing on long-run strategies. The decision criterion is given by the maximization of the expected discounted mean–variance utility function associated to portfolio returns; second, we implement a short-term trading rule based on Sharpe ratios (Sharpe, 1966) to decide day-by-day a market strategy. Such a trading rule moves from the optimal portfolio found in the long-run context. A comparison between the long-run optimal portfolio and the short-term trading strategy is performed, and a related discussion about the financial results is carried out.

The problem is faced both under a theoretical perspective as well as an extensive simulation analysis. More precisely, we first propose a rigorous mathematical formalization of the wealth allocation problem, and then study it by applying Monte Carlo simulations which allow to supply more intuitive insights.

The merging of the mean–variance multiperiodal framework with a financial setting characterized by the presence of thin stocks represents the main novelty of this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a proposal appears.

By a mathematical perspective, as already argued above, the continuous-time hypothesis seems to be able to realistically describe the dynamics of frequently traded risky assets, but it becomes unreasonable when low liquidity is considered. To remove this inconsistency, we introduce random discrete trading times for the dynamics of the returns of thin stocks. In details, we model the dynamics of the light stocks through jump processes following a Levy law. In doing this, we adopt the framework discussed by Pham and Tankov (2008), Cretarola, Gozzi, Pham, and Tankov (2011) and Castellano and Cerqueti (2012). It is worth to note that Levy processes are particularly appropriate for providing a distribution of the returns of infrequently traded assets. In this respect, Schoutens (2003) and Cont and Tankov (2003) provide excellent surveys on the use of Levy processes in financial modeling.

The assumption on the dynamics of the light stocks leads to portfolios with returns evolving according to jump-diffusions. Some prominent works dealing with portfolio selection in a jump-diffusion context are: Aase (1984); Framstad, Oksendal, and Sulem (1998, 2001) and, more recently, Castellano and Cerqueti (2012). Matsumoto (2006) and Rogers and Zane (2002) model discrete random trading times which follow a Poisson law. Cretarola et al. (2011) deal with a consumption/portfolio selection model where only illiquid assets are considered. Each of the quoted papers and the present one face the wealth allocation problem through stochastic control theory. For an excellent tutorial on this field, in the particular case of state variables driven by jump-diffusions, see Oksendal and Sulem (2007).

The paper is organized as follows. Next section presents the description of the financial environment, along with the dynamics of the returns of the risky assets and the riskless bond available in the market. Section 3 illustrates the theoretical optimal portfolio selection problem in the case of long-run strategies. Section 4 is related with the description of the short-term trading rule in a very general setting. Section 5 describes the procedure used in the numerical experiments and discusses the results of the application, providing some concluding remarks. The Appendix A contains pseudo-codes related with the numerical procedures.

According to the model of Pham and Tankov (2008), we assume that investors can trade the j-th thin stock only at random times

                     Random times are assumed to be not influenced by the dynamics of the prices of liquid and light assets. To meet this evidence, we state an assumption, that will stand in force hereafter.

The agent can share her/his whole capital among the assets available in the market.

Investment strategies depend on time, as it naturally should be. Moreover, in line with the original Markowitz’ model, the ordered shares of capital invested in risky assets, thin stocks and riskless bond at time t are deterministic and constitute a vector χ(t) as follows:

It is interesting to analyze the performance of the long-run optimal portfolio in the short-term. We here aim at considering the optimal portfolio obtained in the long-run analysis and measure its performances on a restricted set of dates preceding the trading days. This represents a comparison between long-run and short-term performances.

According to (10), the value of the optimal portfolio χ

The short-term analysis is performed by introducing a trading rule. At this aim and without losing of generality, we assume hereafter that time is discrete as measuring trading days, and label it as

The investor bases her/his evaluation on the uniperiodal returns of the optimal portfolio computed in the ℓdates before the trading day, where ℓ=1,2,…,
                     T and T is the number of available past realizations of all the stocks returns. Obviously, the higher the value of ℓ, the wider the information set taken into account by the trading rule.

                     The function Λ reasonably depends on the riskless bond. Indeed, in a short-term perspective, investors must decide whenever to invest some shares of capital on the available risky assets or the entire capital on the riskless bond.

The aim of this section is to provide, via numerical analysis, financial insights on the long-run strategy and the short-term trading rule which are described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. For this purpose, we explore the relationship between optimal long-term portfolio and short-term wealth allocation performances in the considered market, which is characterized by the presence of rarely traded stocks.

This section includes an analysis of several aspects of the model. In particular, we explore the sensitiveness of the results on the basis of different levels of frequency of trading in thin stocks, λ, levels of risk aversion, γ, and degrees of correlation between risky assets, ρ. We do not carry out an analysis on the initial portfolio value, because the role of this value is rather negligible when comparing long- and short-run strategies at the end of the time horizon.

The general framework adopted in the numerical application can be synthesized as follows:
                           
                              •
                              Investors allocate their funds in a liquid and continuously traded risky asset with expected rate of return μ

                                 =0.1, in a light stock with expected rate of return μ

The intraday trading is not allowed, so that in a business day it is assumed each stock is traded only at the opening of the market.

The coefficient of risk aversion, γ, is alternatively set to 0.5 and 1.5.

The frequency of jumps in thin stock price depends on the Poisson law parameter λ, which is alternatively set to 15 and 60.

The correlation coefficient between the ordinary 1-dimensional Brownian motions B and W, namely ρ, is set alternatively to −0.5, 0 and 0.5.

The first two steps of the numerical procedure provide the simulation of the dynamics for {S

In Fig. 1
                         an example of a path for the price of a thin stock is reported for the case λ
                        =15.

Then we search for the optimal vector χ

                        =1,⋯
                        M, we construct the time-dependent distribution of returns and compute the time-dependent mean and variance of the return of each portfolio, so that we can compute the optimal portfolio m

                        In Monte Carlo experiments, we set ℓ=2. The trading rule allows to determine a short-term portfolio with time-dependent uniperiodal return Π
                        
                           S
                        (t
                        
                           u+1
                        −
                        t
                        
                           u
                        ), which is selected and compared with the expected return of the long-run optimal wealth allocation strategy. The procedure is reported in the Appendix A.

As mentioned above, the main aim of the Monte Carlo experiments is to explore the relationship between long- and short-term trading strategies. In the Figures, the trajectories of the two returns related with the long- and short-term trading strategies for λ
                        =15 and λ
                        =60 are reported. In particular, Fig. 2
                         shows these paths by setting the values for risk aversion and correlation coefficient to γ
                        =0.5 and ρ
                        =−0.5, respectively.

It is interesting to notice that in both the analyzed cases, at the achievement of the time-horizon, the long-term strategy appears to be preferable to that of short-term. In particular, for λ
                        =15, the former, when compared to the latter, offers an excess return almost equal to 4%. This performance deteriorates slightly with increasing frequency of trading in the thin stock, λ
                        =60, and the excess returns reduces to 3%. This last result is confirmed by considering a portfolio containing only liquid assets, for which the short-term strategy dominates the long-term one (see Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that in the λ
                        =60 case the long-term strategy performs generally better than that of short-term. In the λ
                        =15 case, a certain alternation of dominance is observed at the beginning of the time period, but gradually a dominance of the long-term strategy starts around the middle of the period considered (see Fig. 2).

Moving away from the case of negatively correlated returns, ρ
                        =−0.5, and considering scenarios characterized by positive correlation between the returns of the risky assets, ρ
                        =0.5, in case of γ
                        =0.5 results are reversed and show an evident dominance of the short-term strategy, which concludes with a final return of the 7% against the negative final return of the long-term strategy equal to −9% (case λ
                        =15.) This finding is confirmed also in cases of λ
                        =60 (see Fig. 3)
                         and portfolios containing only liquid assets (see Fig. 5). In particular the excess return at the time-horizon becomes 8% in the case λ
                        =60.

As it is showed in Fig. 4
                        , these results are confirmed also in case of risk aversion parameter γ
                        =1.5. When λ
                        =15, the short-term strategy clearly outperforms the long-term one and the excess return is almost equal to 5%. It is weird the evidence collected in the case of larger frequency in the trading of the thin stock, λ
                        =60, where it is observed that the final value of the portfolio in both the cases is almost the same, even though – during the investment period – the short-term strategy provides on average better results than the long-term one. This tendency is confirmed in the case of portfolios containing only liquid assets, where the long-term strategy clearly outperforms the short-term one (see Fig. 5
                        ).

The case of uncorrelated risky assets ρ
                        =0 offers a view on the relationship between long- and short-term strategies which confirms the outcome of the analysis in the case of positively correlated assets.

To conclude, we remark that the long-term strategy outperforms the short-term one only in case of negatively correlated returns between risky assets. In all the other cases, we collect evidences in favor of the short-term strategy. An explanation of this finding is required: the riskier the market position, the better taking financial decisions on the basis of short horizons (see Figs. 3 and 4). Given the parameters assumed in the numerical application, results of portfolio selection are in line with the diversification principle introduced in portfolio theory by Markowitz also when thin stocks are considered.

Furthermore, we note that the optimal choice between short-term strategy and long-term one strongly depends on the presence of thin stocks in the portfolio.

In this appendix we provide details and pseudo-codes of the numerical procedure described in Section 5.

                     t
                     
                        T
                     }. In particular, we consider ⌈ τ
                     
                        s
                     (k)⌉/T where
