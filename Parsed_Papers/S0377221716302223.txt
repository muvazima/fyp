                  We provide a new portfolio decomposition formula that sheds light on the economics of portfolio choice for investors following the mean-variance (MV) criterion. We show that the number of components of a dynamic portfolio strategy can be reduced to two: the first is preference free and hedges the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon while the second hedges the time variation in pseudo relative risk tolerance. Both components entail strong horizon effects in the dynamic asset allocation as a result of time-varying risk tolerance and investment opportunity sets. We also provide closed-form solutions for the optimal portfolio strategy in the presence of market return predictability. The model parameters are estimated over the period 1963 to 2012 for the U.S. market. We show that (i) intertemporal hedging can be very large, (ii) the MV criterion hugely understates the true extent of risk aversion for high values of the risk aversion parameter, and the more so the shorter the investment horizon, and (iii) the efficient frontiers seem problematic for investment horizons shorter than one year but satisfactory for large horizons. Overall, adopting the MV model leads to acceptable results for medium and long term investors endowed with medium or high risk tolerance, but to very problematic ones otherwise.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The mean-variance (hereafter MV) criterion is by far the most widely used in the asset allocation industry. It is also present in several strands of the finance literature, not to mention textbooks. Apart from the Gaussian case, where it is rigorously derived for a von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility maximizer, its theoretical foundation, which goes back to Markowitz’s 
                     (1952, 1959) pioneering work, lies in the classic Arrow–Pratt approximation of certainty equivalent wealth for such an investor. Recent extensions in a static framework include Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Ruffino (2013) who introduce ambiguity in the standard portfolio analysis. Markowitz (2014) himself offers a recent and rather comprehensive review of the relative merits of the criterion. Cochrane (2014) provides explanations as to why the Markowitz’s one-period MV framework is and should be widely adopted in practice as a useful characterization of an optimal portfolio. In particular, he argues that, although the variance of the portfolio return is admittedly not an ideal risk measure, the MV formulation still is the cornerstone of real-world portfolio and risk management

                        1
                        It is also widely used in many other fields, see Aouam, Rardin, and Abrache (2010) and Aouam, Muthuraman, and Rardin (2016).
                      as it provides a simple conceptual benchmark.

The extension of Markowitz’s 
                     (1952) static setting to a much more difficult dynamic version has also been the object of extensive research. The desirability of a discrete multiperiod or continuous time modeling stems from both the theoretical economic relevance, emphasized by Merton (1971), of intertemporal hedging demands and convincing empirical evidence that the latter are a significant part of long-term investors’ total demand for risky assets.

                        2
                        See, among others, Brennan and Xia (2002).
                      Following the early start of Bajeux-Besnainou and Portait (1998), various solutions to the dynamic MV problem have been provided. For instance, Björk, Murgoci, and Zhou (2014) recently proposed a generalization of the time-consistent solution of Basak and Chabakauri (2010) which allows the parameter γ that controls the tradeoff between the expected value of wealth and its variance in the MV framework to be state dependent rather than constant. Qin (2015) solved the portfolio problem in a more general setting where asset returns are either random or uncertain variables. Yao, Li, and Li (2016) proposed a solution in discrete rather than continuous time.

In spite of these advances, two issues still require investigation in a dynamic setting. The first is, in actual implementation of the portfolio strategy, the accuracy, and maybe even the relevance, of the MV approximation. Let the investor’s preferences be expressed as 
                        
                           E
                           
                              [
                              x
                              ]
                           
                           −
                           
                              γ
                              2
                           
                           
                              σ
                              2
                           
                           
                              [
                              x
                              ]
                           
                           ,
                        
                      where x denotes wealth, E expectation, σ
                     2 variance and γ a positive parameter. In virtually all the literature, γ is treated as a constant and, by a misleading abuse of language, called the risk aversion parameter. In fact, the role of commonly defined risk aversion in the MV portfolio strategy cannot be shown explicitly [Bajeux-Besnainou and Portait (1998) and Nielsen and Vassalou (2006)]. Assuming a constant γ parameter constitutes in itself a paradigm that is virtually impossible to gauge within the usual utility framework since a simple index of risk aversion does not exist for the MV criterion.

The second issue concerns the portfolio decomposition formula and its economic interpretation. In Merton (1971), the optimal strategy is broken down into a speculative mean-variance component and as many intertemporal hedges as there are state variables affecting the investment opportunity set. Since then, numerous efforts have been devoted to identifying settings that allow more tractable exact or approximate solutions. Using the martingale approach of Cox and Huang (1989), Lioui and Poncet (2001), Wachter 
                     (2002, 2003), Detemple, Garcia, and Rindisbacher (2003), and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) proposed an alternative breakdown of the portfolio strategy for monotonic utility functions, particularly the power utility function. Under stochastic interest rates, the strategy is shown to contain three components only, irrespective of the number of state variables: a speculative mean-variance component, a hedge against the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon, and a hedge against changes in the market prices of risk.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        This last component can be related to a particular martingale measure. See Lioui and Poncet (2001) and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) for details.
                      These results, however, do not apply to the MV criterion because it does not belong to the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) class.

The first objective of this paper is to propose a new decomposition formula for the MV criterion. We first develop an original formula for an investor endowed with quadratic utility (QU hereafter) and infer a similar decomposition for the MV criterion by analogy.
                        4
                     
                     
                        4
                        The literature sometimes uses interchangeably “quadratic utility” and “mean-variance preferences”. We adopt the first phrasing exclusively to avoid confusion with Markowitz’s ([1952,1959]) “mean-variance criterion”. In a dynamic setting, the optimal portfolio strategies for these two utility representations (QU and MV) can be very different, as will be shown in Sections 2 and 3.
                      The QU function, with a proper restriction on the relevant domain, belongs to the rather large HARA class and the results derived from it can be directly compared to those obtained with CRRA preferences. This is important as power utility is by far the standard assumption in this strand of literature.
                        5
                     
                     
                        5
                        Power utility or its extension by Epstein and Zin (1989) is the workhorse of the dynamic asset allocation literature. See Detemple (2014) for a lucid literature review.
                      While numerous recent contributions have completed our understanding of the CRRA case, we still have some way to fully comprehend the practically important dynamic MV criterion and its economic underpinnings. The adoption of QU as a benchmark to investigate the MV criterion is a natural choice since only the first two moments of the investor’s wealth distribution enter the utility function.

We show that both QU and MV dynamic strategies can be decomposed in two elements only. One is a preference-free term that hedges the risk (volatility) of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The other hedges the random time variation in the investor’s relative risk tolerance. Thus, both display horizon effects while, under CRRA, only the intertemporal hedging element exhibits such an effect. Our new decomposition highlights in particular the crucial role of the investor’s relative risk tolerance. The formal difference between QU and MV, which can be decisive in practical allocations (analyzed in Section 3), lies unsurprisingly in the definition of relative risk tolerance. For QU, our definition directly derives from the quadratic preferences 
                        
                           x
                           −
                           
                              γ
                              2
                           
                           
                              x
                              2
                           
                        
                     . For MV, we must define a relative pseudo risk tolerance that involves additionally the investor’s unconditional expectation of optimal terminal wealth.

The second, related objective of the paper is to provide an empirical assessment of the quality of the MV approximation to QU, and shed light on the practical importance of horizon effects. This in itself bridges a gap in the literature. We adopt in the empirical section an incomplete market setting that leads to explicit solutions to the optimal dynamic strategies for QU and MV criterion. A riskless asset and the market portfolio are available for trade. The excess return on the market is an affine function of a predictor, the dividend yield, which follows an Ornstein–Ulhenbeck process. Portfolio strategies are shown to be non-linear in the predictor, in contrast with Kim and Omberg’s 
                     (1996) well known finding that the CRRA investor’s strategy is linear.

Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Horizon effects are always sizeable and may be huge, as intertemporal hedging is very large, many times more than reported in the literature under CRRA.

                        6
                        See for instance Xia (2001) or Detemple (2014).
                      The horizon-dependence of the relative risk tolerance is the key driver of these effects. (ii) The optimal MV strategy is always tilted, as compared to QU, toward a more risky position. The MV criterion can hugely understate the true extent of risk aversion. The tilt is much more pronounced for short investment horizons and for low levels of risk tolerance. (iii) Positions in the risky asset and certainty equivalent return rates strikingly differ for the MV and QU strategies for short investment horizons and low risk tolerance. They converge, however, as the horizon enlarges and risk tolerance increases. (iv) The efficient frontiers for both preference specifications have the same slopes for all investment horizons, but their ranges differ markedly for horizons up to 12 months. As the horizon enlarges, however, they also tend to converge to one another. In brief, the MV approximation yields misleading results for investment horizons smaller than 1 year and low risk tolerance levels, but is acceptable otherwise.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we derive, in a complete market framework, the optimal portfolio strategy of an investor endowed with QU and compare it to that of an investor obeying a MV criterion. Within a standard affine setting and an incomplete market, Section 3 provides an explicit portfolio solution for both utility specifications, then reports and analyzes the parameter estimates, the optimal strategies, the certainty equivalent return rates, and the efficient frontiers for the period spanning January 1926 to December 2012 in the US. The last section concludes. The main technical derivations are left to an Internet Appendix.

We first describe the economy in which trading takes place and then derive the new portfolio decomposition formulas for the QU and MV investors.

Investors can freely trade continuously in an arbitrage-free and frictionless financial market. Their investment horizon is denoted by T. Available for trade are N risky assets and a locally riskless asset. The excess returns on the risky assets are assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation

                         the N × N volatility matrix. Σt
                         is assumed to be uniformly invertible for all t and all states of the world.

The interest rate and risk premia are time-varying. In this section, we assume for simplicity that this time variation is brought about only by the N sources of risk present in the economy. Consequently, as N non redundant risky assets are available for trade, and Σt
                         is uniformly invertible, the financial market is complete [Björk (2009), pp. 199–200]. This assumption makes the derivation of the investor’s optimal decision easy (Cox & Huang, 1989) and comes with no loss of economic intuition as to our theoretical message.

                           As shown by He and Pearson (1991), in a general setting, the martingale approach is technically much simpler in a complete market than in an incomplete one. In addition, portfolio decomposition formulas are easier to obtain with the martingale approach than with the stochastic dynamic programming method. Since the simpler complete market setting is well suited to the issue we want to focus on at a theoretical level, we adopt it in this section. In the empirical part, however, we will adopt a more realistic, incomplete market setting.
                         The pricing kernel (or stochastic discount factor, or state price deflator) under the measure P, Λt, t ∈ [0, T], thus is unique [Björk (2009), p. 155] and obeys the dynamics

                         is the unconditional (as of time zero) expectation under the actual probability measure, γ is a strictly positive parameter (loosely) related to risk aversion and Λ the pricing kernel. The budget constraint is that the present value of terminal wealth cannot exceed initial wealth. It is assumed to be binding (which is reflected by the equal sign). Since the QU function is strictly concave, the solution to this program is guaranteed to exist and be unique. This restriction is required for the Cox and Huang (1989) method to be applicable.

                         is the initial price of a pure discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. Note that although this bond may not be traded, the investor can replicate (reach) it using the available stocks and the riskless asset since the market is complete.

The condition on the risk parameter γ implied by the first inequality in (11) is economically intuitive. The upper bound to be imposed on the QU agent’s wealth so that marginal utility increases is equal to 
                           
                              1
                              γ
                           
                        . For the investor’s problem (7) to be meaningful, this upper bound has to be larger than what he would obtain by investing all his wealth in the discount bond of maturity T. If not, he would simply invest the discounted value of 
                           
                              1
                              γ
                           
                         in the T-maturity bond and throw away the remaining wealth: the bliss point, or nirvana [in the phrasing of Kim and Omberg (1996)], would be attained. Obviously, such situations have to be ruled out. Now, from the second inequality in (11), it follows that the Lagrange multiplier λ given by (10) is strictly positive. Therefore, saying that λ is strictly positive and stating that the solution to program (7) lies on the increasing part of the QU function are equivalent propositions.

We thus will ensure, in the empirical application presented in Section 3, that the (exogenous) level of wealth and γ parameter respect condition (11). In particular, γ must not only depend on initial wealth but also on the investment horizon.

The time t value of the investor’s optimal wealth is such that

                        . The optimal strategy has three components. Using standard terminology, the first one is the so-called myopic, speculative, or mean-variance term. Unique to the present framework, however, and noteworthy, is the horizon effect embedded in this component through the presence of the T-maturity discount bond. The second component is an intertemporal hedging term that hedges random changes in the conditional expectation of the (squared) terminal pricing kernel which affect current optimal wealth. Squaring stems from the squared wealth that enters the utility function. The last component, which depends on the ratio of bliss wealth over actual optimal wealth, is also an intertemporal hedge against changes in the return of the T-maturity discount bond.

This decomposition inherits the same intuitive interpretation of an optimal portfolio strategy as that offered by Lioui and Poncet (2001), Wachter (2002, 2003), Detemple et al. (2003), and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010). Merton (1971) had shown previously that non-myopic investors trade risky assets for both speculative and intertemporal hedging purposes. The intertemporal hedges are preference-dependent and designed to account for unfavorable shifts in the investment opportunity set brought about by the state variables. These hedging terms are therefore as numerous as the assumed state variables. Although elegant and intuitive, Merton’s original paradigm is difficult to implement, as it provides no guidance as to what is the set of state variables relevant to investors. As a result, intensive follow-up research has suggested alternative decompositions for the optimal portfolio strategy. Lioui and Poncet (2001) and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010), for example, show that in an economy with an arbitrary number of state variables, and investors endowed with power utility, the optimal strategy has three components only. The first is the mean-variance component. The other two are intertemporal hedging terms, one to hedge against changes in a complex variable involving the stochastic market prices of risk, and the other against variations in the return on the discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The decomposition in Proposition 1 thus recovers three elements analogous (but not identical) to those obtained with power utility.

Our next step is to provide an even simpler decomposition that has an intuitive economic interpretation in terms of risk tolerance. To develop the intuition, we first rewrite Eq. (14) as

                         to an extent that depends on the investor’s expectation as to his adjusted risk tolerance at terminal date T. The larger is γ, the smaller is the bliss point, obviously. The lower is his risk tolerance, the smaller is the gap between nirvana and actual wealth because a lower fraction of wealth is invested in the risky asset for speculative purposes. In addition, if the current expectation of terminal wealth is higher, the gap is also reduced because the conditional expectation of adjusted risk tolerance is lower.

This proposition is one of the main results of this paper. As claimed, we are left with two terms only. The first is a pure hedge ratio associated with the T-maturity discount bond. It is preference-free, unlike the third term of Eq. (14), incorporates nonetheless an horizon effect, and is identical to the first term of Eq. (15). We thus uncover the result that the truly riskless asset from the investor’s standpoint is precisely the long term bond of duration T, regardless of his risk aversion. The second term is preference- and horizon-dependent and hedges the fluctuations in relative risk tolerance. It summarizes the influence of the unforecastable error on future risk tolerance, which itself embeds the speculative term and the intertemporal hedges against the fluctuations of the interest rate and the market prices of risk. Consequently, the investor’s relative position in the risky asset would not depart from the pure hedge ratio if his relative risk tolerance was constant or deterministic. This could happen only if all the wealth was invested in the T-maturity bond (nirvana). In other words, we have established that for the dynamic model to be consistent, relative risk tolerance must be a stochastic process.

When risk tolerance tends to zero, the optimal strategy boils down to a position in the T-maturity discount bond for both CRRA utility and QU, although not for the same reason. In the standard CRRA case, sticking to the riskless asset when risk aversion is very large reflects the (too) huge premium required implicitly to invest in risky assets. With QU, sticking to the riskless asset is due to the fact that all the benefits of previous risky investments have been reaped (the wealth upper bound is hit) so that the investor retracts from the stock market, while the CRRA investor did not even enter it. Consequently, the traditional decomposition under CRRA is not well suited to the QU investor in a dynamic framework.

Since both components of the optimal strategy (22) are horizon-dependent, it is extremely likely that horizon effects in the QU case are quite substantial, and to a greater extent than is routinely acknowledged in the literature. We will confirm this intuition in the empirical section.

                        where the symbol “^” differentiates this investor from the QU agent, and γ is a parameter that controls the tradeoff between the expected value of terminal wealth and its variance. To make comparisons fruitful, we keep it equal to the γ encountered in the previous case. Although this parameter reflects attitude towards risk, it cannot be interpreted in a dynamic setting as an absolute risk aversion coefficient, even though utility were exponential and wealth normally distributed. We follow Basak and Chabakauri (2010), whose approach allows for a solution in the general case of a stochastic opportunity set. In Internet Appendix A, we derive the following optimal strategy that generalizes Proposition 4 of Basak and Chabakauri (2010) to stochastic interest rates and market prices of risk.

                           Their Eq. (38) is a special case under precommitment. It has one term, which corresponds to our first term in Eq. (24). They also provide an analytical characterization of the optimal time-consistent strategy in a more general, incomplete market setting (Proposition 2, Eq. (26)). The r.h.s. of Eq. (26) has three terms, as here.

                           A recent paper by Dang and Forsyth (2016) proposes an approach that leads to better efficient frontiers than those implied by precommitment strategies. Their strategies are semi-self-financing only in that cash withdrawals from the optimal portfolio are allowed.
                         This is not the case for standard utility functions for which the time-consistent and precommitment policies coincide.

                               Therefore, their speculative term is proportional to the (discounted) inverse of the γ parameter, while ours is proportional to that inverse augmented by the gap between the (discounted) initial expectation of terminal wealth and current wealth.
                        
                     

The MV objective function can be rewritten as the quadratic objective function augmented by the squared expectation of wealth (times γ/2), i.e.

The l.h.s. of both equations represents the optimal weight invested in the risky assets net of the wealth-independent, hedging weight. Hence the r.h.s. of the equations represents the risky component of the strategy that depends on the investor’s time-varying wealth and risk aversion. In the QU case, this net weight is proportional to the relative gap between nirvana and current wealth. For the MV investor, for whom there is no actual nirvana, it is proportional to the relative gap between the hypothetical quadratic nirvana and current wealth augmented by the relative discounted initial expectation of optimal terminal wealth. It is as if the MV investor kept an eye on two targets, the hypothetical bliss point and the optimal wealth she had expected initially. The further away her current wealth is from these targets, the higher becomes her risk tolerance (see below), which induces her to invest relatively more in the risky assets.

                         is narrow, i.e. when γ is large, theory thus predicts that the ratio will also tend to be large. Findings discussed in the empirical section vindicate this result.

The difference in the optimal strategies (15) for QU and (24) for MV is narrowly linked to the investor’s attitude towards risk. The challenge here is to define the risk aversion of a MV “precommitted” investor solving (23).

                           See Wagener (2003) for an elaboration on this crucial point.
                         The same remark holds for the time-consistent solution developed by Basak and Chabakauri (2010). Risk aversion or tolerance cannot be defined in the usual way under the MV criterion in a dynamic setting since the objective function in (23) does not write as the expectation of some utility of terminal wealth. Still, as shown in Internet Appendix A, we can obtain a second portfolio decomposition similar to that of Proposition 2 for QU by defining a relative pseudo risk tolerance.

                         Equipped with this definition, we can interpret the MV optimal portfolio policy in essentially the same way as the QU one, which provides one justification of our investigation of the latter. The measure of MV pseudo risk tolerance is the QU risk tolerance tilted by the ratio αt
                        . Accordingly, and since α
                        0 > 1, at inception of the strategy the MV investor’s risk tolerance is higher than that of the QU individual and the proportion of risky asset held in the optimal portfolio is larger. As discussed above, however, for long investment horizons, αt
                         may become smaller than one if the two optimal wealths diverge, which again makes room for the empirical evidence to decide.

Unlike what is found for CRRA utility, we have shown that the dynamic strategy for the QU and the MV investor can be decomposed in two elements only. The first is preference-free and hedges the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The second hedges the random time variation in the investor’s relative risk tolerance or relative pseudo risk tolerance. Both components are horizon-dependent. The difference between the QU and MV cases lies, not surprisingly, in the definition of relative risk tolerance. Now, even though we suspect that the MV individual will substantially invest in the risky asset, both in absolute and in relative (to the QU case) terms, it remains to assess how this translates in terms of welfare, i.e. in certainty equivalent return rates. Our empirical analysis will also shed light on this issue.

This section is devoted to assessing the practical implication of our theoretical findings regarding the differences in portfolio compositions, optimal wealths and optimal certainty equivalent return rates between the MV and QU investors, for various degrees of risk aversion and investment horizons. Without loss of intuitive content, we subsume the set of risky assets to the (unique) equity market portfolio. To alleviate the mathematical burden and the empirical estimation, we assume constant riskfree interest rate and market return volatility.

However, we do not assume that the financial market is complete, as the equity premium is driven by a predictor imperfectly correlated with the market return. Since the market is incomplete, and the pricing kernel consequently not unique, we have to derive the price of risk associated with the predictor as part of the solution to the optimization problem. To choose the equivalent martingale measure and the corresponding pricing kernel, we have applied the He and Pearson (1991) fictitious completion argument. The idea is to start by picking up an arbitrary equivalent martingale measure, solve for the portfolio decision using Cox and Huang (1989) as in the previous section, and then select the unique particular measure (the so-called minimax martingale measure) that makes optimal wealth not load on the risks that are not spanned by existing assets and thus are unhedgeable. We provide the solutions for both utility specifications, then present the data and the adopted estimation procedure, and finally discuss our empirical results.

We assume, as for instance Kim and Omberg (1996), Wachter (2002) and Brennan and Xia (2010), that the equity market risk premium varies linearly in some predictor(s). Although our framework could accommodate any number of such predictors, to keep the model tractable we consider a univariate predictive regression. Our predictor is denoted by xt

The empirical analysis uses US monthly data for the period 1963:M7 to 2012:M12 (594 observations). Data relative to the returns on the market portfolio have been downloaded from Kenneth French’s website. The stock market return is computed as the value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks obtained from the CRSP data files. The riskless rate is the one-month Treasury bill rate downloaded from the CRSP “Fama Risk Free Rates” data file.

We have adopted as the predictor the dividend yield that is routinely used in the literature. The dividend yield is measured as total dividends paid off during the last 12 months divided by the actual value of the value-weighted market portfolio. We selected this measure as monthly or quarterly dividend yields cannot be used because seasonality is predominant. We constructed the dividend yield series from the two series of stock market returns with and without dividends available from CRSP.

Panel A of Table 1
                         reports various statistics for the one-month T-bill rate, the excess return on the market portfolio and the dividend yield. All data are monthly, and all rates and returns are non-annualized. For instance, the average risk premium is 0.0035 for the equity market (0.043 per year). We note that the standard deviation of the interest rate is smaller (0.0034) than that of the equity premium (0.0455) by a factor thirteen. Therefore, we will assume for simplicity that the riskfree rate is constant. The large first-order auto-regression coefficient for the predictive variable (0.9898) reflects a high level of persistence. In contrast, the analogous coefficient for the stock market is very small (0.0952). Both are comparable to the ones found in the literature.

Our estimation procedure being standard, we leave it to Internet Appendix C.

Note that, unlike Palczewski and Palczewski (2014), we do not tackle the problem of errors arising from the estimation of the covariance matrix and mean vector of asset returns.
                         Data being discrete, we integrate the continuous time dynamics equation (31) for the predictor and Eq. (30) for the market excess return over the discrete time interval [

Results regarding the stock excess return predicted by the dividend yield are close to those reported in the literature. In particular, ρ the correlation between the innovations in the market excess return and those in the dividend yield is found to be 
                           
                              −
                              0.906
                           
                        . Also, μ
                        1 is positive as expected from both the theory and what is found in the empirical literature: a higher dividend yield entails a larger expected excess return as the market is underpriced.

The time series for the dividend yield, the estimated market expected risk premium and the market realized risk premium appear in Fig. 1
                        . Fig. 1a shows that the dividend yield is somewhat volatile but always contained in the interval [1.06 percent; 5.82 percent] on a yearly basis. The expected market risk premium as predicted by the model (Fig. 1b) is confined to the very small interval [

                         percent] when expressed on a monthly basis (with an average of 0.35 percent). This is in sharp contrast with the realized risk premium (Fig. 1c) which, with the same average of 0.35 percent, strongly fluctuates between

                         percent (typically between ± 10 percent) on the same monthly basis. More generally, Table 2
                         shows that, except for the sample mean, all the other statistics are very different for the expected and the realized risk premium. This implies that the predictability power of the dividend yield is weak at a short return horizon, in accordance with much of the literature on asset return predictability.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Equipped with our estimated parameters, we can implement the investor’s portfolio strategy. We compute, for both QU and MV criterion, and for different investment horizons and parameters reflecting risk aversion, the optimal portfolio composition, the annualized certainty equivalent rate of return (ce) and the efficient frontier sets. The riskfree rate is assumed to be constant at 3 percent.

It must be emphasized that all portfolio strategies are left unconstrained in the sense that there are no short selling restrictions imposed on either asset. Allowing the investor to sell short the market portfolio should hardly be a problem: since the mean-variance component of the portfolio is positive due to a positive risk premium, the optimal weight invested in the risky asset is almost surely positive. Possibly more problematic, however, is that no cap is imposed on short selling the riskless rate (i.e. borrowing) to leverage the market portfolio. This could give rise to situations where the weight invested in the risky asset is unrealistically too large.

                           We thank a referee for this remark. Imposing no-shorting restrictions, however, would require the use of heavy numerical solution schemes which are beyond the scope of this work. See for example the recent paper by Cui, Gao, Li, and Li (2014) for a solution in the MV case.
                         There is also the interesting case, investigated by Fu, Lari-Lavassani, and Li (2010), where the market is made incomplete by assuming that the borrowing rate is larger than the lending rate. This absence of an upper bound on leverage and of frictions in the money market must be kept in mind when interpreting the results and comparing them to those in the literature.

The investment horizon T spans 1–60 months, the time step being a month. Beyond 5 years, some results explode in the case of MV and cannot be realistically interpreted. For readability, we report also Figures where three values only for T appear: 1 (Short), 30 (Medium) and 60 (Long) months.

The value of γ must be made dependent on the investor’s horizon in the QU case since the wealth upper bound is 
                           
                              1
                              γ
                           
                        . If in effect 
                           
                              1
                              γ
                           
                         were kept constant when the investment horizon is varied, 
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 γ
                              
                              P
                              
                                 (
                                 t
                                 ,
                                 T
                                 )
                              
                           
                         would decrease with T, and the certainty equivalent rate ce of the optimal strategy would negatively depend on T. The lower bound for ce would be equal to the riskless rate r in the special case (adopted here) where the latter is constant. In this section, when we change the horizon T for comparing various generations of investors, we will adjust the value of γ such that the inequality (11) holds. In addition, keeping γ horizon-independent would entail mechanical portfolio effects that interfere with intertemporal hedging effects. Consequently, comparing results across investment horizons will require some caution.

We chose to express the upper bound as an annual return rate, letting it vary from 0.05 to 1 (by step of 0.01). This means that, for a given investment horizon T, the upper bound 
                           
                              1
                              γ
                           
                         varies from e
                        0.05T
                         to eT
                         (i.e. risk aversion decreases, and risk tolerance increases, from left to right). Therefore, the higher is the return rate, the smaller is the risk aversion reflected by γ. Again, for readability we report also Figures with three values only for the upper bound: 0.05 (Low), 0.5 (Medium) and 1 (High).

We discuss first the portfolio’s composition from two different angles. First, we consider the term in squared brackets present in the proportion of wealth allocated to the risky asset that is common to the QU and MV investors (see Eqs. (32) and (33)), i.e. that is independent from wealth and risk aversion. This gives us a clue as to the order of magnitude the proportion of the risky part of the portfolio attains for different investment horizons. As illustrated in Fig. 2
                           , this proportion increases smoothly from 200 percent to 560 percent as the investment horizon enlarges from one to 60 months. This is linked to the well documented fact that the predictive power of dividends increases with the return period, which makes the equity market relatively more attractive as the investment horizon is further away. For instance, Xia (2001) also found that, under CRRA, the optimal weight of the risky asset increases most likely with T for the values of the parameters of the expected return process she adopted.
                              20
                           
                           
                              20
                              The reference to Xia (2001) is merely indicative as she provides the actual weight of risky assets in the portfolio while, here, we consider only the part of this weight that is common to QU and MV preferences and thus does not depend on the degree of risk tolerance.
                            Considering that no constraints are imposed on portfolios, and that risk aversion is not accounted for, the proportion we find compares favorably to results present in the literature, where the proportion of risky assets often explodes.

In addition, there is an interestingly large difference between the CRRA utility on the one hand and QU and the MV criterion on the other regarding intertemporal hedging. The latter is reflected in the terms that depend on 
                              
                                 (
                                 T
                                 −
                                 t
                                 )
                              
                            inside the term in squared brackets in Eqs. (32) and (33). Since the first, mean-variance term does not depend on the horizon, only hedging motives explain why the proportion of risky assets increases dramatically with T. Comparison with Xia’s (2001) 
                           Table 2 indicates that this is much less the case with CRRA utility for which intertemporal hedging looks marginal.

Second, we compute the ratio

                            from Eqs. (32) and (33) to compare the MV and QU portfolio compositions. Fig. 3
                           a and b plot the ratio across the horizon T for different values of the upper bound (1/γ). Fig. 3c and d plot

                            across the upper bound (1/γ) for different horizons T.

The conclusions we draw from this and Fig. 3 are as follows: (i) although in theory the ratio could be smaller than one, it is in fact always very significantly larger than one, implying that the MV assumption leads to often extreme leverage, (ii) for low and medium risk aversion levels (High and Medium wealth upper bounds), the ratio is U-shaped in T and already substantial (from 1.70 to 26.26), and (iii) for very high risk aversion (Low wealth upper bound), the ratio exhibits a very skewed U shape, as it skyrockets at short horizons (606 at one month), and remains very high at longer horizons although it decreases exponentially towards a minimum of roughly 30 (for 
                              
                                 T

                            40 months) then increases (toward roughly 48).

The upshot, therefore, is that the MV approximation in a dynamic setting is very problematic and leads to exploding positions in the risky asset (to a larger extent than was recognized so far) when risk aversion is high, and the more so for shorter term investors. The MV criterion often understates grossly the true extent of risk aversion for high values of the γ parameter; and although that phenomenon is particularly spectacular for short investment horizons, it remains true for medium and long horizons. The relationship, however, is not monotonic, and for horizons around 30 months, the ratio exhibits reasonable values.

                            is rather large for short investment horizons, then drops substantially and exhibits a rather flat U shape. When risk aversion is high (Low wealth upper bound), the ratio is much larger and sharply increases with the investment horizon, indicating an unrealistically strong bias of the MV criterion toward risky assets. While the highly risk averse QU individual keeps away from dangerous investments, this is much less the case of the MV investor. It is worth noting, additionally, that the value of the ratio does not exceed (the admittedly already high value of) 6.05, while the ratio

                            skyrocketed to 606 for the same parameters. The reason is that, if accumulating an enormous proportion of risky assets greatly increases the expected return on the portfolio, it also inflates its standard deviation dramatically, so that the certainty equivalent rate is kept in much narrower bounds.

                            across the wealth upper bound for different investment horizons. For short horizons, the ratio decreases smoothly and slowly with the upper bound and remains high (just above 2.5; see also the panel above) for low risk aversion levels. For medium and long horizons, the pattern is rather different, although also monotonic: the ratio starts from a much larger value (3.9 or 6.0) but decreases very fast towards 1.3 with the upper bound, i.e. with risk tolerance. As risk tolerance increases, the gap between the weights invested in the risky asset by the MV investor and the QU individual is reduced, which translates into a sharp decrease in the ratio of certainty equivalent rates. Therefore, for horizons other than short ones (approximately up to about 6 months) and risk tolerance levels other than low ones, the certainty equivalent rates for both types of utility are comparable and converge quickly as the horizon and the wealth upper bound increase. In the other cases, however, in particular for low risk tolerance and short investment horizons, the discrepancy between those rates can be extremely large and the MV framework looks inappropriate.

Considering the QU and MV representations separately leads to the following results. In both cases, as illustrated by Figs. 5 and 6, the certainty equivalent rates exhibit increasing patterns with the investment horizon for a given risk aversion (graphs 5a and b for QU, 6a and b for MV), and with the upper bound for a given horizon (graphs 5c and d for QU, 6c and d for MV). The certainty equivalent rate values, however, differ. Not only is

A final, interesting way to look at the validity of the MV criterion as an approximation to QU is to compute, for a given aversion parameter γ and a given investment horizon T, the QU investor’s welfare and certainty equivalent return rate using the optimal MV wealth

In Fig. 7a (b), ce
                           sub is graphed as a function of T for all (three) levels of the upper bound. In Fig. 7c (d), it is expressed as a function of the upper bound for all (three) investment horizons. Comparing with Fig. 5, one sees that (i) the upper bound is systematically violated, reflecting the suboptimal nature of the MV strategy for the QU investor and, most importantly, (ii) this violation attenuates with the investment horizon and risk tolerance. For example, for 
                              
                                 T

                            months, the suboptimal certainty equivalent is 36.93 percent when the upper bound is 5 percent: the upper bound thus is violated by a factor 7 (0.3693/0.05). When the upper bound is 100 percent, the certainty equivalent is 128.59 percent, implying a violation of “only” 28 percent.

As is well-known, when both a riskless and a risky asset are tradable, the static efficient frontier (thereafter EF) is a straight line in the mean-standard deviation plane, the slope of which is the Sharpe ratio. In Internet Appendix B, we show that: (i) this is also the case in our dynamic framework, and (ii) the slopes of the initial dynamic EF frontier in the QU case (Eq. (A.27)) and in the MV model (Eq. (A.45)) are identical, although the respective domains for the means and standard deviations differ. These findings stem from the fact that a three-fund separation result obtains also in our dynamic setting. Inspection of the optimal strategies (26) and (27) for the risky part of the portfolio indeed reveals that they involve two assets only: the synthetic discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon and a portfolio possessing a complicated volatility structure. This portfolio can easily be identified as an asset whose terminal payoff is the pricing kernel ΛT
                            when one considers the optimal wealth given by Eqs. (8) in the text and (A.2) in Internet Appendix A. This asset is the growth optimal portfolio [Long (1990)] which is also the numéraire that makes asset prices martingales under the true probability measure.

                              A similar result for the MV case has been derived by Bajeux-Besnainou and Portait (1998) assuming that a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon is traded. Here, this bond can be replicated using actually traded assets.

                           0) is an exponential function that does not depend on the investor’s risk aversion parameter. Therefore, provided initial wealth W
                           0 is normalized to one, the Sharpe ratio is also the slope of the dynamic EF. As a preliminary evidence, we report the Sharpe ratio as a function of the investment horizon T in Fig. 8
                           . It increases monotonically from 0.1 to 1.9, for T varying from 1 to 60 months.

                              Recall that the Sharpe ratio is not time homogeneous, as the numerator (excess mean return) is roughly proportional to time and the denominator (volatility) roughly proportional to the square root of time. Therefore, it increases mechanically with the investment horizon.
                            The dependence is not linear, however, as in particular G(.) is the exponential of non-linear functions of T. The advantage of this formulation is that it does not require any annualization.

More to the point, we now analyze the EFs obtained in the usual plane by varying the γ parameter for a given T. This requires the annualization of both the mean and variance of the return on optimal wealth. For the mean, this is easy as we can use the standard annualized log return. For the variance, this is more problematic. Recall that when returns are predictable, as here, the variance is not strictly proportional to T due to the additional variance brought about by the time variation in the drift of the market excess return process. Since predictability is weak, however, we assume as a reasonable first approximation that the variance of the wealth return is proportional to T and, therefore, conveniently divide the obtained standard deviation by

                            and 60 months. The QU and MV frontiers are plotted on the same graph to better visualize the discrepancy between the two. Because of the approximation in the annualization, our FEs are not exact straight lines but are nevertheless (satisfactorily) very close.

The striking difference between QU and MV lies at short investment horizons. For example, for 
                              
                                 T

                            months, both EFs have a very limited range. However, MV is characterized by much larger expected returns and volatilities: for 
                              
                                 T

                                 1
                              
                            month, the EF starts at the (31 percent; 13.4 percent) coordinate and stops at (33.43 percent; 14.25 percent) while for QU it starts at (0 percent; 3 percent), i.e. the riskless asset, and stops at (2.69 percent; 3.87 percent). For 
                              
                                 T
                                 =
                                 3
                              
                            months, the EF starts at the (30.94 percent; 13.83 percent) coordinate and stops at (38.48 percent; 16.68 percent) while for QU it starts at (0 percent; 3 percent) and stops at (8.7 percent; 5.91 percent). More generally, Fig. 9 shows that, up to 
                              
                                 T
                                 =
                                 12
                              
                            months, the two EFs have the same slope but are disjoint. Therefore, for the same γ parameter, the implicit level of risk aversion is completely different for the two types of utility.

As the investment horizon gets larger, however, the two EFs have longer ranges, and overlap more, although the MV frontier always starts higher than the QU frontier and to its right. The punchline of our results thus is that the MV approximation is not acceptable for horizons less than or equal to twelve months, but tends to be satisfactory for longer horizons.

The optimal portfolio and its certainty equivalent return rate are unique for given investment horizon and risk aversion parameter. This is because all the needed parameters are estimated, once and for all, over the whole sample period (1963:M7 to 2012:M12). As the forecasting ability of predictors is known to depend on the data sample, we check our results by conducting a sub-sample analysis. We estimate the parameters over a first sub-period of a given, fixed length starting at the beginning of the whole sample and then re-estimate them recursively for the next sub-period, until the final date of the whole sample is reached.

Our detailed procedure is as follows. We estimate the parameters over a moving period of 30 years (360 months), with the time step set at one month. This choice is partly dictated by the need to have a period long enough to accommodate the longest investment horizon (
                              
                                 T
                                 =
                                 60
                              
                            months). The first period then spans 1963:M7 to 1993:M6. This leads to our first set of parameter estimates and, ultimately, to our first optimal portfolio. Then we redo the whole exercise with data from 1963:M8 to 1993:M7, to get our second optimal portfolio, and so on until the final sub-period 1983:M1 to 2012:M12. Consequently, we have 235 “rolling” (sub-sample) portfolios. Then, for each utility specification, each risk aversion parameter and each investment horizon, we compute the mean of the relevant variate (e.g. the certainty equivalent rate, or the optimal portfolio weight) over these 235 portfolios.

                            They strongly vindicate our previous results. The average (across sub-samples) proportion of wealth allocated to the risky asset that is common to the QU and MV investors, plotted across investment horizons, is almost identical to the proportion displayed on Fig. 2.

                            exhibited in Fig. 4. QU and MV ce rates are virtually identical to the ones we found for the whole sample. As to the EFs obtained for QU and MV, they are also virtually identical to those displayed in Fig. 9. To summarize, our findings are robust to the period under analysis.

The new portfolio decomposition formula we provide sheds new light on the economics of dynamic portfolio allocation for an investor endowed with quadratic utility or following the mean-variance criterion. We show that the dynamic portfolio strategy contains a component that hedges the risk associated with a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon and a component that hedges the time variation in relative risk tolerance. Both components entail strong horizon effects in the optimal portfolio composition. The proportion of wealth devoted to the risky asset is in general much larger for the MV investor than for the QU individual with the same γ parameter, as the time-varying, implicit, relative pseudo risk tolerance (for MV) and relative risk tolerance (for QU) differ markedly from one another.

We also provide closed-form, although not analytical, solutions for the optimal portfolio strategy in the presence of market return predictability in an affine setting where the financial market is incomplete. The model parameters are estimated over the period 1963 to 2012 for the U.S. market. Our overall conclusion is that, if the MV criterion is thought of as an approximation of (true) QU, adopting it will lead to acceptable results for medium and long term investors endowed with medium or high risk tolerance, in spite of its time-inconsistency property, but to very questionable ones otherwise. This mitigates Markowitz’s (2014) renewed arguments in favor of adopting the MV criterion as a general rule. Therefore, if one insists in adopting MV dynamic modeling, we recommend to select high levels of risk tolerance, which should additionally be horizon-dependent, the horizon being larger than one year.

Our portfolio decomposition can be applied to the analysis of market equilibrium. Merton’s (1971) decomposition is abstract and suggests that all innovations in the state variables driving the economy are priced. Ours leads to a three-funds separation result, irrespective of the number of state variables. The first fund is the riskless asset, the second the bond portfolio and the last a portfolio related to the aggregate level of risk tolerance. In addition to the novel economic interpretation, our decomposition sheds light on the important role of investment horizons. It thus contributes to the literature that extended the CAPM to account for horizon risk. For example, Kamara, Korajczyk, Lou, and Sadka (2015) explore the term structure of factor horizon premia and show that there exist factors whose risk measured over one particular horizon explains the cross-sectional differences in expected returns while their risk measured over alternative horizons does not.

The interpretation we propose may be helpful for understanding pure quadratic hedging (see Lim, 2004) and a natural generalization of our work would consider stochastic dominance based asset allocation (see Sharma & Mehra, 2016). A challenging but relevant extension of our work would be to determine how Knightian uncertainty affects our findings. Ruffino (2014) shows that, while aversion towards ambiguity, or preference for robustness, does affect optimal portfolio decisions and market equilibrium, a two-fund separation property still obtains. We therefore expect we would recover our three-funds separation. A natural question is whether accounting for ambiguity aversion exacerbates the extreme behavior of the MV investor relative to the QU individual. In view of our overall conclusion, we conjecture that it does at least for short-term investors endowed with low risk tolerance, since in some way ambiguity aversion adds up with risk aversion.
