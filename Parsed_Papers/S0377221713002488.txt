                  In this paper we develop a supply contract for a two-echelon manufacturer–retailer supply chain with a bidirectional option, which may be exercised as either a call option or a put option. Under the bidirectional option contract, we derive closed-form expressions for the retailer’s optimal order strategies, including the initial order strategy and the option purchasing strategy, with a general demand distribution. We also analytically examine the feedback effects of the bidirectional option on the retailer’s initial order strategy. In addition, taking a chain-wide perspective, we explore how the bidirectional option contract should be set to attain supply chain coordination.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The present business environment is full of uncertainties. To compete effectively in such an environment, firms need to develop the capability of responding flexibly to changing market conditions. This is particularly true for firms dealing with perishable products with comparatively long production lead-times and short selling seasons, and subject to high demand uncertainty. In order to hedge against the loss associated with over- and under-ordering, retailers usually have to order less but more frequently from their upstream firms such as manufacturers so that they can well accommodate demand volatility. Such an order policy, however, exerts great pressure on the manufacturers because it requires them to have flexible capacity to cater for the irregular orders, which results in an increase in the manufacturers’ costs. As a result, conflicts arise between the channel partners, which inevitably impair channel efficiency.

To address the issue of channel inefficiency, a typical approach is to design incentive contracts that provide the retailer with flexibility to respond to unanticipated demand without burdening the manufacturer. Among all such contract types, the option contract has attracted extensive attention and has been demonstrated to be effective in resolving the channel conflicts described above (Barnes-Schuster et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2010; Wang and Liu, 2007). Usually the option contract can be either the call option contract or the put option contract, which is characterized by two parameters, namely the option price and the exercise price. For the call option contract, the option price is an allowance paid by the retailer to the manufacturer for reserving one unit of the production capacity. The exercise price is the payment by the retailer to the manufacturer for exercising one unit of the call option. Hence, with the call option contract, the option buyer has the right to buy a certain quantity of the product at a specified price (the exercise price) on or before an expiry date. For the put option contract, the option price is an allowance paid by the retailer to the manufacturer for cancelling or returning one ordered unit of the product. The exercise price is the refund from the manufacturer to the retailer for exercising one unit of the put option. Hence, with the put option contract, the option buyer has the right to cancel or return some ordered units of the product at a specified refund per unit (the exercise price) on or before an expiry date. Obviously, with the option contract, on the one hand, the retailer acquires order flexibility by paying the option price. On the other hand, the manufacturer receives an early commitment from the retailer so that it can carry out better capacity and material planning, while the allowance received from selling the option justifies its assuming some demand risks from the retailer. Therefore, balancing these two countervailing forces, the option mechanism is beneficial to the channel and the channel partners concerned. This is especially true when the manufacturer is powerful enough and capable of absorbing the risks associated with demand and price uncertainties (Ritchken and Tapiero, 1986).

However, research on the option mechanism in the past often focused on the single directional option, namely either the call option or the put option, with which the retailer is allowed to adjust the initial order only upwards or only downwards. Wang and Tsao (2006) showed that the call option contract induces the retailer to reduce the initial order commitment, leading to an increase in the channel shortage cost, while the put option contract prompts the retailer to increase the initial order commitment, leading to an increase in the channel over-stocking cost. Moreover, the biased orders under the single directional option may exacerbate the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. Hence, it is not in the best interest of the channel to allow the retailer to adjust the order only in a single direction. In addition, the market may be so volatile that at the juncture to purchase the option, the retailer is not sure of the direction in which it will need to adjust the order quantity. In this case, the retailer may need to purchase a bidirectional option so that it is able to adjust the order in either direction. Moinzadeh and Nahmias (2000)p. 421 pointed out that a natural extension of the single directional option is the bidirectional option. So far, however, some issues of the bidirectional option have remained unaddressed. For example, how is the retailer’s initial order strategy affected with the bidirectional option provision? In addition, how should the bidirectional option contract be set to achieve supply chain coordination? These issues are far more complicated than those of the single directional option because the bidirectional option provides the retailer with the chance of adjusting the order in either direction. In this paper we analytically explore these issues of the bidirectional option contract. As an initial attempt to address these issues, we consider the simplest supply chain structure comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. This setting strikes a proper balance between model realism and problem tractability.

We organize the rest of this paper as follows: In Section 2 we present a brief review on the related literature. In Section 3 we develop the bidirectional option model. In Sections 4 and 5 we analyze the model and derive its structural properties. Finally, we conclude the paper and suggest topics for future research in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

We study supply chain contracts in this paper, which is a hot topic in the supply chain management literature. In order to highlight our contributions, we only review the literature that is most related to our work. For more details on supply chain contracts, we refer the reader to the excellent review papers by Lariviere (1999) and Cachon (2003).

The first research stream related to this paper is the literature on the call option that allows the buyer to adjust the order upwards. Generally, this stream of the literature can be classified into two research lines. The first is to consider the pure option contract, and the other is to consider the mixed market option that operates in the presence of an option contract market and a spot market. For the literature on the pure option contract, most works mainly emphasize the managerial flexibility and economic efficiency derived from the option contract (see, e.g., Eppen and Iyer, 1997; Barnes-Schuster et al., 2002; Edlin and Hermalin, 2000; Cachon and Lariviere, 2001; Brown and Lee, 2003; Burnetas and Ritchken, 2005; Wang and Liu, 2007; Zhao et al., 2010; Buzacott et al., 2011; Hazra and Mahadevan, 2009; Jin and Wu, 2007; Erkoc and Wu, 2005). Eppen and Iyer (1997) considered a backup agreement that is essentially a form of the option contract with a two-stage model. They demonstrated that the backup agreement can have a substantial impact on the expected profits of the supply chain members and the committed order quantity. Barnes-Schuster et al. (2002) also developed a two-stage model to explore the roles of the option contract, including how the option contract provides flexibility in response to market variations and how the option contract achieves supply chain coordination. Edlin and Hermalin (2000) studied the principal-agent problem with options. They explored when the option contract can be used to remedy the holdup effect and when it cannot in the presence of re-negotiation. Hazra and Mahadevan (2009) considered a capacity reservation model in which a buyer reserves capacity in advance from one or multiple suppliers with demand uncertainty. They explored the issues of how much capacity the buyer should reserve and how many suppliers it should select. For the mixed market option literature, the research emphasis has been placed on some issues concerning the interplay between the option contract market and the spot market, such as how the option contract and the spot market affect each other and what the optimal contract decisions (pricing) are when the spot market is available (see, e.g., Wu et al., 2002; Hazra et al., 2002; Spinler et al., 2003; Wu and Kleindorfer, 2005; Serel et al., 2001; Norden and Velde, 2005; Serel, 2007; Inderfurth and Kelle, 2011; Wu et al., 2005; Spinler and Huchzermeier, 2006). Wu et al. (2002) characterized the seller’s optimal option contract bidding and the buyers’ optimal contracting strategies in the presence of a stochastic spot market. Serel et al. (2001) considered a capacity reservation contract where the buyer has the right to receive any desired proportion of the capacity reserved. They explored the buyer’s optimal sourcing decisions when both the capacity reservation contract and spot market are available. All the above research including the first and second lines only considers the call option that allows the option buyer to adjust the order upwards only. Our work differs from this research stream in that we consider both the put and call option contracts simultaneously.

The second related research stream is the literature on the put option that allows the option buyer to adjust the order downwards only. Chen and Parlar (2007) considered a newsvendor model in which the newsvendor can purchase the put option to hedge against losses associated with low demand. They examined the value of the put option when the newsvendor is risk averse. A typical category within this research stream is the buyback contract literature. With the buyback contract, the manufacturer promises to reclaim all or part of the leftover inventory from the retailer at a pre-specified price (Pasternack, 1985; Padmanabhan and Png, 1997). The buyback contract allows the retailer to adjust the order downwards and hence is a type of the put option. Generally, we can classify the buyback contract literature into two lines. The first examines the buyback contract in the classical price-independent newsvendor setting. This line of research generally considers how to set the buyback contract to attain supply chain coordination (see, e.g., Pasternack, 1985; Donohue, 2000; Yang and Qi, 2009). A particularly interesting study is that of Yang and Qi, 2009, who developed a general three-step method to find a coordinating contract for a supply chain comprising one supplier and one retailer. They showed that several well-known contract types such as the buyback contract and the revenue-sharing contract can be viewed as applications of their method. The other line of research examines the buyback contract in the stochastic price-dependent demand setting. Since no buyback contract alone can attain supply chain coordination in this demand setting (see Cachon, 2003; Bernstein and Federgruen, 2005), this line of the research generally does not address the supply chain coordination issue but analyzes the buyback contract in the Stackelberg game framework (see, e.g., Padmanabhan and Png, 1997; Emmons and Gilbert, 1998; Wang, 2004; Padmanabhan and Png, 2004; Granot and Yin, 2005; Song et al., 2008). Our work differs from this second related research stream in that we assume that the retailer can place an additional order if necessary, as well as being given a chance to return some ordered units of the product.

Our paper is most related to the third research stream that considers bidirectional adjustments over the initial order (see, e.g., Milner and Rosenblatt, 2002; Wang and Tsao, 2006; Hu et al., 2007; GomezPadilla and Mishina, 2009). Milner and Rosenblatt (2002) considered a two-period supply contract with bidirectional adjustments. They assumed that the buyer determines the orders for two periods at the beginning of the planning horizon. After observing the demand in the first period, the buyer is allowed to adjust the order placed for the second period in either direction with an adjustment penalty cost per unit. They mainly analyzed the buyer’s optimal order strategies under such a contract mechanism. Wang and Tsao (2006) developed a single-period two-stage supply contract with the bidirectional option. Similar to Milner and Rosenblatt (2002), they also considered the bidirectional option contract only from the option buyer’s perspective and developed closed-form solutions for the buyer’s optimal order strategies with uniformly distributed stochastic demand. Hu et al. (2007) presented comprehensive comparisons between the single directional option and the bidirectional option in a supplier-retailer supply chain. In particular, they compared the effects of different option contracts on supply chain coordination. GomezPadilla and Mishina (2009) analyzed the performance of the bidirectional option contract in the multi-period setting. They used simulation to demonstrate that the bidirectional option contract can benefit the retailer, the supplier, and the supply chain. Our study differs from these studies mainly in the following three aspects: First, we derive closed-form expressions for the retailer’s optimal order strategies, including the initial order strategy and the option purchasing strategy, with a general demand distribution. Second, we analytically examine the feedback effects of the bidirectional option on the retailer’s initial order strategy. A particularly interesting finding is that the convexity and concavity of the demand cumulative distribution function, as well as the contracting cost parameters, can be critical determinants of the effects that the bidirectional option may have on the retailer’s initial order strategy. Third, taking a chain-wide perspective to look at the bidirectional option contract, we develop the distribution-free contracting form that can attain supply chain coordination.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer distributes its product via the retailer to the end market. The product is perishable with a comparatively long production lead-time and a short selling season, and subject to high demand uncertainty. The end market demand can be characterized by a stochastic variable X that follows a strictly increasing cumulative distribution function (CDF) F(x), with x
                     ⩾ 0, and a probability density function (PDF) f(x), with f(x)=
                     F′(x). Let the manufacturer’s wholesale price and marginal production cost be w and c, respectively, and the retailer’s retailing price be p. Any leftovers by the end of the selling season will be salvaged at price v per unit for both the manufacturer and the retailer. Clearly, to ensure the model is reasonable, we require that p
                     >
                     w
                     >
                     c
                     >
                     v.

The bidirectional option contract considered in this paper is characterized by two parameters, one is the option price, denoted as o, and the other is the exercise price of the bidirectional option, denoted as e. The retailer purchases the option at unit price o, which gives it the right (but not the obligation) to adjust its initial order either upwards or downwards, depending on demand realization at the juncture when the option is exercised. If upward adjustment occurs, the retailer will procure an additional quantity of the product that does not exceed the option quantity at price e per unit. If downward adjustment occurs, the retailer will return some quantity of the product that likewise does not exceed the option quantity at refund e per unit. We present the model in detail in the following.

The model captures the activities from the beginning of the production season to the end of the selling season. At the beginning of the production season, the manufacturer offers the retailer a bidirectional option contract, denoted as (o,
                     e), as well as a wholesale price contract, denoted as w. The retailer then places an initial order, denoted as Q, at the unit price w, and purchases an option quantity, denoted as q, at the unit price o. With the option quantity purchased, the retailer can adjust the initial order either upwards or downwards in the selling season, depending on demand realization, in the manner pre-specified by the bidirectional option contract. After that, following the retailer’s order strategies, the manufacturer produces the product during the production season. To fulfil the option quantity exercised by the retailer, the manufacturer adopts the make-to-order production policy and commits to producing the product up to Q
                     +
                     q. During the selling season, the retailer determines how to exercise the option upon demand realization, subject to the option quantity constraint q, and any unsatisfied demand is lost at penalty cost g per unit.

To avoid the trivial and unreasonable cases, we require that q
                     ⩽ 
                     Q, o
                     +
                     v
                     <
                     c, w
                     −
                     o
                     <
                     e
                     <
                     w
                     +
                     o, p
                     +
                     g
                     −
                     e
                     >
                     e
                     −
                     v, and p
                     +
                     g
                     −
                     c
                     >
                     c
                     −
                     v. As a matter of fact, the first constraint avoids the unreasonable scenario that the returned product quantity may exceed the one purchased by the retailer. The second constraint avoids the unreasonable scenario that the manufacturer may arbitrage with the option. The first part of the third constraint avoids the unreasonable scenario that the unit purchase price of the product under the wholesale price contract may be higher than that under the bidirectional option contract, while the second part avoids that the retailer may earn some profit by only exercising the bidirectional option as a put option. The fourth constraint avoids the unreasonable scenario that the retailer prefers to return the product to the manufacturer rather than satisfying the demand. The fifth constraint assures that the opportunity revenue for the supply chain is always larger than the opportunity loss; otherwise, there is no incentive to produce the product.

At the beginning of the production season, the retailer needs to determine the initial order quantity Q and the purchasing option quantity q, given a combination (w,
                     o,
                     e) of the wholesale price and the bidirectional option contract. Given the combination (w,
                     o,
                     e), the retailer’s expected profit from pursuing a pair of strategies (Q,
                     q) can be expressed as

The first term is the sales revenue. The second term is the stringent sales profit by exercising the bidirectional option as a call option. The third term is the stringent refund by exercising the bidirectional option as a put option. The fourth term is the salvage revenue. The fifth and the sixth terms are the costs of purchasing the initial order and the option, respectively, and the last term is the shortage cost. Hence, the retailer’s problem can be formulated as

We see from Theorem 1 that the retailer will only place an initial committed order quantity under the wholesale price contract and will not purchase any quantity of the option if the wholesale price is lower than

                     . Otherwise, the retailer will place an initial order accompanied with a quantity of the bidirectional option.

Given that only the wholesale price contract is available (without the bidirectional option provision), the retailer’s optimal order quantity is

                      (see the Appendix for the proof). It is known that the call option will push the retailer to reduce the initial order quantity whereas the put option will push the retailer to increase the initial order quantity (Wang and Tsao, 2006). However, what will happen to the retailer’s initial order decision when the bidirectional option is available? This issue is far from trivial because, given the bidirectional option, the retailer has the chance to adjust the initial order in either direction. We also see from the following results that the effects of the only-call option or the only-put option on the retailer’s initial order do not necessarily carry over to the case of the bidirectional option.

Hence, the retailer’s initial order quantity may increase or decrease given the bidirectional option. A closer look at the bidirectional option reveals the intuition behind this difference between the single directional option – a call option or a put option – and the bidirectional option. Given the only-call option, the retailer has the chance of placing an additional order if demand realization is above the initial expectation, and has no chance of returning the leftovers to the manufacturer if demand turns out to be low. As a result, it is in the retailer’s interest to place a relatively smaller initial order so as to hedge against the loss associated with over-ordering. The reverse happens in the case of the only-put option. Given the bidirectional option, however, the retailer has the chances of both placing a supplementary order and returning the leftovers. If the retailer places a bigger weight on the loss associated with over-ordering, then it will adopt a prudent order policy by reducing the initial order quantity. If the retailer places a bigger weight on the loss associated with under-ordering, then it will adopt an aggressive order policy by increasing the initial order quantity. However, as to on which side the retailer should place a bigger weight, it will depend on the demand distribution and the cost parameters associated with the wholesale price contract and the bidirectional option contract. In essence, Theorem 2 reveals a profound insight that the convexity and concavity of the demand cumulative distribution function, as well as the cost parameters associated with the respective contracts, can be a critical determinant of the side on which the retailer should place a bigger weight when making the initial order decision, which is an interesting result. With respect to the convexity or concavity of the demand distribution, as a matter of fact, there exists a wide range of cumulative demand distribution functions that satisfy these properties. To be specific, examples of convex demand CDF include the exponential, Pareto, and uniform distributions. The CDF of the demand that follows the beta, gamma, or Weibull distribution is also convex with certain parameters. In addition, examples of concave demand CDF include the beta distribution with certain parameters and the uniform distribution. Table 1
                      summarizes the above examples.

In fact, the results in Theorem 3(i) also hold with the single directional option. In addition, by Theorem 3(ii) and the make-to-order production policy adopted by the manufacturer, we know that given

We say that a supply chain is coordinated if the system-wide optimal expected profit is achieved for the supply chain. In the following we explore how the bidirectional option contract, combined with the wholesale price contract, can be set to achieve supply chain coordination. To derive the optimal expected profit of the channel, we take the supply chain as an entity and formulate the expected profit of the supply chain system as follows:

                     Wang and Liu (2007) and Zhao et al. (2010) considered the supply chain coordination issue with the call option that allows the retailer to adjust the initial order only upwards. Given the call option, they demonstrated that at coordination the exercise price negatively correlates with the option price (see Proposition 2 in Wang and Liu (2007) and Propositions 4 and 5 in Zhao et al. (2010)). However, we see from Theorem 4 that given the bidirectional option, at coordination the exercise price positively correlates with the option price. The intuition behind this difference can be explained as follows: Given the call option as considered in Wang and Liu (2007) and Zhao et al. (2010), the retailer is exposed to only the chance of loss from an increase in the exercise price. However, given the bidirectional option, the effects of an increase in the exercise price on the retailer can be the two sides of a coin. One is the adverse effect that the retailer may need to pay a higher unit price for the additional product quantity purchased by exercising the option as a call option. The other is the beneficial effect that the retailer is able to return the leftovers at a higher refund per unit by exercising the option as a put option. In other words, the retailer may both benefit and suffer from an increase in the exercise price of the bidirectional option. As a result, while the contract structure that a higher option price implies a higher exercise price cannot achieve supply chain coordination with the only-call option, it may do so with the bidirectional option. In addition, it should be noted that the system given in Theorem 4 is distribution free, which implies that the manufacturer can utilize it to coordinate different retailers without knowing their respective demand distributions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we develop a supply contract with the bidirectional option for a manufacturer-retailer supply chain. Under the bidirectional option contract, we derive closed-form expressions for the retailer’s optimal order strategies, including the initial order strategy and the option purchasing strategy, with a general demand distribution. We also analytically examine the feedback effects of the bidirectional option on the retailer’s initial order strategy. Note that since the bidirectional option provides the retailer with the chances of both supplementing the initial order and returning the leftovers, it is unclear whether the retailer will increase or decrease the initial order given the bidirectional option. It is also unclear in which scenarios the retailer should adopt a prudent or aggressive initial order policy given the bidirectional option. Our study generates interesting insights into these issues, i.e., in addition to the cost parameters of the contract, the convexity and concavity of the demand cumulative distribution function can be a critical determinant of the retailer’s decisions to address these issues. In addition, we develop a distribution-free form of the bidirectional option contract that can attain supply chain coordination.

Our findings substantiate the claim that there are fundamental differences between the single directional option and the bidirectional option. In our model we consider a simple two-echelon supply chain structure. Obviously, an extension of our model to more complex supply chains is worth pursuing in future research. A particularly interesting issue along with this extension is to introduce horizontal and/or vertical competition in the supply chain and explore how such competition affects the effectiveness of the bidirectional option contract. Another possible extension is to incorporate demand information updating in the model, i.e., the retailer can take advantage of information updates in making decisions.
