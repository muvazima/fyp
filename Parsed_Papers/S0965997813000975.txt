                  The paper briefly summarizes the theoretical derivation of the objective stress rates that are work-conjugate to various finite strain tensors, and then briefly reviews several practical examples demonstrating large errors that can be used by energy inconsistent stress rates. It is concluded that the software makers should switch to the Truesdell objective stress rate, which is work-conjugate to Green’s Lagrangian finite strain tensor. The Jaumann rate of Cauchy stress and the Green-Naghdi rate, currently used in most software, should be abandoned since they are not work-conjugate to any finite strain tensor. The Jaumann rate of Kirchhoff stress is work-conjugate to the Hencky logarithmic strain tensor but, because of an energy inconsistency in the work of initial stresses, can lead to severe errors in the cases of high natural orthotropy or strain-induced incremental orthotropy due to material damage. If the commercial softwares are not revised, the user still can make in the user’s implicit or explicit material subroutines (such as UMAT and VUMAT in ABAQUS) a simple transformation of the incremental constitutive relation to the Truesdell rate, and the commercial software then delivers energy consistent results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Large deformations of solids are an important practical problem, most challenging for computational predictions [1,2]. The main difficulty is to characterize the rate of stress change at various points of the solid in a way that gives correct work of deformation and describes the material deformation objectively, i.e., independently of the rigid-body rotations material elements.

Commercial softwares such as ABAQUS, LS-DYNA, ANSYS and NASTRAN have traditionally used an objective stress rate or increment which involves a convenient simplification that makes a certain error in energy conservation. For most applications this error is negligible. However, the authors show that large errors, of the order of 30–100%, can arise in certain problems of highly compressible materials, or soft-in-shear highly orthotropic materials, or materials which develop a highly orthotropic damage due to oriented cracking.

This article first explains the concept of energy-consistent objective stress rates. Then it briefly reviews several examples of large errors that can be caused by using commercial codes with an objective stress rate definition that is not energy consistent.

While the usual way to derive the objective stress rates has been based on tensorial coordinate transformations, the variational energy approach [3] is preferable because it also ensures energy consistency with the finite strain tensor.

                     This rate is work-conjugate to the Hencky (or logarithmic) strain. The Jaumann (or co-rotational) rate of Cauchy stress cannot be obtained from Eq. (5) and thus is work-conjugate with no finite strain tensor.

When different m are considered, the tangential stress–strain relation must be written as

Many finite element softwares utilize stress rates that are not associated with any finite strain. Although this has been no problem for the vast majority of applications to metals, enormous errors can result in some cases. Other errors can arise even if an energy consistent stress rate is employed, because of an improper choice of the finite strain measure. As shown in [3], m
                     =2 is required for all the situations where the tangential moduli are highly orthotropic and the dominant compressive principal stress has the direction of strong orthotropy. Thus, e.g., m
                     =2 needs to be used for polymers reinforced by unidirectional or bidirectional stiff fibers (note that, on the other hand, m
                     =−2 is required when the maximum compressive stress is normal to the strong orthotropy directions as, e.g., for elastomeric bridge or seismic isolation bearings, and for other principal stress ratios the correct m value lies between −2 and 2; see [4, Eq. (29)]).

This paper reviews several recent studies of this problem and gives three examples of the error caused by the wrong use or definition of the objective stress rate and the associated finite strain tensor.

A salient characteristic of sandwich plates is that the shear strain in a soft core is important for buckling. The shear buckling is a problem with a hundred-year controversial history. It requires using the stability criteria for a three-dimensional continuum, which were for half a century a subject of polemics. Although the polemics were resolved four decades ago, some authors still dispute various aspects. All the historical controversies can be traced to the arbitrariness in choosing the finite strain measure and to inattention to the work-conjugacy requirement. This requirement means that the (doubly contracted) product of the incremental objective stress tensor with the incremental finite strain tensor must give a correct expression for the second-order work [5, chapter 11].

As an example, the cylindrical buckling, which is a special case of plate buckling, is analyzed. The short sides of the sandwich panel are clamped and the longer edges are free; Fig. 1
                        . The core is assumed to be linear elastic and the skins are elastic and quasi-isotropic. The material properties are summarized in Table 1
                        . For numerical simulation, the plate is homogenized through its whole thickness and uniform effective material properties for the combined thickness of the core and skins are used. This defines a homogeneous highly orthotropic plate [6].

As seen in Fig. 2
                        a, the use of the same constant elastic moduli for different strain measures causes a major discrepancy among the solutions for different m, with differences up to about 100%, and can lead to dangerous overestimation of the buckling load. However, this discrepancy becomes less than about 1% when the both the core and the skins of the sandwich are discretized separately through the thickness (but such discretization would not be easily implemented for a large ship with hundreds of large sandwich plates).

                        b shows the correct buckling mode, which is obtained if the

Many softwares use the Jaumann rate of Cauchy stress which is the source of error in this case. In [5,8] it was shown that this stress rate is not work-conjugated with any strain measure due to the missing volumetric term. The error in using the Jaumann rate of Cauchy stress was pointed out in the literature long ago [3], but has either been ignored or thought to cause only negligible errors. Indeed, the error is generally less than 0.1 percent for metals and other materials that are inelastically incompressible and elastically almost incompressible. It now appears, though, that this is not true for highly compressible inelastic materials; for example, rigid foams (polymeric, metallic and ceramic), honeycomb, certain soils (loess, silt, under-consolidated and organic soils), some rocks (pumice and tuff), osteoporotic bone, light wood, carton and various biological tissues.

The problem presented here is of interest for prospective new designs of very light and fuel-efficient large ships in which the hull is clad by sandwich panels of typical span 4m, which have a foam core approximately 150mm thick and are supported on tubular steel ribs. One important design consideration is the impact of floating objects or ice floes onto the sandwich. Therefore, the study is made on the sandwich shown in Fig. 3c and d which is indented in a two-dimensional plane-strain mode by a rigid rectangular object of width b
                        =160mm. For ease of interpretation, the indentation is considered to be static. The material properties of sandwich panel are shown in Table 1. The bottom skin is assumed to be fixed on a rigid base and to extend far enough so that the boundary conditions at the rims do not matter. The object is assumed to be in perfect contact with the top skin.

The core consists of a vinyl foam of mass density 200kg/m3, marketed as Divinycell 200, typically used for marine sandwich structures. The skin is assumed elastic and quasi-isotropic. The constitutive properties of the foam in this simulation are simplified as follows: von Mises (or J
                        2) plasticity in shear, with shear yield stress τ
                        0
                        =62MPa, and the volumetric compression defined by the tri-linear diagram plotted in Fig. 3a. The middle, nearly flat, portion of this diagram corresponds to collapse of foam cells (modeled in [9]). The final stiffening from initial bulk modulus K to bulk modulus γK is caused by the closing of collapsed cells with the opposite walls pressed into contact. The parameters used for the simulations are

The resulting load deflection curves are plotted in Fig. 3b. The difference in the maximum load reached is 17.7% compared to the uncorrected ABAQUS value, which is obtained with the Jaumann rate of Cauchy stress ([8] presents another example of indentation of a sandwich plate with foam core in which the error in the resisting force is 28.8% and in the work of indentation is 15.3%).

A possible numerical error caused by the wrong definition of the stress rate (the Jaumann rate of Cauchy (Kirchhoff) rate vs. the Green-Naghdi rate) is demonstrated in this section. As an example, the experiment presented by Vural et al. [10] is utilized. The shear-compression specimen is shown in Fig. 4
                        . The material of the specimen is assumed to be the 1018 cold-rolled steel. Unfortunately, Vural et al. did not present all material parameters and so the following parameters, typical of this kind of steel, are assumed: Young’s modulus E
                        =200GPa; Poisson’s ratio ν
                        =0.29; yield strength f
                        
                           y
                        
                        =350MPa; and hardening modulus H
                        =2GPa. To simulate different stress rates, the user material subroutine (VUMAT) in the commercial software ABAQUS [11] is employed. The material behavior is modeled by means of the von Mises plasticity with linear kinematic hardening. The error with regard to the law of energy conservation is shown in Fig. 5
                        . Because of the small volume change during the loading, the Jaumann rate Cauchy stress delivers very similar results, as depicted in Fig. 5a and c. The standard ABAQUS first-order tetrahedral element C3D4 is used (Fig. 5d). Note that the same geometry and mesh was utilized for all calculations.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

To remedy these problems, the software makers should switch to the Truesdell objective stress rate, which is work-conjugate to Green’s Lagrangian finite strain tensor (m
                     =2). The Jaumann rate of Cauchy stress and the Green-Naghdi rate should be abandoned since they are not work-conjugate to any finite strain tensor. The Jaumann rate of Kirchhoff stress is work-conjugate to the Hencky logarithmic strain tensor, but can lead to severe errors in the cases of high natural orthotropy or strain-induced incremental orthotropy.

It may be objected that the Hencky strain tensor ant the Jaumann rates are more intuitive for constitutive modeling. True, but it is no problem to convert the constitutive relation, once formulated, to the Truesdell rate, which can be done either by the used or automatically in the software.

Even if the commercial softwares are not revised, one can still make in the user’s implicit or explicit material subroutines (such as UMAT and VUMAT in ABAQUS) a simple transformation of the incremental constitutive relation to the Truesdell rate, as shown in [3,12,8], and the commercial software then delivers correct results.
