                  This paper presents a biarc-based subdivision scheme for space curve interpolation. Given a sequence of space points, or a sequence of space points and tangent vectors, the scheme produces a smooth curve interpolating all input points by iteratively inserting new points and computing new tangent vectors. For each step of subdivision, the newly inserted point corresponding to an existing edge is a specified joint point of a biarc curve which interpolates the two end points and the tangents. A provisional tangent is also assigned to the newly inserted point. Each of the tangents for the following subdivision step is further updated as a linear blending of the provisional tangent and the tangent at the respective point of a circle passing through the local point and its two adjacent points. If adjacent four initial points and their initial reference tangent vectors are sampled from a spherical surface, the limit curve segment between the middle two initial points exactly lies on the same spherical surface. The biarc based subdivision scheme is proved to be

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Designing a smooth interpolation curve from a given polygon by repeated subdivision is an important modeling method in Computer Aided Geometric Design. One of the classical subdivision schemes for curve interpolation is four point interpolatory subdivision (Dyn et al., 1987). It is simple to implement and is regarded as a significant curve subdivision scheme. Limit curves of four point interpolatory subdivision may however exhibit undesired artifacts and undulations (Marinov et al., 2005). To achieve the aim of shape preserving and artifact removing, some geometry driven schemes have emerged (Dyn et al., 1992; Marinov et al., 2005; Sabin and Dodgson, 2005; Yang, 2006; Deng and Wang, 2010; Deng and Ma, 2012). In this paper we generalize the incenter subdivision scheme (Deng and Wang, 2010) to a scheme for 3D curve interpolation with the properties of convexity preserving and artifacts removing.

One subdivision step of the incenter subdivision scheme (Deng and Wang, 2010) consists of three main stages. Firstly, for each edge, we insert a new point which is the incenter of a triangle formed by the two end points of the edge and its end tangents, i.e., a special joint point of the 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      biarc matching the two end points and tangents. Secondly, we select a provisional tangent for each point such that there exists a 
                        
                           
                              G

                      continuous circular arc spline interpolating the points and their provisional tangent vectors. If the tangents remain the same for the next level of subdivision, the limit curve would be the biarc spline curve which is a

                      curve interpolating all initial points. Finally, to obtain a 
                        
                           
                              G

                      limit curve, we rotate the provisional tangent for each of the refined points according to the radii of two adjacent circular arc segments, i.e., all tangents are updated for the next level of subdivision. Note that this applies to the tangents at the points inherited from the previous step, as well as the new ones. If the old tangents were not modified, the scheme would be a Hermite one, probably

To extend the incenter subdivision scheme to 3D, we need to compute newly inserted points (Stage I), their provisional tangents (Stage II), and updated tangents for the next level of subdivision (Stage III), all in 3D. The formulation of 2D biarc interpolation was extended to 3D in Sharrock (1987), Hoschek (1992). So the first and the second stages of the incenter subdivision scheme, i.e., the rule of adding new point as a special joint point of the

                      biarc matching the two end points and tangents and the rule of defining a provisional tangent for each of the inserted points such that there exists a 
                        
                           
                              G

                      continuous circular arc spline interpolating the points and their provisional tangent vectors, can be easily generalized to the 3D case. The crux of the generalization thus lies in how to update tangents in 3D for the next level of subdivision since there is no trivial solution to rotate the tangents in 3D space which yields a well-behaved limit curve.

                      limit curves, the discrete curve formed by refined points should be smoother and smoother with the level of subdivisions higher and higher. At the same time, the discrete tangent and curvature at each refined point should also gradually converge to those of the limit curve. Inspired by these facts, we define each of the new tangents for the next level of subdivision as a linear blending of its provisional tangent and the tangent of the circle passing through the respective point and its two adjacent points. This method is much simpler than the rotation-based method used in the incenter subdivision scheme and numerical examples show that the limit curves produced by this method are also attractive. Furthermore, because 3D biarc curve lies on a spherical surface, the scheme can generate spherical curve segment if adjacent four initial points and their tangents are sampled from a spherical surface. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed 3D biarc-based subdivision scheme is convexity preserving and the limit curve is

                      continuous. Many numerical examples also show that the limit curves are fair curves with

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly highlight the background knowledge of biarc interpolation. The proposed biarc based subdivision scheme is introduced in Section 3. The property of generating spherical curves by the proposed scheme is presented in Section 4. The convexity preserving property of the proposed scheme is proved in Section 5. Further smoothness analysis of the scheme is presented in Section 6. Section 7 provides some experimental examples to demonstrate the excellent properties of the scheme. Some concluding remarks can be found in Section 8.

Before entering a new level of subdivision, all tangents are further updated following the rules discussed in 3.2.

The sequence of points after each subdivision defines a control polygon which is refined in the following manner. After each refinement, points with even indices are inherited from the previous level and are renumbered as

From the fact that a 3D biarc curve lies on a spherical surface, we prove that the biarc based subdivision scheme introduced in Section 3 reproduces a spherical curve with specified initial data.

Convexity preserving criteria of space curves have been suggested by Goodman and Ong (1997), Kaklis and Karavelas (1997) and Costantini and Pelosi (2001). Because the data processed in our biarc based subdivision scheme are points as well as their tangent vectors, different with other definitions of convexity, we define the convexity property of edges and points using points and their tangent vectors.

                      Hermite edges whose edges and their tangents are collinear, we should modify the rule of adjusting tangents to achieve the aim of shape preserving. In such a case, to get

                      limit curve, we select the midpoint of the edge as the new point and keep the end tangents fixed. To insert a line segment in the limit curve with

                      continuity, we adopt the rules of Deng and Wang (2010) (Section 2.4). To make the text lighter, we assume that consecutive Hermite points do not go through the same straight line, and no part of the limit curve degenerates to a line segment.

In the following, we first present the shape preserving property of the biarc subdivision scheme of the 2D case in Subsection 5.1, and then the 3D case in Subsection 5.2.

In this subsection, we assume that all the initial points and tangents are coplanar.

To prove the convexity preserving property of the biarc based subdivision scheme, we only need to prove that the number of inflections implied by data set

The process of the proof of convexity preserving property is as follows:
                           
                              •
                              We first define the convex and inflection 
                                    
                                       
                                          G
                                       
                                       
                                          1
                                       
                                    
                                  Hermite edge (Definition 5.1) and convex and inflection 
                                    
                                       
                                          G
                                       
                                       
                                          1
                                       
                                    
                                  Hermite point (Definition 5.4).

We then find the convexity preserving property between convex (inflection) 
                                    
                                       
                                          G
                                       
                                       
                                          1
                                       
                                    
                                  Hermite edge (point) and the resulting biarc curve (Propositions 5.3 and 5.6).

It is further proved that, after inserting the new points and defining the provisional tangent vectors, the convexity is preserved with the number of inflections being unchanged (Proposition 5.9).

It is finally proved that, after adjusting the tangent vectors, the convexity is also preserved with the number of inflections being unchanged as well (Proposition 5.13).

Finally the convexity preserving property (Theorem 5.14) can be derived based on the previous two conclusions.

In the following we focus on the issue that after computing the new tangent vectors the number of inflections is also not changed.

The definition of convexity preserving in 3D is a very subtle issue because the position of an inflexion depends on the view direction if a curve has torsion. In our construction, the limit curve has local support and is

                        , then it must allow torsion. Since a 3D biarc can be constructed from a 2D biarc, we define a convex

                              The biarc based subdivision scheme defined in Section

                              is convexity preserving for 3D curve interpolation.
                           

To make the text lighter, we assume that all angles in this section are positive if not stated explicitly. In case of some angles being negative, the proof is similar.

For convenience, we further summarize some notations as follows.

To illustrate the quality of a subdivision curve, we also compute and plot the discrete curvatures of the curve after a finite number of subdivisions.

We first explore the effect of free parameter ω (see Eq. (1)) to the limit curve in Example 1, in which nine limit curves are generated by the biarc based subdivision scheme from a simple control polygon with free parameter ω as 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, respectively. The initial five points are (

                        3
                     ). The limit curves as well as discrete curvature of each point are displayed in Fig. 6
                     . To easily access the shape of these limit curves, we also display the discrete curvature plots for each of the limit curves (see Fig. 7
                     ). From the limit curves and their discrete curvature plots, we can see that for small ω such as 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, the limit curve have some visible jump points of curvature, though from the curvature plots we can see that the limit curves still seem to be curvature continuous. For big ω such as 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, the discrete curvatures of the limit curves seem to be jagged sometimes. From their discrete curvature plots, we can clearly see this effect. So though their limit curves seem to be curvature continuous, the limit curves are not fair. However for median ω such as 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, from the limit curves and their discrete curvature plots, we can see that the limit curves seem to be curvature continuous and fair. So we recommend to set the free parameter ω be in the range of 
                        [
                        0.2
                        ,
                        0.3
                        ]
                     . In the following examples we let 
                        ω
                        =
                        0.25
                     .

To compare the effect of the biarc subdivision scheme with other schemes, a limit curve generated by the ternary four point subdivision scheme (Hassan et al., 2002), which generates

                              2
                           
                        
                      curves, and its discrete curvature plots are displayed in Fig. 8
                     . From Fig. 8(b) we can see that though the limit curve of the ternary four point subdivision scheme is 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      continuous, the fact that the limit curve has many curvature extreme points implies that the limit curve is not fair. Two other examples (see Figs. 9, 10
                     
                     ) also support this conclusion.

In the following examples, we show the convexity preserving and artifact removal effect of the biarc based subdivision scheme. A well-known deficiency of linear subdivision schemes is that their limit curves have big bump near a short edge with adjacent very long edges (also see Fig. 10(a)). The biarc based subdivision scheme, however, produces very fair limit curves in such case (see Fig. 10(b)). The initial points for Example 2 are (

Finally, we give two more examples (see Figs. 11, 12
                     
                     ) to show the property for generating spherical curves by the biarc based subdivision scheme. In these two examples, we first sample some initial data from source figures, then generate planar curves by the biarc based subdivision scheme, finally we map the planar initial data to spherical surface and generate spherical curves by the biarc based subdivision scheme. From the figures we can see that the limit curve are spherical curves if all the initial data are sampled from the spherical surface. These facts are consistent with Theorem 4.1.

From these examples and many other examples that we tested, we find that the limit curves produced by the proposed biarc based subdivision scheme is

                      continuous. It is however difficult to prove this conclusion at the moment. We thus pose a conjecture in this paper and leave the proof as future work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

We have described a biarc based subdivision scheme for 3D curve interpolation. It can be seen as an extension of the incenter subdivision scheme (Deng and Wang, 2010) to 3D for space curve subdivision. The scheme has some attractive properties, such as spherical curve generation, convexity preserving, artifacts removal and thus producing fair limit curves. How to prove that the limit curve is 
                        
                           
                              G

                      continuous should however be further addressed as future work. The design of other higher order 3D interpolation curves by geometry driven subdivision schemes also deserves for future studies. Another attractive but difficult future work is to extend the proposed biarc based subdivision scheme for defining an interpolatory surface subdivision scheme that reproduces spherical surfaces.
