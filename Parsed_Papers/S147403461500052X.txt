                  The purpose of this research is to develop a formal knowledge e-discovery methodology, using advanced information technology and decision support analysis, to define legal case evolution based on Collective Litigation Intelligence (CLI). In this research, a decade of Australia’s retail franchise and trademark litigation cases are used as the corpus to analyze and synthesize the evolution of modern retail franchise law in Australia. The formal processes used in the legal e-discovery research include a LexisNexis search strategy to collect legal documents, text mining to find key concepts and their representing key phrases in the documents, clustering algorithms to associate the legal cases into groups, and concept lattice analysis to trace the evolutionary trends of the main groups. The case analysis discovers the fundamental issues for retail modernization, advantages and disadvantages of retail franchising systems, and the potential litigation hazards to be avoided in the Australian market. Given the growing number of legal documents in global court systems, this research provides a systematic and generalized CLI methodology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of research across international legal systems. In the context of the case study, the results demonstrate the critical importance of quickly processing and interpreting existing legal knowledge using the CLI approach. For example, a brand management company, which purchases a successful franchise in one market is under limited time constraints to evaluate the legal environment across global markets of interest. The proposed CLI methodology can be applied to derive market entry strategies to secure growth and brand expansion of a global franchise.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This research focuses on developing a methodology for legal e-discovery and, most importantly, litigation evolution analysis using collective intelligence of precedential documents, court cases, and data existing in legal databases. The specific techniques of text mining, data mining, cluster analysis, and formal concept analysis are modified and applied as the Collective Litigation Intelligence (CLI) methodology for legal e-discovery. The case study of the Australia retail franchise and trademark litigation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalizable CLI processes. The last decade of legal cases (2004–2013), related to retail franchises and trademarks, are searched as the fact-base to derive collective litigation intelligence to project the litigation trends and evaluate hazards underlying the retail legal evolution. These franchise and trademark litigation cases and selected documents are used to demonstrate the significant findings of the CLI approach and the validity of the methodology. The paper strategically advises franchise trademark holders of market strategies for sustainable market development that avoids past mistakes and identifies new opportunities. The research results enables managers and legal advisors to answer critical questions such as “Has legislation stabilized the franchise environment?” and “What are the trademark, legal, and franchise hazards that restrict market development?” The research clusters the last decade of 35 precedent setting franchise and trademark cases into four homogenous groups. Briefly speaking, the clustering analysis yields four groups of cases with distinctive characteristics and features. The CLI’s final step is to derive the time-varied evolution trends underlying the development of the franchise and trademark legal landscape. Applying the developed CLI processes, Clusters 1, 2, and 3 are considered bellwether case clusters whereas Cluster 4 supports legislative stability and a market place of opportunity rather than a legal hazard. Franchisers and brand managers interested in the Australian market should focus on the case clusters to avoid franchise and trademark litigation and to develop opportunities that create sustainable market plans. The methodology and the case research can be rapidly repeated in other legal domains for their litigation e-discovery.

This paper is organized using the following sections. In the literature review section, the key concepts and related research of ontology, knowledge discovery, data and text mining, and formal concept analysis are reviewed, cited, and described. We refer to these papers for the readers’ further reference and study when conducting following up research for advanced theory development and applications. The “collective litigation intelligence (CLI) methodology” section describes the CLI methodology framework and logic for each detailed step. The CLI procedure is best demonstrated and described using an applied legal case study. Thus, the step-wise sub-sections including the document search strategy, the case text mining, the CLI clustering and context interpretations, and legal concept evolution lattice are presented using the Australian franchise example. Finally, the conclusion section discusses the research results, contributions, and suggested future work for a generalizable CLI methodology applicable for legal e-discovery beyond the franchise and trademark case domain.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This research focuses on using knowledge discovery algorithms and methods to effectively extract litigation trends and insights from a huge collection of text documents. The key knowledge e-discovery techniques specifically applicable for CLI methodology development include the capturing of key entities in the domain ontology, knowledge discovery from text documents (KDT) and from databases (KDD), document clustering, and formal concept lattice analysis. From these critical components of knowledge discovery, well-defined domain entities (such as key phrases of given documents), being the essence of the ontology schema, enable the documents being machine readable, inter-operable, and auto-interpretable in the corpus [17]. Although building a comprehensive domain-specific ontology is not the focus of this research (but is a future research direction), ontology engineering, applied to define domain concepts and scopes using a set of key entities, is adopted as the principal research step [9,11].

Knowledge discovery is a process used to extract implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from known data which are relevant and meaningful [8]. Depending on the data type, knowledge discovery divides knowledge into two categories: knowledge discovered from a database (KDD or data mining) and knowledge derived from a text document base (KDT or text mining). KDD is the process used to automatically discover previously unknown patterns, rules, and other types of content in large volumes of data [6,5]. The steps of KDD consists of identifying the analytical objectives, creating the target data set, cleaning and preprocessing data, data reduction or projection, using data mining techniques or algorithms to search the patterns of data, and interpreting the patterns [6].

Text mining is commonly known as knowledge discovery when analyzing documents or text [7]. The framework of text mining consists of text refinement and knowledge distillation [18]. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical method using the frequency of word occurrence in text to reflect the importance of words or phrases and representing key conceptsin a given document set [15]. Salton and Buckley [14] reported that the length of a document can affect the term weight. Therefore, TF-IDF was modified and called normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency (NTF-IDF). The number of words in a set of documents is used to normalize the value of term frequency. For instance, in patent analysis, text mining techniques including text segmentation, summary extraction, feature selection, term association, cluster generation, topic identification and information mapping are commonly applied [10], [25]. Trappey et al. [23] combined the techniques of ontology-based text mining and data mining to identify patent sub-technologies.

Formal concept analysis (FCA) was first proposed by Wille [27] based on lattice theory [1]. FCA is used as a method to derive a concept hierarchy from a collection of objects and their attributes. FCA uses formal context and formal concepts, as represented in Table 1
                      and can be expressed as a triple set {O, A, R} where O is a set of objects, A is a set of attributes, and R is the set of relations between O and A. The left side of the Table 1 is the set of objects (O
                        i
                     , i
                     =1,…,5). The top row of Table 1 lists the set of attributes (
                        
                           A
                           ∈
                           {
                           
                              
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           ,
                           j
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           4
                           }
                        
                     ). If an object (O
                        i
                     ) consists of a given attribute (aj
                     ), the relation between them will be marked (×) in the matrix. Each concept in the hierarchy represents the set of objects sharing the same values for a certain set of attributes. Each sub-concept in the hierarchy contains a subset of the objects in the concepts above it.

The concept lattice is built based on the formal contexts used to define super-concepts and sub-concepts from general to specific levels of relationships. Suppose that an object O1
                     ⊆O2 with common attributes A1
                     ⊆A2. This means the concept (O1, A1) is a sub-concept of the concept (O2, A2) while the concept (O2, A2) is a super-concept of the concept (O1, A1). The concept lattice is drawn as a top-down graph depicting concepts from general to specific relationships. The top and bottom of the concept lattice describes supremum and infimum relationships denoted as maximum sub-concepts and minimum sub-concepts. In Fig. 1
                     , the concepts are derived from the formal context relations of Table 1. For instance, a super-concept is composed of object O1 and has a set of two attributes {a1, a4}. After adding an attribute a3, a narrowed-down (specific) sub-concept O4 is defined with a set of attributes {a1, a3, a4}. The objects, belonging to narrower concept(s), are continuously identified with attributes added into the lattice. Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, the most specific concept has all attributes but is so narrow that it has a null set of objects.

Researchers [12] have modified the formal concept analysis and concept map to include time as an essential dimension for concept evolution analysis. The modified formal concept matrix, as shown in Table 2
                     , is used to represent any types of documents (Di
                     ), such as patent or litigation documents, and their technical key terms (Kj
                     ) according to the yearly publication sequence. The context of the modified formal concept matrix is used in this research to derive the time-based dynamic concept lattice to illustrate the franchise and trademark litigation changes and their relationships over time. The concept lattice is presented in a radial format as shown in Fig. 2
                     , where the earlier documents are presented as the nodes in the inner circles and the newer documents are the nodes scattered in the outer circles. The diagram traces litigation case evolution over time and aids in the extrapolation of future trends and legal case outcomes.

This research develops the formal methodology for the discovery of collective litigation intelligence. The main processes to the CLI approach are illustrated in Fig. 3
                     , which include the litigation case search strategy and execution, the legal document text mining, the case clustering, and the CLI concept evolution lattice analysis. As shown in Fig. 4
                     , the CLI processes are implemented for the Australia retail franchise and trademark related litigation activities and trend analysis. The Australia franchise and trademark litigation case search yields a total of 35 court cases from 2004 to 2013, which serve as the corpus for the e-discovery CLI demonstration. This research emphasizes collective knowledge discovery in a text document base (KDT). The research targets litigation documents filed over the past decade in Australia that are significantly related to franchises and trademarks. A thorough search was conducted and litigation documents downloaded from the legal database, LexisNexis Advance [13]. The thirty-five related franchise and trademark litigation cases collected are listed in Appendix A.

The following subsections explain how each CLI process is conducted using the Australia franchise and trademark cases as analytical examples. The newly developed processes and corresponding algorithms are described in the subsections. In addition, references are cited for detailed theoretical explanations of the algorithms.

The methodology defines the framework for data collection and selection of cases used in the analysis. In summary, the LexisNexis and Westlaw databases were used to retrieve all Australian cases (2004–2013) containing the keywords “retail” and “trademark.” This set was further reduced by creating a partitioned sub-set related to “franchise” and “trademark.” Each case was searched to determine that there were at least 30 related key terms in each document describing the main concepts of franchise disputes. Duplicate cases were removed and the list of all related litigation documents over the recent 10years are shown in Appendix A. The following steps of the CLI analysis require text mining and a clustering algorithm to identify similar cases within clustered groups and eventually form the clusters with significantly different features [10].

After the 35 case documents are downloaded and archived during the previous search step, the documents are text minded to identify and rank the most frequently appearing key phrases in the legal case documents. The measurement of top ranked key phrases are calculated using the formula for Normalized Term Frequency and Inversed Document Frequency (NTF-IDF). The NTF-IDF values of 48 key phrases for the 35 retail franchise and trademark case documents are listed in Appendix B. The NTF-IDF calculates weights for frequent key phrases in the document set to determine relevance. As described in Turney [26], frequent key phrases in one document cannot represent a domain but frequent key phrases in a series of documents should represent the domain concept of the document set. First, the formula for IDF is defined as:

                         equals the most frequently occurring key phrases in a specific text document and is considered as a key phrase for document k. The detailed discussion of the mathematical formulas, term frequencies and inverse document frequencies are reported in the following research papers [26,23].

The clustering algorithm identifies the sets of key phrases used to describe the derived clusters. Given the statistics from each cluster, the key phrase that best describes a given cluster is used to find the associated legal cases and to derive a summary litigation cluster. The litigation summaries are written and based upon the key concepts derived from the key phrases and their relationships clustered using K-Means, a non-hierarchical clustering approach [10,23].

The procedure is described as follows. First, the algorithm transforms the legal document into the key phrase vectors and calculate the frequencies of the key phrases (i.e., NTF-IDF) using Eq. (2). Second, it derives the key term vector by eliminating unnecessary words and merging words into meaningful phrases. Third, the correlation values between documents are calculated. The correlation coefficients between two documents are the normalized cross-product of the NTF-IDF vectors for the given two documents. The NTF-IDF values from the previous sub-section are used as inputs to derive the correlation, Cor (Di
                        , Dj
                        ), of two documents (i and j) using the normalized inner product of vectors as expressed in Eq. (3).

                         is the NFT-IDF vector for document i consisting of the NTF-IDF values of key phrases 1∼k. The document correlation matrix is used as the base for litigation document clustering applying the K-Means algorithm [2]. Same principle applied, the key phrase correlation matrix is used as the base for the key phrase clustering [10]. In order to determine the best number of clusters, Sharma [16] recommends the Root Mean Square Standard Deviation (RMSSTD) and the R-Squared (RS) approach to assess the K-Means clustering results with the same set separated into different numbers of clusters. The RMSSTD value (Eq. (4)), representing the sum of squared distances between elements in the same groups, should be as small as possible to obtain an optimal number of divided groups. Further, the RS value of the clustering result (Eq. (5)) should be as large as possible, since the value represents the sum of squared distances between elements belonging to different groups. The RMSSTD is formularized as Eq. (4), while the RS is formulated as Eq. (5).

While the story of each case cluster refers to the cases in the cluster for micro analysis, the CLI is not derived from the potentially skewed interpretation of subjectively selective legal cases. Our CLI research goal is that there is no a priori knowledge of what is represented in the cluster and is not based on an interpretation of the cluster using an analyst’s familiar knowledge of litigation cases. Bias is avoided and the summary reflects homogeneous legal decisions based on the highest frequency of occurrence of the legal terms appearing in the documents in the cluster.

                              Cluster 1: Franchise Contract Injunctions, Transferals, and Cessation

Franchise cases are of great value to understanding strategic actions necessary to preserve trademarks under competitive circumstances. Two cases of the last decade relevant to termination of franchise agreements are discussed (Fig. 5
                        , Cluster 1). Cluster 1’s key terms include agreement, franchise, franchisee, and evidence reflecting the franchise IP protection. The first case describes a positive story where the franchisor does not seek to discredit the franchisee, even after ongoing defamation abuse, as a means to terminate the agreement. Only an interlocutory injunction was sought and the franchisee was left to continue their business as long as abuse toward the franchisor stopped. However, in the second case, the franchisor was the unscrupulous party that damaged the name of the franchise and franchisees. The franchisor actions diluted the profit and reputation of all franchisees and created skepticism toward franchise agreements in the Australian marketplace. As shown in Fig. 5, the linkages between litigation documents are labeled with percentage (%) values to indicate the similarity strength between documents. The percentage values assigned (50–92%) are used for ranking purposes based on the common occurrences of key terms and their frequencies between two documents (i.e., the distance between the two documents is calculated using the key terms’ NTF values as attribute vectors).

The early 2004 Australian Federal Court case Midas Australia PTY LTD v Ravecroft PTY LTD and Others (‘Midas’) set the Australian standard for managing contracts where there are disagreements between the franchisor and the franchisee. When a franchisor’s trademark is at risk of suffering non-compensable erosion of value, an interlocutory injunction is used to bring an immediate halt to the devaluation of the trademark. The ongoing disagreement with Midas over a breach of the franchise agreement, resulted in Ravecroft publishing defamatory allegations to other franchisees. Although the case does not specify exactly what caused the disagreement between Midas and the Borradales owning Ravecroft, their dispute with Midas led to the spread of false claims to other franchisees. The false claims alleged that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission listed Midas as a “rogue trader,” that Midas was misusing advertising funds, lying and intimidating franchisees, and engaged in unconscionable extortion ([2004] FCA 771 [3]). Midas was left with no choice but to call for an injunction since the breaches were not remedied by the franchisee. Since these breaches were not remedied, Midas terminated the franchise agreement on the May 4th, 2004 as pursuant to the original franchise agreement according to law. Given the severity of the allegations and the continuing use of the Midas trademark (Ravecroft purporting to offer Midas brand mufflers, brakes and suspensions), Midas showed great restraint and strategic market planning not to pursue a media linked settlement via a defamation lawsuit. Midas requested that the agreement be terminated, that their signage be removed from the Borradales’ garage, and the phone ad listing be changed without requesting that they cease their business and automotive service trade. Midas severed the agreement on the 10th of August 2004 without undue or negative publicity and remains to this day a leader of Australian franchising.

An important Australian case concerns franchisor agreement termination by unfairly withholding consent to assign transfer of a franchise to new owners or terminating agreements for minor breaches. The case exemplifies the damage that can be caused to a trademark by a franchisor’s poor management including inconsistent treatment of franchisees [4]. The case dates from the year 2008: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v All-Phones Retail Pty Ltd (2011) 280 ALR 97 (‘ACCC’, ‘AllPhones’). This long running dispute ended in a $45,000 contempt of court settlement and the award of $3 million dollars to 55 franchisees. In 2008, AllPhones was held in contempt of court by the ACCC for failing to release franchisees from their agreements unless new (less fair) franchise agreements were entered into and that franchisees sign deeds, which absolved AllPhones from all liabilities. The ACCC was not notified as agreed upon and were quite alarmed since they were in the process of filing a class action lawsuit against AllPhones on behalf of the unfairly treated franchisees. AllPhones’ disputed franchise agreements were part of an ongoing campaign to eliminate “enemy” franchisees supporting ACCC’s decision to file a class action suit and levy a $3 million dollar fine to pay damages for their anti-competitive action. At the end of the battle with the ACCC, the board of AllPhones placed the 170 stores for sale at $100 million in 2011 but eventually settled for $70 million in 2012. The sale represents significant loss of value linked to self-inflicted damage of the AllPhone trademark.

                              Cluster 2: Marketing and Advertising

The critical key phrases belonging to cluster 2 are marketing conduct, evidence, and product advertising. There remains substantial risk for franchises in the area of advertising and marketing that cannot be underestimated as the following cases demonstrate (Fig. 5, Cluster 2). Advertising and marketing are essential elements of the ACCC’s Australian Franchising of Conduct listed under the Australian Trade Practices Regulations [22]. First, advertising is used by the franchisee, under authority of the franchisor, to advertise under the franchisor’s registered trademark [22], s1. Marketing covers the allocation of collaborative funds (including advertising) that are managed by contract to promote the collective of franchisees and the franchisors as a distinctive brand [22], s6. Over the last decade, there have been several significant cases related to franchise marketing and advertising that offer strategic guidance. The earliest case of the decade occurred in 2005: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chaste Corporation Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2005] FCA 1212 (‘TRIMit’). The TRIMit case involved a pyramid scheme, which was classified as a franchise under law by the applicant ACCC (but claimed by the 10 respondents simply to be a distributor agreement for a retail chain). The respondents created various trusts with the sole intent and purpose to create a pool of eager area managers, who in turn would recruit other area managers, to pay a fee for the rights to regionally distribute an untested weight loss drug. TRIMit was falsely represented as approved and effective by global medical authorities and registered by the Therapeutic Goods administration [19]. In reality, TRIMit was as effective as a placebo and was sold to distributors for $20 a bottle and to consumers for $50. The scheme, combining promises of national advertising, was halted by an ACCC injunction. The scheme was devised to enrich the respondents by inducing managers to pay an up-front $40,000 advertising fee and to buy useless inventory (TRIMit [2005] FCA 1212 at [192]). The case was settled with $600,000 in fines against Chaste Corporation and an additional 3 respondents (including a barrister struck off the register) paying $300,000 in fines. Fortunately, the corporate owner, a serial fraudster, was caught again in 2011 by the ACCC for sales of SensaSlim weight loss spray.

The second case of interest is the 2011 Australian Federal Court case: Easyway Australia Pty Ltd v Infinite Plus Pty [2011] FCA 351 (‘Easyway®’), concerning deceptive advertising [21], ss 51A, 52, 80). The third case involves the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd [2011] FCA 1407 (‘Harvey Norman’) and catalogue distribution which involves misleading and deceptive conduct [21], ss 76E, 80, 86C. Easyway® was first to market in Australia in 2001 and expanded to a franchise of 66 outlets by 2011 ([2011] FCA 351, 1). The franchise product was bubble-milk tea, a popular drink that includes small brown colored taro balls at the bottom third of the take-away drink cup. A rival to the Easyway franchise (Chatime, owned by Infinite Plus) entered the Sydney market in 2009 and targeted stores in the Sydney Chinatown. Chatime hired Wai Wai marketing ([2011] FCA 351, 3) to create a brochure with the intention of drawing customers away from Easyway. The brochure used a play-on-words centered of the registered trademark where “the easy way” was construed as a lifestyle choice that conflicted, expressed, and implied that the products offered by Easyway were of poor quality, not tasty, not fresh, and unhealthy using a series of side-by-side pictorial comparisons ([2011] FCA 351, 9). For example, the brochure created by Wai Wai marketing depicted a picture of concentrated orange juice in a container with the caption “THE EASY WAY” next to a picture of freshly squeezed orange juice in a glass labeled “THE FRESH WAY.” Chatime was portrayed to represent a high quality, tasty, and fresh alternative. Chatime distributed these brooklets labeled “Top Secret” at their franchise stores and as inserts in the Citywalker, a Chinese language advertising newspaper distributed daily with a circulation exceeding 50,000 copies ([2011] FCA 351, 37). The ruling showed that misleading and deceptive advertising was used, an injunction was put in place to stop circulation, and corrective advertising was ordered. The evidence provided by Chatime was found to be “unconvincing, contrived, and implausible” ([2011] FCA 351, 81). The final conclusion reached was that “Chatime’s advertising was false, damaging, and necessitated corrective advertising” ([2011] FCA 351, 101–103).

Misleading catalogue marketing dominates the conduct of the Harvey Norman case. Harvey Norman was charged under the Trade Practices Act (‘TPA’) (1974) and the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’), [2011] FCA 1407 [1–3]. Harvey Norman is a well-known Australian trademark and operates both chain stores, retail franchises, and a website. The case concerns the sale and promotion of a new 3D television during the rugby league grand finals (September and October 2010) by Harvey Norman retailers and franchisers ([2011] FCA 1407 [8]). Although the rugby finals were to be broadcast in 3D format only in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Sydney, and Perth, catalogue advertisements for the TV sets were posted on the website. Catalogues were distributed across the entire Harvey Norman retail network including postcodes where it was impossible to receive 3D broadcasts. Franchisee revenues for over $2 million were gained for sales of over 819 3D TVs from consumers outside of the broadcast area who were misled and deceived to believe that they could watch the rugby finals using the new technology ([2011] FCA 1407 [48]). The penalty imposed by the ACCC ([2011] FCA 1407 [68]) amounted to $1,250,000 for the TPA and ACL violations. In addition, Harvey Norman had to place a corrective notice on their website and place corrective advertisements in every State and Territory where a newspaper was used to distribute the 3D catalogue advertisement stating “Corrective notice for false or misleading conduct in relation to Harvey Norman catalogues.” Given the nation-wide circulation of the corrective advertisements, the trademark and the reputation of Harvey Norman and all affiliated franchisees were damaged.

                              Cluster 3: Trademark Infringement, Oppositions, Class Limits, and Removals

The cluster 3 cases, described by key terms such as trade mark, logo, registration, and intention, are best summarized as trademark infringement litigation cases. The trademark infringement and oppositions include seven cases and are broadly referred to as the “Use or Lose” cases. These cases include Le Desire Pty Ltd v Candle Franchise Systems Pty (2005) 68 IPR 615 (‘Le Desire’) where a trademark opposition held and the Le Desire trademark was not registered under s58 (identical trademark) and s59 (no intention to use) of the Trade Marks Act [20] (‘TM Act’). Meredith Corporation v Better Pets and Gardens Pty Ltd (2008) 80 IPR 385 is a similar case but argued that the figurative trademark for a pet and garden retail franchise was deceptively similar and misleading according to the TM Act, s43, a lack of intention to use s59, and a trademark similar to a trademark with a reputation s60. The opposition failed and Better Pets and Gardens franchise prevailed over the internationally famous Better Homes and Garden magazine. MDI International Pty Ltd v Trio Brothers [2010] FCA 486 (‘MDI’, ‘Trio’) is an infringement case where the applicant MDI, a wholesale distributor, supplied novelty items and glassware to over 3000 retailers and franchisers across Australia. The Trio wholesale company began to pass-off products into MDI’s retail channel at lower prices that infringed on the “Tallulah” registered trademark. MDI was selling products with a retail turnover in excess of $11 million dollars per annum. The decision by the Queensland Federal Court to protect the MDI trademark was significant and demonstrated fast court decisions to protect trademarks.


                        Optical 88 Limited v Optical 88 Pty Limited [2010] FCA 1380 (‘88®’, ‘88TM’) is an important case of trademarks lost due to non-use of two registered trademarks. The Hong Kong owner 88® (and case applicant) registered Optical 88 Australian trademarks beginning in 1989 and used a descriptive word “optical” combined with Chinese characters indicating the name of their franchise stores. The sound of “88” is similar to “prosperity” when pronounced in Cantonese, a popular and lucky word. 88® is a global franchisor and chain store operator with over 200 outlets and more than 20years history of offering optometry product retailing and services in Hong Kong, Canada, China, Thailand, Macau, and Singapore ([2010] FCA 1380 [14]). 88TM (the respondent) was a Sydney limited partnership and optometry practice claimed to be using a deceptively similar business name to 88® since 1984. Being sued, 88TM counter-sued. Based on Australian Copyright Act [3], the judge ruled that there was no trademark or copyright infringement by 88TM, and removed two 88® trademarks from the register for non-use in the categories overlapping with 88TM ([2010] FCA 1380 [434]–[436]). In order for a registered owner of a trademark to preserve their IP rights, it is necessary to conduct businesses in the registered classes. By taking legal action without proper planning against the 88TM, 88® lost not only the infringement suit but also two key trademarks in the Australian market.

A similar case to Optical 88 is Suyen Corporation v Americana International Ltd [2010] FCA 638 (‘Suyen’, ‘Americana’). The respondent Americana opposed Suyen’s trademark Bench Body in class 25 and wanted their mark limited to class 35 (advertising and business management) using ss 58, 59 and 60 of the Trade Marks Act [20], ([2010] FCA 638 [28]). Suyen, a global firm with over 3,000,000 retail clothing, shoes, and accessory items sold in over 500 stores and franchises, was also settling lawsuits with Americana in the US. Recognized as the largest clothing manufacturer in the Philippines, Suyen’s appeal case overturned Americana’s claim under s59 (applicant not intending to use the trademark under class 25, [2010] FCA 638 [138]). The argument that Suyen did not intend to use the trademark in Australia was rejected based on their prior international reputation and global franchise expansion providing goods under all categories of class 25. Bench Body was successfully registered under class 25 by Suyen to include clothing, boots, shoes, and slippers.


                        NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading Co v British American Tobacco Australia Services [2011] FCA 1051 (‘Sumatra’, ‘BAT’) was a high-stakes brand logo case. BAT was most concerned with ss 43, 44, and 60 of the Act where consumers were likely to be deceived and confused with their brand Lucky Strikes that had a considerable reputation in Australia. Since Australians tend to use slang to abbreviate their requests for products (Luckies for Lucky Strike), and given the vast network of retailers and franchisors distributing cigarettes across Australia, there was concern that the brands of Sumatra (Lucky Draw and Lucky Dream) were substantially similar and deceptively similar. There was also concern that the fast turnover in the retail convenience marketplace would inevitably lead to the wrong products being sold when the consumer requested a pack of Luckies. BAT was successful in having class 34 for Lucky Draw and Lucky Dream reduced to ashtrays, lighters, matches, and smokers’ articles and not including any products of manufactured tabacco.

The case Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gym-Mark Inc [2013] ATMO 15 (‘Toddler’, Gym-Mark’) is similar to the case of 88® but instead of complete removal for trademark non-use, the hearing officer re-wrote the class descriptions of the registered trademark to exclude items that were not likely to be used. Toddler was legitimately using its copyright and name for advertising but not selling products under trademark class 16 including instructional and teaching materials, children’s books, newsletters and pamphlets. Under the much broader class 35, the hearing officer agreed that there were no retails sales and excluded from trademark registration all plastic materials for packaging, personal organizers, clothing, toys, footwear, games, soaps, cosmetics, toiletries, food products, bags, bookbinding material, artists’ materials, paint brushes, adhesives for stationery or household purposes, printers’ type, and printing blocks ([2013] ATMO 15 [34–35]).

                              Cluster 4: A Large Set of Homogeneous Litigation Cases

The twenty-one cases in this cluster are analyzed using a concept evolution approach ([12]). Instead of reviewing each case in terms of individual legislative impact, an assumption is made. Cluster 4 is large with many similar litigation cases (Fig. 6
                        ). The similarities between the case documents are indicated in the links labeled with percentage values (as depicted and described in Fig. 5). The cases are homogeneous and the similarity of case deliberations and outcomes indicate a well regulated system for franchises and trademarks in Australia. For example, if the same cluster-based approach was used for a least developed market or new World Trade Organization member then the results would likely yield a wide range of smaller clusters representing heterogeneous legal disputes frequently observed in a newly evolving legal market. Assuming the laws of least developed nations are insufficiently harmonized with developed economies, then there will be unforeseen litigation hazards for franchisors in these markets. The standard approach used by retailers entering a new WTO member country or a developing country is to build up a wholly owned retail chain rather than a franchise [24]. The legal hazard is simply too great and the courts do not have the laws or prior cases to use as references to settle disputes. Thus, proceeding on this assumption, the cluster is deconstructed to represent a lattice of frequently occurring concepts across the 21 cases. For example, the key phrase franchise agreement underlies all cases in Cluster 4 followed by evidence and then franchisee. These key words and phrases stem from disputes with the franchisor, contracts, sales, leases, customers, fees, income, the premises, or contract clauses. Of greater value to potential franchisers wishing to enter the Australia market is the test for time related evolution trends in general franchise and trademark litigation over the last ten years (early five years versus current five years). From the total counts of the above mentioned keywords across the early years and current five years, there is no significant change in litigation key terms and concepts. The litigation trends and their characteristics based on term frequencies supports the assumption that over the last decade the majority of franchise and trademark litigation cases are stable and similar and not unexpected for a well regulated market. Whereas clusters 1, 2, and 3 characterize unique aspects of the market, cluster 4 demonstrates regulatory stability. There is a stable system of laws operating to regulate the Australian franchise and trademark marketplace that is minimizing case anomalies and litigation hazards. Owners of a successful franchise purchased abroad will face little hazard entering the Australian market. However, the franchise must pay attention to the four critical clusters to better understand and avoid the mistakes documented by this report.

In summary, four clusters are distinctively identified for the collective litigation intelligence of the Australia retail franchise and trademark cases. Cluster 1 consists of franchise contract injunctions, transferal and cessation. Cluster 2 is characterized as the agreement disputes related to marketing and advertising issues. Cluster 3 consists of cases related to trademark infringement, oppositions, class limits, and removals. And, finally, cluster 4 is the largest and the most general of the clusters. Being so, Cluster 4 is used to test whether there are time related trends to Australia franchise and trademark litigation over the last ten years. This cluster was different from the first three clusters in the sense that the topics covered were broadly distributed but tightly related to franchisors, franchisees, and general inter-party case disputes and applications.

After cluster analysis, concept evolution analysis is used to establish linkages and relationships between cases over time. The algorithm for deriving the concept evolution lattice is presented using the following pseudo code (with explanations shown between double slashes, //). The pseudo code, once translated into a computer program, can automatically generate nodes to represent the litigation documents and the links between the nodes that are conceptually related with commonly occurring key terms. A legal document in a given domain cluster, where more frequent key terms are found, is interpreted as being more concept specific, i.e., a narrow sub-class. A legal document in the same domain cluster with fewer key terms is interpreted as being a more general legal case and is called a super-class with wider concept coverage. Furthermore, the rationale behind the constants 0.3 and 0.6 in the pseudo-coded concept evolution lattice facilitates discrete and brief illustrative views of the legal case evolution trends. The legal document correlations, generated in the legal case clustering process, are converted into simplified indexes showing the correlation strength between any two legal case documents across three levels, which are no-link, weak link, and strong link correspond to the original correlation values being less than 0.3, between 0.3 and 0.6, and greater than 0.6. Thus, the circular legal case concept evolution trends for all clusters are plotted with some cases (represented by nodes) being strongly linked with solid lines and others being weakly linked with dotted lines.

In the previous section, four clusters are found and their context interpreted. Cluster 1 has only two litigation cases and cluster 2 has 5 cases while 3 of them being closely related to ACCC v Chaste with very similar complaints. Thus, clusters 3 and 4, consisting of more diversified cases over the recent decade, are more meaningful for further analysis using the CLI concept evolution lattice. As shown in Fig. 7
                        , the CLI concept evolution of cluster 3 with 7 litigation cases and their concept links are illustrated. In the cluster, the earliest case is #6 and the latest case is #34. Cases #6 (Le Desire v Candle, 2005) and #28 (Sumatra v BAT, 2011) represent a general legal context, while #21 (MDI v Trio, 2010), #22 (88® v 88TM), and #34 (Tgymbaroo v GymMark, 2013) are recent cases that are specifically confined to lesser issues of legal concern. Furthermore, Fig. 8
                         shows the CLI concept evolution of cluster 4 with 21 litigation cases and their concept linkages. The nodes and links between nodes are automatically derived using the pseudo code executed as a computer program. For franchisers that are interested in litigation trends related to trademark infringement, reference should be made to recent cases such as #20 (KFC v Fair Work Australia Full Bench, 2010), #29 (Paws v Pets, 2012), #31 (Oliver Brown v NSW 2012), and #32 (Winnebago v Knott, 2012).

The past-decade of Australia franchise and trademark litigations are clustered and interpreted in the previous sub-sections. The concept evolution lattices are further illustrated in a circular viewgraph as shown in Fig. 9
                        . The time-based modified formal concept analysis uses the radius of the circle to represent the litigation cases as they have occurred over time. The nodes located near the center of the circle represent the earlier litigation cases. The nodes plotted toward the outer circle represent recent legal actions. The lines, linking the nodes and identifying the concept linkages between the related cases, clearly show the nature of Australian franchise and trademark case litigation evolving over time. By tracing the case evolution trends, CLI e-discovery provides a systematic and scientific way of visualizing litigation trends and their most plausible development in the near future. For instance, cluster 4 evolution has been interpreted, based on the key term occurrences, as an indication that Australia has a well regulated retail franchise market and the litigations are conducted in accordance with evidences of various domain aspects, such as contracts, sales, premises, and fees.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS@&#

This research develops a generalizable Collective Litigation Intelligence (CLI) e-discovery methodology and demonstrates the approach in practice using the case study of Australia’s franchise and trademark litigation cases. The results of CLI e-discovery for the case study show that Australia has a well regulated retail marketplace with solid legislation to support franchises and protect trademarks. There are three important points derived from this research to be considered when entering the Australian market as a franchisor. First, derived from cluster 1 cases, there should be a special relationship formed between a franchisor and a franchisee that generates positive goodwill toward the trademark. If the agreement is well managed, business prospers and customers become brand loyal. However, when the franchisor is unscrupulous, damages the name of the franchise, or dilutes the profits and reputations of all franchisees, then franchising in general gains a bad reputation and the brand of the franchise loses value. Second, as shown by cluster 2’s characteristics, franchise marketing and advertising become more complicated and litigation-prone as the franchise expands and matures. Third, the “Use or Lose” cases of Cluster 3 portrays the difficulty of protecting not only the franchise trademark but the importance of using the franchise trademarks correctly under their registered classifications. Australia, in conclusion, provides a great opportunity for franchisors with a stable system of laws that minimizes litigation hazards.

The use of the keywords helps to define the most critical legal issues and the subsequent disputes over the past decade. Using the CLI methodology, a brand management company purchasing a successful franchise can rapidly explore global markets to rank the litigation risks and rapidly train franchisees how to best operate in targeted global markets. The method provides a new strategic tool for franchise purchase and expansion that greatly reduces the burden on the legal team to physically analyze large numbers of cases, from varying jurisdictions, using an automatic and objective method of analysis. Thus, error is reduced, the output yields greater validity, and the costs of global franchise expansion are substantially reduced. The CLI methodology, as illustrated in the generalized process flow in Fig. 3, can be applied in other domains of litigation intelligence analysis. Nonetheless, the IT-enabled CLI system for legal ontology engineering and e-discovery of other litigation domains should be further studied in detail to ensure the robustness of the proposed methodology.
