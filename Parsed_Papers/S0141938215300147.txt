                  Blue color organic/polymeric light emitting diodes are very important because they can be used for tri-color display applications, fluorescence imaging, and exciting yellow phosphor for generating white light for general illumination. But the efficiency of blue organic/polymeric light emitting diodes is considerably low due to their large band gap that requires higher energy for effective emission. In this paper we report the enhancement in polyfluorene blue organic light emitting diodes with a polymer nano-composite hole transport layer. Blue light emitting diode based on polyfluorene as an emissive layer and poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)–titanium dioxide nanocomposite as the hole transport layer were fabricated and studied. Different concentrations of titanium dioxide nanoparticles were doped in poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) in the hole transport layer and the performance of the devices were studied. Significant enhancement in the blue peak at 430nm of polyfluorene has been observed with increase in concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles in the hole transport layer. The turn on voltage of the device has also been found to improve significantly with the incorporation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the hole transport layer. The optimized concentration of titanium dioxide in the hole transport layer for most efficient device has been found to 15wt.%.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great attention in research and industry for the last two decades. Major applications of OLEDs are in color display devices and general lighting due to their capability to emit light with high efficiency and the production of homogeneous large area emission on glass as well as flexible substrates. There are mainly two types of light emitting materials in OLEDs, i.e., small molecule based organic compounds and long chain polymers. Small molecule based OLEDs are fabricated using thermal evaporation techniques and other expensive fabrication techniques. On the other hand, polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) have gained special importance due to the ease in fabrication using solution processing techniques, such as, spin coating and inkjet printing. A considerable amount of research has been carried out in the synthesis of variety of polymers for light emission applications, out of which polyparaphenylenes (PPVs) and polyfluorenes (PFO) are well known materials. Polyfluorenes are particularly attractive class of blue light emitting polymers which exhibits high luminescence quantum yields [1]. High brightness with fairly high thermal stability is one of their distinguishing features [1]. Polyfluorene consists of pairs of phenyl rings joined together by a methylene bridge which serves to lock the ring pairs into a coplanar arrangement and can be functionalized without distorting the torsional angle between the fluorene units [2]. This feature has made polyfluorene derivatives attractive as emissive materials in displays as well as general purpose lighting. Blue color emitting PLEDs are very important because they can be used for color display applications, fluorescence imaging, exciting yellow phosphor for generating white light and other sensor applications. Therefore, efficient and long life-time blue light emitting PLEDs are very important for these applications.

But the main problem with the polyfluorene family based PLEDs is that they are not stable and inefficient during the operation as a blue color emitting light source [3]. Further, they suffer from an unwanted green emission band (450–550nm) along with the desired blue emission (∼430nm). Therefore, these devices do not emit pure blue light which is required in color displays for high color gamut, white light generation and fluorescence imaging. The origin of the green emission is attributed to either intermolecular excimer formation [3,4] between polyfluorene chains or the presence of fluorenone defects in the polymer backbone [3,5]. Excimers are dimerised units in the excited state that emit at lower energies. This excimer emission affects the color of the emission and the lifetime of the light emitting diodes [3,4]. The effect of excimer emission at lower wavelengths can be suppressed if the blue color emission is enhanced. We have found that efficient blue emission can be achieved from a polyfluorene based OLED using polymer nano-composite hole transport layer (HTL) in the modified device architecture.

Recently, it has been reported that efficiency as well as stability of OLEDs can be enhanced by introducing TiO2 nanoparticles in HTL [6]. TiO2 is considered as good photo-catalytic semiconductor due to its large band gap and low hole/electron recombination probability. Some other properties which make it suitable to use in HTL are high charge conductivity, good stability, low cost and nontoxic behavior. Investigations of polymeric composite films using TiO2 nanoparticles has been reported by Dinh et al. [6] in the fabrication of PLED using MEH-PPV as emissive layer. Asbahi et al. [7] introduced TiO2 nanoparticles in PFO and demonstrated the enhancement of green color light peaking around 530nm and suppressing the blue peaks at 450nm and 428nm. The efficient green color emitting electro-phosphorent OLEDs have already been fabricated, such as, based on Ir(ppy)3 organo-metallic complexes, in which nearly 100% internal efficiency has been achieved by means of harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons [8]. Therefore, it is the blue color OLED/PLED devices which requires more improvement in EL enhancement, color purity, I–V characteristics and life-time. In this paper we demonstrate the enhancement in polyfluorene based blue OLEDs with polymer nano-composite HTL. The effect of modified HTL has been studied, in which poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was doped with TiO2 nanoparticles to improve its hole injection properties in a blue emitting PFO device. Different concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles were doped in PEDOT:PSS and optimum doping concentration was found to obtain an efficient PFO device with enhanced blue emission at 430nm and with suppressed green emission at 500nm, thus leading toward color purity. Experimental results of blue color enhancement, I–V characteristics and enhancement in transmission spectra are reported.

PEDOT:PSS of low conductivity grade (1S/cm) dispersed in water and titanium dioxide (TiO2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Poly(9,9-dioctylfluoenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp., Taiwan. All chemicals were used as purchased. TiO2 nanoparticles (size ∼25nm) doped PEDOT:PSS was used as HTL. Doping was done in different weight% (0–20wt.%). Measured amount of TiO2 nanoparticles in water were sonicated for 6h and then mixed with PEDOT:PSS polymer by continuous stirring. The prepared mixture of polymer and nanoparticles was kept on stirring for 1h. Hole transport material was spin coated on the cleaned indium titanium oxide (ITO) coated glass plates and dried in vacuum oven at 120°C for 1h. Above this emissive layer of poly(9,9-dioctylfluoenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) was spin coated using Apex digital spin coater at 900rpm for 100 s and annealed at 100°C for 1h. LiF/Al were thermally evaporated to make electrode over the emissive layer. Devices 1–5 were made with pure PFO as emissive layer and TiO2 doped HTL as follows (see Table 1
                     ).

By varying the amount of TiO2 in HTL, the optimum doping concentration was found to be 15% for the most efficient device. Photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements were done using spectroflurometer (Shimadzu) and emission spectrometer (Ocean Optics). I–V characteristics were measured using source meter (Keithley-model 2400). Film surface was analyzed using Carl Zeiss scanning electron microscopy and transmission spectra were recorded using UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model 2600).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Fig. 1
                      shows the SEM images of the PEDOT:PSS with and without TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on glass. It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that the film is uniform which consists of PEDOT:PSS layer only. On the other hand, it is clear from Fig. 1(b) that TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in PEDOT:PSS. In anatase phase of titanium dioxide the atoms align themselves in tetragonal geometry. Valance band of titanium dioxide contains sp3d hybrid orbitals which are made by the intermixing of 2p orbital of oxygen and 3d orbital of titanium, whereas conduction band is made up of only 3d orbitals of titanium. When electron jumps from valance band to conduction band they enter from hybridized state to purely 3d state leaving positive charge carriers, i.e., holes behind [9]. This process reduces the electron–hole recombination probability in nano-composite layer and hence holes move from HTL to emissive layer of polymer (PFO). This charge carrier property of TiO2 results in better HTL for PFO device.


                     Fig. 2
                     (a) shows the EL spectra of the controlled PFO device with PEDOT:PSS as HTL at various applied voltages. Fig. 2(b) shows the EL spectra of an OLED with 15wt.% TiO2 doped PEDOT:PSS as HTL. There are three distinguished peaks in the EL spectra of PFO device at 432nm, 460nm and 488nm. It can be seen that the EL peak at 432nm is enhanced significantly using TiO2 doped PEDOT:PSS as HTL. The spectra in Fig. 2(a) and (b) were normalized at 14V applied voltage as depicted in Fig. 2(c), which shows that the height of secondary peaks at 460nm and 488nm has been reduced significantly in the case of TiO2 doped HTL device, thus leading toward color purity. Similar measurements were also taken for other devices with different concentrations of TiO2. Enhancement in electroluminescence with TiO2–PEDOT:PSS nano-composite as HTL was observed. For comparison, EL spectra of different concentrations of TiO2 in HTL at 14V are plotted in Fig. 3
                     . As the TiO2 concentration was increased in the HTL, a significant enhancement in blue EL emission was observed and the results are shown in Fig. 3. It is clearly seen that the spectral peak at 430nm is enhanced on increasing the TiO2 concentration from 0 to 20wt.%.

Blue emitters based on fluorine chromophores hardly exhibit narrow EL peak emissions [10,11]. In the present work, the device with 15wt.% TiO2 doped HTL exhibits FWHM of 40nm in EL emission which is a quite good value for device with PFO as an emitter.

Current density (J) versus voltage (V) measurements are depicted in Fig. 4
                     . It can be seen that, device 1 without any doping of TiO2 in HTL has high turn on voltage. The operating voltage was found to improve from 11V to 7V @30Cd/m​2 by doping up to 15wt.% TiO2 in PEDOT:PSS. On further increase in doping concentration of TiO2 nano-particles the device performance deteriorated with a operating voltage of 8V @30Cd/m2​. On comparison with the EL spectra the electroluminescence was enhanced on increasing the doping concentration of TiO2 in HTL up to 20wt.%.

Luminance versus voltage (L–V) characteristics is shown in Fig. 5
                     . Luminance was found to enhance with increasing the doping concentration of TiO2 in HTL. Maximum luminance was observed in the case of device 5 by 20wt.% doping of TiO2 in HTL and decreased with decreasing the doping concentration of TiO2 in the case of devices 1–4. However, device 4 with 15wt.% doping concentration having slightly lower luminance as compared to device 5 was found to be better than other devices due to its lower turn on voltage. Furthermore, device 4 was found to be more stable as compared to device 5 with 20wt.% doping which also degraded much faster. The comparison of the performance of the devices with different concentrations of TiO2 are given in Table 2
                     .

The performance of the device was found to increase with the increasing TiO2 content in terms of enhanced current density and efficiency values. The operating voltage for luminance of 100cd/m2 for different TiO2 concentration values are given in Table 2. In the device with 15wt.% TiO2 in PEDOT:PSS, 100cd/m2 was achieved at 9.2V as compared to 12.6V required in the case of controlled device with 0wt.% TiO2. As shown in Fig. 6
                     , the devices have also been analyzed in terms of current efficiency and power efficiency. The power efficiency as well as current efficiency of the device was found to increase with increasing content of TiO2 in the HTL. The device with 15wt.% TiO2 in HTL exhibits an efficiency of 3.62lm/W as compared to 0.36lm/W at 6.5V obtained in case of controlled device with no TiO2 at all.

The current efficiency increases as the concentration of TiO2 is increased from 15wt.% to 20wt.% in HTL. However, in the case of device 5 the driving voltage increases which results in reduced power efficiency as compared to device 4. The results can be attributed to non uniformity of the film with increased doping percentages of TiO2 in HTL. As the doping of TiO2 was increased beyond 15wt.%, the uniformity of the film decreased. This resulted in saturated emission and reduced efficiency in case of 20wt.% TiO2 doped devices at lower operating voltages. At higher operating voltages the efficiencies were slightly better for 20wt.% TiO2 doped devices (See Table 2) but the color purity deteriorated. Therefore, the studies were limited to 20wt.% TiO2 concentration in HTL.

Transmittance studies of the TiO2 doped HTL films have also been carried out as shown in Fig. 7
                     . It can be seen that transmittance in visible region (400–700nm) of doped HTL is better than undoped PEDOT:PSS. TiO2 nanoparticles do not interfere with visible region because they absorb in ultraviolet region and therefore do not affect the color of OLED while used as HTL. Moreover since the transparency of the HTL increases with increase in doping concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles the enhancement in blue emission is observed.

Although, TiO2 is a good charge transporting material but it cannot be used in emissive layer (EML) of PFO due to its lower recombination probability. To see the effect of TiO2 in EML device having configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS+15wt.% TiO2/PFO+5wt.% TiO2/Al was fabricated. Decrease in overall EL and device stability was observed for the above configuration which is contradictory to the previous work reported by Asbahi et al. [7] where the enhancement in green emission was observed on incorporating TiO2 nano-particles in the emissive layer of PFO. It has already been demonstrated that polyfluorene photodegrades in the presence of oxygen [10,12] and so quenching of luminescence was observed using TiO2–PFO nano-composite.


                     Fig. 8
                      shows the energy band diagram of OLED with hybrid HTL of TiO2 doped polymer nano-composite. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that HOMOs of TiO2, PEDOT:PSS and PFO are at 7.46eV, 5.2eV and 5.6eV, respectively. Consequently the HOMO of the polymer nano-composite must be above 5.2eV therefore, leading to the ease of charge transport. The TiO2 nanoparticles may cause efficient p-type doping of the PFO layer through electron transfer from the polymer’s HOMO to the partly occupied trap states of the TiO2 as these states are always present within the band gap of the TiO2 due to oxygen vacancies and other defects of the TiO2 surface. The roughness of the films also increases on addition of TiO2 in HTL. This results in enhanced interfacial surface area between the HTL and emissive layer. This is finally responsible for the enhancement in hole injection and transport which is manifested in terms of increased efficiency values with the increasing content of TiO2 in the HTL. Moreover, the observed improvement in electroluminescence may be also due to the enhancement in light extraction since the hybrid HTL may increase the out-coupling efficiency. Thus the enhancement in the electroluminescence by incorporating TiO2 nanoparticles in the HTL can be due to the combined effect of improved injection of charge carriers from the anode as well as improvement in light out-coupling due to the scattering of light from the modified charge transport layer. Li/Al was used as cathode having work function of 4.2eV which is of course quite far from the LUMO level of PFO which is at 2.85eV. In this work we have analyzed the device performance using the modified HTL which is TiO2–PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite and so we have compared it with the same device configuration as for device 1. However, to obtain a very efficient device the electron injecting contact should also be ohmic, which is possible using Ba or Cs2CO3 to match the proper work function of the cathode with the LUMO of PFO.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

It has been found that the blue emission of a PFO device is enhanced using modified HTL using TiO2 nanoparticles. TiO2 nanoparticles not only help in injection of charges as inferred from the I–V characteristics but also improves the transmittance of the hole injection layer as confirmed from the transmission measurements. Nano-composite HTL also helps in light extraction due to the nanoparticles embedded in the layer as out-coupling of light by scattering in OLEDs is well known. The enhancement in blue color EL and charge transfer characteristics might find applications for tri-color display applications, fluorescence imaging, and for exciting yellow phosphor for generating white light as the pure blue color is very important for these applications.
