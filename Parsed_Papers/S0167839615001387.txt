                  This survey paper describes the role of splines in geometry and topology, emphasizing both similarities and differences from the classical treatment of splines. The exposition is non-technical and contains many examples, with references to more thorough treatments of the subject.
               
            

The goal of this survey paper is to describe how splines arise in geometry and topology. Geometric splines usually appear under the name GKM theory after Goresky–Kottwitz–MacPherson, who developed them to compute what is called the cohomology ring of a geometric object. Geometers and analysts ask many of the same questions about splines: what is their dimension? can we identify a basis? can we find explicit formulas for the elements of the basis? However geometric constraints can change the tone of these questions: the splines may satisfy various symmetries or have a basis satisfying certain conditions. And some questions are specific to geometric splines: geometers particularly care about the multiplication table with respect to a given basis.

In Section 1 we discuss GKM theory, followed in Section 2 by some important families of geometric examples, some of which are well-known to students of analytic splines and some of which may be useful in future. Section 3 sketches some techniques that are natural from the perspective of a geometer/topologist, including Morse flows and symmetries that come from geometric representation theory. Finally in Section 4 we generalize splines to a more abstract ring setting, both as a useful conceptual framework and because it provides new combinatorial tools.

This paper is targeted at researchers in geometric design, especially those with an analytic background. Our aim is to give an overview of theoretical tools and techniques from geometry and topology; we often illustrate concepts by example and refer to the literature for details on technical aspects. A reader with a different mathematical perspective may be interested in surveys like Holm (2008), Tymoczko (2005, 2008).

Cohomology is an algebraic gadget associated to a geometric object X that encodes various properties of X. Among other things, the cohomology of X indicates the dimension of X, the number of connected components (how many separate pieces X has), how many holes X has, whether X has singularities, and how different subspaces of X intersect.

We could treat very general kinds of geometric objects but for simplicity in this survey we take X to be a compact complex manifold. When we say that cohomology is an “algebraic gadget” the most general interpretation is that cohomology is a ring. In the cases of interest here, the cohomology ring is actually an algebra, namely a vector space in which one can multiply vectors. The technical condition we assume is that cohomology has coefficients in 
                     
                        Q
                        ,
                        R
                     , or especially 
                        C
                     .

In fact we will consider an enhanced version of cohomology called T-equivariant cohomology. Equivariant cohomology has strictly more information than ordinary cohomology yet surprisingly can be easier to compute. In our case T is a torus, namely the group

We require T to act on X “nicely”, which for us means:

                              X is “equivariantly formal”


                              X is a smooth complex projective algebraic variety

We refer to this set of hypotheses as the GKM hypotheses.

Consider the collection of lines through the origin in the plane, which we call

                         we saw that every one-dimensional T-orbit essentially looked like the one-dimensional T-orbit in

                        . In fact the closure of each one-dimensional T-orbit is exactly

                              Suppose X and T satisfy the GKM hypotheses and O is any one-dimensional T-orbit O in X. Then the closure of O is homeomorphic to

                              and consists of O together with two T-fixed points N and S (essentially the north and south poles).
                           

This means we can record the data of T-fixed points and one-dimensional orbits more concisely: as a graph.

Billera first used dual graphs in the context of splines, proving that the ring of splines on the dual graph is isomorphic to

                           (
                           Δ
                           )
                         when Δ is a hereditary pure polyhedral complex (Billera, 1988). (Hereditary complexes are essentially those without holes or pinchpoints; for instance any triangulation of a convex region in

                         is hereditary. For details see e.g. Billera and Rose, 1991, 1992.)

The GKM perspective uses graphs because of the historical evolution of the result. Pieces of Goresky–Kottwitz–MacPherson's approach predate them significantly. The T-orbits on X had been studied extensively in different contexts: when X is a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian T-action there's a natural map 
                           μ
                           :
                           X
                           →
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         called the moment map that linearizes the action of the torus, “straightening out” the torus orbits. Kostant noticed that the image of the moment map for one important manifold was a convex polytope (Kostant, 1970), leading to work by Atiyah, Guillemin–Sternberg, and Heckman that collectively proved that the image of the moment map is a union of convex polytopes (Atiyah, 1982; Guillemin and Sternberg, 1982; Heckman, 1982). In fact the points and 1-dimensional faces of the moment map form precisely the moment graph that arises in GKM theory.

Another crucial step of the GKM proof is to construct a map from the equivariant cohomology 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 ⁎
                              
                           
                           (
                           X
                           )
                         into a product of polynomial rings. It turns out that the equivariant cohomology of a point is simply 
                           C
                           [

                         and in fact the natural inclusion

                           :

                        . This map plays an especially important role in symplectic geometry and topology, in the work of Kirwan (1984), among others. Chang–Skjelbred analyzed the image of this map in very general settings, where the image is determined by a complicated spectral sequence (Chang and Skjelbred, 1974). One of Goresky–Kottwitz–MacPherson's deep contributions is to identify a package of GKM hypotheses for which the general picture simplifies so dramatically.

At the same time, some work on equivariant cohomology leads to the classical spline perspective, especially when X is a toric variety. Each toric variety X is associated to a polytope, making it more natural to consider piecewise polynomials on the faces of the polytope. This is what Payne (2006) and Bahri et al. (2009) do.

I have not found indication in the literature that any of these geometers or topologists were aware that they had recreated the classical notion of splines. Schenck appears to be the first person to work in both splines and equivariant cohomology (Schenck, 2012).

                           Singularities


                           For simplicity we assumed that X is a manifold. In fact GKM theory applies to many singular varieties as well, including Schubert varieties (see Sections 2.2 and 2.3 below). Geometers often find this surprising, but the GKM hypotheses reduce the calculation of equivariant cohomology to an analysis of zero- and one-dimensional orbits, where geometric singularities don't significantly arise.

Singularities in the sense of analytic splines correspond to faces like the subgraph shown in Fig. 2
                              . They have no relationship to geometric singularities of the variety X. Singular faces appear frequently in moment graphs; for instance Fig. 2 also shows the moment graph of the Grassmannian 
                                 G
                                 (

                              . Section 2.2 describes the Grassmannian in more detail; the edge-labels of the moment graph of 
                                 G
                                 (

                                 )
                               can be found in many other sources (Knutson and Tao, 2003; Tymoczko, 2005).

The difference in perspective between students of analytic splines and what we will call geometric splines affects the kinds of data we assume and the kinds of questions we ask about splines.

                                  as a module over the polynomial ring for geometric reasons.

Geometers, like analysts, want explicit formulas for bases for the space of splines. In many cases the torus action can be used to construct geometric bases or to suggest preferred forms for bases. In other cases a group action on the spline module can be used to construct representation-theoretic bases. But these constructions guarantee existence of a basis or set of splines rather than concrete descriptions that can be used in calculations. Section 2.3 says more about bases when X is a flag variety and Section 3 discusses bases in general.

Geometers care about the multiplicative structure of the ring of splines. In particular geometers want explicit multiplication tables in terms of a basis for the splines. Section 2 describes some context behind this problem in the case of ordinary and equivariant cohomology of specific families of manifolds X.

This section describes some of the most important examples for geometers and topologists. Some are already used in analytic splines; projective space turns out to be essentially the Alfeld split. We present others both to expand on the questions that concluded Section 1 and to suggest tools that may be useful within analytic splines.

We described projective space extensively in Section 1.1. The moment graph of projective space is better-known within analytic splines as the Alfeld split (Alfeld, 1984) or sometimes the Clough–Tocher split (but see the comment in Kolesnikov and Sorokina, 2014, Section 2). We are particularly grateful to Alexei Kolesnikov and Gwyneth Whieldon for pointing this out.

We describe the Alfeld split following Kolesnikov and Sorokina (2014) and Schenck (2014). Let

                               to that of the dual graph to the Alfeld split. It follows from Billera's result (Billera, 1988) that the ring of splines on the moment graph of

Grassmannians occur naturally in different geometric contexts. For instance the tangent bundle of a smooth k-dimensional manifold 
                           M
                           ⊆
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         can be thought of as a map from M to the Grassmannian 
                           G
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           n
                           )
                        . Explicitly each point 
                           p
                           ∈
                           M
                         is mapped to the k-dimensional subspace obtained by translating the tangent space to M at p to the origin.

The cohomology ring of the Grassmannian is particularly interesting. Just like we identified the one-dimensional orbits of 
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         by choosing which entries were nonzero, we can partition the Grassmannian into a natural collection of subspaces by choosing which entries in the k-dimensional planes are pivots. The sets of pivots are indexed by partitions of n and the collection of subspaces corresponding to the partition λ is called a Schubert variety. The Schubert varieties induce a basis of Schubert classes

His name is now given to Schubert calculus, which is more generally considered the study of the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian and related spaces.

                         using splines (in the form of GKM theory) (Knutson and Tao, 2003). Their proof has three steps: 1) use splines to determine the base case of a recurrence, 2) prove that any set of numbers that satisfy the base recurrence are the same; and then 3) miraculously identify a second formula that satisfies the same recurrence and thus is the same as

                        . A particularly interesting element of the proof is that while splines play a key role, it is in some sense an indirect role. Geometrically splines have proven very difficult to calculate.

Flag varieties form another important family of spaces that satisfy the GKM hypotheses. Consider the general linear group

                         invertible matrices. The subgroup of upper-triangular invertible matrices is called the Borel subgroup and typically denoted B. The flag variety is the quotient

The moment graph of the flag variety is defined as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The vertices are the permutations 
                                    
                                       
                                          S
                                       
                                       
                                          n
                                       
                                    
                                 .

There is an edge between each pair of permutations 
                                    w
                                    ↔

                                    j
                                    )
                                    w
                                  that are related by multiplication by a transposition. (Here 
                                    (
                                    i
                                    j
                                    )
                                  indicates the permutation that exchanges i and j and leaves all other numbers fixed.)

                                 . (Typically we assume 
                                    j
                                    >

There are many symmetries in the moment graph of the flag variety and in the equivariant cohomology of the flag variety. For instance, the permutation group

                                 n
                              
                           
                         acts on the vertices 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         either by left- or right-multiplication. At the same time, the group 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         also acts by permuting the variables 
                           
                              
                                 t

                           ,
                           
                              
                                 t
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 t

                        . Some of these actions extend to 
                           
                              
                                 S

                         actions on the splines, too, as we discuss in Section 3.

                         shows how the single edge (drawn in boldface) is transported around the cycle with a Möbius-like twist on the back edges (drawn with dotted lines). This is part of a general phenomenon studied extensively by Guillemin et al. (2012, 2013). Each Grassmannian

Just like projective space and Grassmannians, the flag variety has a natural collection of subvarieties called Schubert varieties that induce a basis for (ordinary and equivariant) cohomology. There is also a remarkable formula for the polynomial associated to the restriction of the equivariant Schubert class

We close this section with an open question. Recall that there is a closed formula for coefficients in the multiplication table for the cohomology

                         of each Grassmannian. Perhaps surprisingly there is no good formula for the analogue in the case of the flag variety, either in ordinary or equivariant cohomology. What does “good” mean? It means an explicit, positive formula—essentially a formula that counts some quantity rather than restating Billey's formula with inclusion/exclusion. This is a problem that has attracted enormous attention within Schubert calculus with only limited success. We suspect that the problem needs radically new tools or perspective.

In this section we describe three very natural tools for geometers and topologists working on splines. We focus on how these tools are used to identify bases for the module of splines.

It bears repeating that one significant difference from the analytic approach to splines is that geometers typically think about splines as modules over a polynomial ring rather than over the base field 
                        C
                      or 
                        R
                     . Geometers also tend to use bases of splines whose polynomials 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              u
                           
                        
                      are either zero or homogeneous of a fixed degree depending on p. This means that each module basis spline corresponds to a family of vector-space basis splines. For instance in 
                        
                           
                              S

                      while a degree-two basis element p gives rise only to itself as a vector-space basis element. (If there were degree-one basis elements p they would generally correspond to the three vector-space basis elements 
                        {
                        p
                        ,
                        x

                        p
                        }
                     .) In some settings one needs to worry about whether the module is actually free over the polynomial ring, which would imply that minimal generating sets of splines are actually bases. Spaces that satisfy the GKM hypotheses are always free modules so this is not a concern for GKM theory.

We now discuss some geometric strategies to identify module generators for splines.

Recall in what follows that geometers traditionally study 
                        
                           
                              S
                           
                           
                              ∞
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                        (
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              X
                           
                        
                        )
                      since those are the splines isomorphic to equivariant cohomology (though Section 4 describes interpretations of the ring

                              r
                           
                        
                        (

                              X
                           
                        
                        )
                     ).

Given a torus acting on a space in X, one of the most natural things for geometers and topologists to do is to push subspaces around in X using the torus. This technique goes by different names in different fields (e.g. Morse theory for analysts/topologists, Bialynicki–Birula decompositions for algebraists/geometers). Regardless of the name, the techniques have consequences for splines that can be described precisely without reference to the underlying geometry.

These techniques often use a one-dimensional torus chosen “suitably generically” from a possibly larger torus action on X. From a combinatorial perspective, choosing a one-dimensional torus corresponds to directing the edges of the graph 
                           
                              
                                 G
                              
                              
                                 X
                              
                           
                        . The “suitably generic” condition helps ensure that the directed graph is a poset, namely 
                           
                              
                                 G
                              
                              
                                 X
                              
                           
                         has no directed cycles.

These techniques give an analogue for splines of upper-triangularity, though the definition we give here is independent of geometry.


                        
                           Definition 3.1
                           Suppose that G is a directed, edge-labeled graph. A spline p on G is poset upper-triangular if there is a vertex v in the graph for which 
                                 
                                    
                                       p
                                    
                                    
                                       v
                                    
                                 
                                 ≠
                                 0
                               and 
                                 
                                    
                                       p
                                    
                                    
                                       u
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 0
                               for all vertices u in the graph without a directed path to v. (The second condition can be written 
                                 u
                                 ≯
                                 v
                               with the partial order > defined by the direction on the graph.) A basis 
                                 B
                               for the set of splines on G is a flow-up basis if its elements can be indexed with distinct vertices so that the basis elements are all poset upper-triangular.

Intuitively each element of a flow-up basis collects the points that “flow up” from a specific vertex according to the action of the torus.

For some graphs, like cycles, poset upper-triangularity is equivalent to ordinary upper-triangularity. Fig. 6
                         shows a flow-up basis for the equivariant cohomology of 
                           
                              
                                 P
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        . Each spline is denoted by a copy of the graph with vertices labeled by polynomials. For the reader's convenience, we left the edge-labels on the graph; they are indicated in grey. Flow-up bases for more general graphs do not correspond as naturally to upper-triangular bases. For instance Fig. 5 shows a flow-up basis for 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 ⁎
                              
                           
                           (
                           
                              
                                 GL
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           (
                           C
                           )
                           /
                           B
                           ,
                           C
                           )
                        . We can impose a total order on the vertices to make this basis upper-triangular, but that requires an arbitrary choice; poset upper-triangularity is the more natural condition. (For flag varieties, Grassmannians, and more general partial flag varieties, the flow-up basis is precisely the Schubert basis.)

Geometers generally require a stronger condition on flow-up classes than in Definition 3.1: that the flow-up class 
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 v
                              
                           
                         restricted to the fixed point v is the product of the labels on the edges directed out of v. Our definition applies in greater generality, discussed at greater length in Section 4.

Many natural spaces X satisfy an additional geometric condition called Palais–Smale, which ensures that if a flow-up basis exists then it is unique. Combinatorially the Palais–Smale condition says that the graph G satisfies the property that for each directed edge 
                           u
                           ↦
                           v
                         the number of edges directed out of u is greater than the number of edges directed out of v. Informally the number of out-edges increases along each path up in the graph. While the geometric Palais–Smale condition is stronger, the combinatorial Palais–Smale condition suffices to guarantee uniqueness of flow-up bases. At the same time many natural manifolds are not Palais–Smale. For instance Fig. 7
                         shows a family of manifolds called regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties parametrized by certain nondecreasing vectors recorded below each moment graph. The third example from the left is not Palais–Smale. Explicitly the vertex associated to the permutation (12) has both the flow-up class in Fig. 5 and the flow-up class whose only nonzero labels are at vertices (12) and 
                           (
                           12
                           )

                           23
                           )
                        , labeled by the polynomials 
                           
                              
                                 t

A second geometric tool for working with splines comes out of geometric representation theory. The fundamental idea is that graph automorphisms (namely bijections 
                           V
                           (
                           G
                           )
                           →
                           V
                           (
                           G
                           )
                         that preserve the adjacencies in G) sometimes preserve the spline relations as well. In this section we sketch the general philosophy using flag varieties; for a deeper discussion and more examples, see e.g. Tymoczko (2008).

Recall that the vertices in the moment graph of the flag variety are associated with the elements of the permutation group 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        . Each element v in the group 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         acts on 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         in two different ways: either by left multiplication 
                           v
                           ⋅
                           w
                           ↦
                           v
                           w
                         or by right multiplication 
                           v
                           ⁎
                           w
                           ↦
                           w
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . Both of these actions give rise to an action on splines as follows.

Right-multiplication on the vertices induces an action on the splines in the equivariant cohomology ring because the labels on the edges come from left-multiplication by transpositions. In other words the moment graph for the flag variety contains an edge 
                           (
                           i
                           j
                           )
                           w
                           ↔
                           w
                         if and only if it contains an edge 
                           (
                           i
                           j
                           )
                           w
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 1

                                 −

                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        . Fig. 8
                         shows what right-multiplication by the simple reflection (23) does to a flow-up class.

Left-multiplication of the vertex labels by (23) corresponds to exchanging labels on either side of the edges of positive slope. That does not preserve splines: for instance it would send the flow-up class of Fig. 8 to a class whose central vertical edge had

                         on the top. However if we also permute the variables by (23) the outcome is again a spline, as shown in Fig. 9
                        . (This action on polynomials appeared in Billey's formula in Section 2.3 as well.)

These geometric representations lend themselves to two different kinds of tools. The first is a collection of degree-lowering operators on the collection of splines that behaves particularly well with respect to flow-up bases. Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand and Demazure originally defined divided difference operators for flag varieties (Bernšteĭn et al., 1973; Demazure, 1973).

                         Divided difference operators are an important tool in algebraic combinatorics; for instance, part of the proof of Billey's formula is an elementary application of divided difference operators (Billey, 1999).

The second tool has been much less studied. Representations can also be used to create symmetrized bases for splines or subsets of splines. In this case the group action can be used to transport a particular polynomial around the vertices, creating splines that are fixed by the overall

Symmetrized bases are not nearly as common as flow-up bases in the literature. In one sense the construction is more algebraic than geometric since it relies on a representation on cohomology. Moreover this symmetrization only describes the whole module if the representation on splines is trivial, which is not usually the case.

                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         restricts to the splines on the Hessenberg varieties shown in Fig. 7. In general the number of symmetrized basis elements decreases as the parameter h changes, as shown in Fig. 12
                        . Currently the only known formula computes the number of symmetrized class rather than the classes themselves. It is an open question to find an explicit formula for a maximal set of basis classes for the equivariant cohomology of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties that is also symmetric under the 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        -action. (These symmetrized basis classes generate a subring that is isomorphic to the cohomology of a different family of Hessenberg varieties called regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties (Abe et al., 2015).)

Containment is another natural geometric relationship to consider, though one with more limited uses. This has been most extensively considered for a GKM space Y which is a subvariety of another GKM space X, both with respect to the same torus action. Schubert varieties are one example, as are other examples that come from flowing subspaces as far as possible in one particular direction. In these cases information about bases and geometric representations for X can be applied directly to splines on Y.

In general some of the most interesting results about subvarieties come from leveraging information about bases for splines of the ambient space. For instance both the Grassmannian 
                           G
                           /
                           P
                         and the quotient 
                           P
                           /
                           B
                         can be viewed as submodules of the splines 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 ⁎
                              
                           
                           (
                           
                              
                                 GL

                         by restricting the Schubert classes to specific fixed points in the moment graph. Together with Billey's formula, this permits calculations that aren't as easy when 
                           G
                           /
                           P
                         or 
                           P
                           /
                           B
                         are viewed just in their own right (Drellich and Tymoczko, in press).

The technique of restricting splines to the fixed points lying inside certain subvarieties has been used even when the subvariety Y is not a GKM space with respect to the same torus action (Harada and Tymoczko, 2010). This technique—called poset pinball—can be used to construct the

                        -equivariant cohomology of Y. In some sense this is a geometry/topology problem more than a problem about splines: it restricts splines to various subsets of vertices, but often the cohomology

                         is not a spline ring itself.

We conclude with an algebraic generalization of splines that gives a more abstract framework for some of the problems that we have considered here.

To define this more general version of splines, fix a graph 
                        G
                        =
                        (
                        V
                        ,
                        E
                        )
                     . For simplicity we assume that G has a finite vertex set, no multiedges (so each pair of vertices has at most one edge between them), and no loops (so there are no edges from a vertex to itself). Let R be any commutative ring with identity. A map 
                        α
                        :
                        E
                        →
                        {
                        ideals in 
                        R
                        }
                      is called an edge-labeling of the graph G.

                      and “throw away” everything whose degree is too big. One subtlety is that the division algorithm does not hold for multivariable polynomial rings; the field of Gröbner bases developed in order to deal with the complications that arise.

Geometers have not studied the rings corresponding to 
                        
                           
                              S

                        (
                        G

                      when d is finite or r is nonzero, though it seems likely that 
                        
                           
                              S

                        (

                        )
                      carries useful geometric information (as Billera noted). The geometric implications of varying r are more mysterious, and interesting.

A few words on bases in this context are useful. Again we consider module bases rather than vector space bases. Indeed splines over an arbitrary ring R do not necessarily have vector-space bases (for instance when R is the integers, described more below). Of more concern, the module of splines may not even be free, both in interesting (DiPasquale, 2012) and uninteresting (e.g. when R has zero divisors) ways.

When we first considered flow-up bases in Section 3.1, we said that geometers typically require the flow-up class 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              v
                           
                        
                      restricted to the vertex v to be the product of labels on edges directed out of v. There are examples of flow-up bases for generalized splines for which this condition does not hold (see Handschy et al., 2014, who give an example over the integers). If X is a GKM space then Definition 3.1 (and the GKM conditions) implies the product condition on 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              v
                           
                           
                              v
                           
                        
                     .

In fact one could generalize splines even more, along the lines of Braden–MacPherson's construction of intersection homology (Braden and MacPherson, 2001). Their starting point is a graph with a module 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              v
                           
                        
                      at each vertex. At each edge there is a module 
                        
                           
                              M

                      and maps

Splines over the integers have interesting connections to number theory. In fact the Chinese Remainder theorem can be restated as a question about splines on the path with three vertices whose edge labels are the ideals

                                 ) (Handschy et al., 2014). Handschy–Melnick–Reinders gave an explicit formula for the smallest value of each element of their flow-up basis (Handschy et al., 2014). Bowden–Hagen–King–Reinders gave an explicit formula for each entry of each basis element of splines on cycles over 
                                    Z
                                  under the hypothesis that one pair of adjacent edge-labels is relatively prime (Bowden et al., 2015). (The general GKM package implies each pair of adjacent edge-labels is relatively prime.)

With a basis, we can try to explicitly describe multiplication tables as in Section 2.2. Even in the case of integers and integers mod m this can be a challenge. Bowden–Hagen–King–Reinders used their basis for splines on some cycles to write an explicit multiplication table (Bowden et al., 2015). Bowden–Philbin–Swift–Tammaro gave an explicit formula for the multiplication table of splines mod m over arbitrary graphs, using a more implicitly defined basis (Bowden et al., in preparation).

Much of this work extends to PIDs in general, including 
                           C
                           [
                           x
                           ]
                         and 
                           R
                           [
                           x
                           ]
                        . Some of it even extends to 
                           Z
                           [
                           x
                           ]
                         in the geometric context even though 
                           Z
                           [
                           x
                           ]
                         is a quintessential example of a ring that is not a PID. Indeed if X is a GKM space for which GKM theory can be used with integer coefficients (like the flag variety), then we can restrict the torus T to various one-dimensional subgroups and get a map from splines over 
                           Z
                           [
                           
                              
                                 t
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 t
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           ]
                         to 
                           Z
                           [
                           x
                           ]
                        . Judicious choice of the one-dimensional subgroup together with the GKM conditions imply that each edge-label is an ideal of the form 
                           n
                           x
                           Z
                         for some integer n. The ring of splines in that case is very closely related to the ring of splines over integers obtained by evaluating at 
                           x
                           =
                           1
                         as in (Gilbert et al., in press, Theorem 2.12).

One of the most interesting aspects of generalized splines is that natural graph operations also give useful information. In this section we will describe ways to remove parts of a graph. This often changes the underlying graph in ways that violate conditions from classical splines or geometry. In a simple case of our first example, removing a vertex together with its incident edges leaves a graph that no longer satisfies the regularity conditions that moment graphs of manifolds satisfy. In the second example, removing an edge typically results in a graph that is not dual to a triangulation.

Let us first consider the effects on

                                 ,
                                 α
                              
                           
                         of removing a subgraph of G. Suppose

                         This can constrain the codimension of each inclusion in interesting ways. We know of no good analogue to this operation for splines over triangulations: removing an edge appears to “cut” the plane so that two triangles are no longer adjacent, without moving or removing those triangles.

We conclude with another example, an algorithm that uses graph operations like contractions and deletions to produce explicit bases for splines over 
                           Z
                        . The algorithm has the following steps:
                           
                              1.
                              If G is a tree then we have an explicit formula for a flow-up basis for its splines (Gilbert et al., in press, Theorem 4.1).
