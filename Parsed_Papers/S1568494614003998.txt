               Abstract
               
                  Using benchmark problems to demonstrate and compare novel methods to the work of others could be more widely adopted by the Soft Computing community. This article contains a collection of several benchmark problems in nonlinear control and system identification, which are presented in a standardized format. Each problem is augmented by examples where it has been adopted for comparison. The selected examples range from component to plant level problems and originate mainly from the areas of mechatronics/drives and process systems. The authors hope that this overview contributes to a better adoption of benchmarking in method development, test and demonstration.
