                  The use of genome-wide, sample-matched miRNA (miRNAs)-mRNA expression data provides a powerful tool for the investigation of miRNAs and genes involved in diseases. The identification of miRNA-regulated pathways has been crucial for analysis of the role of miRNAs. However, the classical identification method fails to consider the structural information of pathways and the regulation of miRNAs simultaneously.
                  We proposed a method that simultaneously integrated the change in gene expression and structural information in order to identify pathways. Our method used fold changes in miRNAs and gene products, along with the quantification of the regulatory effect on target genes, to measure the change in gene expression. Topological characteristics were investigated to measure the influence of gene products on entire pathways. Through the analysis of multiple myeloma and prostate cancer expression data, our method was proven to be effective and reliable in identifying disease risk pathways that are regulated by miRNAs. Further analysis showed that the structure of a pathway plays a crucial role in the recognition of the pathway as a factor in disease risk.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous RNAs, of approximately 22 nucleotides, which constitute an important class of master regulators involved in various cellular and disease processes [1–5]. MicroRNAs function mainly by silencing the expression of target genes at the mRNA level [6,7]. Approximately 1798 genes have been experimentally validated as targets of miRNAs. Target prediction algorithms (MTPAs), such as TargetScan, PicTar and others, have also been developed to predict target genes of miRNAs [8,9]. The study of pathways, which are known to be regulated by miRNAs, has become as an invaluable aid in understanding the function of miRNAs, their target genes and the molecular aberrations associated with diseases.

Enrichment analysis can be used to identify disease related pathways, through the set of target genes. Statistical significance for pathway enrichment can be calculated by hypergrometric tests or the Fisher exact test, using all genes in the genome as the background [10,11]. Studies have shown that repression of gene expression is a general pattern of regulation by miRNA [12,13]. Sample-matched profiling of miRNA and mRNA has been an effective method used to detect this repression effect [14–16]. For example, Gutierrez et al. identified disease related miRNAs and genes. They integrated target prediction and anti-correlation using the Pearson correlation coefficient to identify the over-represented pathways [16–20]. The Pearson correlation coefficient represents the closeness of related miRNA-target pair. As multiple miRNAs can target the same gene, the regulation effect can be cumulative. However, the existing pathway identification methods have omitted the cumulative effect, and considered neither the alteration of target gene’s expression nor the cumulative regulatory effects simultaneously.

The biochemical reactions within pathways control the specific cellular processes. In order to study the biological functions more efficiently, pathways are usually reconstructed into pathway networks (PN), represented by graph theory [21]. The structural information of a PN can depict the roles of gene products within the pathway. For example, a gene product with large betweenness centrality value (fraction of all shortest paths passing through the gene product) is of great importance in the pathway. Clearly, if a gene that is regulated by miRNAs has a large topological characteristics value, the regulatory effect of the miRNA on the pathway is also large. Although pathway topology has been adopted to identify pathways that are significantly related to a specific phenotype [22,23], the traditional methods have failed to consider the regulatory impact of miRNAs in the regulation of the pathway.

To identify disease related pathways that were regulated by miRNAs, we developed a new pathway identification method, called MRPP (miRNA regulated risk pathways by sample-matched miRNA-mRNA profiles). This method incorporated sample-matched miRNA-mRNA expression profiles and pathway structure information. We considered both the alteration of gene expression and the topological significance of gene nodes in the pathways (Fig. 1
                     ). The study of the alteration of gene expression included the analysis of both genes and the miRNAs that target them. The regulatory intensity of the miRNAs was also considered. The topological significance of nodes in a pathway was represented by topological characteristics of these nodes, which represent the ability of target genes to transmit biological signals to the downstream nodes. We applied the method to sample-matched miRNA-mRNA profiles of multiple myeloma (MM) and prostate cancer (PC) and successfully identified their risk pathways.

Multiple myeloma and PC sample-matched miRNA-mRNA expression profiles were obtained from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) [24]. The sample-matched profiles of MM (accession number: GSE16558) [16] consisted of 60 MM samples and five normal bone marrow samples. The sample-matched miRNA-mRNA profiles of PC (accession numbers: GSE8126 and GSE6956) consisted of 14 normal prostate tissues and 60 PC tissues. The 305 pathway files were taken from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway database, as of June 2011.

@&#METHODS@&#

Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed to identify disease related miRNAs and genes [20]. Fold change (FC) of genes was calculated using the quotient of average expression value of disease samples divided by average expression values of normal samples. Genes with FC>1.5 or FC<0.67 were considered to be up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. The same process was applied to the miRNA expression profiles. Lists of disease related miRNAs and genes were established using the information from this process.

The miRNA-target gene pairs were obtained from TargetScan [9]. These associations were used to measure the repression level of gene expression caused by the miRNA. We considered the anti-correlation between the expression of miRNA and the target, reported in the literatures [11,23], and defined an anti-regulated miRNA-gene pair as having the following relationship—both the miRNA and the gene should meet the following two conditions at the same time: (1) they were given in the DE lists; (2) their expression patterns were inverse. Thus, if the miRNA of the pair was up-regulated, the gene of the pair should be down-regulated, and vice versa. We named the target gene included by anti-regulated miRNA-gene pair as putative target gene (PTG). In order to measure the repression level of gene expression caused by the miRNA, we identify the regulatory intensity of the miRNA which was computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient (denoted by R) between the miRNA and PTG. The Pearson coefficient R
                           M,G between a disease related miRNA M and its related PTG G was quantified by Eq. (1):

                            was claculated as mean value of M’s expression values in all n samples. The similar was for PTG G.

Pairs with high coefficients had a closer relationship than those with low coefficients, meaning that the regulatory of miRNA to the target gene was stronger.

The KEGG pathways were reconstructed into directed networks (PDN), with gene products (KOs) as nodes. A node consisted of one or more KOs and the node can be mapped by one or several genes, in accordance with the mapping relationships obtained from the KEGG database. The edges of the pathways were used to decipher the relationship between nodes, such as active and suppression. If a node (or nodes) in a PDN can be mapped by PTGs, the node was named signature nodes. A signature node may be regulated by miRNAs through the common PTGs. Then pathway corresponding to the PDN was potentially regulated by disease related miRNAs and defined as candidate risk pathways.

The signature nodes in the pathway were not only regulated by disease related miRNAs, but also had complex linkages with other nodes in the pathway. The complex linkages of these signature nodes were represented by topological characteristics which were obtained from pathway structure information. For each signature node, it had two kinds of impacts: expression impact and topological impact.

Under the regulation of disease related miRNAs, expression impact of the signature node i was quantified by Eq. (2):

                           In Eq. (2), Wi
                            denoted the level of change of gene expression of node i, in a pathway regulated by a disease related miRNAs. M and G denoted disease related miRNAs and their target gene. The fold change (FC) of G or M was obtained from DE analysis of related profiles. Node i included ni
                            KOs, the jth
                            KO can be mapped by lj
                            gene and the kth
                            gene was regulated by mk
                            miRNAs. A large Wi
                            value meant the expression impact of node i was large, implying that the regulation by the disease related miRNAs resulted in a large change of this signature node.

A signature node had complex linkages within the PDN, therefore, exerted a topological influence on the whole pathway. The topological impact consisted of two aspects: local impact calculated by out-degree (the number of gene products the signature node directing), denoted as D; and global impact calculated by betweenness centrality, denoted as B. Nodes with high out-degree can regulate nodes that are downstream in the pathway. Nodes with high betweenness are crucial for the whole pathway and can regulate a great number of downstream gene products.

The two kinds of impacts of signature nodes were integrated into the pathway analysis to identify the disease impact as follows:

                            denotes the disease impact of a pathway which denoted as P. There were n signature nodes in the pathway. For signature node i, its impact on the whole pathway was assigned to be the product of expression impact Wi
                            and topological impact, 1+

                           . In order to alleviate the impact of a pathway’s scale N which was defined by the number of nodes included in the pathway, the disease impact of a pathway was assigned to be the sum of the impact of all signature nodes divided by the extraction of N.

In order to prove that the disease risk pathways were reliable and not discovered by chance, we performed a statistical test as follows: We put the agreement between probes and the mRNA (or miRNA) expression profiles in random order, which maintained a constant number of DE genes and miRNAs. For each PDN, we calculated the value of topological characteristics, and put the agreement between nodes and topological values in random order, which maintained the sum of topological values a constant. After putting agreements mentioned above in random order, we identified disease related pathways. Then we repeated the process above k times, and then the background distributions were generated using the k times permutation analysis. To estimate the significance of a given pathway P, the real IMP
                            value was compared with the background distributions. Let m represent the number of values that are not less than IMP
                           , in the background distributions. The p-value of the pathway in the statistical test was computed as p-value=
                           m/k. A low p-value (such as p
                           <0.01) indicated that the pathway was a risk pathway.

To show the joint power of topological influence and gene expression alteration of signature nodes, regulated by miRNAs, we applied our method to two cancer datasets (Materials and Methods, Dataset). Nine pathways were identified in the MM dataset and 24 were identified in the PC dataset. One thousand permutations were performed and the data had p-values of <0.01 and fold changes of >1.5 (or <0.67).

A comparison was made between MRPP and three other methods: (1) NP: similar to MRPP but does not take into account cumulative effects in the calculation of pathways. The method assigned the betweenness and out-degree of signature nodes to be 1, i.e. NP considered alteration in gene expression without considering the topological characteristics. For MM, ten risk pathway were identified. For PC, we identified thirty risk pathways. (2) NE: similar to MRPP, but does not take into account cumulative effects in the calculation of pathways. The method assigned the regulated change in gene expression of signature nodes to be 1, i.e. NE considered topological influence without considering the regulation of change in gene expression. We dientified seven and twenty-six risk pathways. (3) MMEA: used sample-matched miRNA-mRNA profiles and calculated the target gene set of all the MM related miRNAs from the anti-correlation obtained from the Pearson correlation coefficient (absolute value of Pearson Correlation Coefficient was more than 0.7). The risk pathways were then identified by over-representation of target gene sets. This method had been adopted to study disease related pathways regulated by miRNA in researches [13,16–18,25]. Three and four risk pathways were identified.

After comparing the number of risk pathways identified by MRPP and MMEA, In MM case, MRPP could identified more pathways in two of the other three methods (especially much more than MMEA) and had consistency of 90% with NE. The similar findings were in PC cases. In all, risk pathways in MRPP had similar size of risk pathways in NP and NE. All risk pathways identified by MRPP had been confirmed by researchers. However, the ratios of confirmed risk pathways identified by NP and NE were smaller than that by MMEA, indicating that the expression alteration and pathway toplogy palyed substantial role during the identification of risk pathways. And the average rank of risk pathways identified from MRPP was much higher than that of MMEA. It indicated that the the joint usage in MRPP was of great efficiency during the identification of risk pathways. Also, we found that the DE genes regulated by DE miRNA in MMEA was much less than PTGs in MRPP, this implied that lower regulation levels performed by DE miRNAs than in MMEA were essential in the identification and could help us identify more risk pathways. We performed detailed comparsions among the four methods (MRPP, NP, NE and MMEA) as described follows.

All nine of the MM risk pathways, identified by MRPP, had previously been reported to be highly associated with cancer or MM progression and complications in MM (Table 1
                        ). The significance of these pathways was higher in MRPP than in NP or NE, which indicates that the joint integration was more powerful than the single use of change in gene expression or pathway topology. None of the nine pathways showed significance when the MMEA method was used, which again implied that the joint usage of change in gene expression and pathway topology was more effective. When the MMEA p-value cutoff was lowered to <0.05, four pathways remained as insignificant, despite all four being reported to be related to MM. This implied that MRPP was more effective than MMEA.


                        Table 1 shows that the neurotrophin signaling pathway gave the highest level of association with MM (rank=1), using the MRPP method. The significance was much higher than with the other methods (rank=16, 2 and 31). The neurotrophin signaling pathway is known to be associated with MM [26–40] and is involved in the survival of MM cells. Some components in this pathway, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), FRS2, Erk1/2 and Rac1, contribute to cell survival [35–39]. The reaction pathway, induced by the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), may be critical to the interactions between bone and stroma in MM cells [38], which indicates the importance of the neurotrophin signaling pathway in MM tumor progression.

Another pathway that showed significant association with MM is purine metabolism. The rank within the MRPP method was 2 and this rank was also shown to a higher consistence with the other three methods. Purine is required for DNA/RNA synthesis and the pathway is necessary for the proliferation of plasma cells in bone marrow [41–43]. For example, the gene GART, which is regulated by 16 miRNAs, was reported to be expressed in dividing cells and catalyzes the product of ribosylamine, which is associated with MM [25]. The higher level of significance obtained from the MRPP method indicated that the joint power of change in gene expression and topology was considerable.

All 25 of the PC pathways had been reported to be related to the progression of PC or other cancers. Eighteen had been reported to show association with the progression of prostate cancer, which indicated that our method was effective. Eighty percent of the pathways showed greater statistical significance in MRPP than in NP. Twenty-four out of 25 pathways were more significant in MRPP than in NE and all of the pathways were more significant in MRPP, compared with MMEA. This indicated that the combination of change in gene expression and topology was highly effective.

Other pathways that showed an association with PC were the purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways, the p53 signaling pathway and the wnt signaling pathway. It is known that the metabolism of purine and pyrimidine (purine rank=1 and pyrimidine rank=5) is necessary for the synthesis of DNA and impacts on the proliferation of cancer cells and migration [44–46]. The p53 signaling pathway (rank=6) has been reported to be related to many cancers and is closely associated with PC [44]. Changes in the pathway can increase the risk of developing cancer. For example, the gene TP53, which encodes tumor protein p53, regulates genes that induce processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair, which are implicated in cancer. The wnt signaling pathway, which is prominent in the study of PC, was identified as being related to PC (rank=21). However, it was less significant in NP, NE or MMEA (rank=28, 35, and 42, respectively, Table 3
                        ). This indicated the high power of a method that uses both the change in gene expression and topology.

For the significant pathways identified by MRPP, we compared the performance of NP with MMEA, and MRPP with NE, to show that it was necessary to introduce change in gene expression to the identification of pathways related to disease. The NP and MMEA methods differed in that NP introduced change in gene expression of signature nodes, whilst MMEA did not. Similarly, MRPP considered change in gene expression, whilst NE did not (see Table 1 and Table 3).

All nine MM pathways, shown in Table 1, were more significant in NP than in MMEA, which indicated that the role of change in gene expression could not be ignored. For example, the fifth pathway, tight junction, was significant in both MRPP and NP (rank=11). However, it was not statistically significant in MMEA (rank=35), which implied that the change in gene expression was of great importance. We also found that the pathway was less significant in NE than in MRPP. During analysis of the change in gene expression within this pathway we found that seven nodes were regulated by miRNAs, with little connection to other nodes in the pathway. These seven nodes had a topological characteristic of zero and their contribution to the association with MM depended on gene expression alone. In MRPP, they accounted for approximately 0.006% of the pathway’s impact score. However, they accounted for approximately 0.35 of the sum of the change in gene expression in the pathway, which indicated that change in gene expression was more important than topology, for these nodes. The change in gene expression was considered during the scoring of the pathway in MRPP but not NE. Claudin, located in plasma membranes, has been proven to be associated with hypercalciuria, one of the complications of MM [47,48]. Claudin had the maximum change in gene expression, regulated by miRNAs, in the pathway. It accounted for 9% of the pathway’s score in MRPP.

We discovered that 96% of PC pathways were more significant in MRPP than in NE, with the exception of the focal adhesion pathway. We analyzed the nodes that were regulated by miRNAs and found that they were dispersed and had poor topology characteristics. The score of the pathway depended on the change in gene expression because of much smaller topological characteristic values of the signature nodes. The calcium signaling pathway was found to be significantly associated with PC (p-value=4.89E−4), in NP but not in MMEA (p-value=4.98E−1). It is known that the calcium channel blocker (CCB) function is inversely related to PC incidence [49]. Mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor is related to the progression of PC [50]. This showed that change in gene expression was more useful than considering the number of regulated nodes, when comparing the whole pathway.

Structural comparisons were made between NE and MMEA, and MRPP and NP. The difference between NE and MMEA was that NE introduced the structural information, whilst MMEA did not. Similarly, MRPP considered the pathway structure, whilst NP did not. All nine MM pathways performed better in NE than in MMEA, as in the comparison between NP and MRPP. This indicated that pathway topology was more powerful during the identification of risk pathways. For example, the neurotrophin signaling pathway was statistically significant in MRPP and NE (rank=1 and 3, respectively). This pathway was not significant in MMEA (rank=31), implying the power of pathway topology in MRPP and NE was the key factor that made the pathway more significant than that in MMEA. The rank in NP was 2, which was much higher than in MRPP. This indicated that topological influence accounted for a large part of the scoring in MRPP. As illustrated in Fig. 2
                        , the high connectivity of the neurotrophin signaling pathway means that the nodes included in the pathway have high topological characteristics (Table 2
                        ). For example, the NGF receptor p75NTR had the highest connectivity (Table 2, betweenness=1671.6) to other gene products, i.e. p75NTR participated in most signal transductions. In addition, p75NTR can impact the downstream gene products (Table 2, out-degree=19), to then impact cell functions. This receptor can be seen as a key point between cell cycle arrest/differentiation and apoptosis by the p53 protein [27]. Some reports have shown that p75NTR, a member of the tumor necrosis superfamily, has a close relationship with the control of tumorigenesis and binds to many kinds of neurotrophins [26]. As a common receptor, p75NTR can stimulate or suppress the growth of many cancer cells, subject to the type of tumor [26]. It has been reported to be involved in breast cancer, melanoma and others [51,52]. Some findings have suggested that p75NTR can be used as a tool in the diagnosis between different types of tumor, such as basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma [29]. Another member of the pathway, PI3K (betweenness=1460.36, out-degree=6), has been reported to be related to MM and has been implicated in the proliferation and survival of MM cells [37,38]. It mediates growth and drug resistance in MM cells and also plays an important role in autophagy [39,40]. Activation is via upstream tyrosine kinase-associated receptors for growth factors, cytokines, antigens and co-stimulatory molecules. Through the interaction with PI3K, activation of AKT occurs, which mediates cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and autophagy [40]. The study of the topology of this pathway has shown that the performance of the neurotrophin signaling pathway was superior in MRPP than in NP.

The topological influence within PC pathways, identified by MRPP, was investigated. Eighty percent of pathways were more significant in MRPP than in NP and all the pathways performed better in NE than MMEA. This indicated that topology was crucial during the identification of disease risk pathways. For example, we found that the p53 signaling pathway was less significant in NE than in MRPP and not significant in MMEA. This indicated that topological influence played an important role in the identification of the p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 3
                        ). The p53 protein can regulate diverse cellular stresses through the signal transit [44] and much of signal transduction is through p53 (betweenness=6.31). Many of the genes regulated by p53 are downstream of p53 (out-degree=35). The influence of topology was 28.82, which was much more than the influence of the change in gene expression (0.0966).

In the wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 4
                        ), a crucial gene product, named protein disheveled, transmits the wnt signal through to the cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal change and gene transcription, which are important for cancer cell proliferation. The dishevelled gene has been confirmed as being up-regulated in PC [53]. The protein appeared in two nodes in the wnt pathway. At these nodes, the influence of the change in gene expression was 0.6 and their topological influences were 16.5 and 160.1 (See Table 4
                        ). The topological influences were more than 20 times that of their expression influences, which indicated that the nodes ability to transmit signals to downstream components had a higher contribution than the change in gene expression.

In order to prove the stability of our method, we assign different values to the parameters adopted during the identification of disease risk pathways. Firstly, we identified disease related pathways based on MTPAs different from TargetScan, such as PicTar, miRanda [54], PITA [55]. After the identification procedure, we got MM related pathways and PC related pathways. Then we made a comparison of risk pathways’ significance for different MTPAs. It showed that the significance of pathways varied little and remained stable. It implied that the identification of disease risk pathways eliminated the effect that the overlaps among different MTPAs are small [56]. Secondly, we thought the genes or miRNAs with FC
                        >2 or FC
                        <0.5 to be disease related. After getting the risk pathways, we still found that the result varied little and was stable (see Supplementary Doc.S2).

Also, considering the impact caused by small size of minority class samples during the identification of DE genes or miRNAs, we firstly enalrged the size of both classes’ samples so as to generate new datasets who had bigger size of minority class samples than original datasets as follows: we enlarged size of two classes’ samples by a method named SMOTE [57]. During the enlargement, original data of samples was divided into two categories according to their class labels which were “normal” or “disease”. Took k (assigned to be 3 in our implement) nearest neighbors and class label for each sample under consideration, set the amount of over-sampling and under-sampling, then synthetic samples were introduced along the line segments joining any/all of the k minority class nearest neighbors which were got from original data. For original MM datasets, we set k to be 3, amount of over-sampling and under-sampling to be 620% and 77%, new MM datasets were generated. The new MM datasets consisted of 40 normal samples and 83 MM samples in contrast with 5 normal samples and 60 MM samples in the original datasets. We identified 3034 DE genes and 261 DE miRNAs (FC>1.5 or FC<0.67, and moderate T-test, FDR<0.05) from the new MM datasets. Comparing with DE 2992 genes and 321DE miRNAs identified originally, the size of DE genes’ overlap and DE miRNAs’ overlap were 2499 and 254. The FER values and related p-values [58] for the two overlaps were 5.67 (p-value<1e-35) and 1.83 (p-value<1e-6). 2470 PTGs, which were used to identify candidate risk pathways, were got from new MM datasets (2424 PTGs for original datasets). The two kinds of PTGs have 2267 PTGs in common (FER=6.58, p-value=0). Then 10 MM risk pathways were identified from new datasets (9 MM risk pathways from original datasets). 9 risk pathways were common (FER=30.5, p-value=0) and the different pathway was Pathways in Cancer which had been confirmed to be ralated with many kinds of cancers. We found that the overlaps’s degree of DE genes (or DE miRNAs), PTGs and risk pathways were gradually increased. For PC, same process was adopted: 42 normal samples and 75 PC samples were included in new PC datasets (14 normal samples and 75 PC samples). 10971 DE genes and 142 DE miRNAs (13293 DE genes and 115 DE miRNAs from original datasets, size of DE gene overlap=9465, FER=1.6, p-value<1e-15, size of DE miRNA overlap=97, FER=8.25, p-value<1e-1). 5625 PTGs were identified (7302 PTGs were identified from original datasets, FER=2.05, p-value=0). 21 PC risk pathways were identified from new datasets (24 were identified from original datasets, FER=8.3, p-value=1e-13). We found the similar gradually increasing for PC. These two gradually increasings indicated that it was robust for differnet sample sizes and different differential expression analysis methods at pathways and our identification method was robust.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

MicroRNAs can regulate their target genes and specific biological pathways. Many methods have been developed to identify these pathways and the conventional identification of disease related pathways is by the analysis of over-represented miRNAs, which reduces the pathways to gene sets. In simple terms, the enrichment method is based on counting the number of annotated genes regulated by disease related miRNAs. This method treats all the gene products as equivalent, but fails to consider the biologically constitutive non-equivalence of gene products within the pathways. Unlike the traditional methods, we considered the biological non-equivalence of gene products regulated by miRNAs. The biological non-equivalence appears in two ways: the change in gene expression in response to disease, and the influence on the other gene products within the same pathway. We used the fold changes in gene product to represent the alteration in gene expression, and betweenness and out-degree to jointly represent the influence on other gene products. With the joint usage of expression and topological influence, the disease risk of a signature node dispersed to the whole pathway through the complex linkages within the pathway. Thus, disease risk of a pathway could be identified through integration disease risk of all signature nodes within the pathway. After application to MM and PC datasets, we found that our method was more effective and reliable than the methods named NP, NE and MMEA. Our method detected many pathways related to diseases that were omitted by the three other methods. For example, among the pathways significantly associated with MM, the neurotrophin signaling pathway had a stronger association with our method compared with the other three methods. The gene product, p75NTR, was related to MM and was regulated by MM related miRNAs, such as miR-27a and miR-34a [59–62].

Our method measured the biological non-equivalence of gene products by quantifying the expression changes and influence on other products. The quantification of gene expression considered the specific status of samples used in the datasets, which helped in choosing the miRNAs and genes that may be important in the diseases. The determination of the level of influence of one gene product on others product was used to investigate the association among the products within a pathway. Both betweenness and out-degree were used to detect the information flow through a gene product. We also investigated the relationships between miRNAs and risk pathways that are associated with diseases. The miRNAs that regulate the pathways have been reported to be related to the progression of cancers. The regulation of some genes by more than one miRNA led us to hypothesize that the miRNAs are cooperative functioned. We found that the co-expression of miRNAs showed a significant difference to the co-expression expected by chance. We also investigated the contribution of MIRNAS to the association of the pathways with increased disease risk. Again, the contributions of miRNAs to the disease pathways were more statistically significant than expected by chance. These findings implied that the co-operated performance of miRNAs is an important factor in the regulation of pathways that respond to diseases. (For more information, see Supplementary material Doc.S1.)

In the robust analysis of MRPP, more existing methods, such as method adopted by de Cubba et al. [63] could introduced into comparsions with MRPP. More comparsions could help show superiority of MRPP.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Our method is effective in identifying disease risk pathways. The results of the comparison between MRPP and other methods showed us that both changes in gene expression and pathway topology were essential factors to consider during the identification of risk pathways. The regulation effect of miRNAs on risk pathways can be cumulative and they tended to be co-expressed and contribute to the pathways association with the risk of diseases. It can be an effective aid for the research of pathological mechanisms of diseases.
