                  This paper considers the problem of joint detection and tracking in mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements. A nonlinear target tracking model with multiple switching parameters has been proposed, in which multiple independent Markov chains are used to describe the switching of target maneuvers and the transition of LOS/NLOS measurements, respectively. Based on the proposed tracking model, a multi-sensor multiple model Bernoulli filter (MMBF) has been developed by employing the random finite set theory which can formulate the joint detection and tracking in a unified framework. To derive a closed-form expression to the MMBF, the Gaussian mixture implementations have been provided by applying the extended Kalman filter technique. A numerical example is provided involving tracking a maneuvering target by a sensor network with 30 nodes. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed filter.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSN) has received great attention in many fields such as mobile station localization, search-rescue, robotic navigation, and autonomous surveillance [1–5]. Target tracking can be viewed as a sequential localization problem via noisy measurements. Representative signal models in a WSN includes time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA), received signal strength (RSS) and their data fusion schemes. Due to its low complexity and low cost of devices, RSS-based target tracking has been one of the most popular methods in a WSN and many algorithms have been developed in [6–8].

As new targets may appear or disappear randomly in the surveillance region, tracking multi-target involves estimating an unknown and time-varying number of targets from a given set of measurements with uncertain origin. Many tracking algorithms have been proposed based on data association strategies such as the nearest neighbor, the strongest neighbor, the joint probabilistic data association and the multiple hypothesis tracking [9]. Due to its combinatorial nature, a high computational load is often required to resolve the data association problem in multi-target tracking algorithms. Two well-known alternative formulations that avoid data association are symmetric measurement equations [10] and the random finite sets (RFS) [11]. In the RFS formulation, the target states and measurements are represented by two different random finite sets, and as a consequence, the multi-target tracking problem can be addressed in a rigorous Bayesian estimation framework based on the finite set statistics theory [11]. A common method is the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter [12] and two typical implementations have been proposed including the sequential Monte Carlo [13] and the Gaussian mixture [14]. Many extensions have been also developed for different tracking scenarios [15–22].

For jointly detecting and tracking a single target, the Bernoulli RFS has been one of the most important candidates by representing the target state as a set that can take on either an empty set or a singleton, and the resulting algorithm is referred to as the Bernoulli filter. As the Bernoulli filter in a general nonlinear/non-Gaussian case has no analytic solution, numerical implementations have been proposed such as the particle filter method [23] and the Gaussian mixture method [24]. In [25], the Bernoulli particle filter has been applied to jointly detect and track an extended target. In [26], the problem of joint detection and tracking of a target using multi-static Doppler-only measurements has been investigated and a multi-sensor Bernoulli particle filter has been developed. The Bernoulli filter has been extended to track multiple targets, which is also known as the cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli filter [27–34].

It should be pointed out that the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation might occur in a WSN whenever there are obstacles blocking the direct radio signal path between the target and a sensor node, especially in the indoor environment or an urban region. The NLOS propagation often induce large localization errors if not addressed, and therefore, special techniques are required to mitigate the NLOS effects. In the past few decades, many strategies have been proposed for mitigating the NLOS errors such as hypothesis test [35], statistical analysis [36], and robust parameter estimation [37]; see [38] for more detailed discussions on these methods. In [39], a two-state Markov chain has been utilized to describe the switching behavior of the line-of-sight (LOS) and the NLOS, and an estimator has been developed by combining the interacting multiple model (IMM) approach with the Kalman filtering technique. It has been shown that the proposed estimator can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects on the measurement errors. Based on this model, the data fusion of TOA and RSS measurements is employed to improve the location accuracy in [40]. The results are further extended to approximate the nonlinear RSS measurement by using fuzzy estimation techniques in [41]. Similar idea has also been adopted to track a mobile terminal by using the M-estimation approach [42]. In [43], a distributed multiple model estimator has been developed for simultaneous localization and tracking. However, little research has been done for joint target detection and tracking in a WSN. In [44], the RSS-based target tracking in sensor networks has been studied by the RFS approach and the Bernoulli filter has been developed in [45]. The problem of joint detection and tracking in mixed LOS and NLOS environment has not been studied.

In this paper, we attempt to apply the Bernoulli filter to address the problem of joint detection and tracking using RSS measurements in mixed LOS and NLOS environment. To address the effects of target maneuvers and NLOS errors, a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters has been proposed as the tracking model. Based on the RFS theory, we show how the multiple switching parameters can be used in the Bernoulli filter. By using the sequential estimation approach to address multiple sensor measurements, a multi-sensor multiple model Bernoulli filter (MMBF) has been developed and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique is adopted to give Gaussian mixture implementations to the multi-sensor MMBF. The proposed filter can be considered as an extension of the filter in [45] with multiple model features. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filter.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The problem of joint detection and tracking using RSS measurements in mixed LOS and NLOS environments is formulated in Section 2. The multi-sensor MMBF is developed and the Gaussian mixture implementations to the proposed filter are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter. Conclusion and future work are drawn in Section 5.

                         denote the position and the velocity components, respectively. Since the target dynamic is not known as a prior, a single motion model might not be enough to represent the target dynamics. To indicate the target maneuvers, the target dynamic is described by the following jump Markov system

Based on the above formulation, the target dynamics and the measurement equations can be represented in a compact form

                        . It can be seen that the proposed tracking model has been formulated as a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters. The transition probabilities of the Markov chains can be determined by using the maximum likelihood estimation approach [46,47], which is out of the scope of this paper.

As the target may enter and exit the surveillance region at random instances, it is important to consider techniques that can jointly detect and track a target. The RFS theory has been used to pose the joint detection and tracking as a Bayes optimal filtering problem with finite set valued states and observations.

Generally, an RFS is a random variable that takes value as unordered finite set. An RFS X is completed specified by its cardinality distribution

The aim of this paper is to address the problem of joint detection and tracking a maneuvering target using RSS measurements in mixed LOS/NLOS environments. By representing the target state as a Bernoulli RFS, our purpose is to develop a recursive filtering algorithm with respect to the tracking model (5)–(6). As the tracking model has been formulated as a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters, we attempt to propose a multi-sensor MMBF in the RFS framework.

As the tracking model involves multiple switching parameters

                           Remark 1
                           Note that the probability

                               is not dependent on the switching parameters. This is due to the fact that the target appearance and disappearance are not dependent on the behavior of the target dynamics and the LOS/NLOS measurements. However, the probability density function 
                                 
                                    
                                       r
                                    
                                    
                                       k
                                    
                                 
                               is dependent on the switching parameters since different modes of the Markov chains are used to estimate the target state.


                        
                           Remark 2
                           The proposed multi-sensor MMBF simplifies to the multi-sensor Bernoulli filter in [45] when the multiple model feature is not adopted. It is worth mentioning that the proposed filter differs from the multi-sensor Bernoulli in [24] since the clutter is not considered in the proposed filter. Although the Markov chain has been used to describe target maneuvers in the RFS framework [29,48–50], the switching of LOS/NLOS measurement errors has not been addressed in the literature.

The Gaussian mixture implementations are proposed to give a closed-form solution to the multi-sensor MMBF (18)–(21). As the updated posterior density

                         is derived by multiple sensor measurements (32), the sequential estimation approach is used as follows.

Based on the idea of sequential estimation, the estimates at time step k can be derived after all the sensor measurements are addressed.

For clarify, the proposed filter is summarized in Algorithm 1
                        .


                        
                           Remark 3
                           As the number of Gaussian components increases without bound as time progresses, the pruning scheme is required after the updated step and a simple pruning procedure has been provided by truncating components that have weak weights [14]. Another feature of the proposed filter is that other nonlinear filtering techniques can be used instead of the EKF such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the cubature Kamlan filter (CKF).

In the proposed tracking scenario, 30 sensor nodes are randomly deployed over a field of 
                           [
                           0
                            
                           80
                           ]
                           ×
                           [
                           0

                        . To indicate the target maneuvers, the target dynamics is described by a coordinated turn model

For notational simplicity, the proposed filter is shortly denoted by TMM in the figures. The simulations results are derived from 500 Monte Carlo runs. The position estimates of the proposed filter for one trial are shown in Fig. 2, where the simulation results suggest that the proposed filter can provide accurate tracking performance for almost all the time.

                         is shown versus time in Fig. 3
                        , which suggests that the target appearance and disappearance can be detected accurately at time 5 s and 85 s.

                         is presented versus time. To illustrate the effects of target maneuvers and NLOS measurement errors, the proposed filter is compared with four multiple model Bernoulli filters (shortly denoted by MM-1, MM-2, MM-3 and MM-Id). The MM-1 refers to the filter without using multiple target dynamic models and only the constant velocity model is used to represent target motions (i.e., only the coordinate turn rate 
                           ω
                           =
                           0
                         is used). But the Markov chain

                         is still used to mitigate NLOS measurement errors for each sensor. The MM-2 refers to the filter without using multiple models for the LOS and NLOS measurement errors and only the LOS measurement noise is used (i.e., only the measurement noise variance

                                 s
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 1
                                 )
                              
                           
                           =
                           64
                         is used). But the Markov chain

                                 k
                              
                           
                         is still used to represent the target maneuvers. The MM-3 refers to the filter with known LOS and NLOS measurement errors at each time step, and only the multiple target dynamic models are used. The MM-Id refers to the filter with multiple target dynamic models, where the NLOS identification approach is adopted to mitigate NLOS measurement errors [52,53].

It can be observed that the proposed filter performs better than the MM-1 and the MM-2 filters. This is due to the fact the unknown target maneuvers and the LOS/NLOS measurement errors are addressed in a unified framework in the proposed filter. An important feature is that the target maneuver plays a more important role than the LOS/NLOS measurement errors for the tracking performance. The proposed filter also performs better than the MM-Id filter, which might be due to the fact that the NLOS measurement errors cannot always be identified accurately. In addition, the proposed filter achieves almost identical accuracy with the MM-3 filter which means the NLOS measurement errors can be mitigated effectively by the proposed filter.

To further evaluate the performance of the proposed filter with respect to the occurrence probability of NLOS measurement errors, the averaged OSPA with different occurrence probabilities are shown in Fig. 5
                        . The following features can be deduced from the simulation results. Firstly, the higher the occurrence probability of the NLOS, the higher tracking errors of the filter becomes. Secondly, the MM-1 filter is the worst since the target maneuvers are not considered in the target dynamic models. To mitigate the NLOS effects, the performance of the filters with Markov chain models is better than that with the NLOS identification approach since the NLOS measurement errors might not be always identified. Thirdly, the MM-2 filter performs slightly better than the proposed TMM filter with low occurrence probability of NLOS, which is due to the fact that almost all the measurements are in LOS condition. However, the proposed TMM filter performs slightly better than the MM-2 filter when the occurrence probability is larger than 0.6. Fourthly, the performance of the proposed TMM filter is close to the MM-3 filter with known LOS/NLOS measurement errors. Thus, a modest conclusion can be drawn that the NLOS measurement errors can be mitigated effectively by the proposed TMM filter. Moreover, by comparing the performance of the MM-2, the MM-3 and the proposed TMM filters, it can be seen that the tracking performance is not severely affected by the NLOS measurement errors.

To evaluate the computational requirement of the proposed algorithm, the averaged CPU Time is computed in MATLAB 7.1 on a 2.80-GHz 4 CPU Pentium-based computer operating under Windows XP (Professional). The proposed TMM filter consumed approximately 1.89 s per sample run over 90 time steps whereas the MM-1 filter consumed 0.36 s, the MM-2 filter consumed 0.64 s, the MM-3 filter consumed 0.62 s and the MM-Id consumed 0.65 s. This is reasonable since 6 filters are used for each sensor measurements in the proposed filter while 2 filters are used in the MM-1 filter and 3 filters are used in the MM-2, the MM-3 and the MM-Id filters.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have proposed a multi-sensor MMBF for joint detection and tracking of a maneuvering target in mixed LOS/NLOS environments. The RSS measurements are used to generate the target state estimate. This filter is derived by formulating the switching of the target maneuvers, the transition of the LOS/NLOS measurements, and the detection for both target appearance and disappearance in a unified framework. Gaussian mixture implementations have been provided to give a closed-form expression for the proposed filter. Simulation results show that the target can be detected accurately and the NLOS effects can be mitigated by the proposed filter.

Future work will focus on the development of a multi-sensor multiple model CBMeMBer filter for tracking multiple maneuvering targets in the presence of data association uncertainty. Another attractive direction is development of a multi-sensor MMBF with unknown transmission power and path loss exponent in the RSS measurement.
