                  Objective
                  The analysis of treatment effects in clinical trials usually focus on efficacy and safety in separate descriptive statistical analyses. The Q-TWiST (Quality adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity) method has been proposed by Gelber in the 90s to enable a statistical comparison between two groups with a graphical representation by incorporating benefit and risk into a single analysis. Although the method has been programmed in SAS, it is rarely used. The availability of the method in the freely software environment system like R would greatly enhanced the accessibility by researchers. The objective of this paper is to present a program for Q-TWiST analyses within R software environment.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The qtwist function was developed in order to estimate and compare Q-TWiST for two groups. Two individual patient data files are required used for input: one for visits and one for follow-up. Q-TWiST is obtained as a sum of time spent in three health states: period in toxicity (TOX), period without relapse and toxicity (TWiST) and period in relapse (REL), weighted by associated utility scores restricted to median overall survival for example. The bootstrap method is used for testing statistical significance. Threshold analysis and gain functions allow a group comparison for different utility values.
               
               
                  Results
                  Input data is checked for consistency. Descriptive statistics and mean durations for each health state are provided, allowing statistical comparisons. Graphical results are presented in a PDF file. The use of the function is illustrated with data from a simulated data set and a randomized clinical trial.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  
                     qtwist is an easy to use R function, allowing a quality adjusted survival analysis with the Q-TWiST method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

New treatment strategies developed over the last few years in the field of oncology have allowed longer survival durations but often at the cost of severe toxicities and poor quality of life [1,2]. Taking into account not only survival but also treatment related side effects is a fundamental objective for evaluating results over the time. Most evaluation tools use validated questionnaires to summarize information with scores. The types of toxicities and the nature of side effects can be classified by severity categories at a given time point. Most often however, toxicity results are usually summarized by the maximal severity grade for each patient observed over the study period.

In the analysis of such longitudinal data, more sophisticated analyses can be performed by estimating changes over time by using mixed models adapted to repeated measures in order to test the time effect. Other methods with fewer hypotheses have been developed which take into account the time factor to estimate prevalence functions over time [3]. These methods have been generalized to take into account long term complications of varying severity among patients alive without relapse [4]. An R function has recently been published for these analyses [5].

The Q-TWiST (Quality adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity) methodology has been used for supplementary analyses of clinical trials taking into account toxicities during treatment as well as relapse and survival [6]. Usually, three variables are generated for each patient: period spent in toxicity (TOX), period spent without symptoms of toxicity (TWiST) and period spent in relapse (REL). Some examples have used the Q-TWiST method in the evaluation of rituximab plus CVP vs. CVP alone in first-line treatment of advanced follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [7] or best supportive care with or without panitumumab in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer [8]. Other examples applied to health related quality of life can be found in Osoba [9]. Data analysis for quality adjusted survival data using the Q-TWiST method has been programmed in SAS, but is not available in a free environment like R.

The objective of this article is to provide an R function for the analyses of survival adjusted for quality of life for three health states using the Q-TWiST method. The availability of this tool could make easier its appropriation by research teams as part of a joint analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints in the evaluation of treatment strategies.

Methods as well as a small example are presented in Section 2. The R function is described in Section 3. In Section 4, results of a phase III randomized trial comparing two pre-operative brachytherapy low dose rates in patients with localized cervix carcinoma are used for illustration [10].

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The first step in an analysis using the Q-TWiST method is the need to define health states corresponding to a categorization of treatment related toxicity or quality of life scores which are as pertinent as possible for the disease and treatment under study [11]. This methodology has most often been used in oncology with three health state definitions: toxicity, no toxicity and no relapse and relapse. Total durations spent in each health state up to a specified time point L are needed for analysis. For example, the total period spent in each health state for each patient i is obtained from the entry and exit times of each health state in the following manner:
                              
                                 -
                                 TOX
                                       i
                                     is the total period in which patient i experiences toxicities (calculated to the date of relapse).

TWiST
                                       i
                                     is the total period in which patient i experiences no toxicity and no relapse (calculated to the date of relapse or death or last follow-up).

REL
                                       i
                                     is the period in which patient i experiences relapse (calculated from date of relapse to date of death or last follow-up).

Total durations spent in each health state for all patients are obtained as follows:

                           with TOX, TWiST, and REL representing the health state durations for n patients.

Quality-of-life-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST) is then calculated as a weighted sum of the mean health state durations

                           With utility scores: UTOX, UTWiST, and UREL, representing utility coefficients associated with each health state.

Each utility weight is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes a state as bad as death, and 1 denotes a state as good as best possible health. Values between 0 and 1 denote degrees between these extremes. Note that if all of the utility weights equal 1, Q-TWiST is equivalent to the mean survival time.

To reflect the relative value of TOX and REL to TWiST, the utility coefficient for TWiST should be set to 1. In this case, a coefficient of 1 represents time with the same quality of life as TWiST, and 0 represents a value of quality of life that is as bad as death.

In order to generate the utility scores, direct or indirect methods (also called generic preference-based measures) can be used. The direct methods include the visual analog scale, the time trade-off and the standard gamble. The indirect methods involve the use of pre-scored generic preference-based measures including the EuroQol (EQ)-5D, the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) and the Health Utilities Index (HUI) [12].

Estimates of the mean amount of time spent in each of the health states are determined by the use of Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the estimation of the duration of treatment toxicity and relapse-free survival (calculated to relapse or death). Due to censoring, it is necessary to calculate restricted means duration estimates up to a pre-specified time point L, usually the median follow-up. Since the estimates of mean durations are biased in the presence of censoring [13]. Kaplan–Meier estimates for STOX, STWiST and SREL for each outcome are used to estimate mean durations of TOX, TWiST, and REL respectively. The areas between these survival curves are used to compare treatment group [14].

Thus the Q-TWiST method estimates the mean time spent in a series of clinical health states that differ in terms of quality of life. These states are then weighted according to a range of relative values with regard to the quality of life of each health state, and the weighted health state durations are used to compare the treatments.

When utility scores are not predefined, the group comparison can be undertaken by computing the group effect for various values of the utility score. When two utility scores are unknown and two groups are being compared, the group comparison can be plotted for all possible values of the unknown utility scores in a two-dimensional graph called a threshold utility analysis. Contour lines can be used to indicate the magnitude of the Q-TWiST treatment effect associated with different pairs of utility values. The contour lines corresponding to a group effect of zero is called the threshold line, which indicates all utility value pairs for which the group effects are equal in terms of Q-TWiST. Confidence bounds for the threshold line can also be plotted to define regions of utility score values for which the group effect is statistically significant (at the p
                           =0.05 level).

It is also possible to investigate how the Q-TWiST group effect unfolds during the course of follow-up. This is accomplished by performing the analysis at an evenly spaced sequence of time leading up to the follow up limit L. For example, if there are ten years of follow up, then the analysis could be restricted to yearly intervals beginning at zero and ending at ten. The estimated group effect can be potted on a time axis in order to display the results. A single curve can be plotted for any specific combination of score values, and a shaded region can be used to display the range of the group effect as the utility scores range between zero and one. This is called the Q-TWiST gain function because it illustrates the amount of quality-adjusted survival time gained for one group compared to another [15,16].

Q-TWiST can be estimated for different groups of patients, usually 2 groups (0 for the control group and 1 for the experimental group for example). Let Q=Q-TWiST. Then the null and alternative hypotheses are the following:

                         represents the estimated value of Q-TWiST in group g, g=0,1 and 
                           
                              σ
                              ˆ
                           
                         represents the estimated standard error (estimated using the bootstrap method) of the difference between groups 0 and 1. The normal distribution can be used to test differences under the null hypothesis, via the calculation of an empirical probability. In the same manner, restricted means for each health state can also be compared between groups.

The qtwist function, written in the R language performs Q-TWiST analyses. The program uses functions to perform utility analyses, threshold analyses and gain functions by comparing weighted time spent in three health states between 2 groups of patients.

To use the function, it is necessary to download and install two R packages: gplots 
                     [17] and survival 
                     [18]. Information and details of how to install packages for other operating systems are available in the R Installation and Administration manual (http://www.Rproject.org) [19].

The function must be loaded in the work session and requires the following arguments:


                     qtwist (visit, fu, gm, tp, utility, fix_utility, nb_boot).

The 2 first arguments are data files and the other arguments are option parameters.

Two data files are needed as input arguments and they must be expressed as an R numeric matrix.

The “visit” file contains information about patient's health state during the study, the number of columns being equal to three:
                              
                                 -
                                 the first column represents the patient identification (integer >0);

the second column is the time (≥0) that a particular toxicity severity grade was observed (calculated from patient entry into the study);

the third column corresponds to severity grade (integer 0–5) of the corresponding toxicity (0 corresponding to no toxicity).

Note: It is important to identify all visits times corresponding to a change in the degree of severity.

The “fu” file contains information about patient's follow-up and disease state, the number of rows being equal to the number of patients and the number of columns being equal to six:
                              
                                 -
                                 the first column represents patient identification (integer >0);

the second column is the time (≥0) until relapse (or last follow-up news otherwise);

the third column corresponds to relapse status (0 no relapse, 1 relapse);

the fourth column represents time (≥0) until death (or last follow-up news otherwise);

the fifth column is the death status (0 alive, 1 death);

the sixth column corresponds to the group membership (0 for control group and 1 for experimental group).

All times are calculated from patient entry into the study and should be expressed in the same units.

The time used for the toxicity survival curve corresponds to the total time spent in toxicity TOX, so qtwist calculates it by summing all the periods of toxicity which occur before the time of relapse or death or last follow-up news. As long as a patient does not change toxicity grade, he stays in the last grade known.

The time used for the relapse survival curve corresponds to the time to relapse or death REL, so qtwist takes the minimum time between time until relapse and time until death.

Five input parameters are necessary to run the function.
                              
                                 -
                                 
                                    
                                       gm
                                     (integer 1–5) represents the minimum grade of toxicity taken into account in the analysis. It must be inferior or equal to the maximal grade of toxicity in the “visit” matrix. For example, if gm
                                    =2, all grade 1 toxicities are ignored. Numbers other than integers 1–5 result in an error message.


                                    
                                       tp
                                     (number >0) is the time-point for which restricted means are estimated.


                                    
                                       utility
                                     (vector of length 3) corresponds to the utility score for the utility analysis (number between 0 and 1) fixed for the toxicity, TWiST and relapse in this order. For example, if utility
                                    =c (0.8, 1, 0.5), utility score is 0.8 for toxicity, 1 for TWiST and 0.5 for relapse.


                                    
                                       fix_utility
                                     (integer 1–3) represents the health state whose score is fixed for the threshold analysis and for the gain function (1 for toxicity, 2 for TWiST and 3 for relapse). The utility value is fixed as the value chosen in the parameter “utility”. For example, if fix_utility
                                    =2 and utility
                                    =c(0.8, 1, 0.5), the score is fixed for TWiST and its value is 1. Numbers other than integers 1–3 result in an error message.


                                    
                                       nb_boot
                                     (integer >10) is the number of bootstrap samples used for the estimations. The larger “nb_boot”is, the better the estimates are. Even though 10 iterations have been set as a minimum, we recommend at least 500 samples for good estimates.

Several data checks are performed by the 
                              qtwist
                           function: “visit” matrix and “fu” matrix must be imported as matrix and all columns must be numeric. No missing values are allowed. In the “visit” matrix, visit times for the same patient must be different. Time until relapse should not exceed time until death, and visits in the “visit” matrix should occur before the times until relapse or death or last follow-up in the associated “fu” matrix. In the first situation, the program will stop. In the second situation, visits after relapse or death or last-follow-up are ignored. All the patients in the “visit” matrix must be identified in the “fu” matrix.

The function also checks if the option parameters are correctly specified. If the “nb_boot” parameter is less than 500, the program prints a warning saying estimates will not be precise enough.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In the case all the checking are correct, the function prints the following results in the R windows. It also exports as a PDF file called “Q-TWiST analysis.pdf” with the following results:

The following example concerns a simulated data set spanning 7 years (tp
                        
                        =
                        
                        7), studying grade ≥2 of toxicity (gm
                        
                        =
                        
                        2) for ten patients. Tables 1a and 1b
                        
                         represents the “visit” and “fu” matrix as they are used in the R function except that qtwist needs two groups. Note that three patients who did not have toxicities are absent in the “visit” matrix. A total of five relapses and three deaths were observed and seven patients entered in toxicity of grade ≥2.

First, qtwist calculates the time spent in toxicity by summing all episodes of time spent in toxicity. For example, patient 7 spent 4 years in toxicity: grade 2 from year 1 to 3, grade 3 from year 3 to 4, grade 4 from year 4 to 5. All toxicities after 5 years are not taken into account because patient 7 relapsed at this time. All toxicities of grade 1 are not taken into account since gm
                        
                        =
                        
                        2: for example patient 10 is not considered in TOX from year 5 to 6.

Kaplan Meier survival rates are then estimated for TOX, RFS and OS (Table 2a
                        ) in order to calculate the restricted means at the time point fixed at year 7. These estimations are available in the list outputted by the function ($survival). Restricted means for each component correspond to the area under the survival curve TOX, RFS and OS respectively (Table 2b
                        ). The restricted mean health state duration for TWiST corresponds to the difference of the RFS and TOX restricted means. Restricted means health state duration for REL corresponds to the difference of the OS and RFS restricted means (Table 2b).

Finally, Q-TWiST estimation is calculated by summing each weighed restricted means health state. In this example, for a utility score value of 0.2 for TOX, 1 for TWiST and 0.5 for REL (utility
                        
                        =
                        
                        c(0.2,1,0.5)), the quality adjusted time without symptoms of disease and toxicity estimate is 3.8 years (Table 2b).


                        Fig. 1
                         is a graphical representation of the partitioned health states over time up to the time point at year 7. The upper, middle and lower lines correspond to the OS, RFS and TOX curve respectively. The three health states are represented in yellow for TOX blue for TWiST and red for REL.

All these results can be found by using qtwist with this small example after duplicating group 0 and thus creating a second group 1. For this example, the input is the following:qtwist(visit,fu,2,7,c(0.2,1,0.5),2,500)
                     

Consequently, the Q-TWiST treatment effect is 0.

The example in this section concerns data from a Phase III trial comparing two low dose rates in brachytherapy, 204 patients were randomized between two groups (0.4Gy/h (Group 0) and 0.8Gy/h (Group 1)) (10). The qtwist function was used to evaluate restricted mean quality adjusted survival between the two groups.

First, the data files corresponding to this study need to be loaded in R. All severity grade of complications will be taken into account (gm
                        
                        =
                        
                        1). The time point for the restricted means will be fixed at 1419 days corresponding to the median follow-up (tp
                        
                        =
                        
                        1419).

The corresponding parameters are provided below.


                        qtwist(visit, fu, 1, 1419, c(0.8,1,0.5), 2, 500)
                     

For the utility analysis, utility scores were arbitrarily fixed at 0.8 for toxicity, 1 for TWIiST and 0.5 for relapse (utility
                        
                        =
                        
                        c(0.8,1,0.5)). For the threshold analysis and for the Q-TWiST gain function, the utility score is fixed for TWiST (fix_utility
                        
                        =
                        
                        2). The number of bootstrap sample for the estimates is 500 (nb_boot
                        
                        =
                        
                        500).

The checking shows input parameters are “OK”. However, a warning message is displayed in the first output to point out that one or more visits in the “visit” matrix are ignored because they occur after the date of relapse.

                        Table 3
                         summarizes results performed by the R function. Analyses are also exported to the “Q-TWiST analysis.pdf” PDF file.

The event summary shows that less toxicities and less relapses or deaths occurred in group 0 than in group 1. In groups 0 and 1 and 0 respectively, 64 and 76 patients entered at least once into the toxicity health state. Also, there were less relapses in group 0 (n
                        =26) than in group 1 (n
                        =35). In this example, no deaths were recorded as the relapse state actually corresponds to relapse or death.

Restricted means are estimated at 1419 days on the one hand from the data and on the other hand 500 bootstrap samples. This option allows an estimation of the standard error (SE). For both groups, restricted means estimated with the bootstrap method are close to restricted mean estimated with the data.

Restricted mean health state duration show that group 1 spends more time in toxicity (62 days) and in relapse (81 days) and less time in TWiST (143 days) than group 0. Also, patients in group 1 spend 53 days less in Q-TWiST than patients in group 0, however the differences are not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained from the SAS code kindly provided by Bernard Cole (Table 3): Q-TWiST treatment effect is 52.9 days in favor of group 0 (95% confidence interval: −118.3 to 12.5) 53.0 days in favor of group 0 (95% confidence interval: −114.8 to 8.7) respectively with SAS program and R program. Small differences between the two programs were observed and are due to different samples generated with the bootstrap methods.

Some graphics are also available in the PDF file.

Partitioned survival curves are plotted for each group and delimit the three health states (Fig. 2a). Graphics show that the colored areas are quite close between both groups.

The threshold utility analysis plot contains in the bottom left corner the fixed utility scores and the time point (Fig. 2b). In this example, the utility score for TWiST is fixed at one and the time point is limited to 1419 days. The legend indicates the significance of the group effect: yellow if the difference is significant in favor of group 1, dark gray if the difference is significant in favor of group 0 and light gray if the difference is not significant. In the example, there is no significant difference for the treatment difference, whatever utility score values for toxicity and relapse are used. When utility score is 0.8 for toxicity and 0.5 for relapse, there is a non significant difference of about −53 days for the treatment effect (Table 3).

The Q-TWiST gain function is plotted from time 0 until the time point at 1419 days (Fig. 2c). This curve continues to decrease with time, showing a continuous increase in the difference in favor of group 0. The middle line represents the quality adjusted survival for the group comparison with the utility score used for the utility analysis: 0.8 for toxicity, 1 for TWiST and 0.5 for relapse. A 53 day difference in favor of group 0 is also found at 1419 days.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The R function presented in this paper permits a study of quality of life adjusted survival analysis using the Q-TWiST method. This function computes descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and quality of life adjusted survival analyses with associated confidence intervals and test statistics. An important advantage of this package is that it provides a visual representation. It thus allows the investigators to see in one graph the benefits and risks for the groups being compared. Most publications have compared two different treatment strategies, but this methodology can be applied just as readily to specific patient characteristics such as age and gender, or disease characteristics such as stage and histology.

The qtwist function is available in the free access environment R. As the SAS program, it provides for each group and for group comparison restricted means estimates for each health state with standard errors and the associated 95% confidence intervals, a partitioned survival plot by group and a threshold analysis plot. For the example used in this application, results similar to those with SAS were observed. Further to the SAS program, our function provides failure event description, empirical probabilities, as well as a gain functional of which are exported to a PDF file.

To analyze this type of data, Pepe et al. [3] proposed the use of the prevalence function, defined as the probability of being in a specific health state at time t among patients alive without relapse. This method takes into account duration and transitions between the state of complication unlike conventional methods of survival analysis or competing risks which are limited to the time to first event. Lancar et al. [4] developed a weighted prevalence function, which is obtained from the weighted sum of the prevalence function associated with a specific severity category at a specific time point. This generalization produces a score that takes into account not only the duration of the transitions but also the severity of complications. These R functions have been recently published [5]. The interpretation however is different between prevalence and Q-TWiST because Q-TWiST is based on cumulative survival time while the prevalence function allows a conditional dynamic approach for evaluating the proportion of patients in a particular state at each time point. Research is ongoing for the adaptation of Q-TWiST by taking into account in a similar manner, weights associated with severity of the toxicity health state.

The R function provided in this paper could be improved by incorporating prognostic factors by using proportional hazards regression models. Graphical representation for the time to transitions between the clinical health states for various patient profiles can be used for prediction purposes, allowing one to examine how prognosis affects the treatment evaluation in terms of Q-TWiST [20]. An important challenge in quality adjusted of live is the choice and interpretation of utility scores. Ideally these weights should be determined a priori, from the following sources: health indices from quality of life questionnaires, from non study participants with similar cancers, or estimated by oncology professionals [21]. When this is not the case, sensitivity analyses can be performed in order to evaluate the influence of utility weights [22].

Additional analyses can be performed using the list of objects returned by the R function and other graphics can be plotted directly in R. The aim of our function is to make easier Q-TWiST analysis and to compare them with other methods for the analyses of survival data adjusted for quality of life.
