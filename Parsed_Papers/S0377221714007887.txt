                  This paper considers returns policies under which consumers’ valuation depends on the refund amount they receive and the length of time they must wait after the item is returned. Consumers face an uncertain valuation before purchase, and the realization of that purchase's value occurs only after the return deadline has passed. Depending on the product lifecycle length and magnitude of return rate, a retailer decides on strategies for that product's return deadline, including return prohibition, life-cycle return, and fixed return deadline. In addition, the influence of the return deadline on consumers’ behavior and the pricing and inventory policies of the retailer are systematically investigated. Moreover, based on the analysis of consumer return behavior on a traditional buy-back contract, we present a new differentiated buy-back contract, contingent on return deadline, to coordinate a supply chain consisting of an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer. Finally, extensions on some specific behavioral factors such as moral hazard, inertia return, and external effect are investigated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In today's society, consumer returns are increasing drastically because consumers are taking advantage of the retail industry's slogan that the “consumer is king.” Today's consumers have more requirements for product attributes and they are more vigilant about return policies (Shulman, Coughlan, & Savaskan, 2010, 2011). Because of the increasing number of products released in the market, consumer uncertainty has also increased; the volume of available retail goods dictates whether a particular product is deemed suitable for individual consumer preferences. Hence, the main reason for consumer returns is no longer product quality issues. Instead, a number of other reasons generate product returns, including installation difficulties, product performance incompatibility with consumer preferences, and buyer remorse (Kumar, Guide, & Van Wassenhove, 2002). If an unconditional 100 percent money-back guarantee is offered, a retailer should expect frequent product returns. Ferguson, Guide, and Souza (2006) first observed False Failure Returns (FFR), defined as products with no functional or cosmetic defect that are nonetheless returned by consumers. Mainly, FFR results from consumer uncertainty over the valuation of a product before purchase, and other uncertainties such as a product not satisfying consumer expectations, the consumer's difficulty in understanding how to use a product, or the consumer's regret over an impulse purchase (Su, 2009; Shulman et al., 2011). Based on a study conducted by Shear, Speh, and Stock (2002), US consumer returns amount to more than $100 billion each year, of which FFRs account for 80 percent (Lawton, 2008). Recently, many firms have enacted standard practices to consider FFR; retailers want to improve their service level and to eliminate consumer losses from uncertain estimations over sold products. For example, vendors like Toys“R”Us, Wal-Mart, and Amazon encourage FFR or unconditional returns, and these return services are offered to the consumers with return deadlines of either 15, 45, or 90 days
                        1

                      for different products from various vendors.

Although encouraging FFR improves consumer satisfaction, it increases the risks for retailers at the same time. In addition, it also generates huge volume returns, which adversely affects the retailer's inventory and ordering strategies. Furthermore, it directly influences the production schedule of upstream manufacturers. Meanwhile, a large quantity of returns leads to a reduction in the marginal profit of the retailer given that returns are usually resold at discounts. Under such circumstances, consumers have no risk. Even though FFR is practiced by many vendors, most of the vendors have started tightening their generous return policies (Earnest & Uribarri, 2007; Li, Xu, & Li, 2013). Generally, when a consumer returns a product, the retailer may charge a restocking or handling fee, or they may ask the consumer to pay the shipping fee for returns. This unconditional return policy is currently adopted by Walmart.com and Taobao.com etc.

                        2
                        For the return policy adopted by Amazon.com, refer to “Returns Are Easy” term http://www.amazon.com/gp/css/returns/homepage.html/ref=hy_f_4. For Taobao.com's return policy, refer to http://www.tmall.com/?spm=1.6659421.754904973.1.RKFLOD.
                      In addition to the above fee, the retailer may also set up a fixed return deadline and accept only products returned within that specified period. These fees and fixed return deadline requirements are similar to “hassle” costs and punishments imposed on consumers (Shulman, Coughlan, & Savaskan, 2009). When consumers view the shipping fee of the returned product as relatively expensive, or find the product economically nonviable for return by the fixed deadline, they may instead decide to hold on to it. In this way, pricing strategy, refund policy, and return deadline strategy temper consumer decision-making regarding impetuous purchases by introducing potential misgivings about the expenses they may incur, with an end result of reducing the occurrence of FFR (Shulman et al., 2009).

Due to the wide range of product categories offered in the market, various retailers calculate return expenses differently. For electronic items, for example, the Apple store charges 10 percent of the selling price as restocking fee, whereas Bestbuy.com charges 25 percent on household appliances. The return expense of some pasta products is pegged at 15 percent. For products with different lifecycles, retailers in other industries set return deadlines of varying lengths. For example, at Sears, the return deadline is 120 days for most of the items, 90 days for fine jewelry, and 60 days for electronics and beds,
                        3

                      whereas at Wal-Mart, 90 days for most items, 45 days for PC accessories, 30 days for cameras, and 15 days for PCs and cell phones. In general, a short return deadline is generally applied to seasonal products with a short lifecycle; the best example would include fashion items. Conversely, a relatively long return deadline is applied to more durable goods.

Based on the above-mentioned practices, in this paper we focus on retailer pricing and refund policies. Moreover, we study the return deadline and inventory policy of the retailer for products with different lifecycles. In addition, this work concentrates on the management of returned and unsold products. In practice, when the retailers receive the returned product, they redirect the product to their forward suppliers through some cooperation mechanisms, such as a kind of supply contract. It is evident from the literature that there exists many types of contracts to achieve supply chain coordination, but none addresses the issues related to the return deadline constraints. In consideration of this issue, we investigate the efficiency of several buy-back contracts related to decentralized supply chain coordination within return deadline constraints.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly discuss the current literature and the contributions of this paper in Section 2. Section 3 presents the research problem on consumer purchasing, return behavior, and retailer pricing policies. In Section 4, we formulate the basic model and derive the optimal refund policy, return deadline, and inventory policy. In Section 5, we examine the effect of several buy-back contracts on supply chain coordination. We explore some extensions in Section 6 including behavioral factors like moral hazard, inertia return behavior, and external effect. The concluding remarks and possible directions for future research are provided at the end of the paper. To simplify our exposition: (i) we use “he” and “she” to represent the retailer and consumer, respectively throughout this paper, and (ii) all proofs are provided in Appendix A.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In the following, we provide a brief discussion of related literature under four important dimensions, such as: (1) consumer purchasing behavior; (2) consumer return behavior; (3) product return policies; and (4) buy-back contracts within supply chains.

The main focus of this paper is devoted to researching consumer behavior in relation to operations management. We highlight the relationship among consumer demand, product inventory, and pricing policy. For example, when one consumer considers making a purchase depending on her expectations of what will be the future price, this forward-looking behavior has been widely addressed in consumer behavior literature (e.g., Aviv & Pazgal, 2008; Elmaghraby, Gülcü, & Keskinocak, 2008; Su, 2007), where consumer purchasing decisions often depend on future prices, especially when those products are on sale. At the same time, this strategic consumer behavior involves constant anticipation of markdowns, offered when there is excess inventory (Cachon & Swinney, 2009; Liu & Ryzin, 2008
                        ; 
                        Su & Zhang, 2007). In contrast to the above, the risk of stock-outs discourages consumer patronage (Dana & Petruzzi, 2001; Su & Zhang, 2009).

The next more relevant literature on consumer behavior is about consumer purchasing decisions in relation to pricing history. Based on the reference effect theory, consumer purchasing decisions are taken by previously observed prices or through observations of prices of similar products relative to the reference price (for example, Kopalle, Rao, & Assunção, 1996; Nasiry & Popescu, 2011; Popescu & Wu, 2007). In all cases, consumer demand is endogenously determined and dependent on the pricing and inventory decisions of the retailer. A paper similar to ours is that of Su (2009), who considers consumers being uncertain about valuation. However, the author focuses only on fit risk, pertaining to whether a particular item matches consumer needs or tastes. In our work, the valuation model proposed by Su (2009) is extended to a more realistic case, where consumer valuation is stochastically dependent on the retailers’ return deadline. Generally, the return deadline has a huge impact on consumers’ valuation (Davis, Hagerty, & Gerstner, 1998), and specifically, the more generous a return deadline, the more value consumers expect (Kirmani & Rao, 2000; 
                        Mukhopadhyay & Setaputra, 2004).

The next important dimension of this paper is about consumer return behavior. Most of the earlier research assumed that consumer returns follow Poisson processes, and a relevant inventory control model is studied under such settings (Cohen, Pierskalla, & Nahmias, 1980; Fleischmann, Kuik, & Dekker, 2002; Kelle & Silver, 1989). But recently the interest has shifted to consumer returns that depend on the decision variables of the retailer, such as pricing, refunds, and product quality. Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2004) analyzed the impact of pricing and return policies on consumer purchasing and return decisions under a direct-sale model, and they assumed that return quantity depends only on return policy. Based on a survey released by PWC (2000)

                         consumer returns are prompted to a certain extent by quality-related problems, and not merely by refunds. Based on Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2004), Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2007) integrated product design quality into their previous model and investigated the relationship between design quality and price of the product, and the firm's return policy. With the increasing quality improvement, recently most of the product returns are referred to as FFR, or returns prompted/stimulated by the discrepancy between consumer expectations and actual product offerings. Ferguson et al. (2006) analyzed supply chain coordination with FFR rooted in differential pricing of two retailers. In practice, returned products are those that do not match consumer tastes to a large extent (Ferguson et al., 2006; Lawton, 2008; Su, 2009). Under such settings, Su (2009) studied the effect of full refund and partial refund policies on supply chain performance. The present study, however, considers consumer valuation as stochastically dependent on retailer-set return deadlines and fit risk. In addition, several specific and common behavioral factors related to product returns are discussed in the forthcoming sections. These factors include moral hazard, inertia return, and external effect.

Return policies, in particular to refund policy, are vital in consumer purchasing and return decisions (Mukhopadhyay & Setaputra, 2004; 
                        Su, 2009). Courty (2003), Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2004), and Su (2009) investigated the effect of partial and full refunds on consumer returns. Because of malicious returns and moral hazard (Baiman, Fischer, & Rajan, 2000; 
                        Davis, Gerstner, & Hagerty, 1995), a full refund policy leads to unnecessary returns; this type of refund policy is not optimal (Davis et al., 1995; Su 2009). Davis et al. (1998) argued that partial refunds are readily observable by consumers, but they may view such refunds as unfair because the retailer keeps the non-refunded portion and consequently negatively affects the retailer's image and the consumer's loyalty (Hart, 1988). At the same time, there exists some hassle costs which prevent such negative effects; examples are direct cash transfers to the retailer, obtained through refusal of items returned without receipts, deadlines on returns, returns with original packaging, and so on (Davis et al., 1998), and restocking fee (Shulman et al., 2009). In contrast to the above literature, we isolate and simultaneously consider both refund policies and deadline on returns, and also discuss the effect of consumer return behavior on retailer decisions. A related study on return deadline is carried out by Janakiraman and Ordóñez (2012); they use an empirical method to study the relationship of return rate and return deadline mediated by return effort. Unlike present papers, we construct a mathematical model and investigate how consumer return behavior and return rate influence return deadlines for products with different lifecycles. For more detailed reviews on reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain, see Govindan, Soleimani, and Kannan (2014).

There are several types of contracts identified in the literature for forward and reverse supply chains. Of all available contracts, the main contracts for reverse logistics are revenue sharing contracts (Govindan & Popiuc, 2014; 
                        Xiao, Yang, & Shen, 2011), buy-back contracts (Chen & Bell, 2011; Xiao, Shi, & Yang, 2010) and quantity discount contracts (Huang, Choi, Ching, Siu, & Huang, 2011). For more detailed reviews on coordination contracts within forward and reverse supply chains, see Govindan, Popiuc, and Diabat (2013). Recent research on buy-back contracts focuses mainly on the demand model of downstream market. Pasternack (1985) analyzed buy-back contracts in the context of a newsvendor problem, while Padmanabhan and Png (1997) considered the buy-back contract to analyze the interaction between manufacturers and retailers. Emmons and Gilbert (1998) studied buy-back contracts with a retail price-setting newsvendor, while Lee, Padmanabhan, Taylor, and Whang (2000) studied model price protection policies to closely resemble a buy-back. Taylor (2002) incorporated a buy-back contract into a sales rebate contract to coordinate newsvendor and effort-dependent demand. Different from the above-mentioned works, our study considers a setting where consumer demand depends on retail price, refunds, and return deadline. In this environment, we study the buy-back contract in the presence of consumer returns. Moreover, in this work, the buy-back contract is refined to coordinate problems caused by unsold products and consumer returns.

Clearly, coordination efficiency of buy-back contracts depends on demand model and retailer decisions. Pasternack (1985) demonstrated that a buy-back contract enables coordination of the supply chain when a supplier offers to buy-back all unsold units at partial credit. Further, Emmons and Gilbert (1998) suggested that the buy-back contract does not coordinate newsvendor and price-dependent demand; however, the contract may still offer better performance than a wholesale-price contract. The buy-back contract enables coordination of the supply chain, unless the retailer commits to a selling price before the selling season (Berstein & Federgruen, 2005). So far, the above discussed studies focus only on demand models, while this work focuses on integrated returns and the demand model. The study of Su (2009) is similar to ours in that it considers consumer return behavior as dependent on both retailer pricing and refund decisions. The author finds that the traditional buy-back contract fails to stimulate supply chain coordination, and that a differentiated buy-back
                           6
                        
                        
                           6
                           In a differentiated buy-back contract, the unsold products and returned products are distinguished for different credits. This contract has three parameters: w, b, and l. Under this contract, the manufacturer sells to the retailer at the wholesale price w but agrees to buy back all remaining units. The retailer receives a credit of b for each new (unsold) unit, but for returned items, the credit is reduced by l per unit. For more details, refer to Su (2009).
                         contract should be proposed to realize this. Nevertheless, the author does not consider the effect of a return deadline decision on the consumer return behavior, whereas we specifically model the return deadline decision based on consumer return behavior. A differentiated buy-back contract fails to achieve coordination when the salvage value depends on the time consumers take to return a product (called time-to-return, hereafter). Therefore, we put forward a new differentiated buy-back contract that is contingent upon the return deadline, which sets different buy-back prices on unsold/returned units. To be specific, the buy-back price provided ensures that return units are dependent on the return deadline.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.

First, this paper contributes to product return policy issues by highlighting the return deadline. Most of the existing literature investigates the refund policy of the retailer, but this paper complements the return policy by examining the retailer's return deadline which influences the consumer's purchasing decisions. Depending on the product life cycle length and magnitude of return rate, we study strategies of return deadline, including return prohibition, life-cycle returns, and fixed return deadline. The influence of the return deadline on consumers’ behavior and retailers’ pricing and inventory policies are also systematically investigated.

The second contribution is a new differentiated buy-back contract depending on the return deadline. In practice, the salvage value of unsold or returned products is contingent upon the time
                           7
                        
                        
                           7
                           In this paper, the time refers to “the period in which consumers can return a product after purchasing it.”
                         (Guide, Souza, Van Wassenhove, & Blackburn, 2006). In general, the return time has two cases: one with products that are returned early and the other with products returned later. Products that are returned early may have more opportunities to the re-enter sales channel through simple repackaging or refurbishing, whereas products that are returned later have lower salvage value. Hence, existing buy-back contracts present loss of efficiency in supply chain coordination due to decreasing salvage value. In order to address this issue, we discuss coordination efficiency of the proposed supply contract in this paper.

Finally, by considering several specific behavioral factors such as moral hazard, inertia return, and external effect, we investigate specific return behaviors and perform a managerial analysis of decision-making when retailers encounter these behaviors.

This paper considers a two-stage supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. The chronology of events is described as follows. At the beginning of the sales season, the manufacturer produces the product at unit cost c, and sells it to the retailer at a wholesale price w. At the retailer end, he decides to order quantity Q and sell at a price p, with a return policy for FFRs including refund r and a return deadline t. Later, a group of homogeneous consumers decides whether to purchase the product on the basis of expected utility surplus, and return the product on the basis of observed utility before the return deadline (if purchasing the product). Finally, at the end of the sales season, all leftover products are salvaged at price s.

Due to the uncertainty of their evaluation of appropriateness of a product, consumers estimate the consumption utility before purchase. Usually, consumer consumption utility depends not only on one's preference for a product and enjoyment of using it, but also on selling price p, refund r, and return deadline t set by retailer. The consumer's valuation of the product utility is related to the length of the return deadline. According to Davis et al. (1998), given a return deadline t, the consumer obtains an extra perceptive value βt (β ≥ 0),
                        8
                     
                     
                        8
                        In this paper, the perceptive value is independent of the consumer valuation; it only refers to the value that the consumer perceives from the return deadline, and the latter refers to the prior valuation on the product itself regardless of the return deadline.
                      where β is the consumer's perceptive value parameter; the larger the extra perceptive value, the more easily the product is consumed or imitated (Longo, 1995). Before a product is bought, the consumer's valuation of this product is expressed as follows: V(t) = V + βt, where V is the consumer's initial valuation, which is independent of the return deadline. We assume that V ∼ U[l, h] [for a uniform distribution assumption on the consumer valuation assumption, also see Davis et al. (1998) and Shulman et al. (2009)

                           Davis et al. (1998) consider a similar consumer return problem, and adopt a uniform distribution over [0, 1] to examine the optimal solution. It is a special case in our paper when a return deadline is not considered. Shulman et al. (2009) also adopt a [0, 1] uniform distribution; however, they consider a case of two horizontally differentiated products. Similarly, Shulman et al. (2010) also use this uniform distribution.
                     ], and v is the realization of random valuation V.

For a given price p, if the consumer's utility is larger than zero, the consumer purchases the product, otherwise, she does not purchase. After the product is purchased, a consumer prefers to keep the product if the consumer's perceived utility is larger than refund (v + β
                     t ≥ r). For a consumer with a lower perceived utility (v + β
                     t < r), she may keep the product. Given differences in the consumer consumption behavior, not all consumers perceive product utility simultaneously. Regardless of whether perception of the product utility occurs simultaneously, the time it takes a consumer to return a product may not coincide with the period at which the consumer's perceived utility is inconsistent with her expectations because of inertia and other reasons like forgetting to return the product (Su, 2009).

Using a previous study on return proportion and time-to-return as a basis (Hess and Mayhew, 1997), we assume that the return ratio by time t is H(t) and H'(t) > 0, H''(t) ≥ 0. Hess and Mayhew (1997) use an analysis of return data of an American fashion apparel direct retailer as the basis in their study, and show that the relationship between return proportion of sold products and time-to-return can be depicted by the split-adjusted hazard model. For each consumer, we assume that time-to-return t is a random variable, with p.d.f.
 ψ(t) and c.d.f.
 Ψ(t). Correspondingly, the hazard rate of time-to-return is h(t) = ψ(t)/[1 − Ψ(t)]. We further assume that time-to-return follows an exponential distribution, i.e.
, h(t) = λ exp( − λt). For a given return deadline, the consumer's return ratio is H(t) = 1 − exp( − λt). For tractability of our model analysis, we use H(t) = λt to approximate 1 − exp( − λt), and λ is the arrival rate of consumers who will return their purchased products, which occurs when λt for 0 < t < T is relatively small, and where T is product lifecycle. Here, H(t) is equal to the return ratio of sold products before the return deadline under a setting of homogenous consumers.

                     Note: In the following, we first analyze the decisions problem of the retailer as a newsvendor model, and based on the result of the decisions of the retailer, we turn to the supply chain problem, and study the supply chain coordination problem. In consideration of this approach in the decisions section of the retailer, we use the term “a newsvendor model” to represent the decisions model of the retailer.

                     Here the first term denotes expected utility when the consumer's perceived utility is more than or equal to the refund, while the second and third terms indicate expected utility for returning and not returning a product before the return deadline, respectively, under the condition that expected utility is lower than the refund. Note that for a product not returned before return deadline, many ways exist for the consumer to dispose of it: for example, selling it in the secondary market, giving it to friends, and so on. For simplicity, this paper considers the case of a consumer keeping the product without considering disposing of it in more detail.

As the aforementioned equation shows, the optimal selling price is the sum of the consumer valuation, perceptive value, and potential refund. When the refund policy is not offered, the optimal selling price is 
                        p
                      =EV. When a refund policy without a deadline is offered, the optimal selling price is 
                        
                           
                              p
                              ¯
                           
                           =
                           E
                           
                           max
                           
                              {
                              
                                 V
                                 ,
                                 r
                              
                              }
                           
                        
                     . The optimal price under a general return policy is usually higher than that of without a return policy. But, a long return deadline resulting in a higher selling price does not always hold, indicating that 
                        
                           p
                           ¯
                        
                      is not higher than p* (refer to Proposition 3 for details).

The retailer may offer flexible return policies, like full and partial refunds. At the same time, the retailer can also set up a fixed return deadline, where in the case that a product is returned beyond the deadline, a no-return policy is offered. Thus, at the beginning of the selling season, three decisions should be determined: the selling price, order quantity, and return policies (mainly referring to refund quantity and time-to-return). Using analysis of the consumer utility and the selling price as basis, we provide an explanation for return and order policies.

Because Δ is independent of E min{Q, X} and Q, the maximization of Δ necessitates the identification of an optimal selling price and refund policy to maximize the objective function. The event chronology is as follows: first, the retailer determines the return deadline and then offers a different refund policy in light of each return deadline. In this logic, we use the backward deduction method to solve the retailer's optimal return deadline and refund decisions. We first analyze the retailer's optimal refund, and then derive the retailer's optimal return deadline based on the refund.

                        Theorem 1
                        
                           In a newsvendor model, the optimal refund of the retailer is r* = S(t).
                        

When the retailer offers a return policy with a return deadline, the optimal refund amount is not the salvage value of the leftover product. As a special case in our study, Su (2009) finds that under the assumption of no difference between returned and leftover products, the optimal refund is the salvage value of the leftover product. On the contrary, Theorem 1 shows that the optimal refund is the salvage value of the returned product, indicating that the optimal refund depends on the time-to-return. It also indicates that the consumer return is dependent on the return deadline because once a product is returned, the consumer needs to make a tradeoff among refund, salvage value, and perceptive value before the return deadline.

                        Corollary 1
                        
                           Return policy with a deadline is always better than no-return policy.
                        

This corollary implies that when the consumer is uncertain about a product value, the optimal return policy of the retailer is to offer one with a specific deadline instead of a no-return policy. This policy is also consistent with the conclusion of Su (2009), whose results show that the optimal return policy is to offer a partial refund policy that does not impose a specific return deadline.

Regarding the value decay of product returns with time (Guide et al., 2006), we assume that the salvage value of a returned product is characterized as S(t) = S − kt, where S represents initial value at a certain time, k denotes the product value decay per unit time, and k ≤ S/T.

                        Corollary 2
                        
                           In the newsvendor model, the optimal value of the return deadline for a return policy is as follows:

                     and 2
                     in different scenarios of λ.

Obviously 
                        λ
                      is a threshold value. When the arrival rate satisfies that λ > 
                        λ
                      , Δ (or ∏
                        R
                     ) is a quadratic function of the return deadline t; otherwise, Δ (or ∏
                        R
                     ) is a monotonically increasing function of t. Note that when the perceptive value β = 0, it can be easily proved that the condition λ > 
                        λ
                      always holds. Therefore, the properties of retailer's profit with respect to return deadline t when β = 0 are similar to those under the condition 
                        λ
                      <λ ≤ 1. In addition, when t = 0, Δ = p − s > 0. When t* = T, Δ (or ∏
                        R
                     ) is maximized and Δ(T) > 0.


                     Corollary 2 shows that there are three return deadline policies for the retailer, namely: no FFR, life-cycle return, and fixed-time-limit return. The return deadline policy is contingent upon the consumer return ratio, product lifecycle and the profit of the retailer under different return deadline policies.

To be specific, under a situation where the return ratio is large, for a product with a short lifecycle, retailer can set up a return deadline approach to the product's lifecycle. For the product with a long lifecycle, the return deadline offered depends on many other factors like demand characteristics, return ratio, salvage value of returned product, and so forth. Especially for products with moderate lifecycle, the retailer can set up a fixed-time-limit return policy.

When the return ratio is small enough, or the return ratio is negligible that the return quantity can be disregarded even in relation to the product's lifecycle, then the retailer can offer a return policy without a return deadline. Considering return ratio and return deadlines, Janakiraman and Ordóñez (2012) found a similar result when the return effort is low.

As addressed above, the retailer can offer a return policy without a return deadline under specific conditions. As a special case in our study, Su (2009) considered a consumer return problem without a return deadline where the consumer return is mainly dependent on the selling price, refund, and valuation, but not on the return deadline.

                        Proposition 1
                        
                           In the newsvendor model, the optimal return deadline has the following properties:
                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    Optimal return deadline t* is monotonically decreasing in return ratio λ;


                                    Optimal return deadline t* is monotonically increasing in salvage value s;


                                    Optimal return deadline t* is monotonically increasing in perceptive value β.

All the corollaries above are derived using the first-order conditions of results in Corollary 2.

This is an intuitive and interesting result. When the return ratio is large, the retailer can shorten the return deadline to reduce the return quantity. For instance, with electronics that always have a high return ratio, Sears set up its time frame for return of electronics to be tighter (within 30 days) compared to other merchandise (within 90 days) (Merrick & Brat, 2005). The higher the salvage value of the returned product, the lower the loss stemming from it and the longer the return deadline.

With regard to the perceptive value, if it is high, the consumer tends to hold on to the product. Therefore, the retailer can offer a longer return deadline. Otherwise, when β = 0, the retailer's return deadline is the same as that under the case of 
                        λ
                      <λ ≤ 1.

With the exception that the retailer's optimal return deadline is relevant to the consumer's perceptive value, the consumer return ratio, and to the product salvage value at the end of selling season, a difference in the consumer's intrinsic value also impacts the retailer's return deadline decision. We thus seek the properties of the retailer's optimal return deadline with respect to the consumer's intrinsic value difference as follows.

                        Proposition 2
                        
                           Given the lower bound of consumer intrinsic value l, the consumer intrinsic value difference h −
 l decreases the value of 
                           
                              λ
                            
                           and t
                           3
                           , and increases the value of t
                           1
                           .
                        

This proposition demonstrates that the consumer's intrinsic value difference influences the retailer's optimal return deadline decision. It shows that given the lower bound of consumer intrinsic value, the upper bound of consumer intrinsic value becomes an important factor to influence the retailer's return deadline decision. Note that when the upper bound of consumer intrinsic value satisfies certain conditions, the retailer's return deadline decision is simplified into the result of Fig. 1; otherwise the retailer can offer a return deadline equal to life-cycle T.

In addition, the consumer's intrinsic value difference decreases the value of t
                     3 and increases the value of t
                     1. Therefore, it is possible for the values of t
                     1 and t
                     3 to be equal. Under this condition, the retailer either offers a return deadline equal to t
                     1 (when T ≤ t
                     1 = t
                     3), or offers a return deadline equal to product's life-cycle T (when T ≤ t
                     1 = t
                     3).

                        Proposition 3
                        
                           In the newsvendor model, optimal return deadline t is decreasing in refund amount r.
                        

Generally, the longer the return deadline, the lower the refund is. In view of a generous refund policy with a long return deadline that leads to serious return problems, the retailer can implement two strategies: either a lower refund with a long return deadline, or a generous refund with a short return deadline. Both improve consumer satisfaction and reduce potential returns.

Given t* and r*, we have the following corollary:

                     Corollaries 2 and 3 lead to the following propositions:

                        Proposition 4
                        
                           In the newsvendor model, optimal pricing policy p* and ordering policy Q* have the following properties:
                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    when 
                                    
                                       λ
                                     <λ ≤ 1, p* and Q* are a bimodal function of t. More specifically,
                                       
                                          (1)
                                          
                                             when 0 < t < t
                                             1, p* and Q* are monotonically increasing in t;


                                             when t
                                             1 < t < t
                                             3, p* and Q* are monotonically decreasing in t;


                                             when t
                                             3 < t < T, p* and Q* are monotonically increasing in t;


                                    when 0 ≤ λ ≤ 
                                       λ
                                     , p* and Q* are monotonically increasing in t.

This result has implications on the effect of the return deadline on the consumer's return quantity and demand. Surprisingly, when the return ratio is high (that is, λ > 
                        λ
                      ), the order quantity (and selling price) of the retailer does not increase with respect to the return deadline. The profit of the retailer depends on the effect of the return deadline on the consumer's return quantity and demands. For example, for a shorter return deadline, the demand increment is higher than the return increment induced by the return deadline. In this case, the retailer can offer a longer return deadline at a cost of fewer consumer returns. As a result, the retailer can charge a higher selling price and obtain more profits. Conversely, when t
                     1 < t < t
                     3, the return increment stemming from the return deadline exceeds the demand increment, resulting in reducing the profit of the retailer as the return deadline increases.

When the return ratio is low (λ ≤ 
                        λ
                      ), the optimal return deadline is the product's lifecycle (shown in Corollary 2) because in this case all products will potentially be returned later, which prompts the retailer to keep larger quantities in his inventory to maintain a high service level. In other words, given the return quantity, the best approach is to prolong the return deadline to increase the demand, which means that in this case, the retailer can offer a longer return deadline, and charge a higher selling price. Hence it can be easily observed that the retailer's profit is monotonically increasing with the return deadline t.

In this section, we address a two-stage supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer produces and supplies products to the retailer, and the retailer sells the products and handles the returns from consumers. The retailer then sends the returns back to the manufacturer. The wholesale price per unit is w. In this section, we mainly study the effect of consumer returns on the performance of several buy-back contracts. Similar to the pure forward supply chain, the supply chain with product returns cannot achieve supply chain coordination through a traditional buy-back contract due to more action dimensions being considered (Cachon, 2003).

Therefore, we aim to design and examine specific buy-back contracts to enable supply chain coordination.

We consider a differentiated buy-back contract, where the manufacturer provides different buy-back prices for unsold and returned products. More specifically, the buy-back price for an unsold product is b, and buy-back price for returned product is b − θ, where θ represents the cost to the retailer imposed by the manufacturer. The manufacturer offers a contract with three parameters
(w, b, b − θ). Specifically, when θ = 0, differentiated buy-back contract is excluded from the traditional buy-back contract.

Under this contract, the profit function of the retailer is expressed as

Following this logic in Theorem 1, the optimal refund amount of the retailer is r* = b − θ (which maximizes ∏
                           R
                         in (8)), and the supply chain optimal refund amount is r* = S(t) (which maximizes ∏ in (9)). To ensure supply chain coordination it is required that r* = b − θ = S(t). Unlike a traditional buy-back contract, condition b > S(t) is satisfied. However, penalty θ is only one parameter irrelevant to the return deadline; in the contract, the salvage value of a returned product is related to the return deadline. Thus, unless θ = θ(t) = b − S(t), or products returned at different times are homogenous, the results are in line with assumptions made by Su (2009). Even considering the return deadline, a differentiated buy-back contract fails to stimulate supply chain coordination. Consequently, we propose a buy-back contract contingent upon the return deadline. More details are found in the next section.

An analysis of the above-mentioned buy-back contract shows that a feasible approach to refining a buy-back contract for supply chain coordination is to distinguish between not only unsold and returned products, but also between products returned at different times. In general, the salvage value of a returned product is related to the time-to-return parameter. The products returned in a timely manner are refurbished or remanufactured and resold; in contrast, products returned at a later date can no longer be resold, causing a dramatic drop in the product value (Guide et al., 2006). Therefore, the manufacturer hopes that the retailer can return consumer-returned products as soon as possible.

Unlike a differentiated buy-back contract, the manufacturer offers different credits to products returned at different times. Specifically, the buy-back contract is designed as (w, b, b − θt). In this case, total supply chain profit is the same in the above two contracts. Following the same logic, the optimal supply chain refund amount is still r* = S(t).

By contrast, under contract (w, b, b − θt), the profit function of the retailer is given by

It is worth recognizing that both the differentiated buy-back contract and the buy-back contract contingent upon the return deadline are effective assuming that the manufacturer is able to distinguish unsold and returned products. For example, in a packaged product, its returns can easily be distinguished from an unsold one. In addition, the latter buy-back contract also requires that the retailer gives back the returned product from consumers in a timely manner. In practice, timely delivery of returned product to the manufacturer is impossible for the retailer. However, for products that are easy to deliver, the retailer delivers the returned product to the manufacturer through strategies such as an express service (next-day delivery via courier). Another approach is to return the product directly to manufacturer, a commonly implemented strategy. Meanwhile, the consumer absorbs the restocking and shipping fees.

Because the consumer valuation and product salvage value are both contingent on the time-to-return, and both the price-only contract and traditional buy-back contract are not relevant to the time-to-return, these contracts are not able to coordinate this kind of supply chain. For example, one fixed buy-back price is generally not efficient enough to motivate the retailer to offer an optimal return service (including refund and return deadline) to consumers. If the retailer chooses to offer a fixed refund to consumers, in a buy-back contract, only consumers whose product salvage values are not higher than the product buy-back price will return their products. It can be easily seen that these contracts will damage the whole supply chain, particularly as a game follower, the retailer will suffer great loss. It can be imagined that a bigger perceptive value β would decrease losses caused by the contract, and a bigger arrival rate λ and product decay rate k would worsen the supply chain performance, because the retailer will suffer the dilemma that more products will be returned and these products will have less salvaged value.

In addition, the differentiated buy-back contract provides different buy-back prices to the retailer. Therefore, this contract can serve as an incentive for the retailer to order more products, and to offer a more generous return service to consumers. However, this contract fails to manage the consumers who return their products in different time. It is obvious that the buy-back contract contingent upon the return deadline can overcome these problems, and that it can motivate the retailer to procure the optimal quantity and offer a refund policy contingent on consumers’ time-to-return.

In this section, we investigate the effect of consumer behavior, like moral hazard, inertia, and external effect on the selling and return policies of the retailer.

Moral hazard consumption behavior (also called opportunistic consumption behavior) refers to a consumer who purchases a target product, consumes or copies it in a short time, and then returns it for a refund within the given return deadline. In essence, she buys a product for one-time use. According to the analysis above, retailers tend to set a return deadline that corresponds to the product lifecycle when it comes to high-value products with long lifecycles. We discuss how a consumer's moral hazard behavior influences the refund from retailers, especially for high-value products. For some special products, the consumer can maximize the usage value in a short time or copy the product within the return deadline. Well-known cases include the return of TV sets after Super Bowl Sunday, the return of camcorders after a daughter's wedding, or “borrowing” party dresses for special occasions (Che, 1996). In these cases, the consumer buys the product for one-time use. After the single use, the consumer has no intent to hold on to the product. Thus, even if the product's refund is low or if she incurs a certain expense, she will choose to return the product before the return deadline. We say that the retailer has encountered opportunistic returns (Longo, 1995). Generally, the rational consumer will return the product only if r > V. However, the consumer who purchases a product for special use usually has a loss tolerance intensity Γ. Such consumers may choose to return the product at the return deadline even if V < r + Γ(Γ ≥ 0).

Suppose in total demand market, the moral hazard consumers are 100α percent and the rational ones are (1 − α) × 100 percent (0 ≤ α ≤ 1). If each consumer can buy only one product, then the consumer's expected consumption utility of the product is

Let Δ = p − α(r − s)G(r + Γ) − (1 − α)(r − s)G(r) − s.

Given that Δ is independent of E min{Q, X} and
Q, the profit function of the retailer is maximized when Δ reaches maximal value.

                           Theorem 2
                           
                              With regard to moral hazard consumers, the optimal refund policy for the retailer satisfies s − Γ < r* < s.
                           

Because of consumers with moral hazard, the retailer's refund is necessarily less than markets in which only rational consumers exist. The consumer's return quantity is reduced. Meanwhile, consumers with lower valuation of a product may choose not to purchase as the selling price increases.

                           Corollary 5
                           
                              When considering moral hazard consumers, the optimal inventory levels of the retailer, Q*(Γ) and Q*(α), are lower than the inventory level Q*(0) when only rational consumers are considered.
                           

The existence of moral hazard consumers results in numerous product returns. With higher loss tolerance intensity generated by moral hazard consumers, one may expect a higher quantity of returned products. Therefore, the retailer tries to reduce his inventory to avert the corresponding profit loss. In response to this product return problem, some retailers have devised a product rental service after satisfying the demands of rational consumers. Retailers distinguish between rational and moral hazard consumers through differential pricing, and they attempt to reduce the false demands generated by moral hazard consumers. Further, the product inventory can also be reduced through cyclic renting of products of little quantity.

In addition, with more moral hazard consumers, more products are returned, especially when the demand for this product comes from a single special use. For example, wedding and party dresses are commonly purchased for a single use and then frequently returned. Hence, retailers who provide product rental services can reduce these high incidents of return.

Products are also returned due to reasons other than product quality or fit, for example the return observable. In general, a high volume of returns influences product valuations from consumers. A product is regarded as a poor value by consumers when large numbers are returned; this phenomenon is called an external effect of returns. Generally, a consumer returns a product only when her valuation of the product satisfies v < r. However, when a consumer observes numerous product returns from others, even if her real valuation of the product satisfies v > r, the consumer may tend to reduce her perceived product valuation from v to v − a (a > 0), where a refers to the external effect on the consumer from other product returns.

Then, the consumer's expected consumption utility is

                              When the external effect of product returns exists, the optimal selling price of the retailer satisfies
                              p* ≤ 
                                 p
                               
                              , if 0 < a ≤ 2(h − l − s); otherwise, p* > 
                                 p
                               
                              .
                           

When the external effect of product returns is low, then the optimal selling price of the retailer is less than when only rational consumers are considered. This result is attributed to the fact that the retailer reduces returns from consumers with lower product valuation by reducing the selling price. This return reduction and lower external effect of product returns further reduce product returns from consumers with higher product valuation. This phenomenon is caused by the external effect of product returns.

However, when the external effect of product returns is high, the retailer should avoid influence from external effect. He should raise the selling price and try to sell the product to consumers with higher product valuation. In this way, the retailer can reduce product returns because he rarely sells to consumers with lower product valuation. Thus, the external effect of product returns is reduced or avoided.

Then, the profit function of the retailer is described as follows,

With the logic of Theorems 1 and 2 we derive the following theorem.

                           Theorem 4
                           
                              The optimal refund of the retailer is r* = s.
                           

When a negative external effect of product returns exists, the optimal refund of the retailer, aimed at maximizing the total profit, equals the salvage value of the surplus product when the selling season is over. This result is consistent with that where only rational consumers are considered (Su, 2009). Hence, the external effect of product returns does not affect the optimal refund of the retailer. However, the return strategy of consumers changes. When consumers return products, they not only consider the product salvage value but also the external effect of product returns. Because the external effect is usually negative, some consumers who do not return the product in situations of no external effect existed also return it under negative external effect, i.e., consumers whose product valuations satisfy r* < V < r* + a also return the products.

Similar to Corollaries 3 and 4, the initial inventory of the consumer satisfies the condition

                              When an external effect of product returns exists, the optimal inventory of the retailer Q*(a) is less than Q*(0) in situation of no external effect.
                           

The greater the external effect of product returns, the more frequently the product is returned, leads to the assumption that should hold in situations where no external effect exists. Therefore, the retailer increases the selling price to sell the product to consumers with high product valuation. Then, the retailer eliminates the possibility of purchase from consumers with low product valuation through his pricing policy. The initial inventory of the retailer is reduced and will be used to satisfy the demands of the consumers with high product valuation because the number of consumers with low product valuation is reduced.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper studied the dependence of consumer valuation on the return deadline set by retailers. Specifically, the longer the return deadline, the better the consumer valuation. The uncertainty valuation is resolved only after a trial period. Through perceptive valuation, consumers decide whether to keep or return the product within the return deadline. Given this foundation, we have examined the optimal pricing, refund, and inventory policy of the retailer. Moreover, the decision of setting return deadlines was also discussed. Using this model, the following findings are presented.

The optimal refund of the retailer is the salvage value of the product rather than the full refund policy, unless the product value does not diminish. Through constraints of the fixed return deadline set by the retailers, only consumers whose valuations are less than the selling price can return products. Due to such constraints, the selling price of the retailer is higher than that when the return service is not offered. However, the relationship between the selling prices with or without return deadline constraints depends on the product lifecycle.

The return deadline strategy of the retailer depends on the product lifecycle and the consumer return rate. When the consumer return rate is low, the retailer provides an indefinite return deadline. Otherwise, the return deadline of the retailer depends on product lifecycle. Conversely, retailers implement an indefinite return deadline strategy for products with a short lifecycle, and a fixed return deadline for products with a moderately long lifecycle. With a sufficiently long product lifecycle, the return deadline of the retailer depends on the comparison between the profits gained by offering indefinite and fixed deadlines.

Furthermore, we accounted for the efficiency of three types of buy-back contracts. When the salvage value is constant, the traditional buy-back contract fails to stimulate supply chain coordination, whereas the differentiated buy-back contract realizes coordination. Furthermore, when the product salvage value is related to the return deadline, differentiated buy-back contracts also present diminishing efficiency. On the basis of these observations, we introduced a differentiated buy-back contract depending on the return deadline. This contract enables supply chain coordination.

Moreover, this investigation was extended to include specific consumer behaviors. First, we studied the case of moral hazard and inertia return behavior. Specifically, moral hazard prompts retailers to reduce the selling price at a value lower than the salvage value. Moreover, given that the retailer focuses on consumers with higher valuations, inventory is also reduced. Meanwhile, the return inertia increases refunds and retailer inventory. The external effect was also considered. Not all negative network externalities worsen the performance of the retailer.

There are some limitations of this paper and possible avenues for future research. First, in our model, we assume that the retailer knows about product status and market conditions. However, in reality, it is difficult for manufacturers to distinguish products returned from consumers and surplus products from retailers beyond the selling season. Hence, it would be interesting to extend this analysis to investigate how to deal with this problem. For a more comprehensive set of information questions that await research in this area, we direct the reader to Shulman et al. (2009) and to Bhargava and Chen (2012).

Clearly, more researches in other product categories are also needed, as discussed in the introduction. Retailers of different categories calculate return expenses in a different way, and they offer different return policies. This paper limits itself to electronic products, so accounting for other categories of product enables us to investigate how product heterogeneity may need different return policies.

Third, in practice, some returned units re-enter the distribution channels through remanufacturing activities, like repackaging, refreshment, and refurbishment. The quality of remanufactured units is as good as new and these get the same coverage in terms of warranties and service contracts. Besides, for products not returned beyond the return deadline, consumers can also sell them in secondary markets. Such analysis will help us to provide deeper insights into reverse supply chain management. Oraiopoulos, Ferguson, and Toktay (2012) provided a good starting point for this secondary market problem.

In addition, in this study we have not modeled any multi-agents and dynamics that affect demand and returns. Future research into this issue, which can include competition and intertemporal demand effects, and in turn affect the consumers’ purchasing and return behavior, is required to study the role of retailing competition and strategic behavior. In recent work, Shulman et al. (2010, 2011) addressed multi-retailer issues; similarly, Ofek, Katona, and Sarvary (2011) addressed multichannel retailers, and Bandyopadhyay and Paul (2012) addressed the multiple supplier issue. Moreover, Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2007) addressed a dynamics problem, considering product return caused by a quality problem and not FFR behavior. Although all of these studies have briefly involved competition and multi-period problems, our review shows that consumer return behavior has not been deeply explored, which influences the consumer's purchasing and return decisions dramatically. This prediction may be analyzed using game theory and dynamic programs, which could present interesting opportunities for future research.

Following the same logic in Theorem 1, as well as that in Corollaries 2 and 3, the optimal selling price is p*, refund amount is r*, order quantity is Q*, and the return deadline is t*. Under buy-back contract contingent upon time-to-return, the optimal selling price is

                              and optimal refund amount is r† = b − θt.

In our model, supply chain coordination is achieved only when two conditions are satisfied. First, the refund amount in a decentralized case should be consistent with the optimal refund amount of supply chain. That is r† = r*, so that we have b = S(t) + θt. Second, the decentralized retailer must implement the optimal return deadline t† = t* of supply chain. On the basis of these conditions, we obtain p† = p* and
