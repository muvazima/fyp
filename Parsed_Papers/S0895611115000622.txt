                  Detection of region specific voxel is a true challenge in many segmentation procedures. In this study a concept of implementing granular computing in the detection of anatomical structures in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans is introduced. After proving the usefulness of the information granules to identify voxels that mark certain organs, an automatic model-based approach has been developed. A three-parameter granule that combines the interval and density distribution of voxels has been introduced and employed to identify organ specific voxels of the liver, spleen and kidneys. The specificity of the information granules varies between 90 and 99% for the liver and spleen and over 85% for the kidneys.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many segmentation approaches have been developed [1,2], yet most of them suffer from a requirement of a manual detection of initial points or seed points, or the boundary of organs to be delineated [3]. The analysis becomes very time consuming when the interaction is required at each slice of a 3D study [4,5]. The most prominent method already suggested to detect seed points and support the segmentation process is based on models [6,7]. Single probabilistic atlas as well as multi-atlas approaches [8] have been used in the segmentation of various regions [7]. In the current study an approach based on granular computing [9] is introduced. The concept, although extensively explored [10–13], has not been widely employed in image analysis.

First attempts have been made in 2005 by Pal et al. [14], who have defined a measure called “rough entropy of image”. The composition of rough sets [15] and granular computing has been demonstrated for object extraction from gray scale image. The threshold level of segmented objects has been determined by optimization of the image rough entropy measure. The same method – with some modifications – has been used to detect moving objects in video sequences [16]. Moreover, in [17] the authors proposed a new algorithm based on granular multilevel rough entropy evolutionary thresholding.

Although medical image segmentation is a problem widely described in the literature [4], granular computing based methods are not common and limited to brain MRI scans, which are characterized by greater range of available soft tissue contrast than CT images. In [18] a hybrid method is proposed, consisting of a segmentation of the brain, with the granular rough set approach, and separation of brain white matter, with fuzzy thresholding. The results have been compared with the mean shift algorithm [19] with the following coefficients: Jaccard, Dice Similarity, Tanimoto, and Volume Similarity [20].

Yang et al. [21] introduced the rough fuzzy set model and performed an analysis of selecting an optimal threshold level, that minimizes some defined type of rough entropy of the image. The authors demonstrated results of the structure segmentation in a MR brain and a skull X-ray image.

The ultimate objective of this study is to introduce a concept of implementing granular computing in the detection of anatomical structures in 3D abdomen images. In brief, given a set of voxel, that forms a clinical image, a representative information granule is formed. It reflects the nature of an organ and differentiates it from its background and the neighboring structures. The information granule has been employed to a model based organ extraction procedure in order to evaluate the robustness of the process and the applicability of the granular computing concept to an automated image analysis methodology.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces two approaches. The first one, based on a manual extraction of the initial region of selected anatomical structures, evaluates the robustness of granular computing and its applicability to the problem of extracting an information granule for each organ. The second approach introduces a model employed to automatically extract the initial region and subject it to the granular computing analysis. Section 3 describes the experiments and presents the results. Section 4 concludes the study.

@&#METHOD@&#

The overall method contains two phases. First, an interactive method has been introduced in order to prove the hypothesis, that granular computing may be applicable in the image analysis field. Second, a model based fully automatic approach has been introduced (Fig. 1
                     ). Its goal is to extract certain anatomical regions that exhibit a significant level of specificity. In this study the liver, the spleen, and the kidneys are considered.

In the image analysis systems the segmentation phase is a crucial element. We anticipate, that the area to be extracted reflects the experimental data with as minimal over-detection as possible [22]. Thus, the system should exhibit a significant level of specificity [23]. In terms of granular computing approach this means, that we would like to have a very compact information granule. The smaller it is, the better. The increase of the border interval comes at an expense of the specificity of the information granule.

Given a set of clinical computed tomography (CT) data 
                           
                              V
                              l
                           
                           =
                           {
                           
                              v
                              xyz
                              l
                           
                           }
                         that reflects a set of voxels 
                           
                              v
                              xyz
                           
                         belonging to an l anatomical structure (e.g. liver, spleen, etc.), we intend to develop a single information granule Ω
                        
                           l
                         to be employed to mark elements of the l anatomical structure. Voxels intensities (regardless their location) have been subjected to further processing that yields the information granule.

Once the data set V
                        
                           l
                         is given, its median med(V
                        
                           l
                        ) is found. Recall that the median is a robust estimator of the sample and typically comes as one of the elements of V
                        
                           l
                        . Once the median is determined, Ω
                        
                           l
                         is formed by specifying independently its lower and upper bounds, denoted here as

The implementation of the granular computing approach requires a region to be marked that serves as a data evidence set. On its basis, the interval of the granule is found. The region may be extracted manually or automatically. For the initial testing phase the region has been delineated manually. Good results have encouraged us to develop a fully automated approach based on a model that indicates the data evidence set for selected anatomical structures.

The model based approach contains two parts (Fig. 1). After an alignment of data from clinical study and a model, a region of interest is extracted that contains experimental data. It is subjected to the granular computing that yields two-parameter and three-parameter information granules.

The model described in details in [25] has been summarized in Appendix A. It assigns each voxel a label that indicates the anatomical structure the voxel belongs to. Voxels, whose accompanied label M(m

                           l
                         subjected to the granular computing procedure. The analysis (as described in Section 2.1) yields the lower and upper bounds of the information granule. It identifies voxels 
                           
                              V

                         located within the l anatomical structure as well as its background.

Although a significant concentration of voxels can be noticed within the organ, the voxels are also spread over the entire image (Fig. 2
                        ). As the density is considered as a measure of concentration, this parameter will be added to the information granule parameters. This indicates that

                        .

Since the anatomical region under consideration features a significantly higher density of voxels than the surrounding areas, the two-parameter information granule is not organ specific. This leads us to introduce a new type of information granule (Ω
                        *) that includes three parameters: the upper and lower bound, and the data density. It is defined as:

In order to find a three-parameter granule a two-step procedure is employed. First, the granule interval marks the voxels within the anatomical structure delineated by the model and the density assigned to the l anatomical structure is computed:

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

Two experiments have been carried out. The goal of the first one is to evaluate the efficiency of a granular computing approach to the extraction of specific areas of selected anatomical regions. Four areas have been chosen, namely the liver, spleen and both kidneys. Based on the results, the second experiment employs the granular computing to develop a fully automated approach to select organ specific areas in the abdomen.

This experiment has been carried out on 30 CT studies. The liver, spleen, and both kidneys have been manually delineated by an expert. Then, the anatomical structures have been subjected to the granular computer analysis discussed in Section 2.1, that yields the W(a) and W(b) functions (Fig. 5
                           ).

Voxels identified by the intervals are subjected to the density analysis and 
                              
                                 ρ
                                 
                                    
                                       Ω

                                          *
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                            is found.

                            parameters, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. Using various α and β ranging between 0 and 3, several information granules have been found yielding the upper and lower bounds. Plots (Figs. 6 and 7) have shown the α and β values (plateaux in these figures) that do not impact the upper and lower bounds of the information granule and provide their stability. Thus, to decrease the numerical complexity, both parameters are set to 1 (as indicated in Figs. 6 and 7
                           
                           ).

Another test has shown the inter-case distribution of the information granules bounds for various anatomical structures (Fig. 8
                           ).

Even though the voxel intensity of various structures overlap, the information granules differ sufficiently to permit the organs to be labeled. An inter-case comparison of the granules on a single structure shows the discrepancy that does not permit one granule to be employed for various cases. Thus, for each study an analysis is required to obtain the upper and lower bounds.

The analysis is performed in several steps. First, a clinical study data is used to extract fiducial points (A) and superimposed over the model (Fig. 9
                           ). Within the organ specific model defined by Eq. A.1, a weighted center of gravity is found. Then, the region of interest (ROI) specific for the selected structure is extracted and employed to the granular computing analysis.

In order to find the optimal size of the region subjected to the granular computing, several experiments have been carried out. The region has been decreased from its maximal value down to 3×3×3 voxels. The upper and lower borders of the information granule have been found. The standardization is obtained for ROIs whose size change from 3×3×3 to 31×31×31. The analysis has been performed for 20 studies. The results for 10 studies are shown in Fig. 10
                           .

One can notice, that for small ROIs the information granule depends on the region size (Fig. 10a and b). On the other hand, big ROI exceeds beyond the structure and generates false positives that again influence the interval. The best solution appears if the granule found on the basis of the smallest ROI is similar to its counterpart calculated for larger ROIs. The region size of 11×11×11 fulfills this requirement (Fig. 10c and d) and has been chosen in further analysis.

Extracted 3D ROI is subjected to the granular computing in order to find the boundaries. These values are used to extract voxels that identify the organ specific region. As mentioned before, Ω
                           
                              l
                            marks the organ as well as its background. Thus, it cannot be considered as an organ specific granule. In order to locate a single structure, an additional granular feature has to be introduced. In our approach, a density parameter is employed (see Eq. 7). This yields a three-parameter granule that combines the voxel intensity and its location in the 3D image. The results are shown in Fig. 11
                           . The 3D plots of results is shown in Fig. 12
                           .

In order to evaluate the approach data from 30 CT studies has been analyzed. Anatomical structures under consideration have been delineated by an expert. They are considered as a ground truth.

As the aim of this research is to obtain the voxels that belong to the specific structure with the highest probability, only the specificity of the method is important. Furthermore, the result is not a single compact object, but consists of a cloud of points.

For evaluation, manual contours delineate the borders of structures. The specificity of the method is calculated as the ratio of the number of points P

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to employ the granular computing to the automated extraction of anatomical organ specific area. Experimental data from clinical CT studies has been used. A statistical model indicates the initial region processed through granular analysis. An interval based granule indicated voxels densely deployed within the organ and scattered in the background. In order to suppress the latter, a new 3-parameters granule that combines the data intensity and density distribution has been introduced. The method has been tested on 80 clinical CT studies. Ground truth segmentation has been outlined by an expert. The specificity of the information granules have reached 90% to even 99% for the liver and spleen and over 85% for kidneys. Since the automatic organ location represents a real challenge in many computer assisted diagnosis systems, this method can become highly practical for the extraction of selected anatomical structure for further analysis.
