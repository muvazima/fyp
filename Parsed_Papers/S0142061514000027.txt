                  During the last years wind power has emerged as one of the most important sources in the power generation share. Due to stringent Grid Code requirements, wind power plants (WPPs) should provide ancillary services such as fault ride-through and damping of power system oscillations to resemble conventional generation. Through an adequate selection of input–output signal pairs, WPPs can be effectively used to provide electromechanical oscillations damping. In this paper, different analysis techniques considering both controllability and observability measures and input–output interactions are compared and critically examined. Recommendations are drawn to select the best signal pairs available from WPPs to contribute to power oscillations damping. Control system design approaches including single-input single-output and multivariable control are considered. The recommendation of analysis techniques is justified through the tools usage in a test system including a WPP.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As a consequence of increased wind power penetration levels, transmission system operators (TSOs) are concerned with system stability. Wind power plants (WPPs) are required by TSOs to meet Grid Code requirements and sometimes to behave as conventional power plants — capable of providing support to the power system when requested to maintain stability [1–3]. Power system stability is divided in three main groups depending on the response of the system to a fault: frequency, rotor angle and voltage stability [4].

Rotor angle stability is defined as the capability of synchronous generators to keep or restore the equilibrium between their mechanical and electromagnetic torques. This stability issue is usually exhibited by synchronous generators as low frequency oscillations (LFOs). The main effects of such oscillations are to limit the power transfer capacity of the system and to cause large grid failures. This problem used to be solved by the installation of power system stabilizers (PSSs) at synchronous generators to increase the damping of the system. Nowadays, due to recent technological advances on power system devices, damping of electromechanical oscillations has been proposed in the literature to be provided by HVDC links, energy storage systems, flexible AC transmission systems and wind power generation [5–10]. It is worth mentioning that wind power is located where wind blows stronger and is more profitable; thus, it is difficult to geographically locate a WPP where its damping capabilities can be best achieved [11]. The physical location of the WPP plays an important role when defining the possible input and output signals for oscillation mitigation if they are measured locally [7,11]. When the WPP is far from the conventional generation, the low frequency oscillation on the electrical signals can be smoothed or hidden. This implies a lower observability, as stated in [7,11].

Different methods to select the best feedback signal to damp power oscillations have been discussed in [8,12–16], but the case for WPPs has not been yet well covered. Recent research focuses on the best input–output signal pairs employing controllability and observability analyses such as residues and geometric measures [13,17]. Other works study the interaction between different controllers for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO, multivariable) case and try to determine if a decentralized controller could be considered by using the relative gain array (RGA) [17,18]. In [19], fundamental limitations of control design by using local signals to damp remote oscillations are analyzed, where the interaction between local and remote signals has an important influence.

The aim of this paper is to compare different controllability and observability and signal interaction analyses for power system oscillation damping employing local signals from WPPs. The main advantages and drawbacks of each alternative are examined. Frequency domain tools such as the RGA and the multivariable structure function (MSF) [20–22] are employed to assess the interaction between signal pairs. Using the frequency domain approach, the arising control design and performance limitations under the presence of right hand plane zeros (RHPZs) are clearly defined [23]. The use of some of these methods is recommended to select the best input–output pairs which ensure a good controllability and observability of the desired oscillation mode, while providing a clear insight of the potential and limitations of the damping controller. These suggestions provide a guideline to select the best input–output signal pairs suitable to damp power system oscillations by means of WPPs signals –either through single-input single-output (SISO) or multivariable (MIMO) control schemes.

WPPs comprising variable-speed wind turbines only (either based on doubly-fed induction generators or fully-rated converters) exhibit dynamics which are considerably faster than the synchronous frequency and the electromechanical dynamics found within power systems. Decoupling of WPPs from network dynamics can be achieved through the use of power converters [3]. For these reasons, WPP models can be simplified for small-signal stability analysis.

WPPs regulate the active power delivered to the grid through an adequate control of the generator-side converter. The aim is to transfer the maximum active power from the wind turbine following an optimum wind power extraction. On the other hand, reactive power regulation is achieved through the control of the grid-side converter [24]. Due to the availability of active and reactive power measurements for converter control, these could be used potentially as control signals for damping controllers. In general, either local or remote measurements could be selected as input signals for a damping controller sitting at a WPP, where electrical variables can be represented, for convenience, as phasors (i.e., in terms of their magnitude and phase angle).

It should be emphasized that the input–output pair (or pairs) selection largely influences the performance of power oscillation dampers. This is particularly critical for the case of WPPs, since they can be located far away from the synchronous generators — where electromechanical oscillations originate.

In general, power systems can be described by a set of nonlinear differential and algebraic equations of the form

For instance, if a SISO controller is considered, the input–output pair could be chosen, for example, as

                     ). The control scheme could be either centralized or decentralized. In the case of a decentralized controller, the input–output signal pair definition arising from a diagonal control structure has significant importance when designing effective controllers [23]. The pairing selection criteria for both SISO and MIMO control schemes are commonly based on controllability and observability properties, and performance limitations are established following a frequency response analysis of the open loop system [25,26].

Controllability indicates how the state variables describing the behavior of a system can be affected by its inputs. Observability is associated with the possibility of determining the states from the outputs. More precisely, the system (2) is said to be controllable, if for any initial state

Although this is a reasonable input–output selection criterion to determine the most controllable and observable signals, it is not always clear which pair presents the best joint controllability and observability characteristics. From a control point of view, the joint measure is of great importance.

                           . Therefore, the residues are clear measures of joint controllability and observability of a particular oscillation mode. For this reason, residues are commonly used in damping oscillation analysis [4,13,27].

The residues can be computed directly from the state-space realization by using

                           . As in general the residues are complex numbers, the best input–output signal pair is given by the maximum value of the residue magnitude.

                            is non-controllable/non-observable from the ith input and the jth output. The geometric measures provide a similar information as the residues, with the advantage of being normalized and independent of the scale of the signals. These measures have been used to determine the best input–output pair in power oscillation damping applications [14,28].

Some authors have proposed the use of Hankel singular values (HSVs) for the selection of input–output pairs [8]. However, it is not possible to connect the controllability and observability of a particular mode with the HSVs [23]. For this reason, their use is not considered in this paper.

It is well-known that non-minimum phase zeros (or RHPZ) impose limitations on the achievable performance [29,30]. To ensure closed-loop stability, the controller cannot cancel RHPZs and the frequency response of the closed-loop transfers will have fixed points that cannot be altered by the controller. For instance, the sensitivity transfer 
                           
                              S

                              )
                           
                         takes the value 1 at a RHPZ independently of the controller; that is, if

                        These constraints become serious limitations if the RHPZs are close to the mode to be damped, since the magnitude of the closed-loop transfer cannot be arbitrarily reduced. If the controller set is reduced to proportional gains, the constraints are more serious. A simple root locus analysis reveals how strong these limitations are. Since the closed-loop poles tend to the open loop zeros, if an open loop pole is close to a RHPZ, a small increment in gain may result in an unstable system and thus it is not possible to affect the lightly damped mode. Therefore, any pair with RHPZs in the range of LFOs should be avoided.

The limitations imposed by RHPZs have been used to propose input–output selection procedures in [30,31]. In the context of damping oscillations in power systems they have been used in [8,19].

An alternative view on input–output signal pair selection can be obtained from the frequency domain. This allows to evaluate input–output interactions and thus determine if decentralized controllers will be able to achieve a reasonable closed-loop behavior.

It allows to evaluate interactions among different inputs and outputs [23]. In the context of input–output pair selection, it helps to determine the pair with the highest interaction and to evaluate the possibility of using multivariable controllers.

                                     and the controllers can be designed independently if the input–output pairs are reordered.

Otherwise, the pairs are not decoupled and the decentralized controller should be designed carefully. For stable plants, input–output pairs with negative steady-state RGA elements should be avoided. Otherwise, if the sub-controllers are designed independently each with integral action, then the interactions will cause instability either when all the loops are closed or when the loop corresponding to the negative relative gain becomes inactive.

Notice that the RGA depends on the frequency. Therefore, the previous analysis should be done in the frequency range of interest; i.e., the range where LFOs arise.

It is the building block for the individual channel analysis and design (ICAD) framework [32,33]. An appropriate interpretation of the MSF at low and high frequency allows to determine: the existence and required structure of diagonal controllers, the dynamical structure of the closed-loop system, a reliable measurement of robustness, and the possibility to satisfy design specifications [20].

The different methods presented in Section 3 are assessed through the test system shown in Fig. 3
                     , which has been previously used to show the interaction between conventional generation and WPPs [34]. This is a simple power system model which provides a clear insight of the system dynamics. The WPP including converter-based wind turbines is assumed as a negative load, since the converter dynamics are considerably faster than the electromechanical dynamics that this work is focused on. For the same reason, the transmission lines are modeled as reactances, with the capacitor dynamics in PI representations being neglected. This approach has been previously used in [35]. The system parameters can be found in Appendix A.

The linearized system is represented in state-space form as (2), where

                     . Although simple in nature, it is representative enough to clearly assess the tools presented in Section 3. The use of a more complex system representation is out of the scope of this work; however, the tools here presented could be equally applied to systems with additional inputs and outputs. It should also be noted that the impact of measuring remote signals using wide-area measurement systems could be included through the introduction of time delays, but it is out of scope of this paper. Instead, it is assumed that all signals are available (either through direct measurement or estimation).

The controllability and observability measures previously presented were compared using the system under study. According to (24), four possible signal pairs can be analyzed:

                           ) as an output.

It can be concluded that the best signal pair is

                           . Also, it can be seen that the worst signal pair is

                                       wt
                                    
                                 
                                 -

                                       wt
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . However, the next best possible option is not clear from the remaining alternatives since the PBH test does not provide any joint controllability and observability measure.

The magnitudes of the residues are listed in Table 3
                           . It can be observed that the maximum value corresponds to the pair 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       P
                                    
                                    
                                       wt
                                    
                                 
                                 -
                                 
                                    
                                       θ
                                    
                                    
                                       wt
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . This is consistent with the information provided by the PBH test; thus, this signal pair should be selected as a first option. Conversely to the PBH test, the residue analysis clearly defines the best order of the signal pairs due to its joint controllability and observability measurement test.

These are given in Table 4
                           . The joint controllability and observability measure

                            shows that the signal pair to be selected must be

                                       θ

                            since it has the maximum value among the input–output pairs. This pair presents negligible differences compared to

                            in terms of controllability and observability; in other words, the use of either pair would provide similar results. These results are consistent with those obtained previously. However, in this case the information is clearer since the values are normalized and presented in per unit.

At 5s, an impulse variation on the mechanical power reference of the synchronous machine is done in order to excite the oscillation mode existing on the system. As it can be observed, the system becomes unstable for the MIMO design. This was expected since MSF

It could be argued that a more complex MIMO controller may stabilize the plant, but this is out of the scope of this work. Conversely, the system is stable when considering the designs for the SISO pairs, but non-minimum phase zeros are present. Moreover, the damping contribution is weak in either SISO case and the oscillations are not damped during the simulation horizon. It could be argued that the performance may be improved by increasing the proportional gain of the controller, but care should be exercised since the system may become unstable due to the presence of RHPZs.

                        . This was expected from the analysis carried out in previous sections. When using the same controller in both individual channels, it can be seen that the MIMO design produces the best damping performance in all variables except for the case of active power, where the oscillations take a longer time to be eliminated. This superior performance was expected since the MIMO design takes the damping contribution of both feedback loops.

It should be emphasized that the results obtained in Figs. 7 and 8 agree on well with the analyses carried out with the controllability and observability tools and the frequency domain approaches from the previous sections. It is also apparent that the best performance for any possible SISO alternative is achieved when considering input–output pair

From the analysis of the different selection methods previously presented, some recommendations can be outlined with the aim of finding the most adequate alternative for input–output signal pairing (depending on the desired control scheme).

Considering the SISO case, controllability, observability and the location of RHPZs determine the best signal pair. Various tools for controllability and observability analyses have been presented. The most useful is the geometric measure since erroneous results caused by different magnitude scales are avoided through the normalization of the controllability and observability measures. The location of RHPZs must also be considered in the study since they might impose serious control restrictions if they appear nearby the oscillation mode to be damped.

For decentralized multivariable schemes, the interaction between input–output pairs is also a limiting factor. For this analysis, both RGA and MSF can be used; nevertheless, MSF is more suitable since it provides additional information about the achievable performance levels and limitations associated to RHPZs.

When considering the application of the tools presented in this paper, it is worth noticing that the amount of input and output signals will be reduced when considering WPPs with local signals. This substantially reduces the problem complexity as the system will not present a large system matrix. Following this consideration, it is important to take into account weakly damped oscillation modes only. This helps to further simplify the system when a large number of synchronous generators is present. After these simplifications the tools recommended can be directly applied.

A brief summary of the selection methods discussed in previous sections is given in Tables 5 and 6

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Several tools have been assessed in this paper to evaluate the potential contribution of WPPs to power system oscillation damping. Efforts have been conducted to choose which of these alternatives is the most adequate. Controllability and observability tests have been analyzed – in particular, those allowing the evaluation of specific oscillation modes (PBH, residues and geometric measures). Among them, the most recommended are the geometric measures since they provide a normalized joint controllability and observability measure. The normalization is useful for the input–output selection because in general the input–output pairs have different scales.

The limitations imposed by the presence of RHPZs on performance have been considered. The stabilization of a plant with RHPZs gives rise to fixed points in the frequency response. As a consequence, if the RHPZs are close to the oscillation modes, there is no controller capable of achieving a substantial increment in damping.

Interactions among input–output pairs were analyzed to assess the possibility of a multivariable control design. RGA and MSF are useful tools to determine the most adequate signal pairs for decentralized control. An advantage of using the MSF analysis over the RGA analysis, in addition to the definition of signal pairs afforded through both approaches, is that the potential dynamic performance and control system design of the oscillation damper can be evaluated. Moreover, through a careful analysis of the MSFs a clear effect of the limitations arising from RHPZs can be clearly defined.

In order to illustrate the different alternatives, a power system including a WPP was analyzed. A simple oscillation damper obtained through classic control design was employed to carry out time domain simulations. Simulation results show a system behavior in agreement with the analyses.
