@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) devices have been widely applied in a diverse range of applications, including nano-switches [1], ultrasensitive sensor [2] and RF communication modules [3] and others, and this certainly makes NEMS research a worthwhile field. When a driving voltage is applied between a moveable and a fixed structure, charges are induced on each which causes an electrostatic force to act on both structures. As the movable structure approaches the fixed structure, an elastic force tends to make it return to its previous undeformed position. At a critical voltage, which is known as the pull-in voltage, instability occurs and the cantilever nano-beam collapses onto the fixed structure. This is of critical importance in the design of NEMS-based devices.

New physics has emerged in the consideration of NEMS. For example, the effect of intermolecular forces, such as the Casimir and van der Waals forces [4], may play an important role at the nano-scale. For separations below 20 nm the force between two surfaces (van der Waals attraction), varies as the inverse cube of the separation. When the separation is greater than 20 nm, the force between two surfaces can be described as the quantum Casimir effect, which is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the separation [5]. Ke et al. [6] calculated the effect of van der Waals force on the pull-in voltage of carbon-nanotubes based NEMS switches. Rotkin [7] considered the effect of the van der Waals force on the pull-in gap and obtained analytical expressions for both the pull-in gap and voltage of a general model. Soroush et al. [4] investigated the effect of dispersion forces on the pull-in instability of cantilever nano-actuators using the Adomian decomposition method (ADM). ADM is a practical technique for solving initial value problems (IVP), boundary value problems (BVP), linear, nonlinear and even chaotic systems [8–11].

However, in practice, surface effects such as the residual surface stress and surface elasticity must be taken into account when evaluating the pull-in behavior of NEMs actuators since the large surface area to volume ratio of such structures induces a size-dependent change in many actuator material properties. Ma et al. [12] studied the effects of surface energies and the Casimir force on the instability parameters of cantilever NEMS actuators using the Homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Wang and Feng [13] addressed the effects of both surface elasticity and surface residual stress on the buckling and vibrational behaviur of nanobeams. Fu and Zhang [14] used a modified continuum model to investigate the pull-in behavior of an electrically actuated double-clamped nano-beam incorporating surface effects. In these investigations, the influence of the Casimir attraction as well as fringing field effects was neglected. There is an important pull-in parameter which is the detachment length in the design of NEMS actuators. In the absence of a driving voltage, the Casimir force could overcome elastic restoration and lead to collapse of the cantilever nano-beam. For any fixed initial gap between electrodes, the maximum allowable length of the cantilever nano-beam that will not adhere to the fixed electrode is called the detachment length [12].

Differential transformation theory was first introduced by Pukhov [15,16] to solve linear and nonlinear initial value problems in physical processes. Zhao used the same theory as a means of solving the circuit analysis domain. However, in recent years, the differential transformation method (DTM) has been extended to include a wide range of engineering problems. For example, Chen et al. [17] and Liu et al. [18,19] used DTM to investigate the problem of entropy generation within a mixed convection flow with viscous dissipation effects in a parallel-plate vertical channel. The solution of the fractional telegraph equation has been discussed by Biazar and Eslami [20] who also used DTM. DTM also has been successfully employed to solve many types of linear and nonlinear problems in mathematics [21,22] and engineering, including thermal conduction [23] and optimal control systems [24]. DTM is a powerful semi-analytical tool for general engineering and mechanics problems and yields an analytical solution in the form of a polynomial [22].

In this study, cantilever nano-actuators incorporating two issue effects are investigated in a simulation of dynamic behavior. The first issue considered is that of intermolecular activity such as the Casimir force at the nano-scale. The second is the surface effect. Hence, a governing equation based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam model incorporating nonlinear electrostatic and intermolecular forces has been used in the present study. The rest of this paper has been arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the use of a hybrid computational scheme to complete the nonlinear governing equation of the cantilever nano-beam and specify initial and boundary conditions. Section 3 validates the proposed method by comparison of the numerical results obtained for tip displacement and pull-in voltage of a cantilever nano-beam with the analytical results presented in the literature. Also, the hybrid computational scheme is used to analyze the dynamic response of the cantilever nano-beam as a function of the applied voltage. Finally, Section 4 presents some brief concluding remarks. Compared to existing methods such as the finite difference method, the hybrid numerical scheme has the advantages of an explicit physical meaning and is also simpler and much faster.

                         shows the NEMS cantilever-type actuator considered in the present study. As shown, the cantilever nano-actuator is composed of the cantilever beam of length L with a uniform rectangular cross section of thickness h and width w. The initial gap between the movable beam and the fixed electrodes is denoted by g. In practice, existing NEMS fabrication techniques make separations below 20 nm rather problematical. So, in this study, only the Casimir force is considered. The nonlinear governing equation for the distributed parameter model, based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam assumptions, may be written as [12]

To start with the validity of the hybrid computational scheme derived in the previous section was verified by analyzing the cantilever nano-beam involved in the nonlinear governing equation. The computations were performed using MATLAB and a [001] silver cantilever nano-beam of length 1 μm, width

                      with different values of beam thickness h, ranging from 50 to 100 nm. The residual surface stress τ
                     0 and surface modulus of elasticity Es
                      are
0.89 μN/μm and
1.22 μN/μm, respectively. The end deflections of the cantilever nano-beam obtained using the two approaches are listed in Table 1
                      for comparison, with an applied voltage of 1 V. It can be seen that the hybrid computational scheme prediction lies close to that of the Finite Difference Method (FDM), and the maximum difference between the two predictions is 7.38% when

                      compares the results obtained by the hybrid computational scheme for the pull-in voltage under a driving voltage obtained by the HPM presented in [12]. As shown, in the absence of surface effect, the hybrid computational scheme predicts a pull-in voltage of 5.91 V. By contrast, the HPM predicts a pull-in voltage of 5.588 V. In other words, the pull-in voltage computed using the hybrid computational scheme deviates by no more than 5.76% from the value presented in the literature.

                     . It can be seen that for a constant applied voltage, the residual stress increases with increasing tip deflection. In addition, it is seen that for a constant residual stress, the tip deflection increases with increased voltage due to the resulting rise in electrostatic force.

                      are 0.89 μN/μm and 1.22 μN/μm, respectively. The results indicate that for a constant detachment length, the beam thickness and surface effect are linked and it can be seen that the influence of surface effects decreases as the beam thickness goes up.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A hybrid computational method employing differential transformation and finite difference approximation was used in this study to analyze the nonlinear behavior of an electrostatically actuated cantilever nano-beam. In the computational method, each term in the non-dimensional governing equation of the cantilever nano-beam is processed using the differential transformation method with respect to the time domain t. The transformed equation is then processed using finite difference approximation with respect to 
                        
                           x
                           ¯
                        
                      (i.e. the axial direction of the cantilever nano-beam). The validity of the hybrid computational scheme has been confirmed by comparing the numerical results for pull-in voltage of the cantilever nano-beam with the results obtained using the HPM. The analysis shows that surface effects significantly influence the dynamic characteristics of the cantilever nano-actuator. The proposed method has been used to examine the surface effects of the nano-beam and beam thickness on the detachment length without voltage actuation. In addition, it has been shown that the dynamic response of the nano-beam can be confined to a stable operating region given an appropriate setting of the actuation voltage. Overall, the results presented in this study confirm the usefulness of the proposed hybrid computational scheme to model complex interactions between electrostatic coupling, the fringing field, the Casimir force and the surface effects. As a result, this is presented as a suitable technique for analyzing not only the nonlinear response of the cantilever nano-beam considered in this study, but also that of other nano-structural devices.
