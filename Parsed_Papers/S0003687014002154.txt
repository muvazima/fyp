                  A method is proposed for evaluation and selection of a personal cooling system (PCS) incorporating PCS, subject, and equipment weights; PCS run time; user task time; PCS cooling power; and average metabolic rate. The cooling effectiveness method presented is derived from first principles and allows those who select PCSs for specific applications to compare systems based on their projected use. This can lower testing costs by screening for the most applicable system. Methods to predict cooling power of PCSs are presented and are compared to data taken through standard manikin testing. The cooling effectiveness ranking is presented and validated against human subject test data. The proposed method provides significant insight into the application of PCS on humans. However, the interaction a humans with a PCS is complex, especially considering the range of clothing ensembles, physiological issues, and end use scenarios, and requires additional analysis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Heat stress has long been recognized as a risk to personnel health and work performance, particularly in highly radiant or hot environments, and at high-activity levels. This is especially true in desert and jungle conditions, deep mines, firefighting situations, or other locations where high radiant loads, high air temperatures, high humidity, or a combination of these elements, can lead to heat stress incidents (Buller et al., 2008; Chou et al., 2008; Duncan et al., 1979). In high-temperature applications, where the ambient temperature is greater than body temperature, the physiological defense against heat stress is the evaporation of perspiration. Unfortunately, protective equipment and clothing limit the body's ability to evaporate perspiration and expel heat to the environment (Cadarette et al., 2001). This also contributes to the buildup of heat in the body, raising the body's core temperature, and eventually leading to heat stress.

In recent years, numerous new technologies in protective fabrics, clothing systems, and cooling systems have been designed to help mitigate the onset of heat stress. Consequently, acquisition specialists, trainers, equipment developers, and researchers are faced with many product choices in the marketplace. For example, more than 300 different personal cooling systems for use in hot environments are available on the market (McCullough et al., 2013). Technical information available from manufacturers of these products is often incomplete, confusing, or misleading, so it is difficult to decide which products are appropriate for a particular application.

Use of PCSs has been investigated for many years by the military, government agencies, private and public organizations, and universities (Barwood et al., 2009; McCullough and Eckels, 2009; McLellan et al., 1999). The analysis of PCSs for use in various industries is challenging due to the inherent variability in human physiology, range of expected work or activities, and variability in environmental conditions. A common method of screening PCSs is to use a thermal manikin to measure the cooling rate. In the standard, systems must meet a 50-W minimum, then systems are compared to one another based on their cooling power (ASTM, 2010b). The thermal manikin provides a cost-effective and timely alternative to testing each variation of PCSs on humans (Bogerd et al., 2010). Even with this economic advantage, 300 PCSs can't be screened for each end use scenario. Therefore, additional tools are needed.

In previous studies, criteria used to select PCSs were often not reported or quantified. These were sometimes confined to cooling ability in watts (Endrusick et al., 2007), ergonomic factors (Goodman et al., 2008), or some combination. Selection criteria could include many different categories, which are necessary, but generally deemed ‘self-explanatory’ and not reported in literature. Obviously, some criteria will vary between applications. In past studies performed by the authors, potential systems have been removed from consideration when they didn't pass certain metrics such as system weight, tethered operation only, PPE compatibility, flammability, and other safety concerns. The work by Laprise (2012) provides a very inclusive list of selection criteria intended as a standard for PCS solicitations from companies for “emergency responder operations.” These can be very useful in narrowing systems based on safety and ergonomic factors, especially when paired with systematic selection methods such as those presented in Ullman (1992). More refinement can be added if this is coupled with the standards proposed by organizations such as ISO, NIOSH, OSHA, and NFPA. While this necessary step is important, a metric for evaluation of personal cooling system effectiveness is lacking.

Currently there is a strong dependence on thermal manikin testing, which can be very expensive when evaluating large numbers of systems. Thermal manikin testing has inherent limitations and does not always include issues such as weight, PCS runtime, and availability of supplies. This paper proposes a unique cooling effectiveness metric that incorporates task time, PCS runtime, weight, and work rate for stationary tasks. There is interest in a comparative cooling effectiveness measure. Work by Xu and Gonzalez (2011) developed a relative efficiency measure for air circulation systems to compare measured power from the manikin to a modeled value. The proposed measure of cooling effectiveness in this paper will be introduced and defined. This will be followed by validation and discussion of the method incorporating existing standards for measuring PCSs, using thermal manikins and previously reported human subject testing.

@&#METHODS@&#

The primary purpose of the PCS is to protect the end user from heat stress by providing cooling to the body. As a result, it is tempting to select a PCS based only on its cooling rate. However, literature suggests that selecting a suitable system is more complicated than just the cooling rate. House et al. (2013) found that the melting temperature of phase-change material PCS affects the cooling experienced by the body. Another factor is weight of the PCS. Some users, such as the U.S. Army, prefer to use cooling effectiveness as a variable consisting of the cooling, measured in watts, divided by PCS weight, to help account for the impact of the PCS weight on the soldier. However, duration of the cooling effect is as important as the cooling rate in longer work times, when the system is not tethered to a continuous or large power or cooling source. After systems are no longer providing cooling, they can become extra weight for the user to carry; thus, adding to the physiological strain on the user. Therefore, it was recognized that time — including both task time and length of cooling time for a PCS — needed to be incorporated into the analysis.

Developing a measure of the cooling effectiveness incorporating these parameters allows systems to be ranked in order of their expected contribution to mitigating heat stress in end users. The numerical score is based on the cooling rate, duration of cooling effect, task time, and system weight. Basic energy balances are used to derive the metrics. The energy balance approach used by House et al. (2013) and Barwood et al. (2009) to estimate the cooling rate from human subject data, except with the inclusion of time and weight parameters, is used here. For demonstration purposes of thermal modeling, the physical aspects of the average-sized man were set to be 81.6 kg (180 lbs) and 1.8 m tall, with 1.8 m2 of surface area, as given by ASHRAE (ASHRAE, 2013).

Heat storage occurs when the body is unable to dissipate the energy generated. This can be examined using an energy balance. In this analysis, a first-order energy balance is used. This simple approach was also used in research done for the Air Force (Pandolf et al., 1995) and in the research of House et al. (2013) and many other sources. The heat storage (St) equation for a user without a PCS is shown here:

The work rate performed on the environment (Wr) is the physical effect of extra metabolic energy such as moving the body by walking, biking, climbing, etc. Possible methods to determine metabolic rate (Mr) and heat loss to the environment (Ht) will be discussed in the following sections. The storage term summation term highlights the effects of different specific heats, temperatures and masses of different body segments and layer. In this simplistic analysis, i = 1, yielding St = Wt*Cpb*ΔTb, where all values are the average body values. This is discussed more in depth in Section 2.5.

Including the PCS in the energy balance analysis somewhat complicates the heat storage equation, because the difference in PCS cooling duration and the task time (i.e. work time) must be reflected in the equation. It was decided this would be approximated as a path-independent heat gain over a task time with a constant work rate and cooling rate similar to Equation (1). Weight of the personal cooling system was accounted for by using the weight-adjusted metabolic rate, (Mr
                        PCS), which will be discussed in a following section. If the cooling duration was greater than the examined task time, the cooling duration was set to the task time. The body heat storage equation with a PCS becomes—

                         is cooling duration (sec), and Cl is cooling rate (W).

Equation (2) highlights both and potential positive and negative effects from the PCS. For longer work times and short cooling durations, the increased metabolic work due to weight of the system will likely exceed the cooling benefit of the PCS. The cooling rate and metabolic rates used in Equation (2) are averages over the associated times. A time-dependent version of this equation can be produced if additional information is known about the cooling rate versus time.

To determine heat storage, metabolic work levels need to be estimated based on the tasks being performed by the wearer. Tables of metabolic rates for different activities can be found in the literature (Ainsworth et al., 2011; American College of Sports Medicine, 2010; Parsons, 2006) if the task metabolic rate is not known. Obviously, using direct measurement of metabolic rate during a task is preferable but not always possible. In the example of the dismounted soldier, activity levels provided in military publications FM 3-4 (Department of the Army, 1994) and TB-MED 507 (Sawka et al., 2003) can be used to determine possible work levels. For illustration purposes, work rates from TBMED 507 are shown below in Table 1
                        .

Another option, in some situations, is to use the equation proposed by Pandolf et al. (1977) for standing or walking slowly. It can be used to estimate the base metabolic rate if the input parameters are known. These can be measured for many tasks by examining walking speed, grade, walking surface, mass of the subject, and extra load carried as shown in Equation (3).

                        where Mw is the metabolic cost of walking (Watts), Wt is body mass (kg), Lo is load mass (kg), T is terrain coefficient, V is velocity or walk rate (m/sec), and G is slope or grade (%). The terrain coefficient was determined as follows: 1.0 = black top road; 1.1 = dirt road; 1.2 = light brush; 1.5 = heavy brush; 1.8 = swampy bog; 2.1 = loose sand; or snow, dependent on depth of depression (T = 1.30 + 0.082*D, where D = depression depth in cm).

PCS system weight will change the metabolic energy generation as illustrated in Equation (3). Some systems may allow users to carry additional supplies but at the cost of higher increased metabolic generation. Other mechanical and physiological issues are also important with increased weight that are not considered in this analysis. To compare PCS system performance, it is logical to assume the end user needs to perform a task at the same speed regardless of PCS weight. Equation (3) could be used to determine this shift in metabolic rate if the inputs are held constant but only the load mass is changed. If Equation (3) was used to find the baseline metabolic rate, the new metabolic rate with a PCS can be found by simply increasing the load carried by adding the weight of the PCS to the existing load.

Despite its limitations, Equation (3) is an empirical equation based on a very large data set. Assuming a general metabolic rate can be identified from published work or other methods, Equation (3) can provide a rough estimate of increased rates. Inputs to Equation (3) (Mt, Wt, T,G, and Lo) can be set without a PCS to match the desired metabolic rate to find the walking velocity, V. Once V is known it can be use with the load increased by each PCS's weight to calculate the new metabolic rate. Additional information in this area is limited and additional experimental study would be useful.

The natural heat loss term in Equations (1) and (2) represents the ability of the body to expel heat to the environment, and is dependent on a number of environmental components including air temperature, air velocity, radiant load, and relative humidity. Fundamentally, natural heat transfer is the combination of many terms that can be thought of as energy loss from the body. First, is the energy loss from the skin due to conduction, convection, and radiation. Second is energy lost due to evaporation from the skin. Finally, losses due to respiration need to be included but are normally small. Two broad methods can be used to determine natural heat loss. One method uses thermal heat loss models such as those found in found in ASHRAE Fundamentals, Chapter 9 (ASHRAE, 2013); another is use of various ISO thermal environment standards and supporting standards for hot conditions, such as ISO 7243 (ISO, 2003) and ISO 9920 (ISO, 2007) among others; or more advanced models such as Fiala et al. (1999). This uses estimates of the heat transfer coefficients and knowledge of clothing properties to estimate natural heat loss. The second method involves use of calorimetry to determine natural heat loss (Jay and Kenny, 2007).

The energy storage term, St, presented in Equations (1) and (2), represent energy stored in the body. This is surprisingly difficult to accurately measure as the complex distribution of temperatures and chemical reactions change the energy stored. Most assume a reasonable approximation can be made by assuming an average specific heat of tissue, Cp
                        
                           b
                        , and some bulk temperature change, usually core temperature, ΔTb. The value given for the average body specific heat, Cp
                        
                           b, by ASHRAE is 3490 J/kg*°C (ASHRAE, 2013). The first-law energy balance can find the storage term, which is the fundamental principle behind calorimetry. However, determining which bulk temperatures to use, where they are located, and how many are required is still a topic of research, thus the reason for the summation in Equation (1) (Jay et al., 2006). It is widely accepted that the rise in core body temperature is the metric to be used when determining when heat stress will occur. The final core temperature, and as a result the allowable core temperature rise, depends on the application and safety protocols of each organization.

The maximum heat stress point of the human body can be generally set at a 2.8 °C rise in core body temperature over a baseline core temperature of 37.2 °C, resulting in collapse. This correlates to body heat storage of 670 kJ for an average-sized man (ASHRAE, 2013). The international standard ISO 7243 WBGT for industrial work allows for a maximum rectal temperature of 38 °C over an eight-hour shift (ISO, 2003; Parsons, 2006). It is recommended civilian users apply occupational safety standards and international standards for work such as those from ISO to define limits. A helpful flow chart and description of the standards is found in Parsons (2006). It should be noted that the cooling effectiveness score developed in this paper is for ranking PCS, not for predicting work times. This should not be used to evaluate possible incidences of heat stress as humans are highly variable and this application requires intensive study by experts. The widely used equation for heat storage from human subject work is St = Wt*Cp
                        
                           b
                        
                        *(0.8*T
                        
                           c
                         + 0.2*T
                        
                           sk
                        ) which is a modified version from Equation (1), where two compartments of temperature are used with a mass weighting coefficient assuming a constant specific heat (Barwood et al., 2009). T
                        sk is mean skin temperature change and T
                        c is core temperature change. In this case, GI temperature from a thermometric pill is used to evaluate the storage term. In the initial screening process, a less complicated set of assumptions can be made.

In the initial screening process, it can be difficult to determine the cooling rate of systems, but ideally manufacturers have had systems measured according to ASTM Standard F2371-10 (ASTM, 2010b). If this information is not available, the following background information can be used to help estimate system performance prior to validation with manikin or human subjects. Some systems are advertised by the manufacturer with a cooling rate which may or may not have been derived from physical testing. The testing standard and surface temperature can impact the cooling properties (Gao et al., 2010). Open literature is also a potential source of estimating cooling rates. However, many systems do not have a cooling rate listed, so an engineering estimate is needed. Systems based on vapor-compression refrigeration technology, thermoelectric, and phase-change materials can be estimated reasonably well using thermodynamic first principles from their design parameter. Methods for evaluating cooling from thermoelectric and vapor-compression refrigeration technologies can be found commonly in many basic electrical and mechanical engineering texts. In practice, designers of the system should have a decent estimate of these values because they are required to design the systems, the evaluator must only check to make sure the claims are reasonable based on the laws of thermodynamics.

Air circulation systems, also seen in literature as body ventilation systems (BVS), present many problems when estimating cooling rates because of their dependence on fit, skin wettedness, environmental temperature and humidity, air flow, garments, etc. Essentially, manikin tests on air circulation systems can yield unrepresentative results compared with human subjects. Work by Xu and Gonzalez (2011) has attempted to measure the effectiveness of air circulation systems. An air circulation system is used in the example presented later and is covered in detail in the discussion section. Estimating their cooling power could be performed using data from literature of similar systems, simple and advanced computer modeling, or standard or modified thermal manikins (Burke et al., 2009).

However, phase-change systems are commonly encountered on the market without a cooling estimate. The following is some general background on obtaining an estimate based on the technology used in phase-change materials, previous experience with these system types, and any material specifications available.

Phase-change materials, such as ice, are frozen and change phase to a liquid by absorbing heat when melting. Using the weight of the system provided by the manufacturer, and material properties such as the melting temperature or type of PCM used, allows for the estimation of the material's specific heat and latent heat of fusion. The latent heat of fusion multiplied by the mass of the material provides the energy required to change phase from a solid to a liquid. This can then be added to the amount of energy required to change the temperature of the material by multiplying the specific heat with the mass and the difference between melting temperature and body temperature. Most phase-change materials have variable cooling rates; they provide high initial cooling followed by a decline until the cooling stops. The cooling rate is dependent on a number of factors including composition of the PCM or packaging, in packs or microcapsules (Wittmers et al., 1998), the latent heat, thermal conductivity of PCM (Farid et al., 2004), and the gradient between skin temperature and PCM melting temperature (Gao et al., 2010; House et al., 2013) and many other issues. However, the cooling effect is usually complete in two hours for most PCSs containing phase-change components (McCullough and Eckels, 2008). Because this analysis was path-independent until the PCS stopped cooling, the cooling rate in watts for phase-change material can be estimated as shown in Equation (4), where the total heat transfer is divided by the time, which is set at two hours. This way many of the variables can be factored out to simplify the calculations. It should be noted this is possibly at the expense of physiological effects, such as vasoconstriction and lowering skin temperature, Tskin, but these factors are not known, so cannot be included.

The goal of this section is to derive a numerical measure that objectively compares the thermal performance of two PCS for a given task scenario. Two steps are required. The first ensures the PCS provides a benefit to the wearer. The benefit can be seen if the heat storage of Equation (2) is less than that in Equation (1). This inequality is used to derive the mathematical expression in Equation (5). An important distinction is there are two terms for natural heat loss, one with the PCS and one without. This is important if the PCS allows for more or less natural heat loss in its inactive state than in the baseline, or possibly changes the natural heat loss because of the cooling effect of the PCS. The externally applied work was assumed constant, although this may not be the case. The algebraically condensed inequality becomes.

                        PCS is natural heat transfer to/from the body with the PCS (W) and Ht is the heat transfer from the body without PCS (W), and Cl = cooling rate (W). If the inequality in Equation (5) is not true, then the PCS is predicted to be a net negative to the wearer and the system should not be considered for this scenario. For system screening applications, the cooling rate (Cl) and natural heat transfer losses are the most difficult to estimate.

The next step was to determine if the PCS theoretically allowed the person to complete the task without reaching the specified heat-stress safety cutoff. This was accomplished by rearranging Equation (2) and solving for Δt
                        TT – the maximum time to heat stress.

This method, as shown in Equation (7), provides a relative measure between systems.

It should be noted here, the negative effect of the PCS system compared to the baseline will appear at the longer task times, even for otherwise high-performing systems. The effect of carrying a depleted PCS eventually overcomes any benefit derived from the fixed cooling duration. Negative effects could also occur for systems with a high mass and relatively low cooling potential. As more information becomes available, such as the PCS cooling rate, duration, and weight will allow the scoring to be refined and better allow for comparison between PCSs. Satisfying the parameters in Equation (6) allows the calculation of the new cooling effectiveness score in Equation (7).

Validation can be provided using manikin and human subject testing, which was performed on a number of systems to evaluate the PCS on dismounted soldiers (Elson et al., 2013).

In this example and validation, assumptions had to be made about the soldier and the operational environment to estimate the natural heat loss. The current study assumed the end user was operating in a desert environment. These conditions were found using data from the NASA Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy Tables (NASA, 2007):
                        
                           •
                           Air (dry bulb) temperature = 42.2 °C (108 °F)

Dew point temperature = 14.6 °C (58.3 °F)

Relative humidity = 20%

Air velocity = 2 m/s (4.5 mph)

Mean radiant temperature = 54.4 °C (130 °F)

The current study estimated the cooling system performance, then measured them on the manikin and with human subjects providing a unique validation trail for the proposed cooling effectiveness measure. The following are the systems that were included.
                        
                           1.
                           VentilationWear by Entrak — This system used a spacer mesh vest worn between the armor vest and shirt, with battery powered blowers to exchange humid air from sweating with the less humid ambient air. This system is dependent on the base garment between the body and vest, relative humidity, air gap, sweat rate, and numerous other factors. From the manufacturer's specifications the system was estimated to mass 1 kg and run for 8 h continuously at a maximum cooling rate of 250 W.

Cool UnderVest by Steele — This system consisted of phase-change packets worn in a minimalist carrier under body armor. The cooling power of this system was estimated using the procedures outlined above for PCM. As the freezing point of this material was near 0 °C, the properties of water at STP were used with manufacturer specifications for weight, 4–18 oz packs, total mass of about 2 kg, and run time of 2 h. This yielded an average estimated cooling power of 94.9 W.

PCVZ-KM Vest by Polar Products — A phase-change system consisting of an insulated, zipper vest with pockets for phase-change packets, this system also had a freezing point near 0 °C and water at sea level was used to estimate the properties. Using the manufacturer's data the system massed 2.7 kg, and based on previous PCM testing, was expected to run for about 2 h. The average estimated cooling power for two hours was 126.5 W.

Hummingbird II by Creative Thermal Solutions — This is a prototype direct-expansion vapor-compression refrigeration system that used expanding refrigerant housed in a tube-laced vest to provide cooling to the body. Unlike other vapor-compression refrigeration personal cooling systems, the system did not use a liquid perfused vest to act as a heat exchanger. This provided a comparative weight savings. The prototype system was expected to mass around 5 kg with one battery, based on the designer's estimation, and run at approximately 100 W–150 W for at least 2 h, with each additional battery extending cooling by at least 2 h per extra 1.5 kg. Therefore, the estimated cooling power for each battery was set at 125 W with a run time of 2 h.

Screening the systems outlined above for the dismounted soldier example requires a number of additional assumptions be made. It was assumed mission times spanned between one and eight hours and the baseline metabolic rate was an average of 400 W. More difficult is determining the natural heat loss for the human both with and without PCS. In this example, the personal protective equipment (PPE) is thick and impermeable over most of the torso area. The PCSs selected for testing were designed to fit under the PPE, so it is reasonable as a first approximation to assume the PCS and non-PCS natural heat loss are the same. Therefore, in Equation (5), H
                     T = HTPCS. If, for instance, the system were a full-body tube suit, this assumption would not be appropriate.

Determining natural heat loss before obtaining manikin data or human subject data is a challenge. This value can be difficult to determine as it is dependent on environmental conditions, clothing, equipment, and individual subject variation. In our example of the dismounted soldier, the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) charts showing work rates limits were used to estimate the natural heat loss. This simplistic measure used the “no limit” work time for the corresponding metabolic rate of 400 W and WBGT temperature of 28 °C. In this example, the WBGT index was adopted because the U.S. military has developed numerous tables for activity in different conditions, which were used in this analysis. Using the index, the “no limit” work time at the specified environmental condition should match the metabolic rate, resulting in no storage. It is noted that clothing and equipment have changed since 1994 and 2003, but as these are still referenced in military doctrine. It was assumed these values were still reasonable. Other viable methods can be used to estimate the natural heat loss prior to any testing (ISO, 2004). Using the scenario time, metabolic rate, and assumed natural heat loss allows the cooling effectiveness to be estimated for the PCS systems outlined in the previous section. Obviously, this pace and duration at eight hours may not be feasible due to fatigue, injury, and other factors. However, the goal of this analysis is to look at the energy balance to try and determine which PCS most benefits the end user. This result is shown in Table 2
                     . The Hummingbird II system has two entries to denote the effect of carrying an extra battery to power the system longer, at the expense of increased weight. In this setup, it is assumed the batteries are not discarded in the field.

Notice, after four hours, the systems with shorter run times start to fail. It is useful to remember that a 90 on these evaluations says, in essence, that the person completed 90% of the expected task without needing to modify his or her behavior. The extra battery also appears to be useful for the Hummingbird system in this case. Thus, for a seven-hour mission, the most effective system is the VentilationWear, followed by the Hummingbird II with battery, then the PCVZ-KM Vest. However, it should be noted that if the task time is four hours or less, another selection criteria will likely dictate which system is selected. For example, an extra battery for the Hummingbird II is not needed, and will be extra weight for the user to carry. A possible next step could also be to lower the maximum allowable heat storage over shorter time periods, if this is the time frame under evaluation, which will highlight the smaller differences between systems.

The first step in validating results of the screening process is checking cooling rate estimations. This was done with a sweating thermal manikin (MTNW, Newton) in the selected base ensemble, according to ASTM F2371-10 (ASTM, 2010b). Test results for cooling power are compared in Table 3
                      to the initial estimates.

In Table 3, it can be seen that three of the systems have very good initial estimates compared with the manikin results, but one was very different. Potential causes of this discrepancy are discussed in the next section. This highlights the difficulty of estimating the cooling effectiveness of air circulation systems, as they are dependent on multiple variables as discussed previously.


                     Table 4
                      shows the effect of using the new cooling data taken from the sweating thermal manikin, applied as the cooling power in the cooling effectiveness model.

Notice in Table 4 that although the cooling power of the VentilationWear system went from 250-W to 100-W with the updated manikin data, there was no difference in cooling effectiveness. The light-weight, high cooling power, and long run time of the system are still estimated to provide a positive effect on the end user. Obviously, there is very little difference between the estimations for the other three systems between Tables 4 and 2, due to the close estimations using the techniques described.

The final step in validation is to compare the ranking of the systems with the cooling-effectiveness calculations, with results obtained from human subject data acquired by walking in a climate-controlled chamber with solar load, matching the conditions listed above. The subjects worked at an average of 400 W for two hours, as measured by a VO2 machine. Results of this experiment were reported in Elson et al. (2013). Table 4 predicts subjects should be able to finish the two-hour trial without heat stress. Using the final expected heat storage for each system from Equation (2), assuming the natural heat transfer to the environment is the same between PCS tests and baseline tests, gives an additional way to rank the expected performance. Table 5
                      presents this estimate in the first column. The baseline result predicts heat storage of 75 W and the best system performance is the Hummingbird, with a net energy loss of about 50 W to the subject.

The second column in Table 5 presents the measured energy storage from the human subject trial with the PCS. The human trial results are surprising, as the energy storage is significantly higher than expected. It is important to note, with the exception of the air circulation system, which has known measurement and estimation challenges, the rank order of the storage meets initial estimates. This provides an important level of validation to the proposed method. Although, the higher-than-expected heat storage suggests additional information is required to accurately estimate heat storage in humans.

Being able to directly calculate the cooling rate in Equation (2) from human subject data would help diagnose the performance difference noted in the last paragraph. Natural heat loss from the subjects is the complicating factor, as it is not directly measured in the experiment. In previous studies, it has at least been implicitly assumed that the PCS does not significantly change natural heat loss from the body (Barwood et al., 2009; House et al., 2013). For the current analysis, baseline data for each subject was used to estimate natural heat loss for the non-PCS case. Calculation of the natural heat loss term can be found simply by rearranging Equation (1) and solving for Ht, with St from mean body temperature. The result of 356.5 W agrees relatively closely with our estimate from empirical data of 325 W prior to running the study. This represents approximately a 9% error, plus whatever uncertainty is associated with the mean body temperature calculation, which has significant potential errors (Jay and Kenny, 2007).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The cooling effectiveness factor presented in this paper is a novel way of screening the effectiveness of PCS systems for different end uses. It incorporates the effect of system weight and cooling power from first principles. In general, the validation with human subjects confirms the ranking of the systems. However, magnitude of the gap between the predictions and human subject results is troubling. For example, Table 5 showed the Hummingbird II system should have caused the human subjects to lose 50 W over the two hours and human subjects results showed no change in storage after the two hours. This highlights the importance of using the most accurate PCS to human cooling rates and natural heat losses possible when using the cooling effectiveness factor.

Multiple issues affect natural heat loss estimation. Changes resulting from different coverage areas and possible physiological reactions to each PCS are the most obvious two impacts. In evaluating a PCS in the above example, the PCS was assumed to be covered by the PPE, while covering the same area with the same thermal and evaporative resistances. In this case, this assumption was deemed reasonable because of the insulated, vapor-impermeable nature of body armor and similar body coverage areas. In many cases, there may not be PPE, and it may cover different areas, or have different resistance values. For example, a firefighter's outerwear may have high evaporative resistance and a relatively high thermal resistance covering the body, not the extremely high thermal resistance of ceramic plate body armor over the torso. PCS systems can range from neck coolers, to vests, to complete body tube suits, so this area and resistances of the area can be a major factor.

In an ideal case, natural heat loss could be estimated using a thermal manikin to test the ensembles without a PCS and with an inactive PCS. This could be used to determine the thermal and evaporative resistances, and then used in a physiological model or a ratio to known data. However, this still requires the availability of good physiological information and models.

Physiological responses to natural heat loss mechanisms are another area that could affect the estimates used. Currently, there doesn't seem to be any published literature specifically quantifying natural heat loss differences between PCS tests and baseline tests due to physiological responses. There are two main areas where this could occur — dry heat exchange by convection, conduction, and radiation; and latent heat exchange, by evaporation.

In dry heat exchange, the first logical location to look at could be a difference in natural heat loss because of the cooling effect of the PCS itself. If the PCS is working, then the body temperature should be lower than the baseline test. In this case, skin temperature is also likely lower. This will affect the temperature gradient from the skin, allowing for less beneficial heat exchange with the environment. A possibility that has been recognized in the literature is that a cold-boundary PCS could cause local vasoconstriction, which would lower the cooling experienced by the body (House et al., 2013).

The latent heat exchange is the other aspect of the natural heat loss of the body that could be affected. It has been noted in literature by House et al. (2013), and in our previous studies (McCullough and Eckels, 2008), that there is a significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) total sweat rate, in some cases, when using a PCS. This lowered sweat rate could have a major effect on the natural heat loss from the body and would need to be quantified to determine the effect. It is also possible there could be more sweating or more efficient use of sweat, as is the goal of air circulation systems. These issues will affect the estimation and calculation of natural heat transfer with and without a PCS for use in this first principles analysis.

The second aspect that would improve the cooling-effectiveness factor is to define the cooling rate of each PCS as accurately as possible. Measuring the cooling rate of a PCS has been described in ASTM Standard F2371-10 (ASTM, 2010b), and is a reasonable estimate assuming a mean skin temperature of 35 °C and good insulation between the PCS and the environment. Comparing the estimation methods presented in this paper to the manikin results, as shown in Table 3, shows good agreement for all systems except the air circulation system. As was noted in Section 2.6, standard F2371 is not designed to work well with this type of system.

Two main issues must be considered when translating cooling power measured on a manikin to human subjects. It is important to remember that in ASTM Standard F2371-10, the manikin surface temperature and ambient temperature are both held at 35 °C.
                        
                           •
                           Skin temperature on the human subjects is not constant at 35 °C, as in the manikin, and can drop significantly under the cooling system (House et al., 2013).

The manikin, being rigid, will also induce a different fit compared to human subject tests, which could create air gaps or make contact where none would occur on a human.

The environment is typically more extreme than 35 °C, increasing the loss of cooling potential to the environment.

Additional information on the effect of manikin surface temperature and different environments can be found in Gao et al. (2010), Xu and Gonzalez (2011) and Jetté et al. (2004).

Estimating cooling power applied by the air circulation systems provides a different set of challenges. Currently, ASTM Standard F2371-10 (ASTM, 2010b) is not appropriate for testing these systems, but is used because there is no other standard. Air circulation systems can seem to provide more or less cooling, during use in different environmental tests than Standard F2371-10. Flow rates necessary to maintain 100% skin wettedness of the manikin can be considered unrealistic in some scenarios, considering published maximum sweat rates (Gosselin, 1947; Smith and Havenith, 2011). Finally, there can be a different fit on the rigid manikin which can change the cooling potential of the systems by creating and blocking potential air-flow passages that may not exist on a malleable, moving human. There have been attempts to compensate for this effect by using physiological-controlled manikins to change the sweat rate of the manikin to better conform to human sweat rates (Burke et al., 2009). However, this can lead to a non-uniform sweat distribution on the manikin, which may impact results. This does solve the issue of 100% skin wettedness and deserves further study.

Overall, improving the screening method proposed here is relatively straightforward. As a first-principles method for screening systems and ranking them in order, this method appears to work well when used with the thermal manikin results. It is possible to define relatively accurately the natural heat loss with and without a PCS as well as the cooling rate of the PCS, using a thermal manikin and possibly thermal models. However, increasing the accuracy of the estimate will generally increase the cost, as extra information will be required. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis is appropriate at this point to determine how well the natural heat loss and cooling rate need to be, and can be, defined.

The current study also highlighted the need to take additional data during human subject testing. The data called out in ASTM Standard F2300-10 (ASTM, 2010a) is not sufficient to fully evaluate the physiological effect of a PCS on humans, and therefore validate the PCS cooling rate. A better understanding of the natural heat loss as discussed above would also benefit human subject trials. Perhaps the most significant is the ability to accurately calculate the energy storage from the human subject results.

As mentioned previously, Jay et al. (2006), Jay and Kenny (2007), and Vallerand et al. (1992) identified problems determining heat storage based on two compartment mean body temperature estimations, such as those used in this validation. Jay and Kenny used a third compartment, which improved their estimate, but the procedure required invasive, intramuscular temperature measurement. Currently, there is not enough research to determine how many compartments form a reasonable estimate of the mean body temperature, where they could be located, or if the compartments vary in the population. The research by Jay et al. (2006) also shows a possible effect of temperature on the compartments. In the case of a PCS, this could conceivably cause variations between PCSs depending on cooling temperatures and locations on the body. Finally, the effect of exercise-induced core temperature rise is noted in the literature (Livingstone et al., 1983), where exercise causes an immediate core temperature increase even in cold weather. Conceivably, this could be a source of error in compartment models and impact comparisons of PCSs when using Standard F2300-10 (ASTM, 2010a). Also, a smaller difference between the core temperatures of systems will result in the measurement uncertainty having a larger impact on the final results. If this method is to be fully validated, the cooling rate must be accurately calculated from the human subject data. This will require additions to the current standard, or a new standard, but will likely result in higher testing costs, more invasive procedures, or both.

Determining the necessary values to create an accurate model for heat stress and time, and then validating the model, is conceptually possible given the correct data. The information required for complete validation will require more information on the physiological effects of a PCS. However, the proposed low-level screening method provides a representative rank order of systems, when the cooling rate can be reasonably estimated compared to core temperature results. Despite the overall uncertainty, this method still provides a cost-effective process to order systems for future testing and evaluation.

Ultimately, if more accurate results are needed information is needed regarding the natural heat loss from both with and without a PCS, how clothing and a PCS interact, and how the body's physiology interacts with a PCS. This requires completing the energy and mass balance equation, leaving only the storage term as the unknown. This may be done in the future on human subjects and possibly using advanced human thermal models.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

To the author's knowledge, a current system does not exist for evaluation of personal cooling systems involving the scaling of different logistical factors and PCS effects using a numerical score. Furthermore, in the available literature, no one has attempted to model the application of PCSs to military personnel.

The selection method proposed incorporates a novel method to calculate the cooling effectiveness of a PCS for different tasks using the cooling rate in watts, weight, run time of a PCS, work rates, and different terrain and grades over a set time period. This allows for an improved method of choosing PCSs from the consumer and prototype markets for further testing. This method ultimately provides a better selection process, fewer wasted testing costs, and a set of systems more representative of the needs of the end user. The steps discussed can be used by many industries with the need for personal cooling. However, more information is needed on the body's heat loss, both with and without a PCS, and the actual cooling effect on the body before this method can be used to accurately predict mission or task times. More information is also required on the physiological effects of a PCS on humans, specifically accurate ways to determine body heat storage, before a comprehensive validation can occur. The method still provides an inexpensive metric for initial selection and possible framework for future improvements.

Personal protective equipment that restricts the body's natural cooling mechanisms can create an uncompensatable heat stress environment. PCS technology, working in conjunction with task-specific PPE, could be a necessary tool to improve the health, safety, and productivity of the 21st century athlete, worker, and warfighter. The selection method proposed here will assist commanders, procurement officers, trainers, managers, safety supervisors, and others in the first steps of selecting the best possible PCS on the market for their end users.
