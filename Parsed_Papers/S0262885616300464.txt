                  This paper presents an orthonormal dictionary learning method for low-rank representation. The orthonormal property encourages the dictionary atoms to be as dissimilar as possible, which is beneficial for reducing the ambiguities of representations and computation cost. To make the dictionary more discriminative, we enhance the ability of the class-specific dictionary to well represent samples from the associated class and suppress the ability of representing samples from other classes, and also enforce the representations that have small within-class scatter and big between-class scatter. The learned orthonormal dictionary is used to obtain low-rank representations with fast computation. The performances of face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dictionary learning has received attentions in recent years owning to its wide range of applications, such as face recognition [1,2,3], visual tracking [4,5], image classification [3,6,7], and person re-identification [8,9]. The existing methods can be roughly divided into two categories: unsupervised [10,11] and supervised [2,12,13,14]. Dictionaries learned by supervised methods are more discriminative and obtain better performances in classification tasks. But most supervised methods failed to take the relationship between dictionary atoms into account, which might yield similar atoms. A redundant dictionary with lots of similar atoms will result in the ambiguity of representations and high computation cost, and Fig. 1(a) shows the representation ambiguity problem brought by similar dictionary atoms.

In order to alleviate these problems, we present an orthonormal dictionary learning method. The dictionary is enforced to be orthonormal to eliminate similar atoms. Having a compact dictionary, both the ambiguities of representations and computation cost can be reduced. Our work is similar to [13] which achieved good performances on both classification and clustering tasks. Different from promoting incoherence between class-specific dictionaries in their work, our method endows the whole dictionary with the orthonormal property, which implies that all the atoms are as independent as possible whether they are in the same class or not. Fig. 1(b) shows the effect of the orthonormal property of the dictionary. Since the dimensionality of the feature vector is usually much larger than the number of dictionary atoms, forcing orthonormal constraint on the dictionary is feasible.

To get a more discriminative dictionary, we push the class-specific dictionary to have good ability to well represent samples from the associated class and also suppress the ability of representing samples from other classes. [13,14,15,16] explicitly modeled the idea and optimized the class-specific dictionaries one by one, which may neglect the relationship between class-specific dictionaries during the optimization procedure. Different from these work, we propose a concise discriminative regularization term only restricting on the representation. In our method, all the class-specific dictionaries are obtained simultaneously, and the relationship between them can well hold. Moreover, we encourage the representations to have small within-class scatter and big between-class scatter, which is implemented by using the Fisher discriminative criterion. The discriminative power of the representation is able to propagate to the dictionary since they are coordinately solved in a unified optimization framework.

Using the learned orthonormal dictionary, we are able to acquire low-rank representations with fast computation. Shu et al. [17] proved that the rank of the reconstruction data matrix is upper bounded by the number of non-zero rows of the representation matrix when the dictionary is orthonormal. According to this theorem, the nuclear norm in the low-rank representation can be replaced by its upper bound, and the representations can be obtained by the magnitude shrinkage function instead of the singular value shrinkage function which needs the SVD operation [18]. The solution procedure is much faster than solving the traditional low-rank representation problem [19,20].

As an application of the proposed method, face recognition from both images and videos are conducted. In still image datasets, faces from the same individual vary slightly and are highly correlated. They are assumed to lie in a linear subspace, so the reconstruction data of the faces are expected to be low-rank. What's more, the orthonormal dictionary is beneficial for reducing the ambiguities of the representations, and thus able to represent all the faces in the dataset faithfully and discriminatively. The results of various experiments on Extended Yale B and AR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in recognizing faces from still images. Compared with face image recognition, the task of face recognition from videos is more difficult since the videos are acquired under non-ideal conditions where illuminations, poses, or expressions vary large. The proposed dictionary learning method aims to learn a discriminative and compact dictionary which is quite robust to the variations in videos. We conduct experiments on Honda/UCSD and YouTube Celebrities datasets and achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods.

In order to alleviate these problems, we introduce the orthonormal constraint of the dictionary into our model. The orthonormal dictionary learning is given by

                      measures the low-rankness of the reconstruction data matrix DX, the

                      is the discriminative term for improving the discriminative power of the learned dictionary. The L is the label matrix of the samples Y, and the I is the identity matrix.

In classification task, training samples from the same class are highly correlated and expected to form a low-dimensionality subspace, so the training samples without noises, i.e. the reconstruction data matrix represented by DX, should be low-rank. We formulate the low-rank term as
                           
                              (2)
                              
                                 rank
                                 
                                    DX
                                 
                                 =
                                 rank
                                 
                                    Z
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                           
                        where rank(Z) denotes the rank of the matrix Z. The minimization of Eq. (2) is an NP-hard problem and difficult to solve due to the discrete nature of the rank(⋅) function. Fortunately, Fazel [21] proved that the nuclear norm function ∥
                           Z
                        ∥⁎ ( i.e. the sum of the singular values of Z) is the convex envelope of the rank function rank(Z) on the set of {Z
                        |∥
                           Z
                        ∥2
                        <1}, and Candès et al. [22,23] proposed to minimize the nuclear norm function instead of the rank function. Accordingly, our low-rank term can be rewritten as ∥
                           DX
                        ∥⁎. As demonstrated in [17], ∥

                        ∥⁎ is upper bounded by

Furthermore, the 2,1-norm can be interpreted as the group sparsity of face representations, which is demonstrated to be quite effective on the face recognition with complex variances in [24]. Eq. (3) can be minimized efficiently as described in Sec.3.1.

Real-word data are often noisy or corrupted due to illumination variation, occlusion, and pixel corruption. The classifier trained with these data may overfit and the classification performance may degrade. Motivated by the low-rank recovery [17,22], the corrupted data matrix Y is decomposed into two parts: a low-rank component DX and a sparse noise component E to alleviate the problem. Here, we denote the noisy term as

                         is the i-th column of the dictionary D, and

                           j
                         is the j-th column of the observation data matrix Y. This term enhances the ability of the class-specific dictionary to well represent samples from the associated class and suppress the ability of representing samples from other classes. In [13,14,15,16], the idea is explicitly modeled by imposing constraints on both D and X as Eq. (A.2) in the Appendix A. Proposition 1 shows the equivalence of the proposed term and the explicit modeling formulation. In the explicit modeling formulation, the class-specific dictionaries are optimized one by one, which may cause the loss of the relationship among class-specific dictionaries. By using our discriminative regularization term, all the class-specific dictionaries can be solved simultaneously.

                         is a matrix whose elements are all 1. In their work, the code-ideal term represented by ∥
                           X
                        -

                        2 encourages X to be close to Q. However, it potentially means that all the atoms in a class-specific dictionary provide the same contributions, which may bring negative effects to the representations of samples. The malpractice is dislodged by using the element-wise operator in our discriminative regularization term.

To further enhance the discriminative power of the dictionary D, we introduce the Fisher discrimination criterion tr(S

                        (X)) where the tr(⋅) denotes the trace a square matrix, the S
                        
                           W
                        (X) is the within-class scatter matrix, and the S
                        
                           B
                        (X) is the between-class scatter matrix. For simplicity, the trace-difference form, tr(S
                        
                           W

                           B
                        (X)), is used in our method. As the trace form is not convex to X, a regularization term η

                        Fig. 2
                         shows the distributions of the representations learned by Eq. (1). As shown in the figure, the discriminative regularization term aims to let the class-specific dictionary has the ability to represent samples from the associated class and suppress the ability to represent samples from other classes. The Fisher criterion encourages samples from the same class are close to each other and distant from samples from other classes. They use the class label information of the training samples in different ways, and both of them are beneficial for propagating the discriminative power of the representations to the dictionary. The overall discriminative term is

We evaluate the proposed orthonormal dictionary learning and fast low-rank representation methods on six public face datasets, three still image datasets: Extended Yale B [27], AR [28], and LFW [38], and three video datasets: Honda/UCSD [29], YouTube Celebrities [30], and YouTube Faces [50].

The Extended Yale B dataset contains 2414 frontal-face images from 38 people with 59–64 images per person. The images are captured under various controlled lighting conditions. The resolution of the image is 192×168 pixels. Since previous work test their methods on this dataset with different experimental settings, we do several experiments for fair comparisons.

To compare with the results in [14], we resize the images in the dataset as 54×48 pixels. For each people, 20 images are randomly selected for training with the remaining images for testing. Table 1
                         shows that our method outperforms other methods. Besides, the images are projected to a 504-dimensional feature by using a random matrix of zero-mean normal distribution following the experimental in [33]. For each person, half images are used for training, and the rest half for testing. The comparison results are displayed in Table 2
                        . Our method achieves comparable results as other methods. The good results demonstrate the effectiveness of the orthonormal dictionary.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows some of the learned dictionary atoms with semantic information, which shows that the learned dictionary is discriminative enough for classification. Fig. 4
                         presents some decomposition results of the training face images. As shown in the figure, different illumination conditions mainly influence the noise components.

The influence of the parameters in Eq. (9) is evaluated on this dataset. To evaluate the influence of one parameter, we change the parameter with other two parameters fixed and report the recognition accuracies. The results are shown in Fig. 5
                        . The figure shows that our dictionary learning method is insensitive to λ
                        2 and λ
                        3, and the interesting phenomenon is that the performance dramatically decreases when λ
                        1 going smaller. This is mainly because that the λ
                        1 controls the importance of reconstruction error in the objective function which demonstrates the effect of reconstruction for recognition.

We also evaluate the computation time of our fast low-rank representation (FLRR) with the traditional low-rank representation solved by linear alternating direction method with adaptive penalty (LRR-LADMAP). Both of the FLRR and LRR-LADMP are executed on the computer with a 3.40GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) CPU. The FLRR computes all the representations of 2414 images by 4 iterations, and the average processing time per image is 0.56 milliseconds, while the LRR-LADMAP represents all the images by 185 iterations with each image taking about 58ms. Furthermore,the FLRR achieves 94.44% accuracy, and the LRR-LADMAP achieves 94.80% recognition accuracy. It means that our FLRR is much faster on getting low-rank representations than traditional low-rank representation with comparable recognition performances.

The AR dataset consists of more than 4000 color frontal images from 126 people with 26 images per person. The 26 images are taken in two separated sessions, and each session contains 13 images. In each session, 3 images are obscured by scarves, 6 are obscured by sunglasses, and the remaining faces are with different facial expressions or illumination conditions and regarded as unobscured images.

We first do experiments under the standard evaluation procedure in [32]. A subset consisting of 2600 images from 50 male and 50 female individuals is used. For each individual, 20 face images are randomly selected for training and the remaining 6 images are used for testing. All the face images are cropped to 165×120 and then projected onto a 540-dimensional feature. The comparison results are displayed in Table 3
                        . Our method achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods, and the number of the class-specific atoms is set as 3 which is smaller than that of other methods.

In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against occlusions, we follow the protocol in [25,35] and conduct experiments under three scenarios:
                           
                              1.
                              
                                 Sunglass: The sunglass give rise to about 20% occlusions of the faces. In this scenario, 7 unobscured images and 1 randomly selected image with sunglass from session 1 are used for training, and the remaining unobscured images from session 2 and the images with sunglass from both session 1 and session 2 are used for testing.


                                 Scarf: Compared with sunglass, the scarf occludes more regions of faces. The scarf covers around 40% of the faces. Similar to the sunglass scenario, 7 unobscured images and 1 randomly selected image with scarf from session 1 are used for training, and the remaining unobscured images and images with scarf are used for testing.


                                 Mixed (Sunglass

                                 Scarf): In this case, the images with sunglass and scarf are mixed. The training samples are 7 unobscured images, 1 image with sunglass, and 1 image with scarf from session 1, and the rest images are used for testing.

For each scenario, the experiments are conducted three times and the average results are reported. The comparison results are displayed in Table 4
                                 . As shown in the table, our method outperforms other methods.

On this dataset, we also do the experiments of gender classification. As in [14] and [36], an unobscured subset of 50 male and 50 female individuals with 14 images per individual is chosen. Images of the first 25 male and 25 female individuals are used for training, and other 25 male and 25 female individuals are used for testing. Following the protocol in previous works, the PCA is used to reduce the dimension for each image to 300. The number of class-specific dictionary atoms (#(C-S DA)) are set as 250 and 25, respectively, and the comparison results with other dictionary learning methods are displayed in Table 5
                        . As shown in the table, our method outperforms other methods.

The LFW dataset [38] contains 13,233 images of 5749 individuals. The face images in this dataset are taken in unconstrained environments. Fig. 6
                         shows some face images of the dataset. As shown in the figure, the LFW is a challenging large-scale face image dataset which involves the interferences of illumination, pose, expression, occlusion, and background. The LFW dataset is aligned by a commercial face alignment software, and the aligned LFW dataset called LFWa is released in [39]. Following [36,40], we do experiments of face identification on this dataset. Individuals who have more than 10 face images are chosen, and a subset of LFWa is constructed with 4174 face images of 143 individuals. For each individual, the first 10 images are used for training the dictionary and the rest images are for testing. The face image is first divided into 10×8 patches and then represented by the concatenation of histograms of the Uniform-LBP descriptors extracted from the patches. The PCA is used to reduce the dimension of the face image descriptor to 1000. The comparisons of the recognition results are shown in Table 6
                         .

The Honda/UCSD dataset contains 59 face videos of 20 individuals. All the face videos are with large variations of poses and expressions, and the average length of these videos is about 400 frames. Following the protocol in [41,42,43], the faces in videos are detected by the detector proposed in [44] frame by frame and then resized to gray-scale images of size 20×20. Histogram equalization is employed to the vectorized face images to reduce the lighting effects. For each individual, 1 randomly selected video is used as training data, and the rest of the videos are used for testing. Three cases of maximum set length (50, 100, and full length) are tested, and the results of these three cases and the average result are reported in Table 7
                        . The results shown in the table are the average over 10 trials under the standard experimental settings. Here, for the maximum length of 50 and 100 cases, the first corresponding frames are used as a standard setting. Noting that the randomly selected 50/100 frames are used as in [43,45], we use the randomly selected frames to test our method for fair comparisons, and our method achieves the recognition accuracies of 100% in both cases. Besides, the dictionary-based method SFDL [46], the covariance on manifold method Cov+PLS [47], and the manifold align method [48] are only tested under the full-length case, and their recognition accuracies are 100%, 100%, and 98.9%, respectively. Therefore, our method achieves the comparable results to the state-of-the art methods. Furthermore, the number of class-specific atoms is set as 5 in our method, quite smaller than 10 and 20 in JLDSS and SFDL, which demonstrates that the orthonormal property is beneficial for the compactness of the dictionary.

The YouTube Celebrities (YTC) [30] dataset contains 1190 video clips of 47 individuals (actors, actresses, and politicians) from YouTube. There are around 41 clips segmented from 3 unique videos for each individual, and the frame number of theses video clips varies from 8 to 400. Compared to Honda/UCSD dataset, the face video clips in this dataset exhibit larger variations in pose, illumination, and expressions. What's more, most of the videos are low resolution and recorded at high compression rates, which leads to noisy and low-quality image frames. The YTC dataset is thus a more challenging face video dataset.

Following the standard protocol, for each individual, the training set is composed of 3 randomly selected video clips which come from 3 unique videos, and the testing set consists of 6 randomly selected video clips where each unique video provides 2 video clips. Similar to the implementation on Honda/UCSD dataset, all the faces are detected and resized to 30×30 pixels, followed by the histogram equalization for reducing lighting effects. The comparison results are shown in Table 8
                        . Our method achieves the best recognition performance, the primal reason is that the orthonormal property prevents similar atoms appearing in the dictionary, which is good for representing faces faithfully and discriminatively.

The YouTube Faces (YTF) dataset [50] is commonly used for face verification, i.e. determine whether two face videos are from the same individual or not. The dataset contains 3425 videos of 1595 individuals collected from YouTube website. The face videos in this dataset contain large variations in pose, illumination, and expression, and the average length of the a video clip is about 181 frames. Two test protocols are provided: restricted [51,52,53,54] and unrestricted [55,46]; the restricted protocol limits that only the same/not same label information is available for training, and the unrestricted protocol allows training with the real label of the individual. Since the real label of the individual is needed for learning the dictionary in our method, we follow the setting in [46] to adopt the unrestricted protocol.

For each video clip in the dataset, we first first cropped each frame into 30×30 according to eye coordinates, and then perform histogram equalization to reduce the illumination influence. Following the unrestricted protocol in [50], 5000 video pairs are randomly selected and equally divided into 10 folds, each fold contains 500 pairs where 250 pairs are from same individual, and the other 250 pairs are not. The 10-fold cross-validation strategy is used. Among the 10 folds, 6 folds are used for learning the dictionary, 3 folds are used to learn the discriminative distance matric by the method in [56], and 1 for test. The results are reported in Table 9
                        . Our method is able to achieve comparable results with other methods.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented an orthonormal dictionary learning method for fast low-rank representation. The orthonormal property is able to reduce the ambiguities of representations and computation cost. Both the proposed concise discriminative regularization term and the introduced Fisher criterion are beneficial for the discriminative power of the dictionary. With the learned orthonormal dictionary, the low-rank representations can be acquired with fast computation. The proposed method is applied to the face recognition task, and the results on three face image datasets and three face video datasets showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.
