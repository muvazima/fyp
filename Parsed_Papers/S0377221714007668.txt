                  This paper develops primal and dual versions of the dynamic Luenberger productivity growth measures that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and intertemporal cost minimization, respectively. The empirical application focuses on panel data of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1995–2005. Primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth averages 1.5 percent annually in the period under investigation, with technical change being the main driver of annual change. Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is −0.1 percent in the same period. Improvements in technical inefficiency and technical change are partly counteracted by deteriorations of allocative inefficiency, with large dairy farms presenting a slightly higher productivity growth than small dairy farms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The characterization and measurement of economic performance in both theory and practice continues to claim considerable attention in the literature. The major attention of economic performance centers on the measurement of efficiency and productivity growth. The economics literature on efficiency has produced a wide range of productivity growth measures (see Balk, 2008 for a comprehensive treatment).

The setting of the decision environment plays a crucial role in the modeling framework and the characterization of results. The static models of production are based on the firm's ability to adjust instantaneously and ignore the potential dynamic linkages of production decisions. The business policy relevance to distinguishing between the contributions of variable and capital factors to inefficiency or productivity growth is clear. For example, when variable factor use is not meeting its potential, remedies can include better monitoring of resource use; when asset use is not meeting potential, remedies can include training programs to enhance performance or even a review of the organization of assets in the production process to take advantage of asset utilization. The weakness underlying the static theory of production in explaining how some inputs are gradually adjusted has led to the development of the dynamic models of production where current production decisions constrain or enhance future production possibilities.

Allowing for the presence of dynamic adjustment leads productivity growth measurement to include a scale and technical change effects (as in the static theory) in addition to capital stock adjustment and the impact of the changing shadow values on long-run equilibrium capital stocks and investment (Luh &#38; Stefanou, 1991). This decomposition can be further elaborated to account for efficiency change (Rungsuriyawiboon &#38; Stefanou, 2008).

The characterization of dynamic efficiency can also build on the adjustment cost framework that implicitly measures inefficiency as a temporal concept as it accounts for the sluggish adjustment of some factors. In a nonparametric setting, Silva and Stefanou (2007) develop a myriad of efficiency measures associated with the dynamic generalization of the dual-based revealed preference approach to production analysis found in Silva and Stefanou (2003). In a parametric setting, Rungsuriyawiboon and Stefanou (2007) present and estimate the dynamic shadow price approach to dynamic cost minimization.

An intriguing prospect is to incorporate the properties of the dynamic production technology presented in Silva and Stefanou (2003) into the directional distance function framework, which can exploit the Luenberger productivity growth measurement. The directional distance function offers the powerful advantage of focusing on changes in input and output bundles, inefficiency and the technology. Such a productivity measure based on the directional distance function has its origins in Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1996) who defined a Luenberger indicator of productivity growth in the static context. A growing literature employing this approach has emerged more recently (see Balk, 2008; Boussemart, Briec, Kerstens, &#38; Poutineau, 2003; Briec &#38; Kerstens, 2004; Chambers &#38; Pope, 1996; Chambers et al., 1996; Färe &#38; Grosskopf, 2005; Färe &#38; Primont, 2003). The dual approach to measuring Luenberger productivity growth in the static context has been elaborated by e.g. Färe, Grosskopf, and Margaritis (2008), but has hardly been applied in the literature.

This paper develops primal and dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicators that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and the intertemporal cost function, respectively. The adverbs ‘primal’ and ‘dual’ refer to the models that are underlying the computation of the productivity indicators, i.e. the intertemporal cost function used for computing the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator is dual to the primal distance function that underlies the computation of the primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator. The primal Luenberger productivity growth indicator is decomposed to identify the contributions of efficiency growth and technical change, while the dual Luenberger productivity growth indicator offers a further decomposition to identify the impact of quasi-fixed factor disequilibrium and allocative efficiency change. An illustration of these measures is applied to a panel of Dutch dairy farms over 1995–2005.

The next section develops the primal and dual measures of dynamic productivity growth and its decomposition. This is followed by the empirical application to the panel of Dutch dairy farms which uses the results of a previously estimated dynamic directional distance function found in Serra, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2011) to generate the primal and dual measures of productivity growth and their respective decompositions. The final section offers concluding comments.

The Luenberger indicator of dynamic productivity growth is illustrated graphically in Fig. 1
                     (for ease of exposition, it is assumed that output is the same in both periods; the capital stock K differs across periods). The quantities of inputs and investments at time t and time t + 1 are denoted as (x

As in the primal case, the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity indicator can be decomposed to identify the contributions of technical change (ΔTD) and technical efficiency change (ΔTEI). But now that this measure embodies an optimization objective (intertemporal cost minimization), we can additionally address the contribution of allocative inefficiency change (ΔAEI) and the change in the shadow value of capital (ΔSV):

                     While the first three components of the right-hand-side of Eq. (9) have direct analogs to the static case, the component ΔSV requires some elaboration. Once we allow for disequilibirum in quasi-fixed factor use, it is clear from Eq. (7) that the notion of an internally generated shadow price of capital plays the role of a price component for the net investement infusions. In particular, changes in the captial stock lead to shifts in the shadow price of capital, which must be addressed in the productivity growth indicator.

Technical change is computed as the arithmetic mean of the normalized distance between the optimal value frontiers, evaluated at prices and quantities in period t and period t + 1, respectively, as

Our empirical application focuses on a sample of specialized dairy farms in the Netherlands. Farm-level data are obtained from the European Commission's Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and cover the period 1995–2005. To ensure that milk output is the mainfarm output, we select those farms whose milk sales represent at least 80 percent of total farm income. The dataset is an unbalanced panel that contains 2614 observations on 639 farms that, on average, stay in the sample during 4 years.

We distinguish one output, two variable inputs, two quasi-fixed inputs and two fixed inputs to keep the vector of estimated parameters to a manageable size. Output, y, is defined as a farm's total output and includes milk, livestock and livestock products, crops and crop products and other output. The two variable inputs are variable costs other than feed, x
                     1, and feed expenses, x
                     2. Variable x
                     1 is an aggregate input that includes veterinary expenses, energy, contract work, crop-specific costs and other variable input costs. Breeding livestock is considered as a quasi-fixed input, K
                     1. Machinery and buildings, also defined as quasi-fixed inputs, are aggregated into K
                     2. Variables y, x
                     1, x
                     2, K
                     1 and K
                     2 are measured at constant 1995 prices. Total utilized agricultural area, L
                     1, measured in hectares, and total labor input, L
                     2 measured in annual working units (AWU), are assumed to be fixed inputs. Labor was assumed to be a fixed input because approximately 95 percent of the labor input was coming from the farm family in the sample period.

Since output and input prices are unavailable from FADN, country-level price indices are taken from Eurostat's New Cronos Dataset. Netputs measured in monetary values are defined as implicit quantity indices by computing the ratio of value to its corresponding Tornqvist price index. Depreciation rates considered for buildings, machinery and breeding livestock are 3 percent, 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The interest rate (r) is defined as the average, over the period 1995–2005, of the annual interest rate for 10 years’ maturity government bonds (Eurostat) and is equal to 4.97 percent. Following Epstein and Denny (1983), Pietola and Myers (2000) and others, we assume that the current price of a quasi-fixed input can be derived as the discounted sum of the future rents on the depreciated asset. Based on this assumption, the rental cost price of capital is measured as ci
                      = (r + δi
                     )zi
                     , where zi
                      is the quasi-fixed asset price (defined as a Tornqvist price index).


                     Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis. With quantity and price indexes used to construct the data, milk production accounts for 90 percent of the value of production, and variable expenses (of which 40 percent are feed expenses) are 43 percent relative to the value of production. The observed long-run cost represents almost 70 percent of total value of output. While breeding livestock gross investments are substantial, I
                     1, net investments, 
                        
                           
                              K
                              ˙
                           
                           1
                        
                     , represent only 0.25 percent of K
                     1, which is due to the milk quota system regulating EU's dairy sector and limiting this sector's growth. It should be noted though that the dairy quota system in the Netherlands allows farms to continue to grow by buying or leasing additional quota. Although the milk quota limits the possibilities for growth of the dairy herd, it does not prevent modernization of dairy holdings that, on average, have net investments in machinery and buildings of almost 7 percent per year.

The estimation of the dynamic directional distance function and dynamic cost function can be done parametrically as in this study or nonparametrically. The nonparametric approach more easily allows for a further decomposition of productivity into the contributions of scale and congestion (see Epure, Kerstens, &#38; Prior, 2011). In addition, the nonparametric approach allows for firm-specific measurements of technical change, while the parametric approach requires assuming equal technical change across the farms in the sample or groups of farms within the sample as in latent class models. However, the nonparametric approach can be subject to computational issues when there is not wide variation in the benchmark technology which is largely determined by those firms identifying the boundary; i.e., V(y(t)|K(t).) such that

The empirical application builds on the parametric estimation of the dynamic directional distance function presented in Serra et al. (2011), using the Dutch dairy farming data set described above. Quantification of the dynamic directional distance and optimal value functions was achieved by econometric estimation. Following Chambers (2002) and Färe, Grosskopf, Noh, and Weber (2005), the quadratic function was used as a parametric specification for the directional distance function. Dynamic cost inefficiency is obtained by estimating a quadratic specification of the optimal value function. The empirical model and the results of the estimation are presented in Appendix A and are more elaborately discussed in Serra et al. (2011). The study yielded a dynamic directional distance function that is increasing in variable, quasi-fixed and fixed inputs and decreasing in output and investment demand, and a dynamic cost frontier that is increasing in prices of variable and quasi-fixed inputs and decreases with capital stock.

                     Table 2
                     presents the computation of the primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth and its decomposition into the contributions of technical change (ΔT) and technical inefficiency change (ΔTEI). Productivity grows on average with 1.5 percent per year, although the annual changes are fluctuating between −5.3 percent and 12.7 percent. The average productivity growth of 1.5 percent indicates that every year during the sample period 1995–2006, Dutch dairy farmers produced 1.5 percent more output from the same quantity of inputs.

Technical change is 1.2 percent per year and is the major contributor, on average, to improvement of productivity. Hence, technical improvements allowed Dutch dairy farmers to increase their production by 1.2 percent per year during the sample period. Technical improvements could have come from improvements of the genetic potential of the dairy cows, improvements in feeding and improvements in the milking technology such as the increasing adoption of the milking robot (André, Berentsen, Engel, de Koning, &#38; Oude Lansink, 2010; André, Berentsen, van Duinkerken, Engel, &#38; Oude Lansink, 2010). Technical inefficiency increases on average to make a positive contribution to productivity growth of, on average, 0.2 percent per year. However, the fluctuation in technical inefficiency is large and is the driver of the year to year changes in productivity. Productivity growth is slightly larger for large dairy farms (1.8 percent) than small

                        A farm was classified as large or small, depending on whether its production was above or below the median.
                      dairy farms (1.1 percent), a difference that is attributable to the higher contribution of technical inefficiency change on large dairy farms. This outcome suggests that large dairy farms better succeeded in improving the use of the current production technology than small farms. According to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, differences between large and small farm indicators are significant, with the exception of the technical change indicator. The annual contributions of technical change and technical inefficiency change to productivity growth are displayed in Fig. 2
                     . The figure clearly shows that technical inefficiency change (ΔTEI) is the driver of changes in productivity in the period 1996–2005.

Moving to the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth measure can help clarify the movement of technical inefficiency change. Table 3
                     presents the computation of the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth and its decomposition into the contributions of technical change (ΔTD), shadow value change (ΔSV), technical inefficiency change (ΔTEI) and allocative inefficiency change (ΔAEI). Productivity declines on average with 0.1 percent per year, though varying between −6.5 percent and 5.8 percent. Hence, this outcome of the dual model suggests that Dutch dairy farmers produced 0.1 percent less output from the same quantity of inputs per year during the sample period 1995–2006. Both the average size and range of productivity growth are smaller than in the primal model (Table 2). Technical change is around 0.5 percent per year and is also smaller than in the primal model, but still the major contributor, on average to improvement of productivity. The change in the shadow value of capital has no impact on productivity growth. Technical inefficiency decreases on average by 0.2 percent and delivers the second largest contribution to productivity growth. The fluctuation in technical inefficiency is counteracted partly by reverse changes in allocative inefficiency. However, on average, allocative inefficiency change (ΔAEI) has a negative contribution to productivity growth. The annual contributions of the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth components are displayed in Fig. 3
                     which indicatesthat technical inefficiency change (ΔTEI) and allocative inefficiency change are the main drivers of changes in the dual Luenberger dynamic productivity growth indicator in the period 1996–2005. Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is almost equal for small and large dairy farms. Allocative inefficiency change makes a relatively large negative (−1 percent) contribution to productivity growth of large dairy farms, suggesting that large dairy farms have more problems in adjusting inputs to long run optimal levels than small dairy farms. According to the KS test, differences across large and small dairy farms’ dual productivity indicators are significant.

Being a first effort to generate primal and dual measures of dynamic Luenberger productivity growth, our results are not directly comparable with productivity growth measures generated in previous research as they are based on static models. Brümmer, Glauben, and Thijssen (2002) measured and decomposed productivity growth of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1991–1994, finding that technical change contributed 0.5 percent to productivity growth, similar to the contribution generated by the dual dynamic productivity growth measure in our study. Also, they find that technical efficiency change had a 0.6 percent contribution to productivity growth, a value that is close to our finding of 0.3 percent. In their static model, allocative efficiency change had a much more positive contribution (1.7 percent) to productivity growth than our dynamic model (−0.8 percent). This divergence between our results and Brümmer et al (2002) suggests that farmers have more problems in finding an efficient allocation of inputs and outputs in the long-run than in the short-run. It should be kept in mind though that the period under investigation in our study does not coincide with that of the Brümmer et al.’s study.

Fluctuations in milk prices over the period of analysis (see Fig. 4), may explain the difficulties of producers to allocate resources efficiently from a technical and economic point of view in the long-run. Fluctuations in productivity growth, mainly driven by technical and allocative inefficiency changes, are negatively correlated with milk price fluctuations.

                        2
                        The correlation coefficient is −0.4. Please note that the milk price index is used in the computation of the output quantity index.
                      This may suggest that farmers are conservative (pessimistic) regarding price expectations and they devise production structures that are optimal in low price frameworks. As a result, during years of bad prices, behavior is more efficient than in good price years. To the extent that this hypothesis is correct, progressive decoupling of EU policies, reducing price supports, may lower farmer price expectations, which may exacerbate inefficiencies during high price years.

Also, Oude Lansink and Zhu (2009) analyzed productivity growth of Dutch dairy farms in the period 1995–2004 using a static model of production. Their results suggest a higher technical change than predicted by our dynamic primal and dual model (3.6 percent). The contribution of technical efficiency change and allocative efficiency change were different from our model, i.e. −0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.

Several studies have now measured the composition of productivity growth using the sample of Dutch dairy farms. The dynamic primal and dual approaches account for the presence of costs of adjustment associated with changes in quasi-fixed factors of production in the measurement of productivity growth. Moreover, the dynamic dual approach provides a richer decomposition of productivity than the static approach by measuring the contribution of the change in the shadow value of capital. The results of this study show that the dynamic approaches yield different results than the static approaches that were applied to the same data set. The contribution of technical change is notably lower, and the contribution of technical efficiency change is higher in the dynamic approach rather than the static approach. This suggests that adjustment costs associated with investments translate into a lower contribution of technical efficiency change, when not accounted for properly, whereas the benefits of investments, i.e. better technology are overstated through a higher contribution of technical change. The results of the dual dynamic model indicate that the contribution of shadow value change to productivity growth was negligible in the study sample.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper develops primal and dual measures of dynamic Luenberger productivity growth that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and intertemporal cost minimization, respectively. The empirical illustration focuses on a panel of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1995–2005.

Average primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is 1.5 percent in the period under investigation, with technical inefficiency change being the main driver of change. Productivity growth of large farms is higher (1.8 percent) than of small farms (1.1 percent). Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is −0.1 percent in the same period. Productivity growth of large dairy farms and small dairy farms are almost equal (−0.1 percent). In the period under investigation, improvements in technical inefficiency are partly counteracted by deteriorations of allocative inefficiency. Particularly, large farms have a negative (−1 percent ) contribution of allocative inefficiency change to productivity growth, suggesting that finding an optimal allocation of inputs in the long-run is more problematic for large rather than small dairy farms.

This study has demonstrated the value of the dynamic Luenberger productivity indicators in that it allows for identifying the components of productivity growth. The dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator allows for a richer decomposition than the primal indicator as it also identifies contributions from allocative inefficiency change and change in the shadow value of capital.

While this study focuses on the dynamic microeconomic decision making implications for efficiency and productivity, there are several interesting policy-related issues that can be gleaned from the empirical analysis. Technical change is a principal contributor to productivity growth followed by technical efficiency change. With technological innovations in this sector being driven externally, publicly supported R&#38;D activities and policies that can facilitate private sector R&#38;D being translated into marketed innovations are potential productivity-promoting actions. Knowledge translating and outreach activities to farmers can certainly promote efficiency improvements. Further, recognizing that large farms can benefit from allocative efficiency gains, targeted knowledge in translating and outreach activities tailored to their scope of activities can be fruitful.

The quantification of the dynamic directional distance function was achieved by econometric estimation. The quadratic function was used as a parametric specification for the directional distance function as it offers the advantage that it can be easily restricted to satisfy the translation property. The quadratic specification is a flexible functional form that is twice differentiable in all its arguments. Setting gxi

                      corresponds to the quadratic form in Eq. (A.1), with αh
                      added to gross investments and subtracted from variable input quantities. By choosing αh
                      specific for each firm, variation on the left hand side of Eq. (A.3) is obtained. Following Färe et al. (2005), αh
                      is set equal to I
                     1, which is the normalizing input in determining technical efficiency.

                        This variable represents gross investment in breeding livestock. Parameter estimates changed very little with the choice of αh however.
