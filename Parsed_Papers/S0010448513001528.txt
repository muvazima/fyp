                  The progressive and iterative approximation (PIA) method is an efficient and intuitive method for data fitting. However, in the classical PIA method, the number of the control points is equal to that of the data points. It is not feasible when the number of data points is very large. In this paper, we develop a new progressive and iterative approximation for least square fitting (LSPIA). LSPIA constructs a series of fitting curves (surfaces) by adjusting the control points iteratively, and the limit curve (surface) is the least square fitting result to the given data points. In each iteration, the difference vector for each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting curve (surface). Moreover, we present a simple method to compute the practical weight whose corresponding convergence rate is comparable to that of the theoretical best weight. The advantages of LSPIA are two-fold. First, with LSPIA, a very large data set can be fitted efficiently and robustly. Second, in the incremental data fitting procedure with LSPIA, a new round of iterations can be started from the fitting result of the last round of iterations, thus saving great amount of computation. Lots of empirical examples illustrated in this paper show the efficiency and effectiveness of LSPIA.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Progressive and iterative approximation (PIA) method  [1,2] is an efficient and intuitive method for data fitting. It cannot only avoid the computational cost of solving a large system of linear equations, but generate a series of approximation curves or surfaces as well. However, in the classical PIA method, the number of the control points is equal to that of the data points. It is not feasible when the number of data points is very large. Although the classical PIA method is extended in Ref.  [3] to approximate a given data set, the limit of the generated curve (surface) sequence is not the least square fitting (LSF) result to the data set. Certainly, the least square fitting is one of the most commonly used mathematical tools in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we devise a progressive and iterative approximation method, namely, progressive and iterative approximation for least square fitting (abbr. LSPIA), whose limit is the least square fitting result to a given data set.

Similar as the classical PIA method, LSPIA starts with an initial blending curve (surface), and constructs a series of fitting curves (surfaces) by adjusting the control points iteratively. In each iteration, the adjusting vector of each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting curve (surface). Compared with the traditional least square method, LSPIA has the following advantages:
                        
                           •
                           LSPIA can handle point set of large size;

LSPIA is so flexible that it allows the adjustment of the number of control points, and knot vector in the iterations;

LSPIA is easy to make the fitting curve hold the shape preserving property;

LSPIA can be performed in parallel efficiently.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section  1.1, we briefly review the related work. Then we introduce the iterative method of LSPIA and show its convergence in Section  2. In Section  3, we study how to assign appropriate values for the weight of LSPIA. Afterwards, Section  4 presents some numerical examples. Section  5 discusses its advantages and shortcomings, and Section  6 concludes this paper.

The progressive and iterative approximation (PIA) is a new and effective technique to seek the curve or surface fitting the data points. The PIA property of the uniform cubic B-spline curve, is first discovered by Qi et al.  [4] and de Boor  [5], respectively. Lin et al.  [1] show that the non-uniform cubic B-spline curve and surface also hold the property. Furthermore, the PIA method is extended to the blending curve and surface with NTP basis  [2]. Moreover, it is proved that the rational B-spline curve and surface (NURBS) have the property, too  [6]. Lu  [7] devises a weighted PIA method to speed up the convergence of the PIA method. More importantly, Lin  [8] discovers the local property of the PIA, by which PIA can control the fitting precision of each data point individually. Recently, the EPIA(extended PIA) method is proposed  [3] to fit data using normalized totally positive (NTP) bases. And Chen et al.  [9] show the convergence of the PIA method for triangular B–B patches at uniform nodes.

While the PIA method depends on the parametric distance between the data points and the corresponding foot points on the curve with the same parameters, Maekawa et al. invent an iterative fitting method, called interpolation by geometric algorithm   [10,11], which is similar to PIA method, but relies on geometric distance between the data points and their closest points on the curve(surface). The geometric interpolation algorithm  [10] is extended to approximate the vertices of a triangular mesh using Loop subdivision surface  [12], and point cloud with B-spline surface  [13].

The PIA method has been extended to subdivision surface fitting, named progressive interpolation (PI), too. Cheng et al. design the PI method of subdivision fitting for a Loop subdivision surface [14], and prove its convergence. Fan et al. develop the PI method of Doo–Sabin subdivision surface fitting  [15]. The PI method for Catmull–Clark subdivision surface fitting is proposed in  [16]. Very recently, Deng and Ma  [17] develop the weighted PIA method for interpolating mesh by a Loop subdivision surface and give a numerical method for finding an appropriate value of the weight.

In this section, we introduce the LSPIA iterative methods for blending curves and surfaces in Sections  2.1 and 2.2, respectively.

In this section, we present the LSPIA iterative method for blending curves and show its convergence.

As shown in Eq. (6), a weight is required for generating the adjusting vector. In this section, we will discuss how to select an appropriate weight to improve the convergence rate of the LSPIA iterative methods presented in Section  2. For brevity, only the LSPIA iterative method for blending curves is handled, and the results for LSPIA iterative method for blending surfaces can be deduced similarly.

In Theorem 3.1, we present the best weight which can lead to the fastest convergence rate.

In this section, we test the LSPIA by cubic B-spline curves because of its simplicity and wide range of applications in CAD. In Section  4.1, the implementation details for the LSPIA and cubic B-spline curves are elucidated. In the following, six representative examples are demonstrated in Section  4.2.

In this section, we present six representative examples to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the LSPIA presented in Section  2. The point sets in the six examples are, respectively:

Example 2: 201 points sampled from a six-degree Bézier curve with random noise;

Example 3: 305 points derived from a subdivision curve generated by incenter subdivision scheme  [19];

Example 4: 501 points sampled uniformly from an analytic curve whose polar coordinate equation is

                                 ;

Example 5: 205 points with features measured and smoothed from a cross-section of a mouse;

Example 6: 577 points with features measured and smoothed from a G-shape font.

With LSPIA, the above six point sets are fitted using cubic B-spline curves with 20, 20, 30, 50, 30, 50 control points, respectively. The point sets and fitting curves are plotted in Figs. 3–8
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        , where the point sets and initial cubic B-spline curves are in (a), the cubic B-spline curves after 1, 3, 5, 7 iterative steps are in (b)–(e), and the limit fitting curves are presented in (f). From Figs. 3–8, we can see that, LSPIA constructs a series of curves which approximate the given data points progressively.

Moreover, we list the fitting errors

Special techniques are usually required in fitting a large size of data set, because it usually leads to an ill-conditioned or even singular matrix  [20]. However, LSPIA can fit a large size of data set successfully. For example, by LSPIA, the 100001 points sampled from Archimedes spiral

                              ≤
                              θ

                         can be fitted by a cubic B-spline with 1000 control points (see Fig. 10
                        ). On the contrary, this problem cannot be solved by Matlab using usual least square fitting method because the collocation matrix (saved as sparse matrix) is out of memory.

The knot vector plays an important role in data fitting. In practice, the data points are usually fitted incrementally, i.e., if the fitting error is not satisfied the given tolerance, we should increase the number of control points, as well as that of knots, to improve the fitting precision. In such an incremental data fitting method, if the traditional LSF is employed, the last fitting result is discarded entirely and the fitting procedure should be restarted from scratch. However, using LSPIA, after adding control points and knots, the new fitting procedure can start from the last fitting result, thus saving a great amount of computation.

Specifically, if the fitting error after a round of iterations does not meet the prescribed precision, the incremental data fitting algorithm inserts a knot to an admissible knot interval with maximum fitting error, and restarts a new round of iterations from the fitting result of the last round of iterations. Here, a knot interval is called an admissible knot interval if there is at least two data points whose parameters lie in the knot interval, and the fitting error of a knot interval

                         This incremental LSPIA algorithm stops when the number of control points is equal to a predefined number or the fitting error satisfies the predefined precision.

We test the incremental data fitting aforementioned on Examples 1, 5, 6 presented in Section  4.2, and illustrated them in Figs. 11 and 13
                        
                        
                        . From them, we can see that with this incremental LSPIA algorithm, the fitting curves faithfully resemble the shape implied by the data points. In the curve segment whose curvature varies slowly, the incremental LSPIA method distributes sparse knots automatically, while in the curve segment whose curvature varies quickly, the incremental LSPIA method distributes many knots automatically to capture the details implied by the data points. To view this effect clearly, we zoom in some details of Examples 1, 6 to compare the fitting effect of LSPIA and LSPIA with knot adjusting (see Figs. 14–16
                        
                        
                        ). In each example in Figs. 11 and 13, respectively, we use the same number of control points for two different LSPIA methods.

We also test the incremental data fitting on a data point grid with 121×161 data points and illustrated them in Fig. 17
                        . These figures show that the final surface catches the features accurately. We compare incremental LSPIA with EPIA  [3] and summarize the statistical data in Table 2
                        . From Table 2 we find that to achieve the similar fitting error from the same initial patch, the incremental LSPIA algorithm needs fewer control points and iteration times, thus performing better than EPIA.

In general, shape preserving means that the inflexion of the fitting curve is the same as that implied by the data point sequence. By LSPIA, it is easy to generate a fitting curve with shape preserving property.

First, from the given data point, we select a sequence of initial control points, which correspond to an initial B-spline curve with the desirable shape. In the iterations of LSPIA, we make the inflexions of the new control polygon

                         will reduce the iteration times to achieve the same error. In this subsection, we present some examples to demonstrate this effect.

First we use LSPIA to fit the data in Example 3 whose bound box is about 
                           0
                           ≤
                           x
                           ≤
                           2
                           ,
                           0
                           ≤
                           y
                           ≤
                           4.7
                        . The two end points of the initial control points are set as the two end points of the input points, all other initial control points are set as (100, 1), a point far from the input points. The results are presented in Fig. 21
                        . From these figures we can see that after 20 iterative steps the fitting curve is not well-formed. But after more iterative steps, for example, 70 iterative steps, the distance between the fitting curve and the input points are very small. Compared with the fitting curves presented in Fig. 5, whose initial control points are selected appropriately, we find that more iteration steps are needed if the initial control points are far from the limit curves.

We also use LSPIA to fit the data in Example 4 with the initial control points set as the centroid of the input points, and the data sampled from Archimedes spiral 
                           ρ
                           =
                           θ
                           
                           
                              (
                              0
                              ≤
                              θ
                              ≤
                              40
                              π
                              )
                           
                         with the two end points set as those of the input points and other initial control points are the midpoints of the two end points. The results are presented in Figs. 22 and 23
                        
                        , respectively. From these figures we can see that the fitting curves converge faster than those of Fig. 21, but slower than those of Fig. 6 because the distances between the initial control points and the corresponding limit control points fall in between the two cases.

From these examples we conclude that an appropriate selection of the initial control points is important. However, as a shortcoming of LSPIA, the construction of a desirable initial patch is difficult, and the convergence of LSPIA will be made relatively slow by the undesirable initial patch.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a new progressive and iterative approximation method is developed, whose limit is the least square fitting result of the given data points (this method is abbreviated as LSPIA). Similar as the classical PIA method, LSPIA also constructs a series of fitting curves (surfaces) by adjusting the control points iteratively. In each iteration, the difference vector for each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting curve (surface). Since it is able to not only fit the data set of very large size efficiently and robustly, but also reuse the last fitting result in an incremental data fitting procedure, it will have a wide range of applications in geometric design.
