                  We examine the rotational (in)variance of the continuous-parameter genetic algorithm (CPGA). We show that a standard CPGA, using blend crossover and standard mutation, is rotationally variant.
                  To construct a rotationally invariant CPGA it is possible to modify the crossover operation to be rotationally invariant. This however results in a loss of diversity. Hence we introduce diversity in two ways: firstly using a modified mutation scheme, and secondly by adding a self-scaling random vector with a standard normal distribution, sampled uniformly from the surface of a n-dimensional unit sphere to the offspring vector. This formulation is strictly invariant, albeit in a stochastic sense only.
                  We compare the three formulations in terms of numerical efficiency for a modest set of test problems; the intention not being the contribution of yet another competitive and/or superior CPGA variant, but rather to present formulations that are both diverse and invariant, in the hope that this will stimulate additional future contributions, since rotational invariance in general is a desirable, salient feature for an optimization algorithm.

To set the scene, we depart with a verbatim setting from Wilke et al. [1]: Consider the scale and frame in which an optimization problem is defined. Fig. 1
                      depicts two reference frames

                      and

Let us now consider ‘invariance’ in the context of optimization algorithms. ‘Scale invariance’ implies algorithm performance that is independent of uniform scaling of all variables. ‘Frame invariance’ on the other hand implies algorithm performance that is independent of frame translation and rotation.

Frame indifference (or objectivity), is well known in classical mechanics [2], where physical laws dictate that this principle must hold. However, no corresponding law in optimization theory requires that an optimization algorithm must be frame invariant. It might therefore seem that frame indifference is merely an aesthetic requirement.

However, arguments in favor of frame invariant optimization algorithms do exist. Due to the lack of a physical justification, the arguments are necessarily based on a user’s perspective. If a particular optimization algorithm is frame dependent, it follows that there exists a specific choice of reference frame in which the problem can be solved easier (i.e. requiring less iterations) or better (i.e. achieving a lower cost function value) as compared to some other reference frame. In general, the performance difference in different reference frames cannot be quantified, and depends amongst others on the optimization problem and algorithm specifics. Since a priori knowledge of the optimal reference frame for a particular problem is seldom available, this places an additional burden on the analyst, which now has to consider solving the problem in a number of reference frames. (An exception being the specialized class of separable functions.) If the algorithm’s frame dependency is severe, the analyst requires some external procedure to take the algorithm’s frame dependency into account. A conceptual procedure is to recast the optimization problem to simultaneously solve for the reference frame and solution, but this renders the problem ill-posed.

An alternative phrasing of the above argument is as follows: A frame dependent algorithm implies a bias towards some particular reference frame (or frames). This in turn implies a bias towards some subclass of problems. If a problem is well suited to be solved in a particular reference frame, a frame dependent algorithm that is aligned with this specific reference frame will perform well. This however implies that frame dependent optimization algorithms are specialist algorithms, tuned to perform well on a special subclass of problems. In contrast, frame invariant optimization algorithms are general algorithms, applicable to a larger class of problems.

But, how do we know if a problem is well suited to be solved in a particular reference frame? In general, we do not. Therefore, the choice of a frame dependent algorithm to solve a particular problem makes the tacit assumption that the problem’s reference frame is well matched with the algorithm’s reference frame bias. If the tacit assumption holds, good performance is expected, since the correct assumption implies additional problem information. Again, an example of practical relevance is the class of separable or decomposable optimization problems, where an n-dimensional problem is simply the sum of n 1-dimensional problems. An algorithm that independently searches along the coordinate axes, (which renders such an algorithm frame dependent), exploits this specific function characteristic. It is therefore expected that such an algorithm will be superior to its frame invariant counterpart.

To summarize, frame invariance of optimization algorithms is not a strict requirement. Frame invariance does however provide a useful classification of optimization algorithms. A frame invariant algorithm requires less a priori knowledge (or tacit assumptions) of the optimization problem, as compared to a frame variant algorithm. This implies that a frame invariant algorithm will have either inferior or superior performance as compared to a frame variant algorithm, depending on the validity of the assumed information. In addition, frame invariance is desirable as it increases the predictive power of numerical performance results [3].

Even though frame invariance is not required, some classes of optimization algorithms do satisfy this principle. In classical gradient based optimization [4], the gradient vector (or some conjugate direction to the gradient), indicates some direction of improvement, even if this direction is not optimal. The gradient vector of any scalar function satisfies the transformation rules for changing both scale and reference frame. This (usually) renders classical gradient based optimization algorithms scale and reference frame invariant.

However, in so-called modern (stochastic) optimization procedures, like the CPGA, few algorithms satisfy the requirement of reference frame invariance. In this study we introduce two rotationally invariant CPGAs for which we show competing performance against the standard variant CPGA on a test set in the unrotated and an arbitrarily rotated reference frame.

Our paper is constructed as follows: we present the concept of rotational invariance in Section 2. In Section 3, we give the formal mathematical optimization problem. We then present the continuous-parameter genetic algorithm used in this study in Section 4. We present our first invariant continuous parameter genetic algorithm in Section 5.1 and the second in Section 5.2. In Section 6, we present numerical results for some popular test functions, in both the unrotated and arbitrary rotated reference frames. Finally, we conclude our study in Section 7.

Any optimization algorithm is scale, translation and rotation invariant if and only if the transformation rules given by (2) and (5) are satisfied for all

                     ; the same optimal results are then obtained irrespective of the scale and reference frame used.

For a stochastic optimization procedure, we may choose to satisfy (2) and (5) such that the algorithm’s performance is invariant of scale, translation and rotation in a stochastic sense. We will refer to this as ‘stochastic frame invariance’.

Various CPGA formulations exist; in this section we describe the formulation of the CPGA used herein. We deliberately keep the algorithms simple and do not implement additional heuristics as to not confuse the issue of rotational invariance. Although crossover schemes exist that are rotationally invariant, e.g. linear crossover [7], they generally lack diversity [8]. This is due to the linear combination of two parent vectors, which results in a solution vector that remains in a bounded plane in n-dimensional space. We deliberately choose a rotationally variant CPGA in order to numerically demonstrate the severity in performance loss that an algorithm may experience when there is severe coupling between the design variables.

Since we consider frame invariance of algorithms and not of functions we need to rotate the hypercube together in space with a function according to (12) in order to quantify the frame (in)variance instead of the invariance of the cost function [9].

This implies that the random numbers should be generated in the rotated reference frame in order to recover frame invariance in an exact sense. This is in general not possible as we do not know

In the binary tournament selection, during each iteration k we select two members randomly from the population

                         and select the fittest member of the two for the parent population. We continue until the parent population

                         contains the same number of members as the initial population p.

Selection is by definition scale and frame invariant as vectors are selected without performing any operations on them.

From (21) and (22) it is clear that the mutation step is not rotationally invariant.

Lastly, we incorporate an elitist strategy by replacing the worst offspring vector (highest fitness value) with the string in the previous iteration with the lowest fitness value. This ensures that the best known solution is preserved and available for parent selection.

We will now present two rotationally invariant algorithms. Both these algorithms use a crossover scheme with magnitudinal scaling of

                      and we then wish to introduce diversity into the algorithms. The first algorithm uses a modified mutation scheme to introduce diversity. The second algorithm does away with mutation and introduces diversity by simply adding a random vector to the offspring vector.

In the first algorithm, denoted the CPGA(M), the mutation operator is modified by simply operating on a complete string instead of specific genes of a string only. This ensures that the intrinsic properties of the string vectors are preserved.

We therefore randomly select strings in the children population that are randomly placed in the feasible search space with a probability of

                        . Here

                         would be of much higher values than the traditional mutation scheme, typically 
                           
                              ∈
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              0.15
                              ]
                           
                        . This is due to the fact that each mutation that occurs has a much smaller effect on the population as a whole for the new variant.

This step, as with the initialization step, is only rotationally invariant if we generate the vector in a rotated frame. This is in general not possible. We will however see in Section 6 that the variance due to this step is negligible and we consider this algorithm stochastically rotationally invariant.

Next we propose a directionally diverse rotationally invariant algorithm denoted the CPGA(S). After the offspring vector

                        , a new term is added to the offspring vector to introduce diversity. The new term is simply a scaled, normalized random vector with a standard normal distribution. This results in a point sampled uniformly on the surface of a n dimensional unit sphere [11].

                         a normalized random vector with a standard normal distribution. By comparing (24) and (25), it is clear that the formulation is only strictly rotationally invariant if

                        . This is in general not true for uniquely generated random vectors, but does hold in an averaged stochastic sense, since both vectors are normalized random vectors with a standard normal distribution. This implies that the probability density function is merely rotated between the two reference frames and remains unchanged. Hence our introduction of the terminology that the stochastic vectors are rotationally invariant in a strictly stochastic sense.

We now perform an empirical study to quantify the (lack of) rotation invariance of the standard CPGA we have presented in Section 4, henceforth referenced to as SCPGA, and the two proposed rotationally invariant CPGA implementations, namely CPGA(M) and CPGA(S). Again we use the approach used by Wilke et al. [1]. Real variables are implemented using double-precision floating-point arithmetic. We choose a population size of 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           30
                        
                      and conduct the study for various parameter settings of each algorithm. Each run consists of 300,000 function evaluations (10,000 iterations). All results presented are averaged over 100 runs.

For all formulations we vary 
                        
                           α

                      between 0 and 0.01 in increments of 0.001. For CPGA(M) we vary the mutation rate

                      between 0 and 0.15 in increments of 0.005. For the CPGA(S) we vary the sphere scaling factor

Some of the functions in our test set are decomposable [9], viz. the design variables are uncoupled. This implies that once an optimal value for a given design variable is obtained, it remains optimal, independent of the other design variables. This is similar to optimizing n 1-dimensional optimization problems, instead of 1 n-dimensional coupled optimization problem. We therefore study the test set in the unrotated or decomposable reference frame

                      is a random, proper orthogonal transformation matrix, constructed as in [9]. The transformation matrix results in a pure rotation of each test function. For each of the 100 independent runs, a new random rotation matrix

                     Table 1 reveals that CPGA(M) and CPGA(S) consistently outperform SCPGA in the rotated frame. Developing a multi species parallel CPGA with CPGA(M) and CPGA(S) seems a profitable endeavor for future study.

The performance of the SCPGA should be considered the benchmark for this work. The rotational variance of the SCPGA is evident from Figs. 2(a), 4(a), 6(a), 8(a), 10(a) and 12(a). Here

                      is varied between each bar. It can seen that the SCPGA is sensitive to its parameters.

From Figs. 2(b), 4(b), 6(b), 8(b), 10(b) and 12(b) we note that although the CPGA(M) is not analytically rotationally invariant, it is rotationally invariant in a stochastic sense. This is because the algorithm does not search independently along the coordinate axes. This formulation is relatively insensitive to parameters, if one chooses the parameters within reasonable bounds.

The rotational invariance of the CPGA(S) is evident from Figs. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. Here, to avoid a distorted view due to single outliers, the Quadric test function

                      the formulation can give relatively competitive results.

Although numerous possibilities exist to formulate stochastically invariant algorithms, the choice of a stochastically invariant diversity mechanism plays a critical role in the performance of an invariant algorithm, as is evident from CPGA(M) and CPGA(S).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study we have shown, both analytically and numerically, the frame variance of the standard CPGA, which results in severe performance loss for rotated functions.

When constructing invariant CPGAs, it is essential to retain diversity in the algorithm. When using a modified mutation scheme, we need a much higher mutation rate to achieve this. Alternatively we add diversity to the formulation by constructing a scalable n-dimensional sphere around the offspring vector.

The aim of this study is not to be competitive with well understood and researched algorithms, but to rather show that frame invariant algorithms can fairly easily be constructed, in the hope that this will stimulate additional future contributions, since rotational invariance in general is a desirable, salient feature for an optimization algorithm.
