                  We study the operational problem of a make-to-order contract manufacturer seeking to integrate production scheduling and transportation planning for improved performance under commit-to-delivery model. The manufacturer produces customer orders on a set of unrelated parallel lines/processors, accounting for release dates and sequence dependent setup times. A set of shipping options with different costs and transit times is available for order delivery through the third party logistics service providers. The objective is to manufacture and deliver multiple customer orders by selecting from the available shipping options, before preset due dates to minimize total cost of fulfilling orders, including tardiness penalties. We model the problem as a mixed integer programming model and provide a novel decomposition scheme to solve the problem. An exact dynamic programming model and a heuristics approach are presented to solve the subproblems. The performance of the solution algorithm is tested through a set of experimental studies and results are presented. The algorithm is shown to efficiently solve the test cases, even the complex instances, to near optimality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Consumers are increasingly seeking newer products with more features. To remain on the leading edge of the ever more demanding marketplace, companies are under constant pressure to shorten their product lifecycles and introduce new products with competitive prices at a faster pace. This market pressure inevitably propagates upstream in the supply chains to higher tier suppliers.

Production and logistics operations are critical to the success of supply chains in most manufacturing industries. Manufacturers’ survival in today's competitive market relies heavily on the coordination of the manufacturing and distribution operations, in addition to how well each are executed. Better asset utilization enables the manufacturers to reduce their marginal costs and hence become more competitive; on the other hand, using faster yet economical transportation options decreases lead times while keeping logistics expenditures low. In this research, we integrate the production scheduling and logistics planning of a manufacturer with the objective of maintaining a customer service level at a minimum cost, and provide a novel solution approach.

Our research stems from the integrated production scheduling and logistics planning problem of contract manufacturers (CMs). A CM is a specialized outside supplier that provides manufacturing services under contract for a limited set of products. Supplying similar products to a set of different customers allows CMs to benefit from the economies of scale and enables them to invest in automation and specialization, thus, reducing the marginal cost of production. It is argued that this business model allows companies to focus on their core competencies (e.g. product development and design) while outsourcing part of their manufacturing to CMs to reduce cost and possibly attaining better quality. CMs play a key role in industries such as computer electronics, aerospace, defense, energy, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and automobile manufacturing (Han, Porterfield, & Li 2012). CMs, essentially, compete on lower production cost and shorter lead-times that reemphasize the significance of integrated production and logistics planning.

We consider the integrated make-to-order production scheduling and logistics planning problem of a CM serving a given set of customer orders. The CM has multiple parallel processors (i.e., production lines which can be located in the same plant or different plants) and can produce each order on any one of the processors. Orders require different processing times on different processors. The processing of an order cannot be split between multiple processors and cannot start before receiving all the needed raw material. Moreover, switching from the completion of an order to the start of the next one on the same processor requires setup and retooling. The cost and duration of this transition are dependent on the order sequence. All orders must be processed and delivered to the customer on or before a predefined due date to avoid service level penalties. While there is no earliness penalty, delivery tardiness is penalized in stages; e.g., a fixed penalty for the first week delay and additional daily penalties thereafter.

CMs often utilize third parties for their logistics and distribution needs. In fact, almost 80 percent of firms rely on third party service providers for their transportation and other logistics operations (Langley, 2014). By outsourcing transportation, CMs are constrained with the carriers’ shipment schedules. On the other hand, carriers commonly offer multiple shipping options with varying costs and lead-times for CMs to choose from. The integration of production and transportation planning allows the CM to trade-off between these shipping options to reduce the overall cost of fulfilling orders. For instance, early completion of an order can be capitalized on by choosing a cheaper but slower surface transportation, while tardiness penalty can be avoided in case of late completion of an order by utilizing more expensive but faster air transportation. The CM business model considered in this research is known as commit-to-deliver, where the manufacturer takes the responsibility of delivering goods. This arrangement contrasts with the commit-to-ship model where the manufacturer is only responsible to complete and ship the goods by a given due date (Stecke & Zhao, 2007). In the commit-to-ship model, the customer chooses and pays for the transportation option, hence controls the delivery time. The commit-to-deliver model with integrated production and logistics planning is shown to benefit both the manufacturers and the customers by increasing the manufacturer's profit, reducing lead-time variability, and improving customer service level (Stecke & Zhao, 2007).

Under commit-to-deliver model, the availability of multiple carriers allows the manufacturer to compare shipping fees and lead-times. Longer shipping times lead to later deliveries, which in turn may result in tardiness penalties. The availability of shipping options is time dependent since many carriers have predetermined cut-off times that shippers have to abide by. Multiplicity of shipping options with different cut-off times, delivery lead-times and total costs (e.g., shipping fees and late delivery penalties) results in a time-dependent logistics cost function for each order. Characterization of the time-dependent logistics cost function is achieved by selecting the dominant shipping option(s) among all feasible options for any given manufacturing completion time of an order. Fig. 1 illustrates the relationship between shipping options and a time-dependent logistic cost function for an illustrative single-leg transportation network.

In this example, the manufacturer can directly ship an order to a customer via air or water mode. Water transportation is cheaper but slower; in contrast, air transportation is fast but far more expensive. Delivery time of each transportation option can be determined based on the scheduled departure time of the ship or flight and their respective lead-times. Thus, the total cost of each option can be calculated based on the shipping cost and the service-level cost as determined by delivery time and order due date. Accordingly, for a given mode of shipping, even with identical transportation fees, any difference in the carriers scheduled departure times may result in different delivery times and total costs. For this illustrative example, let us assume that the CM is considering only one option from each mode to deliver a customer order. Based on the delivery time (thus the penalties) and shipping fees, the total logistics cost of each option is calculated. Water mode option has a lower total cost, but is available for a limited time, after which the more expensive air mode option remains as the only available option. Consequently, if the manufacturer can complete the order before the ship departure time, the cheaper water option would be the best choice. Otherwise, air transportation with the higher cost must be used. Hence, the logistic cost function takes the form of a time-dependent step function with jump points at options’ scheduled departure times.

In practice, however, customer orders are delivered through a complex scheduled transportation network that often involves multi-modal transportation with transshipment nodes. Indeed, the attributes of cargo such as its quantity, product type, weight, volume, handling restrictions, and security concerns affect the routing and mode selection decisions in its transportation planning. For instance, if a mode is not capable of transporting a given cargo (e.g., dangerous goods on a mixed passenger-cargo flight), it would not be reasonable to further consider this mode as an option and thus should be ignored. Similarly large-sized products would cost more to transport and will be subject to various dimension and capacity restrictions. This interplay between the transportation options and cargo characteristics (quantity, weight, product type, etc.) are captured through the time-dependent logistics cost function which is an input to our problem. Therefore, selecting the best routing option and estimating the delivery time and shipping cost require a careful evaluation of the routing options. Azadian, Murat, and Chinnam (2012) study the routing of a single cargo shipment in a transportation network with transshipment points under both deterministic and stochastic settings by considering customer service level, capacity availability, and delays. They study the application of this problem in air-cargo shipping. In their problem, the shipper has multiple carrier options at the origin airport as well as at the mid-way transition airports. The objective is to route the cargo through a set of interconnecting flights from origin to destination to minimize cost, including the delivery tardiness penalties. They developed a recursive dynamic programming solution algorithm that calculates the expected cost of different routing policies and identifies the best policy based on the cargo loading times at the origin and intermediate airports. Their logistic cost function, which accounts for both transportation costs and delivery delay penalties, is shown to be non-decreasing time-dependent function that can be modeled as a regular step function in the deterministic setting. Similar to the problem of routing of a single air cargo in Azadian et al. (2012), where the logistics cost depends on the cargo availability time at origin airport, the total logistics costs in our problem are time-dependent cost functions of the order completion times. The cargo availability time is an input of Azadian et al. (2012), however, the order completion times are decisions of the production scheduling problem in our study.

While the integration of production and logistics decisions has been extensively studied before, the extant research fails to accommodate for the practical requirements of production scheduling such as precedence constraints of orders and sequence-dependent setup costs. The core contribution of this research is to address the gap in the existing literature by explicitly considering the detailed production scheduling decisions and integrating them with time-dependent logistics options. The outcome of this study can assist suppliers, particularly CMs, in improving or maintaining the customer service levels while lowering total cost of production and logistics to gain competitive advantage. Moreover, we contribute to the scheduling literature by providing a new efficient solution methodology for a general class of parallel processor scheduling problems with completion time-dependent cost functions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: first, we review the related literature. In Section 3, we provide the formal definition of the problem and its mathematical formulation. Section 4 develops and discusses the proposed solution methodology. Lastly, we report on the performance of our solution algorithm in Section 5 and offer concluding remarks and directions for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The problem of integration and coordination of production and distribution arises in many industrial settings and has been studied extensively. However, studies that address the scheduling side of the problem at a detailed level are limited and recent. Majority of recent studies on integrated production and distribution planning are limited to single processors and do not capture such practical complexities as sequence-dependent setup times. Chen (2004, 2010) provides a rigorous survey and taxonomy of integrated production and distribution problems. According to the categorization by Chen (2010), our problem falls under models with fixed delivery departure date, where the departure times of the delivery vehicles are not part of the decision variables. This setting is often applied to the cases where a third party performs the delivery upon a delivery request by the manufacturer. This study, in fact, addresses two gaps identified by Chen (2010); (1) expanding the existing literature to deal with third party shipping with fixed schedules and (2) accounting for the heterogeneity of shipping options by considering different lead-times and costs.


                     Li, Ganesan, and Sivakumar (2005) studied an assemble-to-order computer manufacturing company that ships orders to customer by air. The assembly line is modeled as a single machine with constant production rate. Multiple capacitated flights are available for transportation and split delivery is allowed. Deviations from the delivery due date are penalized; however, penalties are calculated proportional to the quantity of the delayed portion of the orders. They provided a decomposition-based heuristic solution method. Li, Sivakumar, and Ganesan (2008a) expanded the study by considering parallel machines for the manufacturer and tested various heuristic methods to solve the problem. Li, Sivakumar, and Ganesan (2008b) studied the same problem when split delivery is prohibited. They showed that the problem is NP-hard and compare heuristics for solving the problem.


                     Stecke and Zhao (2007) also considered a make-to-order computer manufacturer under commit-to-deliver model. They studied two cases where partial delivery is forbidden and allowed. In their research, the cost function is modeled as a convex decreasing function of the transit time, and the manufacturer is modeled as single processor with fixed production rate and no capacity shortage. They showed that under partial delivery, the problem can be solved polynomially; however, when partial delivery is not allowed, the problem becomes strongly NP-hard and is solved through a heuristic solution method.


                     Kanyalkar and Adil (2005) studied the aggregated production and distribution planning problem for a parallel multi-site production system. Kanyalkar and Adil (2007) expanded their previous work to consider procurement in planning. They provided a mixed integer linear goal programming model that addresses the drawbacks of the traditional sequential decision making approach. They considered the limitations of storage space, raw material availability, production capacity at plants, and minimum safety stock levels in their model. Kanyalkar and Adil (2010) applied the aggregate multi-site procurement-production-distribution system problem to a real-world example.


                     You, Lee, Hsieh, and Chen (2011) studied a single machine scheduling problem where goods are delivered by either regular commercial flights or chartered flights. A heuristic approach was proposed and tested for small-scale problems. Ma, Chan, and Chung (2013) studied the problem of integrated production and distribution in a (single machine) manufacturing company with emphasis on sea transportation. They accounted for storage cost and minimize the overall distribution cost by a two-level genetic algorithm. Meisel, Kirschstein, and Bierwirth (2013) used branch-and-cut method and heuristic to solve a combined production and intermodal transportation problem. They demonstrated the advantage of integrated decision making for a chemical company. Condotta, Knust, Meier, and Shakhlevich (2013) extended the combined production and transportation planning problem by considering job sequencing in the production planning phase with a single processor. They considered ready times and job dependent processing time and provided a mixed integer programming model and a tabu search based heuristic solution method.

Our problem is also related to the scheduling literature. According to the standard three-field notation of Graham, Lawler, Lenstra, and Rinnooy Kan (1977) for scheduling problems, our problem can be presented as R|rj, sij
                     |∑f(cj
                     ), where ∑f(cj
                     ) is a non-decreasing step function. This problem generalizes R|rj, sij
                     |∑wiUi
                      in which the step function for each job has only one jump point at its due date, from zero to tardiness penalty. While special cases of this problem have been studied extensively, the research on the general form, i.e., ∑f(cj
                     ), is limited.

One of the best exact methods for minimizing weighted number of tardy jobs with release date is by M'Hallah and Bulfin (2007) for single machine problem. Armentano and Filho (2007) proposed a greedy random search adaptive procedure for minimizing total tardiness on uniform parallel machines problem with sequence-dependent setup times. Lin, Fowler, and Pfund (2013) studied the problem of unrelated parallel machine scheduling with multi objectives based on makespan, total weighted tardiness and total weighted completion times. They proposed bi-criteria heuristic and genetic algorithm for solving the problem. Ullrich (2013) integrated the production and distribution scheduling problem in order to minimize the total tardiness. They studied the problem on parallel machines with machine-dependent ready times and capacitated delivery vehicles with availability constraints and proposed a genetic algorithm based solution approach.

The closest work to our problem is by Detienne, Dauzère-Pérès, and Yugma (2011) which studied R|rj
                     |∑f(cj
                     ) and provided a mixed integer programming model that utilizes a special dominant solution set property based on Jackson (1955). Detienne et al. (2011) presented a constraint generation procedure for solving the problem with or without release dates. Detienne (2014) extends his previous work to consider resumable, non-resumable, and semi-resumable jobs. They provide a mixed integer linear programming model and present a knapsack cover cut to enhance their solution method that is based on special dominance properties. The performance of their approach is tested on a single machine problem to minimize the weighted number of tardy jobs given the job release times. Due to the special dominance property that makes the foundation of their approach, their method cannot be readily extended to account for sequence-dependent setup times and is limited in handling other technical constraints, e.g. precedence constraints, if needed.

In this research, we generalize the integrated production and logistics planning problem to include multiple independent parallel production lines and consider sequence-dependent setup times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider detailed production scheduling with multiple processors while integrating production and distribution decisions. Moreover, we contribute to the scheduling literature by generalizing the problem of unrelated parallel machine scheduling with release times and sequence dependent setup times with a regular non-decreasing step function objective.

Our problem consists of scheduling a set J of jobs (i.e., orders) on a set of M parallel processors which can be located at different production facilities. Each job j ∈ J has a processor dependent job release time 
                        
                           r
                           j
                           μ
                        
                     . The processor dependent release times provide the required flexibility for our model to consider practical scenarios. For instance, this approach allows for the consideration of differences between the resource availabilities for job processing at various locations. Moreover, the implementation of a rolling time horizon is facilitated by considering the earliest starting time of a job on a processor (which may be bounded by the completion time of the previous commitment of the processor) and the needed time to prepare the processor for processing the new job. We assume that there is no setup requirement for the first job on an idle processor. However, if job j is not the first job, a setup time of sij
                      is required to prepare the processor for accepting job j immediately after completing job i ∈ J and i ≠ j. The processing time of job j on processor μ is denoted as 
                        
                           p
                           j
                           μ
                        
                      for each processor μ ∈ M. The completion time of job j on processor μ, denoted by

In this model, the objective function (1) minimizes the total cost of completing a given set J of jobs. Constraints (2) ensure that all jobs are scheduled. Constraints (3) ensure that the number of predecessors and successors correctly corresponds to the number of jobs assigned to a machine. Constraints (4) and (5) guarantee that all scheduled jobs on a machine have at most one predecessor and one successor. Constraints (6) and (7) define the completion times of jobs based on their release time and the necessary setup times if they are processed after other jobs. Constraints (8) and (9) ensure that the correct cost rate is used given that the completion time of job j on machine μ occurs at

In model (P), constrains (2) are the coupling constraints connecting processors together. Lagrangian relaxation is commonly used to relax the coupling constraints (see Fisher, 2004) The Lagrangian relaxation of (P) with respect to (2) results in the following Lagrangian dual function φ(λ).

This solution method reduces the complexity of the problem as the subproblems are generally easier than the original problem and can be solved separately. This approach, however, is not promising and hardly results in a feasible solution. In particular, some jobs will not be processed while some will be scheduled on multiple machines and, hence, recovering feasibility becomes a challenge. Nevertheless, optimal objective function value of the LD,

                     , is still a valid lower bound for the original problem; although, in some cases the quality of the bound may not be notably better than a simple linear relaxation bound. In the following section, we present a novel solution approach for the formulation (P) which overcomes the issues of feasibility and bound quality.

To solve the master problem, we adopt the Successive Subproblem Solving (SSS) approach. This approach was introduced by Zhai, Guan, and Cui (2002) for the unit commitment problem in the scheduling of electrical power generators. In the SSS method, we augment the Lagrangian dual function by introducing an absolute penalty term that connects the subproblems together. The connection between subproblems alleviates the issues associated with Lagrangian relaxation approach; i.e., multiple assignment of a job to different processors. Let  ω > 0 be the penalty parameter; consequently, we can express the new Lagrangian dual function as follows:

The added penalty term prevents the assignment of a job to multiple processors and further penalizes the unassigned jobs. Thus, this method improves the quality of the lower bound and increases the likelihood of achieving a primal feasible solution. However, as can be seen from (15), problem (PS) is no longer decomposable by processors due to the added penalty term. Hence, the calculation of the subgradient of φ(ω, λ) with respect to λ requires solving the integrated lower-level problem, which is computationally inefficient. We address this issue next.

Presentation of (15) as (19) holds true for any  μ ∈ M. The additive structure of (19) allows the problem (PS) to be solved in parts; i.e., for each processor as a subproblem. The variable  qμ
                        (j) is fixed for the μth subproblem and links the subproblem  μ to other subproblems by conveying information about job j’s assignment on other processors. qμ
                        (j)  is 1 if j is not assigned to any other processor than μ, 0 if j is assigned to one other processor than μ, and less than zero if j is assigned to two or more processors other than μ. We solve the problem for each given processor  μ one at a time and update qμ
                        (j) before attempting the next processor. The μth subproblem can be defined as follows:

The standard subgradient approach for solving (PS) requires the solution of all subproblems to obtain the subgradient direction. The new representation of Lagrangian dual function, however, makes it possible to implement the surrogate subgradient algorithm (SSG) for solving (PS). In the SSG method, introduced by Zhao, Luh, and Wang (1999), the solution to only one of the subproblems is sufficient to obtain a proper direction. Accordingly, we solve the subproblems one after another. The detailed implementation of this approach is presented next. The proof of boundary and convergence of the algorithm are provided in Appendix A.

We first introduce the notation used in the SSS method and then present its algorithmic steps.

                           . This inequality is important for convergence analysis as explained in Appendix A. The subproblems in Step 1 are sequentially solved until the improvement condition in (22) is attained for at least one of the processors μ. In each subproblem solution, the previous iteration's solutions are used to calculate qμ
                           (j) ∀j ∈ J. Whenever a subproblem solution does not satisfy (22), the previous iteration's solution is maintained. The multipliers are updated using the surrogate gradient in Step 2.1. The SSS method terminates when at least one of the two stopping criteria is satisfied, i.e., multipliers converge according to the convergence criteria based on ɛ
                              λ
                            or solution converge to the optimum solution based on ɛGAP threshold. Using the multipliers’ rate of change as the algorithm's stopping criteria in Step 3.1 is motivated by its relationship with the rate of convergence to the optimal objective value; i.e., when the change in the multiplers is small, the rate of convergence to the optimum solution decreases (see Theorem A.2. in Appendix A). In fact, this slow rate of convergence of the subgradient method is often regarded as one of its shortcomings and the choice of ɛGAP is critical as it establishes a balance between the time to terminate with a solution and the solution quality. While other heuristic stopping conditions such as those based on number of iterations or CPU time can also be utilized as the stopping criteria, the quality of the solutions obtained with these conditions cannot be guaranteed with a bound. We provide the framework of the algorithm's proof of convergence in Appendix A. Comprehensive discussion on the convergence, uniquness of optimum multipliers, and other charachteristics of the surrogate subgradient algorithm are provided by Chang (2008) and Bragin, Luh, Yan, Yu, and Stern (2015).

The SSS method requires

                           . This value, however, is generally unknown in advance and needs to be estimated. A poor underestimation may result in convergence to a primal infeasible solution with a large duality gap. In the standard Lagrangian method, often an overestimation of the primal optimal solution is used and the solution converged in this approach is either primal infeasible or optimal (Held, Wolfe, & Crowder, 1974). In constrast, by using an overestimation of

                                    )
                                 
                              
                            the SSS method may converge to a primal feasible but not optimal solution. Hence, SSS differs from the standard Lagrangian method, as it may converge to a suboptimal primal feasible solution without using a feasibility recovery heuristic. The reason for this is that the SSS minimizes the augmented Lagrangian relaxation in (17) by independently solving each of the decomposed subproblems in Step 1. Therefore, the bound estimate of

                                    )
                                 
                              
                            in SSS is critical, since it affects both the convergence rate and the quality of the solutions converged. To improve the convergence rate and optimality gap, we developed a dynamic bound estimation procedure, called variable target value method with backtracking, as described in the next section.

The SSS procedure uses an estimate of
                              
                                 
                                    Φ
                                    
                                       PS
                                    
                                    *

                                    ω
                                    )
                                 
                              
                            for the surrogate subgradient optimization. Rather than using a static estimate, we dynamically change this estimate in order to obtain a good quality primal feasible solution. Specifically, we modify the variable target value method (VTVM) presented in Lim and Sherali (2006) and incorporate backtracking to improve the target value estimation. Since the SSS method can converge to a primary feasible but suboptimal solution, we integrate a backtracking phase within the VTVM to improve the quality of the feasible solution converged.

We modify the SSS method by replacing

                            holds true for each iteration i. In choosing the estimate

                           , the goal is to approximate primal optimal solution as close as possible. In the standard VTVM method, the target value 
                              
                                 Φ

                            is increased as long as the convergence rate is satisfactory and then decreased to close in on the optimal solution. With the basic VTVM method, it is possible that the solution converged might be far from the optimal solution. In our adaptation, we increase the target value 
                              
                                 Φ

                                 i
                              
                            with a controlled rate until we find a primal feasible solution. Finding a primal feasible solution, as explained before, indicates that the target value is an overestimation of

                           . This primal feasible solution, however, may be a low quality suboptimal solution. Therefore, with a backtracking phase, we revise the latest target value to obtain a better primal feasible solution. Specifically, after encountering with a primal feasible solution, we return back to a past iteration where the target value underestimates a known lower bound; i.e., Lagrangean lower bound. Then, the modified SSS repeats the iteration with a smaller step size in an effort to find an improved primal feasible solution. Indeed, the best primal feasible solution serves as an upper bound on the objective value.

We first provide the notation used in VTVM with backtracking and then present the modified steps of the SSS procedure. For the two parameters of VTVM, i.e., η and σ, we use the recommended settings in Lim and Sherali (2006). Next, we briefly discuss the convergence behavior of the SSS with backtracking. Note that we replace

                            might not have decreased sufficiently. In contrast, lower σ values reduce the convergence rate. The required ranges for acceptance interval parameter and fraction of cumulative improvement are σ ∈ (0, 1/3] and ηj
                            ∈ (0, 1] (Lim and Sherali, 2006). The algorithm terminates and returns the best primal feasible solution when the gap between the best feasible solution and the Lagrangian dual function value falls below the optimality gap threshold (ɛGAP).

In the previous section, we discussed an approach for solving the master problem. The proposed approach still relies on solving a series of subproblems for each processor. Indeed, the efficiency of solving the subproblems plays a significant role in the success of solving the overall problem. In this section, we review the subproblem structure, propose a transformation scheme, and present a solution strategy for the transformed subproblems.

The subproblem for the μth processor is defined as (PS
                           μ
                        ). Essentially, in each subproblem, we select a set of jobs and schedule them to be processed on a processor. Jobs can be processed one at a time and only after their release time. Consequently, the total cost is calculated based on the completion times of the scheduled jobs. Not scheduling a job is penalized, where the penalty could be positive or negative (i.e., based on whether the job is already scheduled on other processors or not). Next, we discuss a scheme to depict this scheduling subproblem as graph. For notation simplicity, we eliminate  μ index from notations in this section; i.e., the processing time of job j is denoted as pj
                         instead of 
                           
                              p

Without loss of generality, let us define two dummy jobs as j
                        0 and je
                        , corresponding to the initial and the final idle processor states, respectively. All feasible schedules must start with job j
                        0 and end with job  je
                        . Both jobs have release dates, processing times, and Lagrangian multipliers equal to zero. Moreover, we set

                        . No setup is required to start processing a job immediately after j
                        0. Similarly, job je
                         does not require any setup.

Let us define a complete directed graph

                        } and each arc identify the sequencing of job j immediately after job  i. The length of arc (i, j) ∈ A depends on the processing time of job j after job  i, the required setup time, sij
                        , as well as on the release date of job j and can be calculated as

As presented, the cost function consists of two elements: a time-dependent cost term and a fixed cost term. Since time-dependent cost is a non-decreasing function, earlier visit of a vertex results in a lower cost. The objective is to find a path starting from j
                        0 and ending at je
                         with the minimum cost.

The state space can be reduced by implementing the following dominance rule.


                           Dominance rule. Let (S, j, t) and (S, j, t') be two states such that f(S, j, t) ≥ f(S, j, t') and t > t'; then (S, j, t) is dominated by (S, j, t').

While the formulation (DP) can be solved through complete recursion or heuristic path finding methods, these approaches generally become inefficient as the dimensionality of the problem grows. Thus, in the next section we present a more efficient heuristic solution strategy for solving the subproblems.

As stated earlier, efficient solution of the subproblems is critical for an effective implementation of the SSS approach. A careful examination of the subproblem structure reveals their similarity to the classic Traveling Repairman Problem with Profits (TRPP). In the TRPP, given a set of locations, a single server chooses and visits a subset of locations. Visiting each location results in a fixed profit; this profit, however, is discounted based on the arrival time at the location (Campbell, Vandenbussche, & Hermann, 2008). Our subproblems are essentially similar to the TRPP where a processor selects and processes a subset of jobs. The transformation of the subproblems to the TRPP equivalents is achieved through the graph representation discussed in the previous section. Profit and discount rate are derived from g(S, i, cj
                           ); the fixed part of g(S, i, cj

                           , represents the profit of visiting a location in the TRPP setting. Moreover, the time-dependent discount rate corresponds to f(j, cj
                           ), where cj
                            corresponds to the arrival time at location j in the TRPP.

The TRPP is the generalization of the traveling repairman problem (see Afrati, Cosmadakis, Papadimitriou, Papageorgiou, & Papakostantinou, 1986) and shown to be NP-hard (Coene & Spieksma, 2008). Studies on the TRPP solution algorithm are limited for the general form. As far as we know, the most recent computational study on the problem is conducted by Dewilde, Cattrysse, Coene, Spieksma, and Vansteenwegen (2013) that propose a heuristic solution method for the TRPP based on Tabu search.

We adopt their approach and use their algorithm to solve the subproblems. This choice is justified by two reasons. First, their heuristic approach is shown to be computationally very efficient while providing a reasonable optimality gap. Moreover, as discussed by Sun, Zhao, and Luh (2007) and Zhao et al. (1999), only an approximate solution to a subproblem is sufficient to obtain a proper surrogate subgradient direction.

It should be noted that, unlike Dewilde et al. (2013), the time based discount rate in our problem setting is nonlinear (i.e., non-decreasing step function); their algorithm, however, is still applicable. The heuristic algorithm starts with construction phase that generates a non-trivial solution. Next, the initial solution is improved through the tabu search metaheuristic. At each iteration of the tabu search, a fixed set of moves are made and one of the moves is selected according to the principles of variable neighborhood descent heuristic (VND). The sequence of the moves is presented in the Fig. 2
                           . Neighborhoods generated by each of the moves are explored one at a time and whenever an improvement is achieved, the best solution from the corresponding neighborhood is selected as the next solution to be improved. Each neighborhood is explored only if the previous ones in the search sequence do not produce any improvement.

We refer readers to Dewilde et al. (2013) for the details of the solution algorithm and its implementation. Herein, however, we briefly discuss the constructive phase of the algorithm to establish a notational correspondence. The construction method is based on insertion; an insertion measure is used to select the next node for insertion. Let

In this equation, parameter  m determines the relative impacts of  πj
                            and  dij
                            on the ratio. Node(s) with the largest insertion ratio are selected for insertion. By executing this heuristic algorithm, we obtain a feasible solution to a subproblem for a given processor  μ, which is a schedule of jobs chosen to be processed. The results are then conveyed back to the SSS algorithm.

In this section, we report on the experimental results conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach. Tests are performed on a laptop equipped with 4 gigabyte RAM and a 2.60 gigahertz Intel processor, using the CPLEX 12.5 as linear integer solver with the default settings. The SSS algorithm is coded in MATLAB and experiments were carried out using MATLAB.

Since this problem has never been studied before, there are no test datasets available in the current literature. Therefore, we have setup our computational experiments using the closest existing instance generation scheme proposed by Detienne et al. (2011) and adjusted it to suit our problem. For each job j ∈ J, we draw  M processing times from a uniform distribution in the range

Each instance is solved by both the CPLEX and the SSS approach. We set 1000 seconds time limit on CPLEX and, as a benchmark, we also recorded the linear relaxation solution as the lower bound for each instance. The results of the experiments are summarized in Table 2.

In Table 2, we
                         report on the comparison statistics of the solution performance of CPLEX and SSS. In reporting the performance of the SSS with VTVM algorithm, we present the first primal feasible solution before backtracking phase and final solution after backtracking phase discussed in Section 4.1.2. We note the former solution as SSS-VTVM and the latter as SSS-B-VTVM. Thus, Table 2 presents solutions from three methods: CPLEX, SSS-VTVM, and SSS-B-VTVM.

Solutions from each of the three methods are compared with the best lower bound solution available and summarized in three columns, e.g., CPLEX, the first primal feasible solution of the SSS (SSS-VTVM), and the final solution of the SSS after the improvement phase (SSS-B-VTVM). Under CPLEX column, we report the percentage of cases that CPLEX produced an optimal solution within the time limit, percentage of cases that CPLEX find a primal feasible solution within the time limit, average and maximum gap percentage between CPLEX and the lower bound (LB). For the SSS-VTVM and SSS-B-VTVM approaches, we present the percentage of cases that the optimal solution was achieved followed by an average and a maximum gap percentage between the solution and the lower bound. Solution times of each approach are also presented in Table 2. The notation for the headings of Table 2 is provided in Table 1.

Note that, in calculating the average and maximum gap for CPLEX, we ignored all the instances that CPLEX failed to produce a primal feasible solution within the time limit, due to the lack of any tangible measure for calculation. For instance, in the case of 80 jobs, 20 processors and 10 steps for cost function, CPLEX produced primal feasible solution in only about 15 percent of cases; consequently, the average gap is only calculated for those 15 percent of the instances, ignoring 85 percent of the instances that CPLEX failed to produce a feasible solution. Similarly, these instances are ignored for calculating the average time for CPLEX. Hence, the actual objective gap and CPU time results of CPLEX would be worse than those reported in the CPLEX columns with Fsbl < 100.

Results in Table 2 show that, as the number of jobs increases, particularly with fewer processors, the problem gets more complicated and CPLEX success rate in solving the instances to optimality, in a timely manner, reduces significantly. More importantly, CPLEX often fails to find a primal feasible solution in many of the complex instances. It seems, for cases with 60 or 80 jobs and with 5 or 10 processors, using CPLEX is not practical.

As can be seen from the results, the SSS-VTVM produces high quality solutions in a notably short time. The average gap of the first primal feasible solution is always less than 1.2 percent against the lower bound. The maximum gap percentage is similarly small and less than 5 percent against the lower bound. The average first solution time among all cases is about 1.03 seconds and at most 5.17 seconds in a case of 80 jobs, 5 processors and 10 steps; it is also worth to notice that CPLEX failed to solve any of the instances for this given case to optimality within the time limit.

While the performance of the SSS-VTVM seems to be reasonable, the improvement phase (backtracking) further enhances the quality of the solutions. For the SSS-B-VTVM, the maximum average gap against the lower bound reduces to below 0.43 percent; moreover, in the worst case scenario, the maximum gap against the lower bound is about 3.72 percent. It should be noted that in many cases the SSS-B-VTVM solves all the instances to optimality; in other words, in the worst case scenario, SSS-B-VTVM still manage to solve over 55 percent of the instances to optimality. This improvement is achieved with a slight increase in the average solution time of SSS-B-VTVM to about 3.12 seconds.

Clearly, the result of the experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the SSS algorithm in producing near optimum solutions in a relatively short time. Even the first solution of the SSS (i.e., SSS-VTVM) is sufficiently acceptable for practical purposes.

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSS algorithm, we solve few random instances with 300 jobs and 10 and 20 processors with 10 steps for cost function. The dimension of these cases is beyond the CPLEX capability to solve them to optimality in a reasonable time; thus, we only use linear relaxation lower bound for comparison. Table 3 presents the results of six randomly generated instances.

As can be observed in Table 3, even solving the linear relaxation problem is challenging. Similar to previous results, the SSS-VTVM seems to provide high quality solutions, with a gap of less than 0.5, in less than 19 seconds. These results suggest that the SSS approach can be reliably used to solve large size problems in reasonably short time as demanded in many practical applications.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper studied the problem of integrated production and logistics planning under the commit-to-deliver policy. This problem arises in many supply chains and is particularly relevant to the contract manufacturing industry, which deals with a group of customers and relies on third party services for delivering the orders. We have provided a framework (model and solution approaches) for a decision support tool that can assist manufacturers to better coordinate their production scheduling and shipping planning for improved overall performance. We studied a manufacturing setting with multiple unrelated parallel processors where orders have release dates, sequence dependent setup times and delivery due dates with non-linear tardiness penalties. On the logistics side, we considered third party air and surface transportation options that provide a variety of pre-scheduled shipping options with different lead times and costs. While problem of integrating production and distribution has been studied before and its advantages were demonstrated in practice, this is the first research that considers the manufacturing scheduling in detail to allow for more realistic settings.

We have modeled the problem as a mixed integer linear model. The problem is NP-hard; thus, we proposed a decomposition method based on successive subproblem solving method. We decomposed the problem to a set of subproblems for each processor. After transformation, we solve the subproblems with an approach based on traveling repairman with profit. An adaptation of variable target value method was presented for automatic parameter setting in our solution methodology. The performance of our methodology was tested against CPLEX optimum solution and linear relaxation lower bound trough a set of computational experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our problem to achieve under 0.5 percent optimality gap against linear relaxation lower bound in average of less than 3 seconds. Moreover, we have showed that the algorithm is capable of solving larger problems efficiently and provide high quality solutions.

In this research, we address the gap in the integrated production and logistics problem literature in addition to providing an effective solution method for the class of parallel machine scheduling problems with time-dependent cost functions. We provided an effective modeling and solution approach for integrating production scheduling and logistics planning under commit-to-deliver policy for manufacturers. This research can be further extended to account for the processor failures, delivery lead-time uncertainty, and shipping cost discounts due to consolidation. Moreover, this work can be further expanded to account for more detailed aspects of logistics and distributions systems especially important for the integrated production and logistics planning in global supply chains with flexible manufacturing facilities.
