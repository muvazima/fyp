                  In this paper, the modelling problem of brain and eye signals is considered. To solve this problem, three important evolving and stable intelligent algorithms are applied: the sequential adaptive fuzzy inference system (SAFIS), uniform stable backpropagation algorithm (SBP), and online self-organizing fuzzy modified least-squares networks (SOFMLS). The effectiveness of the studied methods is verified by simulations.
