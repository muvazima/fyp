                  In dentistry, clinical radiographs (also called X-ray images) reflect the intensity loss of an X-ray when being transmitted through the mandibular objects, and this loss is quantified in terms of grey values. While such images are standardly used for pathology detection by the experienced dentist, we here present a new method for getting more quantitative information out of such 2D radiographs, “extending” them into the third dimension. This “extension” requires consistent combination of X-ray physics (namely, X-ray intensity loss quantification along paths orthogonal to the panoramic clinical image and X-ray attenuation averaging for composite materials) with anatomically known upper and lower limits of vascular porosities in cortical and trabecular bone compartments. Correspondingly computed ranges of overall organ thicknesses are extremely narrow, suggesting adequate estimation of thickness characteristics from 2D radiographic panoramas used clinically, while predicted cortical and trabecular thickness ranges vary by ±8.47% and ±16.13%, respectively. The proposed method also identifies variations between thicknesses at similar anatomical locations left and right of the face's symmetry axis, and molar regions turn out to be thicker than those close to incisors. This paves the way to more detailed diagnostic activities, e.g. in combination with Finite Element simulations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Clinical treatment in dentistry often starts with a 2D radiograph of the mandible, obtained by a technique based on X-radiation, also referred to as X-ray imaging [1]. Such images reflect the loss of X-ray intensity when transmitting the mandibular objects, and this loss is quantified in terms of grey values which are proportional to the decadic logarithm of the initial-over-transmitted intensity ratio. By naked eye, X-ray images allow for detection of major irregularities, such as carious tooth decay [2], or severely damaged areas in the mandible; the latter may occur in certain types of cancer [3]. As a complement to this standard use of such images, we here aim at retrieving from these 2D images information concerning the third dimension.

For this purpose, a new method is developed, based on the average rule of X-ray attenuation coefficients [4–6], which states that the attenuation coefficient related to a three-dimensional (3D) voxel in a 3D object is equal to the volume average of the attenuation coefficients of the material constituents found within this voxel. It allows for translation of attenuation coefficients assigned to milimeter-sized bone voxels, into voxel-specific vascular porosities. Integration of attenuation coefficients over the organ thickness delivers the aforementioned intensity losses – and this allows us to “back-analyze” from 2D radiographs, based on physiologically typical vascular porosities, upper and lower bounds for the pixel-specific thickness of the organ, as well as of the thicknesses of its cortical shells and trabecular core. This is described in detail in the sequel of this paper: after introducing mathematical relations for attenuation averaging (see Section 2.1), the two types of bone found in the human mandible, namely cortical bone with low vascular porosity and trabecular bone with high vascular porosity, are introduced (see Section 2.2), and the attenuation behavior of X-rays transmitted through composite materials (here solid bone matrix with embedded vascular pores) is elaborated (see Section 2.3). The collected and derived mathematical relations allow for quantification of the proportionality between pixel-specific grey values and X-ray intensity losses, and this gives access to the thicknesses of the mandible, be it in the purely cortical compartment at its bottom, or in the mixed cortical/trabecular, sandwich-type compartment further above (see Sections 2.4 and 2.5). The model is then numerically evaluated, demonstrating how 2D images can be extended into the thickness direction (see Section 3.1). Additionally, the model is validated through comparing benchmark dimensions of the analytically created with the corresponding dimensions extracted from CT imaging (see Sections 2.6 and 3.2). After a comprehensive discussion of the results (see Section 4), the paper is rounded off by presentation of final conclusions and potential directions of future developments (see Section 5).

As materials, we use 2D X-ray images, composed of small quadratic units called pixels, defining the resolution of the images, see Fig. 1
                        (a). Each pixel is characterized by a grey value χ, measured on an 8-bit scale from 0 to 255. These pixel-specific grey values are proportional to the optical density ρ

Across the mandibular thickness, i.e. orthogonal to the plane of an X-ray image as shown in Fig. 1(a), two types of composition, being relevant for two different regions in the image, are distinguished [13–15]:

                              “Purely cortical” regions made up of cortical bone only (labelled by “cort” in the following): the so-called substantia compacta constitutes the compact outer layer of bone, also referred to as cortical bone. In the grey value representation of Fig. 1(a), the region of purely cortical bone is discernable as light grey-colored area (high grey values) at the lower boundary of the mandible.

“Mixed cortical/trabecular” regions (labelled “mix” in the following), made up of two cortical layers, adjacent to a central trabecular core: the spongiosa is a sponge-like assembled system of slim bone platelets, enclosed by a shell of cortical bone. The bone platelets are denoted as trabeculae, thus spongious bone is also referred to as trabecular bone. In Fig. 1(a), the region of mixed cortical/trabecular bone is located above the region of purely cortical bone, and discernable as dark grey-colored area (low grey values).

Cortical and trabecular bone are such composite materials, built up by the constituents “(extravascular) solid bone matrix” (in the following labelled by suffix “BM”) and “vascular pore space” (in the following labelled by suffix “H2O”, indicating that the X-ray attenuation behavior of the pore fluid is close to that of water). Within a representative volume element of macroscopic bone material, the solid bone matrix occupies the volume fraction f

                        . Interestingly, these volume fractions depend in a bilinear fashion on each other, and on the extracellular bone matrix density. A corresponding “universal” composition rule, valid across numerous different organs, species, and ages, was evidenced by Vuong and Hellmich [18], based on careful evaluation of different chemical and weighing protocols realized over a time span of more than 80 years [19–29].

Combining Eqs. (1)–(21) with additional information on the vascular porosities found in mandibular bone, will allow us to derive thickness profiles from planar images as the one of Fig. 1. More precisely, we will be able to determine upper and lower bounds of such profiles, being related to minimum and maximum values of the cortical and trabecular porosities,

Next, we consider the cortical porosity values to be relevant for a chosen subset of the purely cortical region of a given mandibular radiograph, as the one shown in Fig. 1. Namely, we will choose the pixels along a vertical cross section between two adjacent teeth. Therefore, we adopt the following numbering convention for cross sections lying all between two adjacent teeth: the cross section between the two central incisors is labeled by “0”, and the following cross sections are labelled by increasing integers, combined with letters “L” and “R” indicating positions left and right of the “0” position, see Fig. 2
                        . All of these cross sections are characterized by total lengths l

                           S,cort. All pixels along cross section S can be located through variable x

                        The thicknesses of the individual compartments follow from insertion of d
                        mix(x), according to Eq. (30), into Eqs. (28) and (29).

However, pixel-specific numerical evaluation of Eq. (30) is not straightforward, since the trabecular thickness fraction TFtrab is neither known a priori, nor constant along the location variable x, compare Fig. 2. Its determination requires additional “topological rules”, which are implemented while progressing along the pixels constituting cross sections S, S
                        =L5, L2, R2, R5, with increasing location variable x
                        
                           S
                        . These rules read, in increasing hierarchical order (i.e. the latter potentially overruling the former), as follows:
                           
                              (i)
                              When progressing along location variable x
                                 
                                    S
                                 , thickness changes are neither encountered at the interfaces between the purely cortical region and the mixed cortical/trabecular regions (this interface is indicated by value x
                                 
                                    S,int of the location variable, see Fig. 2), nor within the mixed cortical/trabecular regions themselves; corresponding evaluation of Eq. (27) for x
                                 
                                    S
                                 
                                 =
                                 x
                                 
                                    S,int, and equating the result to Eq. (30), yields an expression for the trabecular thickness fraction TFtrab,

Thus, the model can account for situations where, within the widening region, the trabecular core may be well thinner than the cortical shells surrounding it. This becomes also apparent from the case studies presented in Section 3.1.

If the trabecular porosity computed according to Eq. (33) lies outside the porosity range reported by Renders et al. [32], given by Eq. (23), the thickness constance across the mixed cortical/trabecular regions needs to be abandoned. Accordingly, ϕ

                                 =0.5, Eq. (30) gives access to the sought organ stiffness. The latter, while further increasing x

The values of TFtrab according to rules (i)–(iii), in particular following Eqs. (31) and (32), together with Eqs. (28)–(30), allow for determination of the cortical and trabecular thicknesses of the mixed (cortical/trabecular) regions. Furthermore, deriving Eqs.

For the purpose of validation of the herein proposed modality of X-ray image interpretation, we consider additional patient data. In particular, both CT data and X-ray images were collected from three patients each, hereafter called patients P-1, P-2, and P-3. Thus, two sources for the distributions of cortical and trabecular thickness across the mandible are available:
                           
                              (i)
                              Applying the image analysis method presented in this paper to a specific cross section, e.g. to the cross section next to the left lateral incisior, see Fig. 4
                                 (c), provides the computed distribution of cortical and trabcular thicknesses along this cross section.

The CT data provides the corresponding “real” thicknesses straightforwardly, through placing appropriate cross sections by means of suitable image processing software (here, OsiriX v.5.8.2 was used), see Fig. 4(a) and (b). In more detail, the voxels of the used CT data sets were typically oriented along the superior–inferior anatomical axis, so that cross sections orthogonal to this anatomical axis can be easily chosen. Such a cross section is labelled “A-A” in Fig. 4(a) and (b), and it allows for accessing, within the 3D CT data sets, the cross sections indicated in the 2D radiograph of Fig. 2. This is shown exemplarily by means of cross section L2, see Fig. 4(b)–(d). The latter allows for identification of the mandible thicknesses

                                       cort
                                       mix
                                    
                                  and 
                                    
                                       d
                                       trab
                                       mix
                                    
                                 , as well the height of purely cortical bone, h
                                 cort.

Since the 2D-to-3D extension method delivers normalized thicknesses, we consider for validation the thickness fractions TFcort and TFcort, compare Eqs. (28) and (29). Furthermore, in order to simplify the validation procedure, we do not consider the whole thickness distributions, but only the thicknesses after completion of trabecular widening, at x
                        
                           S

@&#RESULTS@&#

In the following, we apply the method described in Section 2, to cross sections at four different anatomical locations [33,34]. As indicated in Fig. 2, these cross sections are located directly adjacent to selected teeth, namely: (i) left of the first right distal molar (labeled by “R5”), (ii) right of the right distal lateral incisor (labeled by “R2”), (iii) left of the left distal lateral incisor (labeled by “L2”), and (iv) right of the first left distal molar (labeled by “L5”). Corresponding distributions of grey values along these cross sections are depicted in Fig. 5
                        . It appears that grey value profiles along mandible cross sections are characterized by three distinct segments. The first segment relates to purely cortical bone, and is characterized by an increasing grey value. The second segment relates to mixed cortical/trabecular bone and features a decreasing grey value, due to the formation of the two cortical shells enveloping the trabecular core. Once this formation is completed, at x/l
                        ≈0.3, the third segment shows roughly a constant grey value distribution. From application of the evaluation scheme given by Eqs. (27)–(33) to the grey value profiles of Fig. 5, it turns out that prescribing maximum cortical porosity and minimum trabecular porosity relates to the lower bounds of resulting bone compartment thicknesses, whereas prescribing minimum cortical porosity and maximum trabecular porosity relates to the upper bounds of resulting bone compartment thicknesses, see Fig. 6
                         for respective thickness “corridors”. Fig. 6 shows the computed thicknesses in normalized fashion, that is divided by 
                           
                              
                                 d
                                 ¯
                              
                              
                                 LM
                                 ,
                                 cort
                              
                           
                        . Such, the comparability of the thicknesses between different locations is improved. As expected, the thicknesses of all purely cortical regions, given with dark grey background in Fig. 6, increase with increasing distance from the bottom of the mandible. At the same time, cross section-specific variances across the aforementioned thicknesses become evident, the organ being thicker at the molars than at the incisors, compare Fig. 6(a,d) to (b,c), but also being thicker at the right lateral incisor when compared to the left lateral incisor, compare Fig. 6(b) to (c). Also in the mixed cortical/trabecular regions, the incisor-related cross sections are thinner than the molar-related cross sections, and this holds for the overall thickness as well as for the cortical and trabecular compartment thicknesses (see curves with light grey background in Fig. 6). As concerns the variances within the incisor-related cross sections, the overall, as well as the cortical and trabecular thicknesses close to the left incisor are again larger than the corresponding thicknesses close to the right incisor; and while the cross section close to the left incisor exhibits a constant thickness along the mixed cortical/trabecular region, the right incisor-related cross-section gains thickness from the bottom of the mandible. Also, it is noteworthy that the porosity range-induced thickness ranges given in Fig. 6 are very narrow for the overall thickness (with a maximum deviation of 2.07%), they are still remarkably narrow for the cortical thicknesses (with a maximum deviation of 8.47%), while they are somewhat larger for the trabecular thicknesses (with a maximum deviation of 16.13%); percentages are quantified with respect to the average values of the total thicknesses, plotted as white solid lines in Fig. 6.

Following the validation procedure as decribed in Section 2.6, the resulting mean relative error (between thicknesses revealed by the here proposed analysis modality and CT-derived thicknesses) across all studied cross sections, computed according to Eq. (34), is remarkably low, amounting to only 0.0012±0.0755; the respective mean relative errors relating to cortical and trabecular thicknesses amount to −0.0060±0.1087 and 0.0083±0.0423, see Table 1
                         for all underlying relative errors. When considering the absolute values of the relative errors, |E
                        cort/trab|, the mean value is naturally higher (but still indicates that our analysis method provides adequate results), amounting to 0.0584±0.0464; the respective mean values relating to cortical and trabecular thickesses amount to 0.0842±0.0657, and 0.0326±0.0271.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the previous section, the 2D-to-3D X-ray image extension modality was applied to standardly produced mandible radiographs, revealing thickness profiles along chosen cross sections. Furthermore, through comparison of the underlying cortical and trabecular thickness fractions with the “real” thickness fractions available from CT data gathered from the very same patients, the method was satisfyingly validated, enhancing its credibility. However, one potential drawback of this method is that it is not fully automatized, requiring input of the user at the beginning of the analysis, concerning (i) the definition of the cross section to be analyzed, and (ii) delimitation, within each cross section, of regions of purely cortical bone and of mixed cortical/trabecular bone. In particular, different individuals may decide differently, which is not problematic with regards to the exact location of the cross section, but which may lead to different results when it comes to the distinction between purely cortical bone and mixed cortical/trabecular bone. Since precise definition of the region of purely cortical bone is mandatory for gaining reliable results by means of the proposed method, a more in-depth discussion of the potential inter-individual variance is instructive.

After choosing specific cross sections, 2D X-ray images give direct access, without any ambiguity, to corresponding grey value profiles along these cross sections; Fig. 5(a)–(d) shows the grey value distributions along cross sections L5, L2, R2, and R5 from the X-ray image shown in Fig. 1(a), see also Fig. 2 for definition of the respective location variables. Definition of the region of purely cortical bone, within one cross section, is based on considering that purely cortical bone is reflected by an increasing grey value found along the investigated cross sectional line – whenever two consecutive pixels exhibit the same grey values, or if a pixel exhibits a grey value which is lower than its predecessor, then this last pixel (or the second of the equally grey pixels, respectively) does not any more belong to the purely cortical region. Since the X-ray image provides the grey value distribution pixel-wisely, one obtains eventually a number of pixels relating to purely cortical bone, based on a visual inspection of the grey value profiles, see Figs. 5 and 7
                        , the latter showing the magnified region of interest within cross section R2. Provided that the person who applies our method follows the aforementioned simple rule for definition of the region of purely cortical bone, the results between different individuals are virtually variance-free – according to Fig. 7, the number of pixels representing purely cortical bone is clearly ten.

The only selection left to the physician is the choice of the landmark cross section from which the proportionality factor 
                           P
                         is computed, compare Eq. (26). Once this choice is made, the method automatically delivers all thicknesses normalized with respect to the average thickness of the purely cortical region along the chosen landmark cross section. The question arises how such a choice could potentially influence the results of our method: for example, let us consider cross section L5 of the radiograph depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. For this cross section, (normalized) thickness distributions computed on the basis of LM=R2 and LM=L2, respectively, are fully similar, and solely vary by a constant factor of 1.078, which is caused by different average cortical thicknesses of the two cross sections R2 and L2. However, the ratios of 
                           
                              d
                              cort
                              mix
                           
                           /
                           
                              d
                              mix
                           
                         and 
                           
                              d
                              trab
                              mix
                           
                           /
                           
                              d
                              mix
                           
                         do not differ at all between the different landmark cross sections, thus the characteristics of mixed cortical/trabecular regions, as computed by means of our method, are fully independent of the cross section chosen as landmark for the definition of the proportionality constant 
                           P
                        .

When applying the 2D-to-3D X-ray image extension method in clinical practice, the operating clinician first has to choose the cross sections to be studied. Thereby, cross section(s) can be chosen at specific locations, e.g. between the teeth, as has been done in this paper, or quasi-continuously, i.e. for each column of pixels constituting the 2D X-ray image. Specification of cross sections is tantamount to extracting from the X-ray image 1D distributions of grey values of which the X-ray image is composed along the respective cross sections, see e.g. Fig. 5. At this stage, a manual task is required from the clinician. Based on the grey value distribution, the clinician must discern the region of purely cortical bone. The underlying rule is straightforward. Given the shape of the region of purely cortical bone, see e.g. Fig. 1(b), it is concluded that the purely cortical part at the bottom of a cross section is characterized by an increasing grey value (due to the increasing thickness). In other words, once the grey value distribution reaches a plateau or decreases, the transition from purely cortical to mixed cortcial/trabecular bone has already occured; the inter-individual variance regarding the delimitation of purely cortical bone has been thoroughly discussed in Section 4.1. Furthermore, emphasis must be laid on excluding pixels representing teeth from the cross sections, since those would adulterate the analysis results. Then, the further analysis is completely automatic, according to the flowchart shown in Fig. 3.

The such obtained thickness distributions along the cross sections, see Fig. 6, are intended to provide benchmark dimensions across the mandible. On this basis, experienced clinicians are able to detect local irregularities “hidden” somewhere across the mandible, which are probably not recognizable on X-ray images since they may be represented by a few pixels only. Importantly, the method is not able to reveal the exact shape of the mandible, which has to be kept in mind when interpreting the computed thickness characteristics, where the cortical portion is not further differentiated into an interior and an exterior part. Furthermore, the direct output of the analysis are thickness profiles normalized with respect to the average thickness of a region of purely cortical bone representing a (freely choosable) “calibration cross section”. Such normalized thickness profiles certainly allow to detect the aforementioned irregularities. If nevertheless the need arises to deduce the absolute thicknesses, the average thickness of the region of purely cortical bone within the calibration cross section must be quantified. This quantification is not provided by the analysis modality proposed in this paper, but must occur based on the experience of the operating clinician, or based on additional measurements.

Notably, the fact that X-rays have to transmit soft tissue (such as skin and fat) before they reach the mandible, has not been taken into account in our model. Consideration of these effects would require the grey value of purely cortical bone to fulfill an extension of Eq. (4), namely

                        soft are the attenuation coefficient and the thickness of the soft tissue. The attenuation coefficient of soft tissue is available from the NIST-database. Furthermore, a comprehensive database on facial soft tissue thickness measurements has been provided by DeGreef et al. [35]. These additional data allow us to quantify the influence of the soft tissue on the computed thicknesses. For this exercise, we consider the bottom of purely cortical bone, at cross section R2, see Fig. 2, and consider a maximum cortical porosity ϕ
                        cort
                        =0.11 – such, we make sure that the considered influence of soft tissue on the computed thicknesses relates to a “worst case scenario”. Then, we prescribe the minimum soft tissue thickness provided for this location by the aforementioned reference, amounting to 6.2mm, which yields an increase of the thickness of purely cortical bone by 1.09%. On the other hand, when prescribing the maximum soft tissue thickness of 15.0mm, the decrease of the thickness of purely cortical bone turns out to be 1.50%. Both deviations are given with respect to the cortical thickness when neglecting soft tissue. These results clearly show that not taking into account in our analysis soft tissue explictly is indeed a justified simplification. We can also conclude that the influence of soft tissue increases with decreasing mandible thickness and with increasing thickness of soft tissue.

It is an important limitation of our model that it can be applied only to X-ray images being of good quality. Reasons for considering X-ray images (or parts thereof) as inappropriate could be a poor contrast between regions of purely cortical and mixed/cortical trabecular bone, or movements of the patients during the recording. Furthermore, in order to minimize the effects of possible inter-individual measurement differences high-resolution radiographs are preferable.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The method presented in this paper allows for transforming the spatially heterogeneous attenuation behavior across human mandibular bone acquired by X-ray imaging and quantified in terms of the attenuation-indicative grey values, to corresponding thicknesses of the cortical and trabecular mandibular compartments. These thicknesses are further governed by the vascular porosities expected in cortical and trabecular bone. The aforementioned transformation, being the first of its kind, is based on the laws for X-ray intensity loss when traveling through a solid medium, by the X-ray attenuation averaging rule for composite materials, and on anatomically reasonable “corridors” of vascular porosities in cortical and trabecular bone. This newly derived 3D geometry appears itself as an interesting and useful information to the dentist, additional to the information accessible from standard panoramic views as shown in Fig. 1(a). For instance, the presented approach may serve as decision-support tool as for instigation of more detailed, three-dimensional imaging measures, e.g. computed tomography.

Moreover, the 2D-to-3D extension developed herein may be particularly useful for deriving 3D structural mechanics models based on the Finite Element method (FEM). While the FEM has been introduced in dentomaxillofacial research for quite some time [36–40], generation of the required 3D models standardly requires CT data. As an alternative, so-called atlas-based models have been developed [41]. These methods use statistical information collected for the anatomy of interest, such as the mandible, to infer from 2D X-ray images the corresponding 3D shape. The method proposed here could be employed to include additional information regarding the segmentation of cortical and trabecular bone. Additionally, the porosity distributions gained from our method may be fed into micromechanics-based material property identification [42], which has greatly improved the reliability of the aformentioned Finite Element models [5]. Accordingly, retrieval of thickness and porosity information as described in Section 2.5, for each and every cross section throughout the organ, in combination with the porosity-to-stiffness conversion described in [5], promises a new route for computational mechanics technology entering the daily practice in dentistry, delivering information on stress states which, in turn, indicate regions of potential atrophy [43]. At a later state of even more sophisticated mathematical modeling, such regions may be quantified through a combined systems biology-micromechanics approach [44].
