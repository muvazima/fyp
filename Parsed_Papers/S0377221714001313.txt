                  In a financial market composed of n risky assets and a riskless asset, where short sales are allowed and mean–variance investors can be ambiguity averse, i.e., diffident about mean return estimates where confidence is represented using ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, we derive a closed form portfolio rule based on a worst case max–min criterion. Then, in a market where all investors are ambiguity-averse mean–variance investors with access to given mean return and variance–covariance estimates, we investigate conditions regarding the existence of an equilibrium price system and give an explicit formula for the equilibrium prices. In addition to the usual equilibrium properties that continue to hold in our case, we show that the diffidence of investors in a homogeneously diffident (with bounded diffidence) mean–variance investors’ market has a deflationary effect on equilibrium prices with respect to a pure mean–variance investors’ market in equilibrium. Deflationary pressure on prices may also occur if one of the investors (in an ambiguity-neutral market) with no initial short position decides to adopt an ambiguity-averse attitude. We also establish a CAPM-like property that reduces to the classical CAPM in case all investors are ambiguity-neutral.
               
            

A major theme in mathematical finance is the study of investors’ portfolio decisions using the well-established theory of mean–variance that began with the seminal work of Markowitz (1987). The mean–variance portfolio theory then formed the basis of the celebrated Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe, 1964), the most commonly used equilibrium and pricing model in the financial literature. However, it is a well-known fact that the investors’ portfolio holdings in the mean–variance portfolio theory are very sensitive to the estimated mean returns of the risky assets; see e.g., Best and Grauer (1991a), Best and Grauer (1991b), Black and Litterman (1992). The purpose of the present paper is to investigate equilibrium relations in a financial market composed of n risky assets and a riskless asset using an approach that takes into account the imprecision in the mean return estimates. In our model, investors act as mean–variance investors with a degree of diffidence (or confidence) towards the mean return estimates of risky assets. We refer to this attitude of diffidence as ambiguity aversion to distinguish it from risk aversion quantified by a mean–variance objective function. Decision making under ambiguity aversion is an active research area in decision theory and economics; see e.g., Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005, 2009). Our study follows the earlier work of Konno and Shirakawa (1994, 1995), and is in particular inspired by the previous work of Deng, Li, and Wang (2005) where the authors study a similar problem allowing the mean returns of risky assets to vary over a hyper-rectangle, i.e., an interval is specified for each mean return estimate and a max–min approach is used in the portfolio choice as in the present paper. We adopt an ellipsoidal uncertainty set for the mean-return vector instead of a hyper-rectangle, and obtain a closed-form portfolio rule using a worst-case max–min approach as in the robust optimization framework of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1999, 1998). In contrast, in Deng et al. (2005) a closed-form portfolio rule is not possible due to the polyhedral nature of their ambiguity representation. The ellipsoidal model controls the diffidence of investors using a single positive parameter

                      while the interval model of Deng et al. (2005) requires the specification of an interval for each risky asset, and has to resort to numerical solution of a linear programming problem to find a worst-case rate of return vector in the hyper-rectangle. The linear programming nature of the procedure may cause several components of the rate of return vector in question to assume the lower or upper end values of the interval as a by-product of the simplex method (i.e., an extreme point of the hyper-rectangle will be found). Since the worst case return occurs at an extreme point of the hyper-rectangle, it corresponds to an extreme scenario where most (or all) risky assets assume their worst possible return values, which may translate into an unnecessarily conservative portfolio. Such extreme behavior does not occur with an ellipsoidal representation of the uncertainty set due to the non-linear geometry of the ellipsoid. Besides, the ellipsoidal representation is also motivated by statistical considerations alluded to in Section 2. As in Deng et al. (2005), in the contributions of Konno and Shirakawa (1994, 1995) where short sales are not allowed, the formula for the equilibrium price vector requires the solution of an optimization problem as input to the formula whereas we have an explicit formula for the equilibrium price.

To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is one the few studies next to Deng et al. (2005), Wu, Song, Xu, and Liu (2009) to incorporate ambiguity aversion in asset returns in an equilibrium framework. However, unlike the present paper, in neither Deng et al. (2005) nor Wu et al. (2009) there is a truly closed-form result, and furthermore they do not study the impact of ambiguity aversion on equilibrium prices.

The seminal results on equilibrium in capital markets were established in the early works of Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966) and Sharpe (1964), which resulted in the celebrated CAPM; see Elton and Gruber (1991), Markowitz (1987) for textbook treatments of the subject. The theory of equilibrium in capital asset markets were later extended in several directions in e.g., Black (1972), Nielsen (1987, 1989, 1990, 1989). In a recent study, Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2007) use the so-called diversion measures (an example is Conditional Value at Risk, CVaR) to investigate equilibrium in capital markets. Balbás, Balbás, and Balbás (2010) use coherent risk measures, expectation bounded risk measures and general deviations in optimal portfolio problems, and study CAPM-like relations. Grechuk and Zabarankin (2012) consider an optimal risk sharing problem among agents with utility functionals depending only on the expected value and a deviation measure of an uncertain payoff. They characterize Pareto optimal solutions and study the existence of an equilibrium. Kalinchenko, Uryasev, and Rockafellar (2012) use the generalized CAPM based on mixed Conditional Value at Risk deviation for calibrating the risk preferences of investors. Hasuike (2010) use fuzzy numbers to represent investors’ preferences in an extension of the CAPM. Zabarankin, Pavlikov, and Uryasev (2014) uses the Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk (CDaR) measure to study optimal portfolio selection and CAPM-like equilibrium models. Won and Yannelis (2011) examine equilibrium with an application to financial markets without a riskless asset where uncertainty makes preferences incomplete. They assume a normal distribution for the mean return with an uncertain mean, and adopt a min–max approach using an ellipsoidal representation as in the present paper.

In the present paper, we investigate the equilibrium implications of ambiguity aversion defined as diffidence vis à vis estimated mean returns. In particular, in a capital market in equilibrium where all investors fully trust estimated mean rates of return (they are ambiguity-neutral), if one investor decides to adopt an ambiguity-averse position, this shift may create a downward pressure on equilibrium prices. In uniform markets where all investors are ambiguity averse, the effect of ambiguity aversion is also deflationary with respect to a fully confident (ambiguity-neutral) investors market.

In summary, the contributions of the present are as follows:
                        
                           •
                           we use an ellipsoidal representation of the ambiguity in mean returns which avoids extreme scenarios, and thus alleviates the overly conservative nature of the resulting portfolios,

our ellipsoidal ambiguity model allows for a truly closed-form portfolio rule,

we establish a sufficient condition for a unique equilibrium price vector in financial markets with ambiguity averse investors, as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of non-negative equilibrium prices,

we have an explicit formula for the equilibrium price system in a market of mean–variance and ambiguity-averse investors, which reduces to a formula for the equilibrium prices of a market of mean–variance investors,

we show the deflationary effect of the ambiguity aversion on risky asset prices,

we establish a generalization of the CAPM which reverts to the original CAPM when all investors are ambiguity-neutral.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we examine the problem of portfolio choice of an ambiguity-averse investor using an ellipsoidal ambiguity set and worst case max–min criterion. We derive an explicit optimal portfolio rule. In Section 3, we study conditions under which an equilibrium system of prices exist in different capital markets characterized by the presence of ambiguity-averse or neutral investors, and give an explicit formula for equilibrium prices. We illustrate the results with a numerical example. Section 4 gives some properties of equilibrium. In particular, separation and proportion properties are shown, as well as a CAPM-like result which reduces to the classical CAPM when investors have full confidence in the estimates of mean rate of return. We conclude in Section 5 with a summary and future research directions.

Garlappi, Uppal, and Wang (2007) show that the ellipsoidal representation of the ambiguity of estimates may also lead to more stable portfolio strategies, delivering a higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratio compared to the classical Markowitz portfolios. It is also well-known (see Johnson & Wichern (1997, p. 212)), that the random variable

In this section we shall analyze the existence of an equilibrium price system in capital markets where investors adopt or relinquish an ambiguity-averse attitude. First, we shall look at markets where all investors are either ambiguity-averse or ambiguity-neutral. We refer to such markets as uniform markets. Then, we investigate the effect on equilibrium prices of introducing an ambiguity-averse investor in a market of ambiguity-neutral investors. We shall refer to such markets as mixed.

We denote the price system by the vector

The existence of strictly positive prices is a harder question that is rarely addressed (with the exception of Rockafellar et al. (2007)) although zero prices would hardly make economic sense in practice. Interestingly, we can also prove the following negative result on the existence of a strictly positive system of equilibrium prices.

                        . Therefore, in a homogeneously and mildly diffident ambiguity-averse mean–variance investors’ market (where diffidence is bounded above by the slope of the Capital Market Line), equilibrium prices are under downward pressure with respect to a purely confident mean–variance investors’ market. We summarize these observations below.

                              ) ambiguity-averse mean–variance investors’ market in equilibrium prices are smaller than the equilibrium prices in a pure mean–variance investors’ market.

                        . In other words, in an ambiguity-averse mean–variance investors market with bounded diffidence, if all investors have long initial positions, then equilibrium leads to smaller prices compared to the equilibrium prices of purely mean–variance investors’ market, everything else being equal. Hence, the introduction of ambiguity aversion or diffidence in rate of return estimates into a market with all positive initial positions creates a deflationary pressure on equilibrium prices.

                                       of investor m are positive, the equilibrium prices of the mixed market are smaller than the equilibrium prices of the uniform market.
                                    

The above result is not surprising if one bears in mind that an ambiguity-averse investor holds smaller long positions in risky assets compared to an ambiguity-neutral investor, which leads to a decreased demand for risky assets, and hence exerts a downward pressure on equilibrium prices.

A similar analysis can be made when the ambiguity aversion of one investor is not classified as mildly diffident, but rather, significantly diffident, i.e., with 
                           
                              ∊
                              ⩾
                              H
                           
                        , in which case this investor would put all his/her initial wealth into the riskless asset. It can be shown again that such behavior leads to a drop in equilibrium prices. This is left as an exercise.

We devote this section to the study of some interesting properties of portfolios in equilibrium. More precisely, we follow the references Deng et al. (2005), Konno and Shirakawa (1994), Konno and Shirakawa (1995) to examine the properties of the portfolios in equilibrium in a market of mildly diffident mean–variance investors.

Then, we have the following CAPM-like property which expresses the nominal excess rate of return of risky asset j as proportional to the worst-case excess rate of return of the market portfolio of risky assets. In addition to the terms that are encountered in the classical CAPM, the proportionality also depends on the square root of the market optimal Sharpe ratio

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we analyzed existence of equilibrium in a financial market composed of risky assets and a riskless asset, where mean–variance investors can display aversion to ambiguity, i.e., aversion to imprecision in the estimated mean rates of return of risky assets. We first derived a closed-form optimal portfolio rule for a mean–variance investor with aversion to ambiguity modeled using an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, borrowing the concept from robust optimization. The optimal portfolio rule reduces to the portfolio choice of a mean–variance investor when the investor is ambiguity-neutral. We examined conditions under which an equilibrium exists in a market of ambiguity-averse investors as well as conditions that lead to deflationary pressure on equilibrium prices with respect to a pure mean–variance investors’ (i.e., ambiguity-neutral) market. A CAPM-like result is derived, which reduces to the usual CAPM in the absence of ambiguity aversion.

Future research can address equilibrium in the absence of the riskless asset, limitations or exclusion of short sales, equilibrium with other risk measures such as robust CVaR or expected shortfall under mean return ambiguity, and equilibrium under transaction costs.
