                  Recently Georgiev, Luc, and Pardalos (2013), [Robust aspects of solutions in deterministic multiple objective linear programming, European Journal of Operational Research, 229(1), 29–36] introduced the notion of robust efficient solutions for linear multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we extend this notion to nonlinear case. It is shown that, under the compactness of the feasible set or convexity, each robust efficient solution is a proper efficient solution. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for robustness, with respect to the tangent cone and the non-ascent directions, are proved. An optimization problem for calculating a robustness radius followed by a comparison between the newly-defined robustness notion and two existing ones is presented. Moreover, some alterations of objective functions preserving weak/proper/robust efficiency are studied.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Due to perturbations and partial knowledge, in most practical optimization problems we are faced with uncertainty. Popular approaches for dealing with uncertainty are stochastic optimization, robust optimization and sensitivity analysis. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages (Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009; Bertsimas, Brown, & Caramanis, 2011). From the late 1990s, robust single-objective optimization has been being investigated. In robust single-objective optimization, we try to find a feasible point that optimizes the worst case counterpart of the objective function, see Ben-Tal et al. (2009) and Bertsimas et al. (2011) for more formal definition and more details about robustness in single-objective optimization.

The robustness of single-objective optimization has received considerable attention, but the robustness of multi-objective optimization has not been frequently considered. See e.g. Deb and Gupta (2006), Ehrgott, Ide, and Schöbel (2014), Kuroiwa and Lee (2012) and Georgiev, Luc, and Pardalos (2013), where this notion is studied from different standpoints. Deb and Gupta (2006) focused on two definitions for robustness. In the first definition, they call an efficient solution to be robust if it optimizes the mean of all objective functions. In the second definition, the objectives do not change, but a constraint is added which restricts the absolute difference between the mean and original objective functions. There, the efficient solutions of the modified problem are called robust. Ehrgott et al. (2014) extended the worst case robustness notion from single-objective optimization to multi-objective programming. They further introduced some scalarization methods which are able to produce a robust solution in worst-case sense. Bokrantz and Fredriksson (2014) studied more methods of scalarization with respect to the definition given by Ehrgott et al. (2014). Moreover, Fliege and Werner (2014) utilized a special robustness concept in portfolio optimization.

In a recent work, Georgiev et al. (2013) have defined the robustness for linear multi-objective programming problems from a different point of view. They have considered a perturbation standpoint, and have defined an efficient solution as a robust solution if it remains efficient for small perturbations in the coefficients of the objective functions. Georgiev et al. (2013) studied their definition considering different kinds of perturbations, including changing the objectives’ coefficients and adding a new objective function. They obtained necessary and sufficient conditions and presented various nice properties of the robust solutions in linear cases. Goberna, Jeyakumar, Li, and Vicente-Pérez (2015) extended Georgiev et al.’s definition for linear multi-objective optimization problems under perturbations of the coefficients of both objective functions and constraints.

In this paper, we extend the definition given by Georgiev et al. (2013) to nonlinear multi-objective programming problems. We show that, under the compactness of the feasible set or convexity, the set of robust efficient solutions is a subset of the set of proper efficient solutions. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for robust solutions with respect to the tangent cone and non-ascent directions, under appropriate assumptions, are given. A robustness radius is calculated. The relationships between the robustness notion considered in the present paper and two worst case-based definitions, studied by Fliege and Werner (2014) and Ehrgott et al. (2014), are highlighted. Two kinds of modifications in the objective functions are dealt with and the relationships between the weak/proper/robust efficient solutions of the problems, before and after the perturbation, are established. Some examples, to clarify the theoretical results, are given.

The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. In Section 2, some preliminaries are given. In Section 3, robustness is defined, its relationship with proper efficiency is established, and some necessary and sufficient conditions are proved. Section 4 is devoted to the robustness radius calculation. Section 5 contains some results about connections between the new and previously defined robustness definitions. In Section 6, we study some alterations of the objective functions that preserve weak/proper/robust efficiency.

This section is devoted to some preliminaries. For a set

Proper efficiency has been defined in different senses and has been studied in several publications, including Benson (1979), Borwein (1977), Geoffrion (1968), Henig (1982) and Kuhn and Tucker (1951). In this paper, we use the above definition.

Our robustness notion in the present work is based on the matrix perturbations. Hence, we need a matrix norm. For an m × n matrix

Now, we consider the latter case: {xi
                           } does not have any subsequence convergent to

                           . Therefore, without loss of generality, there exist an r > 0 such that

This remark indicates that the robust solution studied in the present paper may not exist in some special cases, though these solutions (if exist) have nice properties as compared to non-robust points. An efficient point is robust if it stays efficient under small linear perturbations. Let us assume that fi

For constrained problem (20) satisfying the assumptions of Corollary 3.5, if

                                 p

                           . It is not restrictive for practical cases, because in practice the problem has at least 2n constraints due to the lower and upper bounds of variables.

The necessary condition introduced in Theorem 3.2 provides a tie-in to the gradient-like descent methods existing in the literature for solving vector optimization problems; see Drummond and Iusem (2004) and Fliege and Svaiter (2000). Extending these numerical tools to generate robust solution(s) can be worth studying in future.

In this short section, we compute a radius of robustness. For a given vector

It can be seen that, the optimal value of the optimization problem considered in the above theorem is equal to the maximum robustness radius if one furthermore assumes the equality of the tangent cone and the cone of feasible directions.

There are some definitions for robustness in the multi-objective programming literature that optimize the worst case of the objective functions. In the following, we highlight the relationships between the robustness notion considered in the present paper and two worst case-based definitions studied by Fliege and Werner (2014) (FW in brief) and Ehrgott et al. (2014) (EIS in brief). See also Georgiev et al. (2013) for some comparison.

In fact, the robustness notion considered in the present paper is sufficient for two above mentioned (worst case-based) notions. In definition studied in the present paper, the robustness is coming from a linear perturbation instead of an arbitrary perturbation and this leads to Proper efficiency as proved in Section 3. See also, Section 3 of Georgiev et al. (2013) for some comparison.

In this section, we consider two robustness aspects of (weakly/properly) efficient solutions. In the first one, we consider a convex combination of the objective function of Problem (20) with a new special function. The second robustness aspect is due to adding a new objective function to the problem. In both cases, we examine preserving the weak/proper/robust efficiency.

The following example shows that part (i) of the above theorem may not hold when some fi
                      or gj
                      functions are nonsmooth. A similar example can be constructed for part (ii).
