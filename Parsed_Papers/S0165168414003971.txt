                  The analysis of the stability and numerical simulation of Costas loop circuits for high-frequency signals is a challenging task. The problem lies in the fact that it is necessary to simultaneously observe very fast time scale of the input signals and slow time scale of phase difference between the input signals. To overcome this difficult situation it is possible, following the approach presented in the classical works of Gardner and Viterbi, to construct a mathematical model of Costas loop, in which only slow time change of signal׳s phases and frequencies is considered. Such a construction, in turn, requires the computation of phase detector characteristic, depending on the waveforms of the considered signals. While for the stability analysis of the loop near the locked state (local stability) it is usually sufficient to consider the linear approximation of phase detector characteristic near zero phase error, the global analysis (stability in the large) cannot be accomplished using simple linear models.
                  The present paper is devoted to the rigorous construction of nonlinear dynamical model of classical Costas loop, which allows one to apply numerical simulation and analytical methods (various modifications of absolute stability criteria for systems with cylindrical phase space) for the effective analysis of stability in the large. Here a general approach to the analytical computation of phase detector characteristic of classical Costas loop for periodic non-sinusoidal signal waveforms is suggested. The classical ideas of the loop analysis in the signal׳s phase space are developed and rigorously justified. Effective analytical and numerical approaches for the nonlinear analysis of the mathematical model of classical Costas loop in the signal׳s phase space are discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Costas loop [1,2] is a classical phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuit for carrier recovery. Nowadays among the applications of Costas loop there are Global Positioning Systems (see, e.g., [3–7]), wireless communication (see, e.g., [8–14] and others [15–23].

A PLL-based circuit behaves as a nonlinear control system and its physical model in the signal space can be described by nonlinear nonautonomous difference or differential equations. In practice, numerical simulation is widely used for the analysis of nonlinear PLL-based models (see, e.g., [24–28]). However the explicit numerical simulation of the physical model of Costas loop or its mathematical model in the signal space (e.g., full SPICE-level simulation) is rather complicated for the high-frequency signals. The problem lies in the fact that it is necessary to consider simultaneously both very fast time scale of the signals and slow time scale of phase difference between the signals, so one very small simulation time-step needs to be taken over a very long total simulation period [29–31].

To overcome this difficult situation it is possible, following the approach presented, e.g., in the classical works of Gardner and Viterbi, to construct a mathematical model in the signal׳s phase space, in which only slow time change of signal׳s phases and frequencies is considered. Such a construction, in turn, requires the computation of phase detector characteristic, which depends on PD physical realization and the waveforms of the considered signals [32–35]. Note that “understanding how phase detectors work is one of the major keys to understanding how PLLs work” [36].

In the present paper a general effective approach to analytical computation of phase detector characteristic is presented; the classical ideas of analysis and design of PLL-based circuits in the signal׳s phase space are developed and rigorously justified; for various non-sinusoidal waveforms of high-frequency signals (see, e.g., various applications of PLL-based circuits with non-sinusoidal signals in [62–68]) its phase-detector characteristics are obtained for the first time and its dynamical model is constructed.

Various modifications of analog and digital Costas loops and PLL with squarer are widely used for BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) and QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) demodulation in telecommunication. Because the realization of squaring circuits can be quite difficult, the Costas loop is the preferred variant [26]. In digital circuits, the maximum data rate is limited by a speed of ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). In the following classical analog Costas loop, used for BPSK demodulation (similar analysis can also be done for QPSK Costas loop), is considered.

Consider the Costas loop operation (see Fig. 1
                     ) with the sinusoidal carrier and VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) signals with the same frequencies after transient processes. The input signal is BPSK signal, which is a product of the transferred data 
                        m
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        =
                        ±
                        1
                      and the harmonic carrier 
                        sin
                        (
                        ω

                        )
                      with the high frequency ω. Since here the Costas loop in lock is considered, VCO signal is synchronized with the carrier (i.e. there is no phase difference between VCO signal and input carrier). On the lower branch (Q branch) after the multiplication of VCO signal, shifted by 90°, and the input signal by the multiplier block (

On the upper branch (I) the input signal is multiplied by the output signal of VCO:

Then both branches are multiplied together and after an additional filtration one gets the signal g(t) to adjust VCO frequency to the frequency of input carrier signal. After a transient process there is no phase difference and the control input of VCO is zero. In the general case when the initial frequencies are different the control input of VCO is constant:

                     , one can consider a linearized mathematical model of Costas loop for sinusoidal signals (see details in Section 4). This allows one to estimate approximately acquisition parameters by the same methods that were developed for the analysis and design of classical PLLs (see, e.g., [69–72] and others).

In the next section a rigorous mathematical approach to the analytical computation of phase detector characteristic and the nonlinear analysis of classical Costas loop for non-sinusoidal waveforms is considered.

The low-pass filters on the upper and the lower branches of Costas loop (Fig. 2) are responsible for demodulation process (see Fig. 1) and therefore they can be applied separately from the loop (see, e.g., [4]). From a point of view of the analysis of stability, the filter at the input of VCO executes their filtering functions.

Thus one can consider a simplified physical open-loop model of Costas loop (Fig. 3
                        ) with only one filter at the input of VCO. In this case the transmitted data m(t) can be omitted (i.e. 
                           m
                           (

                           1
                        ) because after the multiplication of the upper and the lower branches at the input of filter the data are squared: (

For solving the above problem, posed by D. Abramovitch, and applying the averaging methods it is necessary to consider mathematical properties of high-frequency signals. Here an approach is applied and used which is developed for the study of the classical PLL [32,35,48,74].

A high-frequency property of signals can be reformulated in the following way. Suppose that for the frequencies
                           2
                        
                        
                           2

In other words, this theorem separates the low-frequency error-correcting signal from parasitic high-frequency oscillations and proves that the considered function 
                        φ
                        (
                        θ
                        )
                      is a phase detector characteristic of Costas loop. Thus the filter input can be approximated by the function 
                        φ
                        (
                        θ
                        )
                      in the sense that a change in the filter output signal is sufficiently small (see (15)).

For sinusoidal waveforms this fact was known to engineers [2] without rigorous justification.

Nonautonomous system (19) describes physical model of Costas loop in the signal space (see Fig. 5
                     ) and is rather difficult for the study.

Suppose that the frequency of reference signal is a constant

                      so one can read in [37] “the use of linear macromodels can lead to qualitatively incorrect prediction of important PLL phenomena”. At the same time the attempts to justify analytically the reliability of conclusions, based on simplified engineering approaches, and rigorous study of nonlinear models are quite rare and one of the reasons is that “nonlinear analysis techniques are well beyond the scope of most undergraduate courses in communication theory” [28].

While the physical model of Costas loop in the signal space (19) is nonautonomous and its rigorous global analysis (transient processes, stability in the large, cycle slipping, etc.) is rather difficult and creative task, for the global analysis of nonlinear autonomous model (21) of Costas loop, the well-known methods of analysis of pendulum-like systems can be applied (see, e.g., [79,54,80,56,81,60]). Modification of direct Lyapunov method with the construction of periodic Lyapunov-like functions, the method of positively invariant cone grids, and the method of nonlocal reduction turned out to be most effective [82,83,80,81]. The last method, which combines the elements of direct Lyapunov method and bifurcation theory, allows one to extend the classical results of Tricomi [84] and his progenies to the multidimensional dynamical systems [83,85].

Since in the block diagram in Fig. 6 and system (21) only slow time change of signal׳s phases and frequencies is considered, they can be effectively studied numerically.

                        One can compare the numerical integration of systems (19) and (21) with the simulation of realization of block diagrams in Figs. 5 and 6, f.e., in Matlab Simulink (see, e.g., [28,86] and the patent application [87]).

                        While we consider a very simple filter, sawtooth and triangle waveforms in simulation, one can consider similar effects for lag-lead or PI filters and other waveforms.
                      of those considered in the previous section of Costas loop models in the signal and signal׳s phase spaces. In Fig. 7
                      are shown the transient processes of VCO input in block diagrams in Figs. 5 and 6 (here it is important if and when VCO input becomes a constant, see (3)).

Here the simulation in the signal׳s phase space is more than 100 times faster. Unlike the filter output in the signal׳s phase space, in the signal space the filter output contains additional high-frequency oscillation. These high-frequency oscillations interfere with qualitative analysis and efficient simulation of Costas loop. The passage to the analysis of autonomous dynamical model of Costas loop (in place of the nonautonomous one) allows one to overcome the difficulties that relate to the analysis of Costas loop in the signal space.

The approach described can be adapted to digital Costas loops [4,88], where the filter and the VCO are digital unlike those in Fig. 5. If a discretization step is sufficiently small, then a digital filter acts similar to an analog filter. In this case it can be shown that the considered mathematical model in the signal׳s phase space is adequate (see Fig. 8
                     ).

In conclusion it should be remarked that in the signal׳s phase space a similar numerical simulation of the whole transient process (around 10s – see Fig. 7) of Costas loop with frequencies around 1GHz=109
                     Hz takes less than 1s. At the same time to perform the accurate simulation of Costas loop in the signal space for such frequencies one has to use a discretization step much less than 10−9, what results in a very long simulation time to oversee the whole transient process: during 10s of simulation in the signal space only 3.5×10−8
                     s of 10s of transient process was obtained (see Fig. 9
                     ).

These difficulties are described in [37]: “Direct time-domain simulation of PLLs at the level of SPICE circuits is typically impractical because of its great inefficiency. PLL transients can last hundreds of thousands of cycles, with each cycle requiring hundreds of small time steps for accurate simulation of the embedded voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Furthermore, extracting phase or frequency information, one of the chief metrics of PLL performance, from time-domain voltage/current waveforms is often difficult and inaccurate.”

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The approach, proposed in this paper, allows one to compute analytically PD characteristics for the general case of periodic waveforms and to construct the nonlinear mathematical model in the signal׳s phase space for classical Costas loop and, ultimately, to apply numerical simulation and analytical methods (various modifications of absolute stability criteria for pendulum-like systems) for the effective analysis of its stability in the large.

Remark that the addends in (47) consist of the product of four coefficients and four trigonometric functions. Apply the formulas of product of sines and cosines to each addend and use Lemma 1 (assertions of Lemmas 1 and 2 are at the end of Appendix), taking into account the conditions of high-frequency property (7)–(9) and the introduced notion (40). Note that the addends in (47) are similar and the types of functions (sin or cos) and coefficients (

                           ,

                           β
