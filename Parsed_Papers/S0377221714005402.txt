                  In 2014, Wang et al. (2014) extended the model of Lou and Wang (2012) to incorporate the credit period dependent demand and default risk for deteriorating items with maximum lifetime. However, the rates of demand, default risk and deterioration in the model of Wang et al. (2014) are assumed to be specific functions of credit period which limits the contributions. In this note, we first generalize the theoretical results of Wang et al. (2014) under some certain conditions. Furthermore, we also present some structural results instead of a numerical analysis on variation of optimal replenishment and trade credit strategies with respect to key parameters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Trade credit is an increasingly important payment behavior in real business transactions. Since the trade credit management needs to balance the trade-off between increased sales and the risk of granting credit, Teng and Lou (2012) first incorporated the credit-linked demand and default risks to establish an EOQ model for the retailer in a supply chain with up-stream and down-stream trade credits. In an article published in Journal of the Operational Research Society, Lou and Wang (2012) extended the model of Teng and Lou (2012) by introducing the credit-linked demand and default risks. Later, Wang, Teng, and Lou (2014) extended the model of Lou and Wang (2012) for deterioration with a maximum lifetime. Base on the model of Teng and Lou (2012), Wu, Ouyang, Cárdenas-Barrón, and Goyal (2014) subsequently built an EOQ model for deteriorating items with expiration dates under two-level trade credit financing. However, the rates of demand and default risk in the above-mentioned studies are assumed to be specific functions of the credit period. In this short note, we first generalize the theoretical results of Lou and Wang (2012) and Wang et al. (2014) under some certain conditions. Next, a sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters are further performed in rigorous discussions.

For easy tractability with Wang et al. (2014), we use the same notations and assumptions. Further, in order to generalize the models of Lou and Wang (2012) and Wang et al. (2014), we make assumptions on the rates of demand and default risk. Let n be the credit period offered by the retailer to its customers, the demand is given by a demand function 
                        
                           D
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                     , which is assumed to be nonnegative, continuous and twice differentiable. Because the trade credit allows customers to enjoy the benefits of delayed payments, lengthening the credit period will stimulate sales. The longer the credit period, the higher the demand; hence, the demand strictly increases in the credit period, that is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D

                     . Meanwhile, since a longer credit period may tie up the retailer’s capital and then increase the risk of default, the rate of default risk giving the credit period n is assumed to be

Although we know the optimal replenishment time and trade credit strategies exist from the above discussions, we do not have any further information about the system behavior. In this section we study how the optimal replenishment time and trade credit strategies vary with respect to the key parameters by using the property of supermodular function. In the following, we first introduce the definition of supermodular function.

We now state our third structural result as the following proposition.
                        Proposition 1

                           are met, then:
                           
                              
                                 (1)
                                 
                                    The optimal value of T decreases as n increases.
                                 


                                    The optimal value of n increases, but the optimal value of T decreases as p increases.
                                 


                                    The optimal value of n decreases, but the optimal value of T increases as o increases.
                                 


                                    For a given T, the optimal value of n decreases as c or h increases. Likewise, for a given n, the optimal value of T decreases as c or h increases.

Finally, the rates of default risk and deterioration defined in the model of Wang et al. (2014) are used to study the impacts of default risk and deterioration on the optimal replenishment time and trade credit strategies. We then state the structural results on the variation of optimal replenishment time and trade credit strategies with respect to b and m as the following proposition.
