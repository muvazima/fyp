                  The anisotropic diffusion is an efficient smoothing process. It is widely used in noise removing and edges preserving via different schemes. In this paper based on a mathematical background and the existing efficient anisotropic function in the literature we developed a new mathematical anisotropic diffusion function which is able to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional process such as the details loss and the image blur. The simulations results and the comparative study with other recent techniques are conducted and showed that the proposed schema generates a wide improvement in the quality of the restored images. This improvement has been shown subjectively in terms of visual quality, and objectively with reference to the computation of some criteria. The simulated images are well de-noised but the most important is that details and structural information are kept intact. In addition to that, the proposed new function was found very interesting and presents numerous advantages like its similarity to the conventional model and the importance of the speed hence it converges faster which allows an opportunity to be well implemented in our de-noising process.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Improving the image quality is the most important goal in image processing. So, we are looking for an efficient method of noise removal, which is able to de-noise efficiently the image. Linear smoothing technique allows good results but it causes the loss of the details and the image becomes inexploitable for further processing information extraction. They are potentially more powerful than linear filters because they are able to reduce noise levels without simultaneously blurring edges however they can be computationally expensive to use as well as they can generate spurious features and distort existing features in images. Scale space representation is based on the convolution with a chosen kernel in the smoothing operation. The most important parameter supervising an anisotropic filtering function is its convergence speed. This parameter is able alone to characterize the filtering process to be real time running and it allows it to be electronically implemented. The higher the convergence speed is, the more interesting the filtering process is especially when the image is composed by many details and edges or textures. For this reason we are highly interested in the development of a new anisotropic function which is faster than the existing recent models in the literature. Then, the new model is chosen such as it behaves in the range of 
                        [
                        0
                        
                        1
                        ]
                     . In addition the proposed model satisfies the convergences requirements and reversibility.

Witkin [1] proposed to generate coarser resolution images by convolving the original image with a Gaussian kernel. This description was developed by Koenderink [2] who motivates the diffusion equation formulation by announcing two criteria, the first is that of causality and the second is about the homogeneity and isotropy. These criteria lead to the diffusion equation formulation. In an analogous way, anisotropic diffusion is considered as an important solution for better image de-noising and edges preserving. Therefore, variational methods for image smoothing have been proposed to reduce noise and restore the quality of an image for better observation. The anisotropic diffusion is a nonlinear iterative process which aims to process separately noise and details by calculating the gradient of each pixel. The first model of anisotropic diffusion has been proposed by Perona and Malik [3]. This model is based on a new definition of the scale space representation via anisotropic diffusion, in which P and M proposed to replace the heat equation by a nonlinear equation. Many studies based on a modified anisotropic diffusion have been proposed for an efficient de-noising technique and edge preserving [4–8]. Anisotropic diffusion algorithms are a powerful tool in image processing. These processes are based on two constraints such as good edge enhancement and fast convergence speed. By this way, this function will be easier and faster for real time implementation. In this paper, a new anisotropic adaptive schema which smooths the noisy zones at the same time, enhances the edges and preserves the content is presented.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the basic information about Perona & Malik anisotropic diffusion (AD) and its regularized models will be given in Section 2. Section 3 describes our contribution to denoised images without hitting edges and contents. The implementation technique of the new function in the denoising process will be held in Section 4. Section 5 exposes different evaluation metrics and the comparative study of the new algorithm with diverse recent works [3,15–17,23–30]. Conclusion appears in the last section.

The first model of the nonlinear PDE approaches has been proposed in [3] by Perona and Malik, as illustrated by the following equation:

The choice of the diffusion coefficient g is very important for an efficient filtering. In fact, the diffusion is higher when a small gradient is detected, consecutively, conversely for higher gradient magnitude. The diffusivity function is chosen to be a non-negative decreasing conductance function which satisfies these conditions:

                         Edges are significant local changes of intensity in an image. Often, points that lie on an edge are identified by detecting the local maxima or minima of the first derivative or detecting the zero-crossings of the second derivative. The first derivative has a peak at the edge while the second derivative has a zero crossing. The first derivative is computed based on a finite difference such as:

                         The Perona and Malik anisotropic diffusion model presented in Eq. (1) will be reduced to an isotropic diffusion equation if the diffusion coefficient 
                           g

                         is a constant. One of the drawbacks of this model is to be an inverse heat equation for some gradient values.

For images corrupted by high densities of noise, the Perona and Malik model cannot differentiate between edges and noise (Fig. 2
                        ). The noisy image is obtained by adding Gaussian noise of strength

Since this first model was proposed by Perona & Malik, many studies have been developed to prove that the performance of the anisotropic diffusion could be improved to overcome the drawbacks and limitations.

Various modifications of the original scheme of P&M were presented attempting to overcome its drawbacks. In [4] a new version of Perona and Malik was proposed by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel:

                         where G is a Gaussian of standard deviation σ and ⁎ denotes the convolution operator. If σ tends to 0, the model becomes unstable since it is reduced to the model of Perona & Malik. In order to avoid the shortcoming of this model developed in [4], Weickert, Ter Harr Romeny, and Viergever [9] proposed an ‘AOS’ scheme in which they introduced a diffusion stopping time parameter that controls the restored image quality. In [10] a new well-posed regularizing method based stable algorithm for image restoration is proposed.

                         controls the anisotropic diffusion. The function g has the same role as in the model of Perona and Malik, namely to limit the spread for strong gradients. One side effects of this equation is ill-suited to noisy uniform areas: indeed, the proposed method tries to follow the edges, even in its absence.

In [11], Whitaker and Pizer mentioned some other illness of the traditional diffusion model. If the diffusion threshold is high, sometimes, sharp transitions tend to dissociate into shorter and clearer segments due to the enhancement effect where some transitions are fractured in half. This phenomenon called staircasing effect. Another drawback associated with the choice of the parameter k is the pinhole effect. It occurs in a transition area interrupted by an intermediate zone where the gradient is less than the threshold k. In the process, the intermediate zone widens and becomes blurred giving this aspect “hole”. This limitation has been introduced and analyzed in [12] and [13]. In [12] a new model of the conduction function is studied in order to reduce these undesirable effects that appear in the model proposed in [3], as illustrated by the following equation:

                         Many other solutions and models have been mentioned in the literature which aims to avoid the ill-posedness of the Perona and Malik model such as in [14].

In this paper, a new approach based new anisotropic diffusion function is developed for better image de-noising and edges and contents preserving. The novel technique has been compared with the original anisotropic diffusion filter of Perona and Malik and other modified anisotropic diffusion schemes, in terms of the improvement of the image quality. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach removes noise and preserves edges and contents more efficiently than other recent techniques proposed in the literature [15–17,23–30] based on a modified model of Perona and Malik.

Anisotropic diffusion is a smoothing process which produces a family of parameterized images, which aims to remove noise while preserving fine details of the studied image, such as edges and other structures that should be preserved in the image. We propose a new diffusivity function for an adaptive smoothing. According to Perona and Malik [3], the conduction function is chosen to be a positive decreasing function that is based on the gradient magnitude. Thus, we tried to develop a new conduction function which favors image smoothing in the homogeneous regions with small gradient and stop the diffusion across edges at or around which the image values undergo a sharp variation.

The simplest version of anisotropic diffusion proposed in [3] aims to remove noise with a constant gradient threshold level and a slow speed of convergence. So, we are looking for a new function with fast convergence and better performance. Therefore, the proposed function has to be faster in the convergence speed and more efficient in noise removal. In addition we look to get the advantage of content and detail preserving. Consequently, the new model must be a circular model which converges faster than the Perona and Malik model.

Consequently, the new model is based on the tangent sigmoid (tansig) function. Mathematically, this function is equivalent to the hyperbolic tangent. It differs in that it is faster. Such function is presented by the graph (Fig. 3
                        ) and the equation as follows:

The proposed new function was found very interesting and presents several advantages detailed as follows:
                           
                              ✓
                              First of all, it is similar to the Perona and Malik model.

Second, its speed is very important, hence it converges faster which allows an opportunity to be well implemented in our de-noising process aiming at reducing image noise without hitting significant parts of the image content such as edges, lines or other details that are important for the image's interpretation.

In this section we present a mathematical study of this diffusion function. This study aims to demonstrate the efficiency and the highlights and improvement of the new model compared to the traditional one. It is based on the representation of the density function, the speed of convergence, starting from the speed in each point, as well as from the slope to the tangent. Finally, we will show the necessity to a finite truncation of the function, from an infinite and continuous representation.

The behavior of the flux function is illustrated in Fig. 5
                           .

As it can be noticed from Fig. 5, the flux function of the proposed model decreases faster. This proves that the processing time of the de-noising process is very rapid and sharp especially when the function reaches the value of zero which means that we are processing near details and edges. Consequently, the protection of the edges and the contents of the image during the diffusion process are assured. Nevertheless, using the Perona and Malik model as well as the model

                           , the image smoothing still available which can blur the edges. In Fig. 6
                           , we show the diffusion coefficients and the flux function calculated based on the gradient of ‘Cameraman’ image in 2 directions [
                              N
                              ,
                              E
                           ]. It's clear that the coefficients near the edges are lower than the other which refer to homogeneous areas. A zoom section is presented to show how vary these coefficients.

As we mentioned previously the speed of convergence is higher than the other cited models. Consequently, the processed f can be used for a real time implementation and a rabbit filtering process. This rapidity is examined in Fig. 7
                           . Fig. 7a illustrates the behavior illustrating the decreasing speed profile of the proposed function compared with other recent functions [3] and [12]. The new function converges faster than the traditional models of Perona and Malik as well as the cited model

                            which proves that the magnitude of the proposed function is the nearest to zero and then faster than [3] and [12].

The value of x determines the graphical position of the function that tells us how quickly the new function is changing. It is clear from the figure and the following values

                            It is interesting to note that a function may not be equal to its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series converges at every point. And the raising of the Taylor series's order can let it to diverge, that's why we need to truncate the function in order to be representable through a matrix.

Thus, in our case the filter has infinite support and it must be truncated to a finite window (
                              3
                              ×
                              3
                           ). That's why we should approximate the function by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series in order to better illustrate its convergence. Fig. 10
                            shows the behavior of the Taylor series of the proposed model compared to P&M. It is well observed that the agreement between the Taylor series and the new function is meaningful (Fig. 10b) in which the Taylor series follows the innovative model and it diverges after the point (
                              x
                              =
                              40.06
                           ) but in the case the Perona & Malik function, the Taylor series diverge faster around 
                              x
                              =
                              23.1
                            (Fig. 10a).

The diffusion process is authorized for low gradient's values with a high diffusion coefficient and it is limited for high values by a weak coefficient in order to protect the image content. We will precede a new scheme, which we called ‘Successive Anisotropic Filtering SAF’, for image de-noising using the proposed function. In the first step, we applied a diffusion process in which the coefficient diffusion's computation is based on the image gradient magnitude. In the second step, the diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Laplace operator of the image obtained in the first step.

Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model by computing some criteria such as the MSE, PSNR and the MSSIM criteria of the restored images. In addition to these quantitative measures, we illustrate the good performance of the new technique by displaying many filtered images in order to evaluate the new method psycho-visually.

The new image filtering process is described in Fig. 11
                        , where the diffusion coefficients are computed based on these functions

The gradient threshold parameter k is an important parameter in which depends the anisotropic diffusion that why it must be well selected taking in consideration the best quality of the smoothed image. It is optimized for each studied image. We vary the value of k and the value of the thresholding parameter leads to the higher PSNR value.

The optimization of k is performed for each iteration number. After selecting the maximal PSNR, we compare all the PSNR results then we select the higher PSNR. Finally we attribute kappa_opt. The example in Fig. 12
                        a, illustrates that for one iteration, we have kappa_opt = 12. The variation of the threshold parameter with the number of iterations of a synthetic image is figured in Fig. 12b.

For many images, Table 1
                         shows the optimum value of the threshold parameter related to the iterations.

The next section is devoted to presenting the results obtained through the proposed algorithm. Comparisons with recent works based on the anisotropic diffusion have proved the efficiency of the new scheme.

In this section, we present and discuss the various results given by the new anisotropic denoising algorithm. To evaluate its performance, we tested it using synthetic and natural images and compared the results with other existing algorithms. This comparison is based on the computation of the peak signal to noise ratio PSNR, and the structural similarity MSSIM and the correlation measure. All these used measures are in favor of the proposed anisotropic model in image de-noising and edge preserving.

Many experiments are recorded in order to show the important contribution of the new anisotropic diffusion function. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we first experiment with synthetic images. We apply the new scheme to a synthetic test image illustrated in Fig. 13

The psycho-visual comparison of the restored image shows the efficiency of the proposed anisotropic technique to remove the noise while keeping the edges and the borders visible, against the traditional Perona and Malik model. Table 2
                         shows clearly the performances of the developed algorithm.


                        Fig. 14
                         shows the de-noising power of different nonlinear anisotropic filters on a synthetic image to which Gaussian noise is added with a standard deviations 
                           σ
                           =
                           0.025
                        . By comparing the contents preservation, it can be seen that the proposed approach gives better result than P&M which blurs the edges.

The efficiency of the new proposed technique is shown by the visual observation in Fig. 14, which proves better noise reduction and edges preservation.

A very good performance of the proposed algorithm for denoising synthetic images is obtained compared to the original model of Perona and Malik.

The proposed smoothing technique was also applied to some natural images. Fig. 15
                            demonstrates the results of the de-noising technique of Perona & Malik and the proposed technique. The image is corrupted by a Gaussian noise (variance: 
                              
                                 
                                    σ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              =
                              10
                           , 
                              
                                 iterations
                              
                              =
                              19
                           ).

The proposed ‘SAF’ method exhibits greater performance in both noise removing and contents conservation. The proposed technique outperforms the original Perona & Malik anisotropic diffusion. PM suppresses noise but it destroys the most important details in the image (Fig. 15). The high quality of the filtered image is shown by the measures of the PSNR, correlation and the MSSIM (Table 3
                           ). These measures are compared with different methods in the literature [3] and [15–17].

Many other experiments are recorded and show the superiority of the proposed model. In the next figure (Fig. 16
                           ), we present the filtered images, it can be seen that the developed model is very efficient than the other, so that intra-regions in the image become smoothed while edges of inter-regions are preserved.

This simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a stable and efficient image processing tool, as it is illustrated by the evaluation criteria measures in Table 4
                           .

Similarly, in Fig. 17
                           , where Gaussian noise was added to the house image, the proposed smoothing technique using the new diffusion function performs better than the other technique.

The results shown in Fig. 17 reveal that the proposed method can perform the other techniques in terms of the capacity to reduce noise while keeping the high structures in the image. In addition to that, the numerical results based on the PSNR and MSSIM (Table 5
                           ), on various images, shows that the new technique performs well than the Perona & Malik model and the technique proposed in [18]. The images are degraded by Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation 
                              
                                 
                                    σ

                           . The quantitative difference between the proposed model and the other models is represented by the

                            and 
                              
                                 
                                    Error
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           .

The next experiment is done in order to demonstrate the improved performance of the new algorithm. We compared its efficiency with other existing algorithms [3] and [19–22]. The images are corrupted by additive Gaussian noise with a standard deviation 
                              σ
                              =
                              25
                           . The results of the PSNR show the improvement of the proposed model. This improvement is inspected from the good quality of the smoothed image Fig. 18
                            which is related to the important PSNR values (Table 6
                           ).

In these simulations, higher PSNR value indicates the optimum denoising capability of the proposed model compared to the presented methods.

In Fig. 19
                           , we expose a comparison based on the PSNR measures of the proposed scheme with the BM3D algorithm [23] for image denoising; the good performance of the new technique is well achieved.

In the case of Table 7
                           , where Gaussian noise with standard deviation = 30 was added to the images, a comparative study with recent works TV [24], GVF [25], INGVF [26] and CONVEF [27] models, was accomplished. This comparison is based on the values of the PSNR, MSSIM, the iteration number as well as the time of the filtering process. The out performance of the proposed anisotropic model is revealed.


                           Table 8
                            shows the values of PSNR, MSSIM and the iterations number of the filtering process. It can be seen that the investigated model has the largest value of PSNR and MSSIM, as well as the least iteration number of the other three models. The noise is removed more rapidly and the details and the content of the image are preserved more effectively.


                           Fig. 20
                            and Fig. 21
                            show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to preserve the edges, texture and the basic details of the image. In this case, we display the image difference between the original and the filtered image. The proposed algorithm is applied to the original image Lena. It's clear that the geometrical structure are preserved which reveals that the new function tends to disappear close to the edges and details of the image. Consequently, the details are preserved and kept intact. Table 9
                            illustrates the mean square error (MSE) of some denoised images, comparing the new algorithm with different recent technique such as Non-Local-means algorithm (NL-means) [30] and others techniques in use [3,24,28] and [29]. The proposed algorithm achieves smaller mean square error than the other techniques which prove the efficiency of the proceeded scheme and the high quality of the recovered image. The energy dispersed by the filtering process is lower than this eliminated by the other methods.

To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm based on the new anisotropic diffusion function, we report in this section some filtering results related to color images. Fig. 22
                            and Table 10
                            summarize these results. It can be observed from Fig. 22 that the details and the borders are entirely and fully preserved. Table 10 manifests that the filtering process based the new function outperform the C-BM3D algorithm.

The whole presented results of synthetic as well as natural Grayscale or color images prove the efficiency of the proposed anisotropic diffusion scheme which allows obtaining high quality of filtered images in a short time.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new anisotropic diffusion technique is targeted for noise reduction and edges preserving, has been proposed in this paper. We presented a new scheme based on the gradient and the Laplacian operator in order to keep the high quality of the restored image. The threshold parameter was optimized in order to preserve the content and the most important details in the image. Many comparisons are developed to show the efficiency of the proposed technique not only for synthetic and textured images but also for natural images including Grayscale and color category.

Many cropping and zooms are given in the experimental section to provide better judgments. Also, the PSNR, MSE, iteration number and the computational time are provided in comparison tables gathering the quantitative values of the proposed technique compared with many recent techniques in use. For psycho-visual evaluation, various restored images are given and prove very well the outperformance of the new technique to remove noise and preserve edges content and details.
