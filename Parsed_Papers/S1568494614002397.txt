                  In this paper, a performance-based optimal seismic design of steel frames is presented utilizing Charged System Search (CSS) optimization. This meta-heuristic optimization algorithm has been recently developed and employed in many optimization problems showing a high capability in structural optimization. Here, a pushover analysis method based on semi-rigid connection concept is employed as analysis and design method. Two numerical examples which have been previously considered in literature are studied and the results illustrate significant improvement in structural weight compared to the conventional design methods. The capabilities of the CSS are compared to those of the ACO and GA.
