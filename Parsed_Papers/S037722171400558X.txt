                  The prevalence of intermediaries (middlemen) in supply chains is often seen as a dying remnant of less efficient times. Despite predictions that supply chains will rapidly “cut out the middleman” as technological advances have eased logistics, middlemen have continued to thrive. In this paper, we demonstrate a transaction role of middlemen that may help clarify their staying power. In a model with self-interested decision-making by both a manufacturer and a retailer, wherein incentive misalignment creates investment and production inefficiencies, we show that the integrated (first-best) outcome can be achieved with simple cost-based contracts if and only if a middleman is present. We further show that the approach of utilizing a middleman to fully coordinate the supply chain is robust in that it can be applied to a variety of circumstances discussed in the literature, including multilateral investment/effort choices, multiple product providers, and logistical investments made by the middleman.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supply chains typically include intermediaries, such as factoring firms, third and fourth party logistics providers, wholesalers, brokers, agents, and even coordinating divisions within firms. A common explanation for the existence of such intermediaries is that they fulfill a transactional role by reducing search and matching costs, providing inventory and capacity, or aggregating supply/demand to achieve economies of scale. Another explanation highlights the novel expertise of intermediaries in collecting and interpreting data thereby reducing information asymmetry concerns.

As technological advances have seemingly neutralized some of these natural advantages, many have predicted the imminent demise of such “middlemen”, pointing to a coming era of supply chain disintermediation. As Anderson and Anderson (2002, p. 53), note, however, intermediaries have survived, even thrived: “The internet was supposed to bring manufacturers into direct contact with end customers in a ruthlessly efficient world that left no room for middlemen. But the opposite is occurring.” In this vein, Belavina and Girotra (2012) also recognize the “phenomenal growth of supply chain intermediaries.” As a notable example they discuss the case of Li & Fung Ltd., an entity that primarily serves an interface between multiple suppliers and retailers and whose client list includes Levis, Marks & Spencer, Phillip Morris, Target, Walmart, and Zara.


                     Belavina and Girotra (2012) provide a clever rationale for the use of such intermediaries: they enable rapid adjustment of supplier base to meet changing buyer needs while ensuring suppliers act as if they were facing long-term sourcing commitments. This paper presents a complementary view that also supports the continued strength of supply chain middlemen. We show that even if middlemen do not have any unique skills or information, they can still improve supply chain efficiency by helping to coordinate a supply chain that suffers from incentive misalignment.

To elaborate, we consider the canonical problem of two-sided self-interest between a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer undertakes non verifiable investments that can reduce its marginal production cost. Under simple per-unit pricing contracts between the supply chain participants, if the unit price paid to the manufacturer is equal to marginal cost, it of course removes any incentives to curtail such costs. If, however, the contract entails a markup that restores investment incentives, such a markup also limits procurement incentives of the retailer. That is, the supply chain suffers from the usual tradeoff between alleviating hold-up upstream and reducing double-marginalization downstream. The end result is that self-interested behavior by the supply chain participants precludes full coordination under simple unit pricing arrangements such as wholesale price and cost-plus (e.g., Klein, Crawford, & Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1979; Bajari & Tadelis, 2001; Cachon, 2003); this is true even if such cost-contingent variable charges are deployed in conjunction with fixed transfer payments as part of familiar two-part tariff arrangements.

Our key insight is that when disintegration of a supply chain creates incentive conflicts, these conflicts can be resolved with further disintegration, i.e., the introduction of a middleman. In particular, we show that adding a middleman to the manufacturer–retailer relationship can achieve the integrated (first-best) outcome with simple linear cost-based contracts. Importantly, the model is constructed so that the middleman offers no other benefit – he does not provide better monitoring, improve contracting contingencies, or increase the value of the good through effort. Intuitively, efficient trade can be induced when the per-unit fee charged by the middleman to the retailer is such that the retailer bears the good’s actual marginal cost. By making the retailer internalize supply chain costs, the contract ensures that the retailer procures the efficient quantity of units. With a cost-plus contract between the manufacturer and the middleman, the manufacturer’s payoff is proportional to the markup times the traded quantity. In this case, the manufacturer does not have direct incentives to cut costs (he is reimbursed for all costs), but does have an indirect incentive, because cutting costs boosts the traded quantity. A judiciously chosen markup can then ensure efficient effort choice. Of course, fixed payments between the parties can then allocate the increase in expected surplus across all three parties.

The contractual arrangement we identify exhibits an interesting feature in that the middleman may engage in below-invoice pricing, i.e., he purchases the good from the manufacturer paying a markup per unit while selling it to the retailer below his own per unit purchase price. Although below-invoice pricing is common in a variety of industries (e.g., automobiles; groceries), it is usually viewed as a strategy to drive away competition and, thus, often raises concerns of regulators. Our model notes an upside to below-invoice pricing in that it can be an integral part of ensuring coordination and efficiency of the supply chain.

While our model focuses on the role of an intermediary in alleviating incentives of a single supplier and retailer, a prominent role for middlemen in practice is in consolidating goods of multiple suppliers. With this in mind, we demonstrate that our key results persist if the middleman has to coordinate multiple manufacturers each of whom can reduce its own costs through unverifiable effort. The middleman can again restore incentives with simple unit pricing so that the integrated outcome can be achieved. That is, the retailer purchases the bundle from the middleman at marginal cost per unit, while the middleman purchases the individual goods from various suppliers at a cost-plus markup.

We also extend the analysis to incorporate efforts by the middleman and retailer, and to reflect investment spillovers (the manufacturer’s investment can increase demand and/or the retailer’s investment can reduce cost). Though previous work has shown that solutions that can achieve the first-best outcome do not necessarily work or have to be adjusted in fundamental ways in the presence of non-verifiable efforts and/or investment spillovers (e.g., Che & Hausch, 1999; Che & Chung, 1999; Cachon, 2003; Schweizer, 2006), we demonstrate that our coordination contract is remarkably robust even allowing perfect coordination in case of cross investments.

Broadly stated, our paper provides support for simple and commonly used contracts in conjunction with a middleman by showing that the integrated outcome can be attained with a middleman, but not without one. In contrast, previous literature on such coordination problems has shown that judicious, but not necessarily simple, contracts between the buyer and supplier when used with a deliberately designed renegotiation process can achieve coordination (e.g., Chung, 1991; Aghion, Dewatripont, & Rey, 1994; Nöldeke & Schmidt, 1995; Edlin & Reichelstein, 1996; Plambeck & Taylor, 2007; Taylor & Plambeck, 2007a). The theoretical advances come with the caveat that proposed mechanisms may not be common in practice; as noted by Schmitz (2002, p. 178): “the fact that there exists a bargaining game such that the first best is achieved does not guarantee that in real life contractual parties will actually always play this particular game.” Similarly, Plambeck and Taylor (2007) and Taylor and Plambeck (2007a, 2007b) show that efficient supply chain coordination can be achieved in a long-term supply chain relationship through informal agreements, i.e., relational contracts, which do not require the verification of realized costs. However, crucial for this result is that the supply chain relationship exhibits an infinite horizon and is linked to specific off-equilibrium beliefs.

Our paper is related to work showing that a third party can restore efficiency for moral hazard problems in teams (Holmstrom, 1982), adverse selection with correlated types (Mcafee & Reny, 1992), and incomplete contracting models with message games and renegotiation (Baliga & Sjostrom, 2009). Our paper is also related to the scarce but emerging literature on the role of a third party mitigating coordination problems of decentralized supply chains (e.g., Hanany, Tzur, & Levran, 2010; Belavina & Girotra, 2012; Bakshi, Adida, & Demiguel, 2013). While these works analyze problems in the absence of moral hazard, our paper adds this critical element to extend this line of inquiry.

In the context of the familiar newsvendor problem, the supply chain literature has documented instances of failures when simple wholesale price contracts are utilized. In response, the literature has turned to more elaborate contractual arrangements to help restore a reasoned degree of efficiency (e.g., Pasternack, 1985; Moorthy, 1987; Lariviere & Porteus, 2001; Taylor, 2002; Cachon & Lariviere, 2005; see Cachon, 2003 for an excellent review). Taking its cue from this literature, this paper too first documents the drawback of simple contracts in a setting where trade and investment incentives provide opposing pulls. But rather than proceeding along the lines of adding complexity, our paper takes a different approach by seeking to boost the efficiency of the simple contractual scheme itself by adding a middleman.

Previous literature has studied the effect of middlemen on search and trading behavior (e.g., Rubinstein & Wolinsky, 1987; Biglaiser, 1993; Gehrig, 1993; Yavas, 1996; Rust & Hall, 2003; Masters, 2007, 2008). Middlemen can have advantages in that they can meet users with a higher frequency; have better information, higher expertise, or better reputation; can bundle risk; can reduce delivery distance and costs; or can hold inventories of varied types of goods (e.g., Kalai, Postlewaite, & Roberts, 1978; Biglaiser, 1993; Li, 1998; Johri & Leach, 2002; Shevchenko, 2004; Smith, 2004; Watanabe, 2010). To isolate the unique effects of the middleman in our analysis, we intentionally exclude these benefits of intermediaries, restricting attention only to their contracting role.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the basic model. Section 3 presents the results; Section 3.1 presents the coordinated supply chain outcome; Sections 3.2 and 3.3 study the outcomes without and with a middleman; and Section 3.4 studies extensions.

                     −
                     q]q, with β reflecting the uncertain demand intercept. Without loss of generality, higher values of α and β are viewed as positive news, i.e., c
                     
                        α
                     (a,

                     (q,
                     β)>0.

Following previous literature (e.g., Hart, 1995; Edlin & Reichelstein, 1996), we study the following sequence of events. First, the manufacturer and the retailer agree on a pricing schedule, with t(c) denoting the per-unit transfer paid by the retailer to the manufacturer given realized cost c. Next, the manufacturer privately chooses upfront a non-verifiable effort level under uncertainty. For example, the manufacturer’s effort can be interpreted as investment in R&D or time spent on generating human and process capital (designing the production process) that subsequently lowers the per-unit cost of manufacturing the good. Prior to procurement and conversion, the uncertain parameters α and β are realized and privately observed by the manufacturer and retailer, respectively. Though these parameters (and the underlying effort choice) are not universally observed, the ensuing unit cost c(a,
                     α) is tracked by the accounting system and thus publicly verifiable. Subsequently, the retailer orders q units for a payment of qt(c), after which the profits are realized.

The sequence of events is summarized in Fig. 1
                     .

The issue we confront in this paper is whether a unit-pricing contract tied to the verifiable cost can be arranged so as to yield efficient (first-best) supply chain outcomes. For the most part, we abstract from the particulars of the negotiation process, since fixed transfers can be used to dictate how the surplus generated by any cost-based contract is shared.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Before evaluating the extent of the supply chain coordination problem and the role of a middleman in alleviating that problem, we first detail the first-best outcome that would arise absent both self-interest and private information issues. That is, what decisions would the manufacturer and retailer make if they each cared only about maximizing supply chain value and had access to all relevant information (i.e., a, α, and β) in doing so? In effect, the coordinated supply chain value reflects the surplus generated by a vertically integrated entity.

Given realized values of the uncertain parameters, the supply chain value (surplus) is:

The first-best solution in the Lemma exhibits intuitive features. First, efficient production simply reflects the standard balancing of marginal revenues from additional quantities, R
                        
                           q
                        (q,
                        β), with marginal costs, c(a,
                        α)+
                        k. The manufacturer’s effort term too equates marginal costs, v′(a), and marginal benefits, −E
                        
                           α,β
                        {q

                        α,
                        β)c

                        (a,
                        α)}. The marginal benefits term for the manufacturer captures the expected reduction in costs due to a marginal increase in its effort, with the computation done at the sure-to-follow efficient quantity levels. We assume the solution to the first-order conditions in the Lemma, the integrated outcome, is unique and interior, q
                        ∗(α,
                        β)>0 and a
                        ∗
                        >0. (If instead a
                        ∗
                        =0, our supply chain problem reduces to the canonical single-stage production problem that can be coordinated with a transfer payment that equals marginal cost as in Hirshleifer (1956)).

Using the solution from the Lemma in the expression for supply chain surplus in (1), and taking expectations, yields the coordinated supply chain value.

We now derive the outcome when the supply chain participants act in their own interest. With self-interest, the incentive problem is apparent – the manufacturer chooses effort with a focus only on its profits and the quantity decision made by the retailer is driven by t(c), what it has to pay to procure the products, not c, the actual cost incurred in making the products.

Working backwards, given t(c), the self-interested retailer procures quantity to solve:

                        (·) from (5), simply reflects the impact of the effort due to the change in the retailer’s quantity decision. Comparing the optimality conditions in (5) and (7) with those presented in the Lemma is key to isolating the impact of self-interest on supply chain coordination. From (5) and Lemma (a), the retailer will choose efficient quantities if and only if t(c)=
                        c – after all, such a choice ensures the retailer internalizes precisely the supply chain’s cost of production and conversion. However, the downside of this choice is that it makes the manufacturer’s effort level inefficient – with t(c)=
                        c, so t(c)=1, the right-hand-side of (7) equals 0, so a
                        =0. This is consistent with intuition. A manufacturer who is reimbursed exactly for cost has no incentive to undertake costly investments to curtail costs.

In effect, the discord in the supply chain implies the optimal t(c) solution that solves (5) and (7) cannot possibly eliminate both quantity and effort distortions; rather it balances the two frictions. For sake of comparison, this result is formally noted in Proposition 2.
                           Proposition 2
                           
                              In the absence of a middleman, no pricing schedule, t(c), can achieve the coordinated outcome, so supply chain value is strictly less than Π

                        Proposition 2 is in line with previous findings (e.g. Klein et al., 1978; Bajari & Tadelis, 2001). From a broad perspective, the proposition is also related to Holmstrom (1982) impossibility theorem that a balanced sharing rule cannot induce the Pareto efficient outcome in a pure team setting with moral hazard. The key for Proposition 2 is that the retailer is able to exploit resolution of cost uncertainty when ordering its quantity. If either (i) purchases were made in advance of information resolution or (ii) there were no uncertainty in the first place, the buyer and seller could make use of a unit transfer fee equal to the “standard cost” based on the optimal effort level. In the latter case, the retailer determines the optimal quantity, q
                        
                           e
                        (a
                        ∗,
                        β), according to R
                        
                           q
                         (q,
                        β)=
                        c(a
                        ∗)+
                        k. The quantity does not depend on the cost uncertainty and depends on the anticipated manufacturer’s effort level. The transfer payment, t
                        =
                        c(a
                        ∗), provides the manufacturer with the correct incentives to reduce his cost. That is, the manufacturer selects his level of effort according to: Max
                           a
                         
                        E
                        
                           β
                        {q
                        
                           e
                        (a
                        ∗,
                        β)[c(a
                        ∗)−
                        c(a)]−
                        v(a)}, yielding the first-best effort level: −E
                        
                           β
                        {q
                        
                           e
                        (a
                        ∗,
                        β)c
                        
                           a
                        (a)}=
                        v′(a). A similar outcome obtains in the case where purchases have to be made without information resolution. With uncertain costs and the ability to condition quantities on them, however, an upfront determination of the “standard cost” is not possible without introducing information loss when the retailer makes quantity choices, since such choices would only reflect standard cost and not the information gleaned since the standard was established. Using actual cost permits incorporating information into production choices, but as previously discussed invariably distorts the incentives of either the manufacturer or the retailer.

As a corollary, we note that the commonly utilized two-part tariff schemes (fixed transfer coupled with a variable charge per unit) are ineffective in resolving coordination concerns when both appropriate trade level and effort choices are issues. The proof follows immediately from the fact that the inclusion of a fixed transfer has no bearing on either the retailer’s quantity decision in (6) nor the manufacturer’s effort choice in (7).
                           Corollary 1
                           
                              In the absence of a middleman, two-part tariff schemes fail to achieve the coordinated outcome.
                           

The previous sections establish that a move away from vertical integration to separation wherein upstream and downstream entities trade in self-interest is detrimental to the supply chain. This might suggest that still further separation – introducing an intermediary – will only worsen supply chain distortions. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that actually the reverse is true and, in fact, the introduction of a middleman can restore supply chain efficiency. Such coordination gains arise despite the fact that the middleman does not engage in monitoring or in writing elaborate contracts or in spurring parties to renegotiate. Rather, the natural ability of the middleman to contract separately with upstream and downstream parties is alone sufficient to achieve coordination, resulting in gains for all parties when the surplus is shared via fixed transfers. Moreover, the efficiency-inducing contracts are particularly simple as they take the form of cost-based transfers plus judicious markups as warranted.

Formally, suppose the supply chain adds a middleman that is tasked with shipping and processing the products and, thus, incurs the k-cost; the retailer’s sole focus is on selling the products. Notice the formulation provides no apparent cost savings and seemingly only adds an unwanted layer of bureaucracy. Also, in line with the previous section, the contracts continue to be cost-based. In particular, denote the per-unit transfer from the middleman to the upstream manufacturer by t
                        
                           u
                        (c), and the transfer from the downstream retailer to the middleman by t
                        
                           d
                        (c). The question is: does there exist a contracting arrangement, {t
                        
                           u
                        (c),
                        t
                        
                           d
                        (c)}, that can fully coordinate the supply chain?

Again, using backward induction, (8) and (9) present the retailer’s problem and its first-order condition for quantity choice, respectively. Denoting the quantity choice of (9) by q(t
                        
                           d

                        β), the manufacturer’s effort problem and the associated first-order condition are noted in (10) and (11), respectively.

A quick glance establishes that the first-order condition in (11) is similar to that in (7) but for the fact that the traded quantity, q(t
                        
                           d
                        (·),
                        β), depends on the downstream transfer payment while the reimbursement from the middleman to the manufacturer may well be a different amount.

The intuition for the construction is crisp. By charging the retailer the marginal cost of production and conversion, the middleman ensures that quantity decisions are efficient. Further, the middleman structures a markup that suitably incentivizes the manufacturer to choose the surplus-maximizing effort. By cutting costs, the manufacturer can boost quantities procured and, thus, his profits.

A note on the middleman’s profits is also in order. The middleman procures each unit for

                                    m
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                           
                        , incurs additional cost of k, and sells it for c
                        +
                        k. For small k (say k
                        =0), this necessarily entails below-invoice pricing. Of course, given the boost in overall supply chain value, fixed payments (including subsidies and/or holdbacks) can be structured to ensure that all parties, including the middleman, benefit and prefer to participate.

To elaborate, consider, for example, the familiar case of Nash bargaining (Myerson, 1991). A reason for the popularity of this axiomatic approach is that it permits a tractable characterization of the equilibria while avoiding an explicit detailing of the specific bargaining process. To begin with, denote the supply chain profit in the absence of the middleman by Π
                        
                           ϕ
                         which, from Proposition 2, is strictly less than Π
                        ∗; thus, Π
                        
                           ϕ
                        /2 is the status quo payoff for the manufacturer and retailer, respectively, i.e., each receives an equal split of supply chain profit if bargaining with the middleman fails. With the middleman included, suppose the upstream manufacturer and the downstream retailer upfront make fixed payments of T
                        
                           u

                           d
                        , respectively, to the middleman; the per-unit transfers are again labeled t

                           d

The intuition behind the per-unit payments follows from the fact that the Nash bargaining solution is assured of achieving the first-best solution, and the unit transfer payments in Proposition 3 achieve this solution. The role of the fixed transfers is then to split the efficient surplus amongst the participants accounting for their status quo payoffs. From (17), the manufacturer and the retailer each receive their status quo payoff plus an equal share of the increase in surplus associated with the use of the middleman, i.e., both of these parties receive Π

                           ϕ
                        ]/3. The middleman’s status quo payoff is 0 and, thus, he receives [Π
                        ∗
                        −

                        ]/3 under the above scheme. Thus, under Nash bargaining, the addition of the middleman provides Pareto gains.

In this subsection, we note that a prominent activity for a middleman in practice is to interact and coordinate multiple upstream providers in order to meet needs of downstream clients. While our base model includes only a single manufacturer, the proposed transfer scheme extends naturally to a setting with multiple manufacturers which, for sake of simplicity, face separable cost functions. In this instance, the middleman simply charges the retailer the (actual) aggregate cost to ensure efficient production. And, stepping back, efficient efforts entail a cost markup that is tailored to each manufacturer. This ensures that all manufacturers are suitably incentivized.

The base setting was intentionally constructed so that the middleman brought no obvious skills to the table, yet proved instrumental in coordinating the supply chain. In practice, intermediaries often specialize in providing logistical support and themselves invest to reduce processing and shipping costs. The precise extent of these investments too is subject to moral hazard, and incorporating this feature places an extra burden on transfers: incentivizing appropriate effort from the middleman. Another practical aspect missed by the base setting is the issue of downstream investments. After all, akin to the cost cutting initiatives taken by the manufacturer, the retailer is also often capable of boosting revenue through (unverifiable) investments in marketing and advertising (e.g., Hart, 1995; Edlin & Reichelstein, 1996). In this section, we extend the model to include investment choices made at all three tiers – upstream, middleman, and downstream.

Formally, let u(e) and w(b) denote the personal cost (investment) incurred by the middleman (who chooses e) and retailer (who chooses b), respectively. The personal costs are each increasing and convex in the underlying effort, so u(e) and w(b) satisfy the same properties as the manufacturer’s cost v(a). The effect of the middleman’s effort is to reduce conversion and processing costs, now denoted k(e), k(e)=

                           >0 measures the sensitivity of conversion costs to the middleman’s effort. In similar vein, the revenue function is now denoted by R(q,
                           β)+
                           rqb, with r
                           >0 denoting the sensitivity of revenues to the retailer’s effort.

Following the same rationale as in Section 3.1, the coordinated supply chain outcome is determined as follows:

The above outcome can again be achieved by a supply chain comprising of self-interested participants but only if a middleman is employed. The next proposition lists the pricing schedule that provides all parties with appropriate effort incentives while ensuring that the quantity decision too is efficient.

                                          With effort by all parties, the presence of a middleman, in conjunction with a judicious pricing schedule can again achieve the coordinated outcome.
                                       


                                          The coordinating pricing schedule with a middleman can be characterized as:
                                       


                                          For each unit the middleman procures from the manufacturer, he pays a markup over cost, i.e.,

A few observations are in order. The retailer’s payment, t
                           
                              d
                           (c), depends on the middleman’s efficient level e
                           ∗, so there is no need for e to be observable. Under t
                           
                              d
                           (c), the retailer is made the residual claimant fully internalizing the supply chain’s cost and benefits. This ensures the retailer’s effort and quantity decisions are efficient. The middleman, in turn, chooses e to maximize [t
                           
                              d
                           (c)−
                           t
                           
                              u
                           (c)−(K
                           −
                           ηe)]q
                           
                              e
                           (a,
                           e,
                           b,
                           α,
                           β)−
                           u(e), yielding the first-order condition under the coordinated solution in (18). Stepping back in the supply chain, the positive markup in (14) ensures that the manufacturer does not under- or overinvest.

As before, the payoff of each supply chain participant is concave in its choice variables. The one added issue here is to confirm that the choice of (a
                           ∗,
                           e
                           ∗,
                           b
                           ∗) by the supply chain participants is the unique solution. Since t
                           
                              d
                           (c) and t
                           
                              u
                           (c) are independent of e, the middleman’s effort problem does not interact with the other parties, and so uniqueness essentially reduces to checking if the manufacturer and retailer effort choices comprise a unique best response, i.e., the manufacturer and retailer reaction functions, a(b) and b(a), respectively, intersect just once. Taking suitable derivatives of the first-order conditions of the manufacturer and the retailer’s problems, it can be verified that ∂a(b)/∂b
                           <0 and ∂b(a)/∂a
                           >0, guaranteeing uniqueness.

One final note. In the settings examined so far the manufacturer and the retailer make investments that provide each with direct benefits: the manufacturer’s effort reduces its expected costs and the retailer’s effort increases its expected benefits. In practice, one party’s investments may have positive spillovers for other supply chain participants. A manufacturer’s investment may boost product quality which translates into consumers being willing to pay more for the retailer’s goods. Suppliers may engage in cross investments by sending staff (engineers) to customize parts for buyers (automakers) in design and production (see Che & Chung, 1999 & Che & Hausch, 1999 for excellent examples). As we next see, while such “cross investments” necessitate a careful adjustment of the transfer scheme, they do not derail the gains that arise from employing a middleman.

Consider the case where the manufacturer and retailer engage in cross investments. That is, the setting is as above except that it is the (i) manufacturer’s effort that boosts downstream revenues, so R(q,
                           β)+
                           rqa and (ii) retailer’s effort that cuts upstream cost, so c(b,
                           α) is the realized cost. In this case, the coordinated supply chain outcome is as follows:

The above outcome can be replicated when vertically separated entities comprise the supply chain. As noted in the next proposition, the markup used to provide the manufacturer with incentives in the cross investments case is tied to the impact of its investment on revenues. That is, the manufacturer is motivated to choose appropriate effort recognizing its effort will impact the retailer’s marginal revenues and, thus, the retailer’s demand for its goods.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

It has long been recognized that trade between supply chain participants can suffer from incentive problems that can hamper efficiency. While these problems that stem from disintegrated interests along the supply chain can theoretically be solved with detailed contracts, simple contracts used in practice are often not flexible enough to induce efficient outcomes without pairing with a judiciously designed renegotiation process. In this paper, we demonstrate that if an additional party in the supply chain, a middleman, is present, simple contractual solutions to the problem are readily accessible. Perhaps surprisingly, the conclusion is that when disintegration in a supply chain creates contracting friction, such friction can be relieved with further disintegration. Our finding is reassuring in that it is in line with current practice wherein a variety of traded goods pass through intermediaries, and such arrangements typically employ simple cost-based (or invoice-based) pricing.
