                  In this paper two types of tensor product finite macro-elements are contrasted, the former being the well known Lagrange type and the latter the Bézier (Bernstein) type elements. Although they have a different mathematical origin and seemingly are irrelevant, they both are based on complete polynomials thus sharing the same functional space, i.e. the classes 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      and 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                     . Therefore, from the theoretical point of view it is anticipated that they should lead to numerically identical results in both static and dynamic analysis. For both types of elements details are provided concerning the main computer programming steps, while selective parts of a typical MATLAB® code are presented. Numerical application includes static (Laplace, Poisson), eigenvalue (acoustics) and transient (heat conduction) problems of rectangular, circular and elliptic shapes, which were treated as a single macroelement. In agreement to the theory, in all six examples the results obtained using Bézier and Lagrange polynomials were found to be identical and of exceptional accuracy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During the last 45years, the CAD technology has passed through five main stations, the last being the NURBS representation of surfaces and volumes [1,2]. The first three stations are determined by the names of their founders, which are Coons [3], Gordon [4], and Bézier [5], whereas the fourth is called B-splines [6,7]. For a detailed handbook the reader is referred to Farin et al. [8].

The strong relationship between CAD and CAE was early understood in 1973 by Gordon and Hall [9] and can be also found as a comment in the classical textbook of Zienkiewicz in 1977 [10, pp. 181–182] (“… quite independently the exercises of devising various practical methods of generating curved surfaces for purposes of engineering design led to the establishment of similar definitions by Coons, and indeed today the subjects of surface definitions activity…”). In the decade of 1980s some researchers started dealing with the development of large finite elements based on Coons–Gordon interpolation; for a detailed review the reader is referred to [11–13] and papers therein. Also, the use of B-splines and the most recent NURBS in engineering analysis are reviewed in the textbooks of Höllig [14] and Cottrell et al. [15], respectively. In the particular case of isogeometric elements, useful software aspects have recently appeared [16,17].

Despite the abovementioned progress, there are still some unclear points, from both the theoretical and the programming point of view. For example, it is well known that tensor product Lagrange type finite elements have been extensively used and can be found in all textbooks such as those by Zienkiewicz [10] and Bathe [18]. Nevertheless, it is not perhaps widely known that the aforementioned tensor product based on Lagrange polynomials is a special case in which the Gordon–Coons interpolation degenerates [12, pp. 327–328]. Except of the aforementioned relationship of CAD/CAE character, there is a second one as follows. It is well known that Bézier surfaces are based on tensor products of Bernstein polynomials of the form

                      and does not include the nodal values but nodeless coefficients.

Recently it has been shown that in 1-D problems the Lagrange and Bézier polynomials, as well as the popular p-method [19] lead to the same eigenvalues [20,21], and it is only a matter of basis change [18].

In this context, this paper continues the investigation in 2-D quadrilaterals in both static and time dependent problems. The study reduces to the Galerkin–Ritz formulation.

Potential problems can be categorized into three types: elliptic (Poisson-Laplace), hyperbolic (wave propagation) and parabolic (thermal). Concerning the wave propagation, for the sake of briefness, results will be presented for only the corresponding eigenvalue problem.

Again, with respect to Eqs. (19) and (20), in case of Lagrange polynomials the vector

B-splines implementation in Eqs. (19) and (20) is not a novel task as it has been previously applied by the author [11–13] in the older (Schoenberg’s [6]) formulation, whereas its contemporary (deBoor [7]) general formulation has been presented in a textbook ([14] and papers therein). Therefore, Bézier interpolation, which is a particular case of B-splines

                        Step 4: Computation of matrices.

Second, at each Gauss point, first the Jacobian (xsj) is calculated and then the global derivatives (shp) based on the coordinates of the nodal points produced in Steps 1 and 2.

                        Step 6C: Transient heat conduction. In general, it is possible to apply the trapezoidal rule and derive the general matrix formulation that includes all four, i.e. (i) the forward difference, (ii) Crank–Nicolson, (iii) Galerkin, and (iv) backward difference schemes. For details the reader is referred to [12]. However, since the transient phenomenon is described by a first order differential equation (thus no doubling in the number of equations is required) the MATLAB® ode45 function could be alternatively applied (but in this paper it was not done).

At each Gauss point, the Jacobian is calculated and then the global derivatives based on the nodal coordinates of Steps 1 and 2. This step is similar with Step 4 for Lagrange polynomials; the only difference is that

Therefore, it is obvious that the polynomials used in two successive sides (e.g. AB and BC) are of identical degree, i.e.

                     . In more details, both of them are polynomials of the same degree in 
                        
                           ξ
                        
                      and

                     , in the reference unit square. The main difference is that the Lagrange polynomials refer to the potentials u of the nodal points (and successively take positive and negative values), whereas Bézier–Bernstein ones refer to arbitrary (nodeless) coefficients a (and take only nonnegative values). While a separate Bernstein polynomial is not complete, the series expansion that determines the variable u is. This is somehow similar to the fact that Lagrange polynomials are equivalent to Taylor series expansion, the latter including generalized coefficients as well. A rigorous explanation for the equivalency between Lagrange and Bernstein (Bézier) polynomials is given in Appendix A, while an illustrative example is given in Appendix B.

While the above paragraph is completely understood for a rectangular domain 
                        
                           a
                           ×
                           b
                        
                      where the normalized coordinates are proportional to the Cartesian ones 
                        
                           (
                           ξ
                           =

                     , without having performed numerical experiments, the same is not obvious for curvilinear domains such as a circle or an ellipse. In the two latter specific cases the control points are found outside the problem domain. Nevertheless the results are again found to be identical and of excellent accuracy. It is clarified that the internal mesh (nodes or control points) was based on boundary-only Coons interpolation of either the boundary nodal points or the outer control points that correspond to the boundary, for the Lagrange and Bézier polynomials, respectively.

In the examples tested in this paper it was found that the computations based on Bézier basis were slightly slower than those based on Lagrangian basis. This is due to (i) the slightly increased computer effort to calculate the univariate Bernstein (Bézier) polynomials and due to (ii) the numerical handling of boundary conditions, where a matrix inversion is sometimes needed. Despite this fact, the advantage of the Bézier basis lies on the fact that it is better integrated into a CAD/CAE environment where the user can move the control points to influence the desired shape of the mechanical component under design.

To come to an end, for the first time, in 2005 the author expressed the general idea of replacing the Galerkin/Ritz by implementing a global collocation scheme in conjunction with CAD-based approximation [24], whereas he continued with numerical applications in potential problems under Dirichlet [25] and Neumann [26] boundary conditions, as well as in plane stress elastostatics [27]. Concerning eigenvalue and time response structural analysis, in 2008 he published a couple of papers (for example, [20]) dealing with 1-D problems, where in case of the aforementioned global collocation, Lagrange and Bézier polynomials have lead to identical results. For more details the interested reader may consult a very recent review paper [28], which includes also original results concerning the comparison between Galerkin–Ritz and global collocation formulations. It is worth-mentioning that isogeometric collocation methods were recently presented by others [29].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

It was found that Lagrangian and Bézierian type finite elements are equivalent one another. In the standard unit square they share the same functional space of monomials, i.e. the classes 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 ξ
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      and 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 η
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                     . Despite the fact that Lagrangian elements are based on nodal points (distributed along the boundary and the interior) whereas Bézierian elements are based on control points that are quite different and generally do not coincide with the aforementioned nodal points (neither for the boundary nor for the interior), the obtained numerical results were found to be identical. The theory was successfully tested on six examples as follows. Three examples governed by Laplace and Poisson equation, two examples for the eigenvalue extraction concerning rectangular and circular acoustic cavities, as well as one example for a transient heat conduction problem. It is anticipated that the extension from acoustics to elastodynamics and other types of partial differential operators as well as to three-dimensional problems using either Galerkin/Ritz or collocation procedures will lead to the same conclusion.
