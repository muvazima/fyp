                  Background
                  Graph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Electroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties.
               
               
                  Results
                  Perception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices. For local analysis, efficiency was more discernible than clustering coefficient. Nevertheless, there was no significant discrimination between Chinese traditional and western classical music perception.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Perception of different styles of music introduces different network properties, both globally and locally. Research into both global and local network properties has been carried out in other areas; however, this is a preliminary investigation aimed at suggesting a possible new approach to brain network properties in music perception.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the field of cognition and perception, many studies have investigated the effects of music on brain responses. Some examples of these studies include: comparisons of the similarities and shared processing foundations between music and language [1,2]; assessments of music helping to improve IQ or work efficiency [3–5]; investigations of translating electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms into music [6,7]; and reports on the effects of cultural styles on music perception [8–10]. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were the most studied electrophysiological responses (e.g., P600 responses to cross-cultural expectancy violations [11]). Some recent interesting studies investigating music perception include: observing the musical event-related synchronization/desynchronization phenomenon, classifying EEG responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music [12]; and comparing the network properties of EEG when listening to Guqin music and noise [13]. Network properties can be evaluated with graph theoretical analysis, which has recently been a popular tool in neuroscience since it could reveal the segregation and integration areas of the brain [14,15]. Graph theoretical analysis first became popular for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, and extended to various modalities of brain imaging techniques, such as EEG, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) [16], and magnetoencephalography (MEG) [17], among others. Graph theoretical analysis usually starts with the construction of a network consisting of vertices that are linked by edges. The vertices stand for elementary units, such as cortical areas or channels, while the edges represent associations between vertices. Regarding the associations, there are many choices, for instance, phase coherence, synchronization likelihood and phase lag index (PLI). Various properties can be calculated from the constructed network, such as clustering coefficient (the most elementary measures of local segregation), path length (an index reflecting the overall integration of the network), and efficiency (computed as the average of the inverse of the distance matrix), etc. In most cases, the functional brain would present as a ‘small world’, with a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length, which reflect efficient information spreading, rapid synchronization and low wiring cost [18,19]. However, brain network properties can be affected by many factors, such as age [20], disease [21–25] and alcohol [26], and can reflect different brain activities in different experimental tasks [27–29]. Therefore, graphic analysis is prevalently used to explore the coordination of cortical areas in many medical researches and cognition studies [17,23,30–32].

There are only a few studies that use graph theoretical analysis to investigate brain dynamics related to music perception. Jäncke et al. found that people with absolute pitch tend to have increased degrees, clustering, and local efficiency of functional correlations (fMRI) [33], while Sänger et al. demonstrated that playing duets helped enhance the intra-and-between-brain small-world properties (EEG) [34]. Moreover, Varotto et al. made patients with diseases of consciousness listen to pleasant and unpleasant music, with the aim of discovering the differences of network properties compared with normal individuals (EEG). In the control group (six healthy subjects), an increase in the number of network connections was induced by pleasant music; however, clustering coefficient and path length were not affected by the stimuli. In the patient group (five vegetative state patients), two showed stronger synchronization during the unpleasant condition, and decreased values of clustering coefficient and path length during both musical stimuli [35]. Nevertheless, in regard to the perception of different music styles, there has been no study that uses graph theoretical analysis. In this study, the subjects listened to three styles of music: Chinese traditional, light and western classical music, and EEG data were measured. Because the above-mentioned studies proved that listening to Guqin music changed the brain network properties [13] and other fMRI studies found that different cultural music perception would activate different cortical areas [36], we assumed that processing different styles of music would also affect brain network connectivity properties. To test this hypothesis, graph theoretical analysis was applied. Functional connectivity at different electrodes was estimated using the phase coherence method. The whole brain was modeled as undirected weighted graphs for each subject, and then the network topology was investigated. We analyzed global and local network properties, since both of these are very important in network neuroscience [37]. Many of the previous studies [13,35] only assessed the global properties of network topology. In this study, we looked at the local properties, similar to Xue et al. [38].

@&#METHODS@&#

Ten healthy Chinese male undergraduates, with a mean age of 22.10 years (standard deviation±2.25), participated in the experiment and they were all musically untrained and right handed. All of them were properly paid. During the experiment, the subjects were asked to sit in a comfortable armchair with both arms placed on the hand rests. Chinese traditional, western classical and light music, without lyrics, were presented to the subjects via speakers, with the volume normalized. Each style contained 50 excerpts, which were approximately 16s in length, and the music was played in a random sequence. The subjects were asked to look at the blank screen with a cross in the middle, which would help them to focus their vision.

Fifty-two EEG channels were sampled using NeuroScan SynAmps2™ (Compumedics NeuroScan, Charlotte, NC, USA), with a sampling frequency of 1000Hz, and E-Prime 2® software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA) was used to present the stimuli and synchronize with the sampling software SCAN 4.3™ (Compumedics NeuroScan). For data preprocessing, all the channels were re-referenced to two mastoid channels, namely, M1 and M2. ERPs were cut 150ms before the onset of music and continued 1200ms thereafter, and the baseline was corrected according to the first 150ms. Four channels of electro-oculogram (EOG) were also recorded, which were placed above and below the left eye, and at both canthus. Trials polluted by EOG were deleted, and the remaining data were filtered by a bandpass filter from 0.1Hz to 30Hz. The reference channels were excluded, and 50 channels were retained for network analysis purposes, as shown in 
                        Fig. 1.

We compared phase coherence in the alpha frequency band because of its role in music listening, attention and audition [12,39,40]. For each subject, ERP data were averaged over trials, and then the alpha band was filtered (8–13Hz), denoted as S(n). The analytical signal was

                           ω
                         ranges from 0 to 1; where 0 means uniform distribution of the phase, while 1 stands for strict phase locking. Phase coherence is a classical measure of phase synchronization and is insensitive to the amplitude of the signals, and only depends upon the phase relations between the two signals [41].

In the present study, we regarded brain networks as graph representations of brain activity acquired by ERP data, where the vertices represented channels and the edges described the phase coherence between each pair of channels. The 50×50 correlation matrices were thresholded into a set of undirected weighted graphs with the proportion W of the strongest weights (W ranged from 0.02 to 0.4 with an increment of 0.02). To be specific, 0.02 (2%) the proportional strongest weights were selected, which meant that the remaining 98% of weights, and all weights on the main diagonal (self–self connections) were set to 0. We focused on network properties, including clustering coefficient and path length, at the global level, and clustering coefficient and efficiency at the local level. Clustering coefficients can be calculated according to Onnela et al. [42], as follows:

A path length matrix, which contains the shortest path length between each pair of vertices, can be calculated from the clustering coefficient matrix using Dijkstra׳s algorithm. The characteristic (global) path length is also the mean value of the whole graph.

Efficiency is the average inverse path length, and can be computed for each node as

It has been postulated that the small-world propertied network has many advantages, and the relevant properties could be found in many real networks [43]. Usually, a small-world network is described by two parameters – clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. Specifically, small-world network is usually defined as one network with a high clustering coefficient and a short path length [44], the former property is more comparable to the clustering coefficient of a regular network (characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a long path length), while the latter is similar to the characteristic path length of a random network (characterized by a low clustering coefficient and a short path length). In this study, these two properties were evaluated and compared with those of regular and random networks. The construction of regular and random networks can be referred to Appendix A. The efficiency property is considered at the local level, because it is the harmonic mean distance between one vertex and all others and indicates how much effect the removal of one vertex may have on the path length [45], thus it is more appropriate for the local analysis.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this study, the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and efficiency were all calculated using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox [46]. The former two properties were illustrated as the functions of proportional strongest weights (W), as shown in 
                        Fig. 2, from which it could be concluded that the small-world properties appeared when perceiving light music and western classical music, especially when the proportion of weights in the correlation matrices remained relatively low.

Global measures of integration and segregation belie a rich repertoire of underlying local patterns of connectivity [46]. Thus, it would be intriguing to consider the local properties, that is, to consider the clustering coefficient and efficiency of each node (channel) instead of the mean values of the whole brain network.

For each node, clustering coefficient and efficiency were calculated and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to see whether there were significant differences between different styles of music perception. The proportion of weights was set as 0.02–0.4, with an incremental step of 0.02, which resulted in 20 calculations and comparisons, and was considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.05/3 (Bonferroni correction). Owing to the three music styles, 20 signed rank tests were performed for each run (total=three runs: Chinese traditional vs. light music; Chinese traditional vs. western classical music; and light vs. western classical music), and 
                        Table 1 lists the significant test numbers out of the 60 tests performed. These tests were based on clustering coefficient and efficiency, and the significant numbers were denoted as N(C) and N(E), respectively.

It was already known that for each channel, signed rank tests was 60 times (3 [1 versus 1 music styles] x 20 [proportion of weights]. For the clustering coefficient tests, there were only two relatively prominent channels: F6 and P4, and the significant test numbers were 3 and 4, respectively. The total number of signed rank test was 3000 (60 times multiple of 50 channels) and in the efficiency tests, the significant test numbers occurred 444 times in the right hemisphere and 380 times in the left hemisphere.

One may be curious regarding the significant test result occurrence since there were three runs of tests among the perception of three music styles; each run consisted of 20 tests with weights ranging from 0.02 to 0.4. However, in actual fact, for the tests based on clustering coefficient, eight out of 17 significant results were between Chinese traditional music and light music (denoted as group 1), while there were five out of 17 significant results between light music and western classical music (denoted as group 3). The remaining four significant test results came from test of Chinese traditional music versus western classical music (denoted as group 2). However, as for the tests based on efficiency, no significant test results were observed from group 2. When studying the efficiency in more detail, perception of western classical music and Chinese traditional music generated similar efficiency distributions, as shown in 
                        Fig. 3, which illustrates this for three typical channels.

To investigate the local efficiency distribution further, some extra calculations were also done as follows: for each style of music perception, the efficiency was averaged across 10 subjects first, and then conducted subtraction within 22 pairs of symmetrical channels (FP1–FP2, AF3–AF4, F7–F8, F5–F6, F3–F4, F1–F2, FT7–FT8, FC5–FC6, FC3–FC4, FC1–FC2, T7–T8, C5–C6, C3–C4, C1–C2, TP7–TP8, CP5–CP6, CP3–CP4, CP1–CP2, P7–P8, P5–P6, P3–P4, P1–P2), which resulted in a 20 (proportion of weights) ×22 (pairs) matrix. The last step was to average over the first dimension (20 proportion of weights) and sum the second dimension (22 pairs) up. Finally, the values we got for Chinese traditional music, light music, and western classical music were −0.2059, −0.0111, and −0.3003 respectively. Since it was the left that minus right channels in pairs, the more negative the values were, the more the predominance of the right hemisphere was revealed. What can be concluded from these values is that Chinese traditional and western classical music perception rely more on the right hemisphere, while light music perception showed almost no lateralization. 
                        Fig. 4 can be referred to understand these calculations.

In this study, we assessed the global and local network properties of music perception evoked EEG responses with culturally different styles of music. Results of our study are quite interesting: both global and local network properties change as the styles of musical stimuli change, and we found that the brain manifested small-world properties when perceiving light music and western classical music, especially when the proportion of weights in the correlation matrices remained relatively low. The small-world network properties meant effective neural resource allocation, which seemed contradictory to some studies. An example was that Nan et al. came to the conclusion that unfamiliar music demanded higher attention [36]. And this result was not consistent with the commonsense that perception of foreign (i.e., unfamiliar) music required more attention and neural resources, either. However, in our daily life, college students, even those without music training, are exposed to western classical music frequently, for example, the bell for the beginning and the ending of the lectures, or the music before an English listening test. Thus, ‘foreign’ or ‘unfamiliar’ remains to be discussed, which also leaves room for further research. Moreover, the weights directly reflected thresholding of the network. Some researchers argued that choosing thresholds can be arbitrary [47], and our results proved that different thresholds would generate different results, which should be carefully handled. For local properties, efficiency was more discriminative than clustering coefficient between light music and Chinese traditional or western classical music perception and the right hemisphere had more significantly discriminative channels than the left hemisphere. It was considered that the right hemisphere was processing music, and combined with the clustering coefficient results, the right hemisphere seemed to be more advantageous than the left hemisphere during music perception. However, light music perception showed less lateralization compared with the other two styles. It was acknowledged that the right hemisphere was more specific in processing of pitch-based information, while the time-based information of music was bilaterally processed [48]. It could be possible that because the subjects were all musically untrained, it might have been easier for them to grasp the rhythm of light music, thus resulting in bilateral processing. In addition to the right hemisphere appearing to be more discriminative for music perception, the central area and right parietal area also seemed to exhibit this result. Other studies have also found that the whole right hemisphere increased coherence when loud music was present [49] or music in ‘non-musicians’ was processed in the right temporal–occipital area of the cortex [50]. However, in our study, this led to one shortcoming: without inverse modeling, it was hard to judge which cortical areas were actually activated [41]; and even with the inverse modeling method, the non-unique solution problem is still not avoidable. A solution may be available as Stam et al. and Wu et al. advocated [41,51], in which they applied PLI to assess phase synchronization, which was less affected by the influence from common sources through volume conduction.

Nevertheless, there are several points that still remain controversial. First, in this study, the alpha band was investigated in a way similar to the methods described by Wu et al. [13]. There have also been studies observing other types of frequency bands [34,35]. In other words, which frequency band revealed the functional network connection properties most during music perception has not been agreed on. An alternative answer could be found in research by Wu et al. [51], in which graph analysis was carried out on several frequency bands and significant differences were only found in the alpha2 band. Second, Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis [12] classified the EEG responses to different styles of music, yet, with training labels of liking/disliking; and Jäncke et al. [33] used music stimuli previously rated for emotional valence and arousal instead of different cultural styles. Wu et al. [51] also compared clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths of three Guqin excerpts, and could not find any differences. The authors implied that it could be due to the fact that the styles of music excerpts were very similar. In this study, personal preference rating was lacked. In the future, it would be interesting to combine personal preferences with cultural differences and analyze them simultaneously. Finally, although some other studies used ERPs to do graph theoretical analysis, it is also possible that complex processing involves not only the ERPs but probably the later responses. Hence, for future studies, it would be desirable to include not only the musically untrained but also trained subjects, collecting their subjective ratings, and then analyzing multiple frequency bands and EEG responses that are not just restricted to ERPs. Moreover, a PLI-based graphic analysis is also an option worth trying.

To summarize, our study is preliminary and explorative, focusing not only on the global but also on the local network properties. The preliminary results prove that different styles of music could induce different network properties, and in the future this may be further extended to an intelligent environment recommending music to users or related to the performance of BCI as Zhang et. al. did [52]. Further research still needs to be carried out in order to thoroughly understand network properties when perceiving culturally different styles of music.

Construction of regular and random networks was realized by two functions : randmio_und and latmio_und, which were built within Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT). The regular and random network function randomizes or regularizes an undirected network, while preserving the degree distribution. The functions do not preserve the strength distribution in weighted networks.

The steps of the process of random network generation are as follows:
                           
                              1)
                              Find out the indexes of the nonzero elements, and denote them as [i,j]

Generate random numbers, e1 and e2, e1~=e2
                                    
                                       
                                          a=i(e1), b=j(e1);


                                          c=i(e2), d=j(e2);

it should meet the condition that


                                          a~=[c d] and b~=[c d]

if R(a,d)=0 and R(c,b)=0 , rewire the edges as follows:
                                    
                                       
                                          R(a,d)=R(a,b); R(a,b)=0;


                                          R(d,a)=R(b,a); R(b,a)=0;


                                          R(c,b)=R(c,d); R(c,d)=0;


                                          R(b,c)=R(d,c); R(d,c)=0;

These steps repeated themselves for a number of times, which could be specified by the user. In our case, the rewiring process number was set as 50, and we used this function 20 times. Each time we could get the network properties, such as clustering coefficient and path length or efficiency, and then these property values were averaged by 20.

The regular network function had a similar process except that a ‘distance-to-diagonal’ matrix D was invented.

The generation of D was dependent on n (n=size(R,1)).

For example, if n equals eleven,
