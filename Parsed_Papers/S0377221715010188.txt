@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional skiving stock problem (SSP) which is strongly related to the dual bin packing problem (DBPP). In the classical formulation, 
                        
                           m
                           ∈
                           N
                        
                      different item lengths 
                        
                           
                              l
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              l
                              m
                           
                        
                      with availabilities 
                        
                           
                              b
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              b
                              m
                           
                        
                      are given, the so-called item supply. We aim at maximizing the number of products with minimum length L that can be constructed by connecting the items on hand. Such computations are of high interest in many real world applications, e.g. industrial production processes (see Zak, 2003 for an overview) or politico-economic problems (cf. Assmann, Johnson, Kleitman, & Leung, 1984; Labbé, Laporte, & Martello, 1995). Furthermore, also neighboring tasks, such as dual vector packing problems (Csirik, Frenk, Galambos, & Rinnooy Kan, 1991) or the maximum cardinality bin packing problem (Bruno & Downey, 1985; Peeters & Degraeve, 2006), are often associated or even identified with the dual bin packing problem. These formulations are of practical use as well since they are applied in multiprocessor scheduling problems (Alvim, Ribeiro, Glover, & Aloise, 2004) or surgical case plannings (Vijayakumar, Parikh, Scott, Barnes, & Gallimore, 2013).

The considered optimization problem, for the case 
                        
                           
                              b
                              i
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           (
                           i
                           ∈
                           I
                           :
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           m
                           }
                           )
                           ,
                        
                      was firstly mentioned by Assmann et al. (1984), based on the doctoral thesis (Assmann, 1983), and denoted by dual bin packing problem. Therein, the authors mainly investigate heuristic approaches and provide results regarding the quality and average case behavior of the presented methods. Further contributions, especially in terms of exact approaches to the DBPP, have been studied in Labbé et al. (1995) and Peeters and Degraeve (2006) where two branching algorithms are introduced.

Based on practical preliminary thoughts (Johnson, Rennick, & Zak, 1997), a generalization for larger availabilities 
                        
                           
                              b
                              i
                           
                           ∈
                           N
                           
                           
                              (
                              i
                              ∈
                              I
                              )
                           
                        
                      has been considered in Zak (2003) also motivating the term of skiving stock problem. In that paper, Zak formulates a pattern-oriented model of the SSP with an infinite number of variables and provides first (numerical) results regarding the gap of this optimization problem, i.e., the difference between the optimal values of the continuous relaxation of the SSP and the SSP itself. But to our best knowledge, there are only a few works concerning theoretical aspects.

In this paper, we introduce three new models for the skiving stock problem which only require a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints. Two of them are based on position-indexed and order-indexed approaches that are related to the arcflow and onecut formulations (see Dyckhoff, 1981; Valério de Carvalho, 2002) of the extensively studied one-dimensional cutting stock problem. In contrast to the standard model of Zak (2003), these new models can cope with larger and practical meaningful instances. Additionally, we provide some techniques in order to significantly reduce the total amount of variables and constraints within these two models. For the sake of completeness, the third model refers to the well known Kantorovich approach (Kantorovich, 1939) and is shown to have a weak continuous relaxation and many symmetric solutions. For this purpose, we present an approach to avoid symmetries with the help of additional linear constraints and binary variables.

We provide theoretical and numerical investigations on the relationship of these models and prove, as a main result, the equivalence between the continuous relaxations of the standard model and the new position-indexed and order-indexed formulations.

Throughout this paper, we assume without loss of generality that all input-data are positive integers. Additionally, we expect the item lengths to be smaller than L since each item i ∈ I with li
                      ≥ L already represents a finished product and does not have to be considered within the optimization. Finally, we assume that two items can be connected directly, i.e., without any overlap or an intermediate composite. If, in a certain practical application, this situation is not given from the beginning, we can, depending on the particular case, shorten or extend the item lengths and L obtaining an equivalent skiving stock problem where this third assumption is fulfilled.

The next section deals with the above mentioned standard model (Zak, 2003). Section 3 introduces an arcflow and an onestick model, respectively, and proves their equivalence to Zak’s formulation. Afterwards, we present a model of Kantorovich-type and show how symmetries can be avoided therein. In a final step, we compare all approaches by means of numerical computations, give some conclusions and an outlook of future research.

In the following, we refer to a particular skiving stock problem with given input data as an instance

Note that this model has an infinite number of variables, but in every feasible solution there are only a finite number of nonzero variables. In contrast, the feasible set of the continuous relaxation contains (feasible) solutions with an infinite number of positive x-variables. Therefore, we would like to present a method to obtain a finite formulation of Zak’s model. To this end, only minimal patterns of E are considered. A pattern a ∈ PE
                      is called minimal if there does not exist any pattern

The objective function maximizes the total number of connected final products, whereas constraints (1) observe the item supply limitations. In most cases, it is not reasonable or even not possible to have all patterns available prior to the optimization process due to the huge cardinality of

                     . Hence, common solvers, like CPLEX, usually cannot be applied to tackle this problem. However, at least the continuous relaxation of the standard model can be solved efficiently by column generation. In order to solve the ILP, branch-and-price techniques can be applied as in the context of one-dimensional cutting, see Belov and Scheithauer (2006) for instance. Note that, in this case, the computational behavior strongly depends on the choice of an appropriate branching rule. A further way to tackle the integer problem consists in the consideration of other modeling approaches.

In this section, we assume the item lengths to be of strictly decreasing order, i.e.,

If such an order is not given from the beginning, we can easily obtain it by a sorting algorithm, e.g. merge sort, in

                         this identification is not unique since a does not contain any information about the particular arrangement of the items. We therefore like to restrict our investigations to monotonically decreasing paths, i.e., paths whose corresponding item lengths are sorted in descending order. This approach is based on a similar method (cf. Scheithauer, 2008) for the well known arcflow model of the cutting stock problem (Valério de Carvalho, 1998). For each

We want to investigate the relationship between the optimal values of the arcflow and the standard model. The following proof is similar to Valério de Carvalho (2002, Proposition 5.1) but has to contain, due to Remark 1, an argumentation on the basis of equivalence classes of paths in

                              holds for the optimal values of both models.
                           

We have proved that both models provide the same optimal objective value, even in the case where the continuous relaxations are considered.

                           Remark 2
                           The equivalence between the arcflow and the standard model can also be proved by the application of results from polyhedral theory as it was done in the case of one-dimensional cutting, see Valério de Carvalho (1999, Proposition 2.1).

While in the standard model (entire) patterns are considered, we now take a different approach focusing on each single connection between two items that is necessary to construct a pattern. For the cutting stock problem, this method is known as the onecut model (Dyckhoff, 1981). Since in the skiving scenario we are not confronted with cuts we would like to refer to this new model as the onestick model indicating that we rivet on sticking items together separately.

                         contraints (16) have to be interpreted as follows:

                           
                              1.
                              The left hand side of (16) counts how often an object of length r is used to build larger objects, either as the left part (cf. first sum) or the right part (cf. second sum) of a onestick.

The right hand side counts how often an object of length r has been constructed out of smaller items and adds the initial number of objects of length r.

Altogether, these constraints ensure that the number of items of length r being used to build larger items cannot exceed the sum of initial and constructed items of length r.

                                       holds for every j ∈ J since the right sum contains at most one nonzero element. If this sum equals zero, assertion (B) leads to (27), otherwise we can apply (A) obtaining the same result.

Altogether, it follows that:

This theorem remains true if we focus on the continuous relaxations of both models.

Hence, we have proved the equivalence of all three approaches, i.e., the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model. Remarkably, this equivalence also holds in the continuous case. In particular, the alternative models (i.e., the arcflow model and the onestick model) can be solved by software like CPLEX also offering a possibility to investigate the gap of the skiving stock problem.

In the last subsections, we noticed a certain relationship between our two new approaches. Both of them avoid the modeling of (entire) patterns and only consider the position or order of the single items. Obviously, each onestick

                        . Thus, in a certain extent, both alternative models share a common structure of variables. We therefore aim at investigating which of these models is expected to require a lower computational effort. To this end, we particularly rivet on the two criteria of the number of variables and the number of constraints.

The proof of a corresponding result for the number of variables is much more complex. Therefore, we split it into different steps starting with the following relation between the indices μ and ρ.

Hence, we have shown that the onestick model differs from the arcflow model by exactly m fewer variables and constraints. In general, especially for practical meaningful instances, this number is ”small” in contrast to both the total numbers of variables 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              m
                              L
                              )
                           
                         and restrictions 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              m

                              L
                              )
                           
                        . We therefore expect the average calculation times of the onestick model to be smaller than those ones of the arcflow model, but not differing that much among one another. This behavior will be investigated numerically in Section 5.

In this section, we present a method to transfer the well known Kantorovich approach (Kantorovich, 1939) to the skiving stock problem. For the sake of a better presentability, we apply the terminology of the equivalent dual bin packing problem. Let

                                 Constraints (34) are necessary to cope with the feasible solutions of the model in a consistent way, cf. Remark 3. Nonetheless, omitting these additional restrictions has no influence on the optimal objective value of this model since

                                     for some k ∈ K would contradict to the optimality.

Obviously, this Kantorovich-type model is equivalent to the standard model since there is a canonical relationship between a (minimal) pattern

                                     and the assignment of the items of a pattern to a bin k ∈ K. Note that, in general, this equivalence does not hold in the continuous case, see the subsequent proposition for more details.

Unfortunately, this formulation contains two disadvantages: a weak continuous relaxation and a high number of symmetric solutions. Both of them might lead to additional expenses within numerical computations, especially, if branch and bound methods or related approaches are considered. In order to clarify these drawbacks, we state the following two results, but omit most parts of the proofs.

In order to compare the performances of the presented models we implemented them in MATLAB R2013a and used its CPLEX-interface (version 12.5.1) to solve all optimization problems but the continuous relaxation of the standard model. Due to the a priori unavailability of the explicit form of the constraints, this model had to be solved by a self-programmed column generation algorithm. Our computational environment was given by an Intel Core i5-2450M CPU with 2.50 gigahertz and 6 gigabytes RAM. As a first investigation, we selected the parameters 
                        
                           (
                           m
                           ,
                           L
                           )
                           =
                           (
                           10
                           ,
                           100
                           )
                        
                      and solved 50 randomly generated instances where li
                      and bi
                      (i ∈ I) were chosen from uniformly distributed integer numbers in 
                        
                           [
                           L
                           /
                           10
                           ,
                           L
                           −
                           1
                           ]
                        
                      and [1, 20], respectively. Since these examples are small to a certain extent, we limited the computation time to a maximum of 30 seconds and listed the results in Table 1
                     . Thereby, the continuous relaxations of Kantorovich-type models have not been investigated since their optimal objective values can be computed directly.

Note that the Kantorovich model could only cope with 39 instances, whereas the lexicographic Kantorovich model only handled 20 instances within the given time limitation (indicated by ⋆ in Table 1). Focusing on these solved instances, we obtain average computation times of 0.7917 sec and 13.1646 sec for the Kantorovich and the lexicographic Kantorovich model, respectively. Thus, even if a solution is found, both models are quite slow compared to the performances of the other ones. On the basis of our simulations, we would like to give two main reasons for the bad performance of these models. Table 2
                     
                      shows the average numbers of variables and constraints in the considered models.

In these instance, cf. Table 2, the Kantorovich-type models possess significantly larger numbers of variables and constraints which, in many cases, lead to high additional computational expenses. Besides, CPLEX applies a solution method based on branch-and-bound-techniques that mainly depends on the availability of reasonably tight bounds. As we have seen in the theoretical part of this paper, the bounds derived from the continuous relaxation are weak in general. In our simulations, the absolute difference between the optimal value u of the continuous relaxation of the Kantorovich model and the optimal value z
                     ⋆ of the skiving stock problem was in the range of 1 up to 19, and its average value was 7.16. Moreover, the mean relative gap resulted to about 15 percent. Hence, in many cases, the bounds computed at the different nodes of the branching tree were too weak to reduce the number of open subproblems. Altogether, we would like to restrict our further investigations to the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model.

                        Remark 5
                        Note that the relationship between the numbers of variables and constraints in the different models depends on the given input-data. For instance, small values of bi
                            (i ∈ I) are favorable for the Kantorovich approaches (since the availabilities influence the upper bound u), whereas they do not affect the arcflow model and the onestick model. Additionally, the size of the models of Section 3 is strongly connected with the absolute value L. In contrast, the size of the Kantorovich-type models only depends on the ratios li
                           /L (i ∈ I). Therefore, we randomly generated 70 ”Kantorovich-tailored” instances with 
                              
                                 L
                                 =
                                 200
                                 ,
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 m
                                 =
                                 10
                              
                            and uniformly distributed integer numbers li
                            ∈ [L/10, L/4] and bi
                            ∈ [1, 10] with i ∈ I. The results can be seen in Table 3.

Also in these instances, the Kantorovich-type models turn out not to be faster than the alternative approaches of Section 3, even though the input-data were chosen favorably for the models of Section 4. Hence, even if there are much smaller numbers of variables and constraints in the Kantorovich-type models they are, due to their very weak continuous relaxation, outperformed by the position-indexed and order-indexed approaches.

In order to evaluate the influence of different parameters m and L on the average perfomances of our models, we randomly generated 100 instances for each selected pair 
                        
                           (
                           m
                           ,
                           L
                           )
                           ∈
                           N
                           ×
                           N
                        
                      and listed their average computation times in Table 4
                     . Here, li
                      and bi
                      (i ∈ I) were chosen from uniformly distributed integer numbers in 
                        
                           [
                           L
                           /
                           10
                           ,
                           L
                           −
                           1
                           ]
                        
                      and [1, 200], respectively.

Obviously, the average computation times of the continuous relaxation of the standard model are much higher than those ones of the other models which are certainly caused by the fact that a self-programmed algorithm is compared with CPLEX. Moreover, as observed in Valério de Carvalho (2005) and Ben Amor, Desrosiers, and Valério de Carvalho (2006), in column generation there might be a lot of degeneracy that stalls the simplex algorithm. Since this aspect would also be meaningful in an exact algorithm of the standard model we forbore from doing further research in this field.

Observe that, in general, the average computation times of the position-indexed and order-indexed models are the higher the larger the parameters m and L are. This behavior is reasonable since both of them possess 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           m
                           L
                           )
                        
                      variables and 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           m
                           +
                           L
                           )
                        
                      constraints which, in most cases, lead to additional computational expenses if m or L increases. In contrast, the average computation time of the continuous relaxation of the standard model only increases significantly in the case where m grows. In order to understand this fact, remember that each iteration of the column generation is mainly determined by two processes: a matrix inversion via the Sherman-Morrison formula with a complexity of 
                        
                           O

                              2
                           
                           )
                        
                      and the solution of a covering problem by means of dynamic programming with a complexity of 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           m
                           L
                           )
                        
                     . Due to the statement from Bazaraa, Jarvis, and Sherali (2005, chap. 5, p. 206)

                        “Empirically, it is often suggested that on the average in most instances, the simplex method requires roughly on the order of m to 3m iterations.”
                     
                  

we assume that, on average, there are 3m iterations leading to a total complexity of about 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              m
                              3
                           
                           +
                           
                              m
                              2
                           
                           L
                           )
                        
                     . Thus, the influence of the parameter m on the average computation time is expected to be higher than the influence of L.

Unfortunately, these instances are too small to clearly notice the predicted relationship between the computation times of the arcflow and the onestick model. We therefore generated and solved, in each case, 50 instances for some larger values of m and L under the same conditions as above. Additionally, we listed the average numbers of variables and restrictions of the respective models in Table 5
                      in order to get an empirical impression of the benefit being based on the presented reduction principles.

These simulations show, especially for 
                        
                           (
                           m
                           ,
                           L
                           )
                           =

                           100
                           ,

                           )
                           ,
                        
                      that the average computation time of the arcflow model is slightly higher than those ones of the onestick model. Furthermore, note that the differences between the respective average numbers of variables or constraints always equal m. Thus, our theoretical results and predictions of Section 3.5 can also be observed in these computational data. Additionally, we want to underline the large differences between the average number of variables (or constraints) and the theoretical worst-case-value mL (or 
                        
                           m
                           +
                           L
                        
                     ). Considering, by way of example, the simulations of the arcflow model for 
                        
                           (
                           m
                           ,
                           L
                           )
                           =
                           (
                           100
                           ,
                           500
                           )
                           ,
                        
                      the average number of variables corresponds to only about 22.75 percent and the number of constraints is about 82 percent of the theoretical worst case complexity mL and 
                        
                           m
                           +
                           L
                           ,
                        
                      respectively. Thus, the reduction techniques presented in Section 3 effect high economies as regards the complexity of the models since they significantly lessen the numbers of variables and restrictions.

Note that in all these simulations we only considered the times to solve the respective models of the skiving stock problems. Actually, the total computation times are higher since the alternative formulations require additional time for necessary precalculations before the solution procedure can be applied. For instance, such initializations are given by the construction of potential allocation points, variable and constraint reductions (as described in Section 3) and the definition of the corresponding vectors and matrices for the objective function and the set of restrictions. In order to get an overview on how the total computation times change with respect to different choices of m and L, we generated 50 instances with uniformly distributed input-data li
                      ∈ [L/10, 3L/4] and bi
                      ∈ [1, 100] for each pair (m, L). Therefore, Table 6
                      lists the same data (i.e., t, trel, ncon
                      and nvar
                     ) as the previous one, but now we also report on the computation time tmod
                      needed for the model generation itself.

First of all, observe that these randomly generated instances were much harder than the previous ones which, in particular, can be seen by the greater average number of variables and the (slightly) greater average number of constraints. In some extent, this is due to the fact that we excluded very large item lengths li
                      > 3L/4 which potentially leads to a larger variety of possible combinations between the single items. Thereby, the number of potential allocation points, as well as the number of arcs and onesticks is likely to increase which leads to more variables and constraints. According to this observation, for the same parameters (m, L), we needed more time to solve the problems compared to the instances of Table 5. Again, the pure solution times of the arcflow model and the onestick model are quite similar, but in most cases the performance of the onestick model tends to be slightly better.

Furthermore, note that both models require approximately the same time tmod
                      as regards the model generation itself. Only in the case of very large instances, i.e., for 
                        
                           (

                      of both formulations can be noticed. From our point of view, this behavior is quite natural since, in general, the precalculations for the onestick model are a little bit more complex. For instance, the index set of the variables of the onestick model 
                        
                           M
                           ′
                        
                      contains an additional condition (namely p ≥ 2q), that has to be ensured, compared to the set 
                        
                           E
                           
                              ′
                              ′
                           
                        
                      of the arcflow model. Moreover, in the onestick model, we need to precalculate the vector N for the right hand side of the constraints. As our computations show, for very large instances, these additional expenses can be larger than the savings arising from the lower number of variables and constraints. However, for instances of moderate sizes, both alternative models can be considered as equivalent from the computational point of view.

                        Remark 6
                        Note that the method of randomly-generated instances can be generalized to so-called problem generators. For example, such an approach is presented in Gau and Wäscher (1995) for the one-dimensional cutting stock problem. As regards the generation of the item lengths we are working quite close to the construction proposed in that paper. However, a main difference is given by the fact that we also kept the values of bi
                            fully randomly. In particular, we did not fix 
                              
                                 
                                    ∑
                                    
                                       i
                                       =
                                       1
                                    
                                    m
                                 
                                 
                                    b
                                    i
                                 
                              
                            as it was done in Gau and Wäscher (1995).

                     between the optimal objective values of the continuous relaxation and the integer problem is the same for the standard model, the arc-flow model and the onestick model. This result could also be observed in our simulations. Note that in Zak (2003) it is conjectured that Δ(E) < 2 holds for all instances of the skiving stock problem. Therefore, for the 450 instances of Table 6, we also computed the gap and obtained the (rough) distribution of Table 7
                     .

Obviously, our results do not violate the conjecture of Zak, since, in particular, we did not even find any instance with gap Δ(E) ≥ 1. However, a thorough computational study or theoretical investigation of the gap of the skiving stock problem would go beyond the aim of this paper. We would like to refer the reader to Martinovic and Scheithauer (2015) for more information as regards this topic.

In this paper, we gave an introduction to the topic of the skiving stock problem by presenting a new position-indexed model, a new order-indexed model and one assignment model which only require a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints. Hence, these formulations are, in particular, suitable to cope with instances of practical meaningful sizes. We further applied several reduction or improvement techniques to the different models in order to reduce their computational expenses. As a main contribution, we proved the equivalence of the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model, especially in the case where the respective continuous relaxations are considered. Additionally, we compared the presented models by means of theoretical and numerical investigations and showed, as a main contribution, that the onestick model requires fewer computational expenses than the arcflow model as regards the pure solution time.

Since the alternative models require additional time for their initialization, we did further research on the total computation times of the arcflow model and the onestick model. Thereby, both models turned out to have a similar running time, in most cases. Only for very large instances, small differences in favor of the arcflow model could be noticed. Our results also give reason to investigate solution methods and exact algorithms for the standard model since this model does almost not depend on any precalculations.

It will be part of our future research to develop models for the description of multidimensional generalizations of the skiving stock problem. Thereby, also necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-overlapping multidimensional patterns are of high interest. Additionally, due to the equivalence of the standard model, the position-indexed formulation and the order-indexed approach, further investigations on the gap of this optimization problem will be a main objective of our research.
