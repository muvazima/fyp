                  In many supply chains, the manufacturer sells not only through an independent retailer, but also through its own direct channel. This work studies the pricing and assortment decisions in such a supply chain in the presence of inventory costs. In our model, the retailer offers a subset of the assortment that the manufacturer offers through its direct channel. We model the customer demand by building on the nested-logit model, which captures the customer’s choice between the manufacturer and the retailer. This model produces several insights into the optimal pricing strategies of the manufacturer. For example, we find that variants with high demand variability will carry a lower wholesale price. Furthermore, we characterize scenarios in which the manufacturer’s and retailer’s assortment preferences are in conflict. In particular, the manufacturer may prefer the retailer to carry items with high demand variability while the retailer prefers items with low demand variability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In a supply chain setting, the pricing of an assortment is a critical decision not only for the seller itself, but also for its supplier. This pricing question becomes even more critical in supply chains where the manufacturer is both a supplier to and competitor of the retailer. Take the relationship between Sony and Best Buy as an example; specifically the Sony VAIO E line of laptop computers. Sony’s direct channel (SonyStyle.com
) sells, at the bare minimum, 30 different configurations for the Sony VAIO E Series laptop. Naturally, a Best Buy store will not be able to offer nearly as many configurations. Motivated by such channel relationships, in this work we consider the pricing and assortment selection problems that arise in a supply chain where the manufacturer uses “dual channels”, that is, a supply chain where the manufacturer sells directly to the customer as well as selling through a retailer.

The marketing literature suggests that a store’s assortment is almost as important as its price profile and location in driving the store traffic, see, for example, Zhang, Kushwaha, Steenburgh, Farris, and Irvin et al. (2009) and the references therein. Hence, in this paper, we model the customer’s choice of channel as a function of the assortment and prices offered by both channels. In particular, we use the nested-logit model to capture the consumer choice: The customer first chooses the channel she wants to purchase from (if any) and, subsequently, decides which product to purchase from her chosen channel. This demand model allows us to account for the effect of both channels’ assortments and prices on the demand observed by each channel.

There are several assumptions one can make regarding who carries inventory in this dual-channel structure and where. In keeping with the motivating example, we consider a manufacturer (e.g. Sony) who sells a build-to-order product through its direct channel while meeting the orders from the retailer. As for the retailer (e.g. Best Buy), it is assumed that it keeps inventory of the final (assembled) products and meets the observed demand with this inventory. Because the retailer must make stock level decisions before observing the customer demand, there exists the possibility of demand-inventory mismatch at the retailer. Hence, our model accounts for the inventory-related costs associated with the demand-inventory mismatch at the retailer. We assume that when the customer demand seen by the retailer exceeds the retailer’s inventory level, the retailer is allowed to procure additional products from the manufacturer. For example, if the demand of a specific VAIO laptop computer is greater than the amount Best Buy had in stock, then Best Buy could order additional units from Sony to meet the excess demand.

A strength of this model is that it allows us to analyze the effect of inventory-related costs on the pricing decisions. We find that the selling prices charged by the manufacturer’s direct channel and the retailer follow an equal effective margin property similar to that described in Rodríguez and Aydın (2011). In addition, in this paper, we characterize the optimal wholesale prices the manufacturer charges to the retailer. For example, we find that, everything else being equal, the manufacturer will charge lower wholesale prices for variants with larger demand variability.

We use our model to study if the manufacturer benefits from selling through two separate channels. In practice one can find both success and failure stories about engaging in dual (or hybrid) sales channel strategies. For example, although Dell has been very successful selling directly to customers, in 2006 it saw its profits and market share decline significantly. The reaction to this decline came in 2007, when Dell successfully embraced a hybrid strategy by adding resellers to their channel mix. In contrast, by 2008, Gateway, another computer business, moved from engaging in dual sales channels to only selling indirectly to customers. Inspired by these examples, in this work we investigate the benefits of engaging in dual-sales channels.

For a build-to-order manufacturer and a retailer engaging in dual sales channels, another relevant question is what assortment to offer through the retailer. More often than not, the retailer offers only a subset of what the manufacturer’s direct channel offers as indicated by the Sony VAIO example discussed earlier. Depending on the power structure in the supply chain, the retailer’s assortment can be decided by the retailer itself or it could be dictated by the manufacturer. We study both options. Moreover, we study different sequences of decision-making that allow various scenarios regarding the timing of assortment and pricing decisions.

We first explore problems where there is no limit on the number of variants to carry. In such cases, we find that if the manufacturer’s pricing decisions precede the retailer’s assortment selection, both the retailer and the manufacturer will be best off by offering every available product. However, if the retailer’s assortment selection precedes the manufacturer’s pricing decisions, then the retailer may strategically leave certain variants out of its assortment.

We then study cases where there is a limit on the size of the assortment. When there is a limit on the size of the retailer’s assortment, we find that the manufacturer and the retailer may disagree about which product to sell through the retailer, because the manufacturer prefers products with higher demand variability while the retailer prefers products with lower demand variability.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section we review the related literature. Section 3 describes the model. The pricing problem is analyzed in Section 4 and the benefit of adding an indirect channel is analyzed in Section 5. In Section 6 we explore the assortment decisions. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the results and contributions. The proofs are provided as an online supplement.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The analysis of distribution systems has received considerable attention in the operations and marketing literature. In the context of the broad literature on distribution systems, the problem studied in this paper belongs to the subset that deals with multiple-channel distribution systems, in which a supplier sells through more than one channel. Cattani, Gilland, and Swaminathan (2004) present an extensive literature survey on the coordination of multiple channels.

The multiple-channel distribution system studied in this paper belongs to the narrower subset of dual-channel systems, in which the supplier sells through two channels only. The interest in dual channel systems (which have also been labeled as “hybrid distribution”) dates back to as early as 1965 (Preston and Schramm, 1965). However, the interest in dual-channel systems has been revived in recent years due to the tradeoffs presented by e-commerce. Swaminathan and Tayur (2003),Tsay and Agrawal (2004) and Agatz, Fleischmann, and van Nunen (2008) review the literature dealing with multiple-channels that arise in the e-business setting.

One could separate between two streams of work on the dual-channel distribution systems. The first stream of work deals with questions surrounding how much to stock and where to keep that stock in the distribution system, see for example Moinzadeh (2002),Boyaci (2005),Alptekinoğlu and Tang (2005),Chiang and Monahan (2005),Seifert, Thonemann, and Seike (2006) and Schneider and Klabjan (2013). Another example is Zhao (2008), which adds the pricing problem to the inventory decision. In commonality with this work, we take into consideration inventory costs of the products offered. However, we simplify the inventory aspect of the problem by assuming that the inventory levels are chosen to satisfy an exogenously fixed service level and the only stock-keeping location is the retailer. These assumptions are in line with our motivating examples, which revolve around build-to-order manufacturers adding a retailer to their channel mix. The second stream of work in dual-channel systems deals with how the prices should be set and/or coordinated in this distribution system., e.g. Rhee and Park (2000),Yao and Liu (2005),Chiang and Chhajed (2005),Cattani, Gilland, Heese, and Swaminathan (2006),Kumar and Ruan (2006),Liu, Parlar, and Zhu (2007),Dumrongsiri, Fan, Jain, and Moinzadeh (2008),Huang and Swaminathan (2009),Hua, Wand, and Cheng (2010) and Chen, Fang, and Wen (2013). Our paper is related to this second stream of research in that we study, among other things, the pricing decisions in a dual-channel system. Earlier work that is particularly related to the type of pricing problems that arise in our paper are Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess (2003) and Tsay and Agrawal (2004), who treat the manufacturer’s channel structure as a decision variable, i.e., manufacturer decides whether or not to use a dual-sales channel. They study the effects of the channel structure on the pricing strategies and profits. Tsay and Agrawal (2004) build on Chiang et al. (2003) by incorporating sales effort and the unit cost of supplying an item; however, they restrict the selling prices to be the same in both channels. Our work differs from Chiang et al. (2003) and Tsay and Agrawal (2004) in a number of ways. In particular, we incorporate demand uncertainty and we explicitly model the inventory costs associated with demand-inventory mismatches at the retailer.

This work also addresses the question of whether it is always beneficial to sell through dual-channels. There has been some work on the question of channel design, especially when considering the distribution costs, e.g. Rangan (1987),Chiang et al. (2003) and Bhatnagar and Syam (2014). In our case, we do not explicitly model distribution costs but we incorporate inventory costs and compare the expected profits for the manufacturer under both scenarios.

One important distinction between our work and the existing literature is that in our model each channel sells an assortment of substitutable products, and we analyze the assortment decisions.

Consider a product that can be purchased through two channels: directly from the manufacturer and through an independent retailer. Take a Dell Inspiron desktop computer as an example: A customer can purchase a Dell Inspiron computer directly from Dell.com
 (the manufacturer’s direct channel) where the customer configures the computer by choosing from several colors, processor speeds, operating systems, memory and hard drive capacities. On the other hand, the customer may choose to purchase a Dell Inspiron from Best Buy (retailer) in which case she must choose from only a few pre-configured Inspiron computers the store carries in stock. In keeping with this scenario, we model a build-to-order manufacturer, who offers an assortment of all possible variants; we denote this set of variants with SM
                     . The retailer in our model, on the other hand, offers a subset of the variants in SM
                      and keeps stock of the variants it carries. Let SR
                      denote the set of variants carried by the retailer.

In our model, the pricing decisions available to the manufacturer are the prices for the direct channel, 
                        
                           p
                           k
                           M
                        
                      for variant k ∈ SM
                      (i.e. prices charged to the customers who purchase from the manufacturer), and the wholesale price charged to the retailer, wk
                      for variant k ∈ SR
                     . On the other hand, the retailer chooses the price it charges to its customers. Let 
                        
                           p
                           k
                           
                              R
                           
                        
                      denote the retailer’s selling price for variant k ∈ SR
                     .

Consider an individual customer. We model the individual customer’s decision building on the nested-logit model. In the nested-logit model the customer choice is modeled as a sequential process, where the customer first chooses one of many ‘nests’ of items and, conditional on the choice of the nest, the customer chooses what specific item to purchase from the nest. The choices in each stage follows a multinomial logit choice model (MNL). The nested-logit model leads to a closed form expression for the probability that a customer purchases a specific item in a given nest. For more on the nested-logit model, see Anderson and de Palma (1992). In our model, the nests are the manufacturer’s assortment, the retailer’s assortment and an external alternative. If the customer decides to purchase from the manufacturer or the retailer, then she decides on the specific product to purchase. For the sake of exposition, we first describe the customer’s variant choice given that the customer already decided what channel to purchase from (the retailer or the manufacturer’s direct channel).

In this stage, the customer chooses which variant to purchase from the assortment offered by the channel she chose in the first stage. Consider an individual customer who decided to purchase from channel n ∈ {M, R}, where n = M refers to the manufacturer’s direct channel and n = R refers to the retailer. Let 
                              p
                           
                           
                              n
                            denote the vector of prices for the variants offered by channel n. (As a notational convention, we use bold symbols to denote vectors, e.g. 
                              p
                           
                           
                              n
                            is the vector of prices charged by channel n to its customers.) In keeping with the nested logit choice model, we model the customer’s choice of variant using the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model. (For details on the MNL model, see, for example, Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985.) Let 
                              
                                 U
                                 k
                                 n
                              
                            denote the customer’s utility from variant k ∈ Sn
                           . Following the MNL model, 
                              
                                 U

Let UM
                            and UR
                            denote the customer’s random utility of purchasing from the manufacturer and from the retailer, respectively. The nested logit model posits that the utility of purchasing from a nest is the expected utility of the utility-maximizing choice in that nest plus a Gumbel error term. Hence, following the nested logit model,

                           0, is itself Gumbel with a mean of α

                           Example: In Table 1
                            we provide a numerical example that we will carry through Sections 3 and 4. In this example the manufacturer is carrying three variants in its assortment, i.e. SM
                            = {1, 2, 3}, and the retailer is carrying only variants 1 and 2 out of these three variants, i.e. SR
                            = {1, 2}. Suppose that the degrees of heterogeneity across variants (μ
                           2) and across channels (μ
                           1) are 2 and 1, respectively. Suppose also that the expected utility of the external alternative for channel choice, α
                           0
                           μ
                           1, equals 3. For now, we take the prices of variants to be exogenously fixed. For each variant k = 1, 2, 3, the following table shows the customer’s expected utility from the variant (αk
                           ), the price of the variant at the retailer (

We treat the manufacturer’s assortment as fixed and hence we drop SM
                         from the argument lists of the functions. On the other hand, we treat the retailer’s assortment, SR
                        , as a decision variable. This modeling choice is aligned with our motivating example, in which the manufacturer offers all possible variants while the retailer offers only a subset of them. We consider both the case where the retailer chooses its own assortment, and the case where the manufacturer decides what to offer through the retailer.

We assume that the manufacturer has two pricing decisions to make: the direct channel prices, 
                           
                              p
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 M
                              
                           
                         for k ∈ SM
                        , and the wholesale price for each variant, denoted by wk
                         for k ∈ SR
                        . The retailer, on the other hand, needs to determine its own selling prices, 
                           
                              p
                              k
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                         for variant k ∈ SR
                        . We consider several scenarios regarding the sequencing of decisions, including the pricing decisions and the assortment decision. For the sake of exposition, we next describe the retailer’s and manufacturer’s profit functions given the prices and assortments and we provide the explanation of the sequence of events in the following section.

We consider a one-period problem. Recall that we model a make-to-stock retailer who procures the finished product from the manufacturer and faces uncertain demand. Hence, inventory decisions at the retailer are taken into account and we assume these decisions are made after all pricing and assortment decisions have been made by both the manufacturer and retailer.

Let yk
                            denote the retailer’s stock level of variant k ∈ SR
                           . We simplify the inventory decision problem by assuming that the retailer will stock yk
                            units at the beginning of the period to satisfy a service level objective, which is uniquely determined by the exogenously fixed parameter, zk

                            denote the mean and standard deviation of the demand for variant k observed by the retailer. Here, zk
                            can be interpreted as the service level for variant k, measured in standard deviations above the mean. In particular, zk
                            determines the probability that variant k will not run out of stock, which is typically referred to as type-1 service level. Instead of choosing the inventory level to satisfy an exogenously-fixed service level objective, one could have allowed the retailer to pick the optimal inventory level to minimize the expected underage and overage cost. In our setting, one can show that picking the optimal inventory level is equivalent to picking the optimal service level (i.e., the optimal value for the parameter zk
                           ). Instead of working with optimal service levels, however, we work with exogenously fixed service levels in the rest of this paper.

                            for each unit of leftover inventory. In the latter case, we assume that the retailer places an additional order with the manufacturer to meet the excess demand. When this happens, we assume that the retailer pays the manufacturer the previously announced unit wholesale price, wk
                           . In addition, the retailer incurs a unit backordering cost, cuk

                            may be interpreted as the additional cost paid to a third party associated with expediting a shipment in order to meet the excess demand. Define

The manufacturer builds to order and faces two sources of demand: one from the direct channel and the other from the retailer. The sequence of events for the manufacturer is the following: At the beginning of the period, the manufacturer receives an order from the retailer and meets that order. Throughout the period, the manufacturer continues to build to order to meet the demand from its direct channel. At the end of the period, the retailer may observe excess demand over the initial stocking quantity. When that happens, the retailer will backorder excess demand and will procure the needed quantity from the manufacturer. The manufacturer will meet the retailer’s additional demand charging the same wholesale price as before.

Given that the retailer backorders the excess demand from the manufacturer, the quantity that the manufacturer sells to the retailer is the maximum of the retailer’s initial order quantity, yk
                           , and the demand observed by the retailer,

                           In the above expression, the first term is the profit attributed to the sales through the direct channel and the second term is the profit attributed to sales to the retailer. The parameter θk
                            deserves further discussion. We refer to θk
                            as the “safety stock factor” for variant k. Notice the significance of the safety stock factor: For variant k in the retailer’s assortment SR
                           , the quantity the retailer purchases from the manufacturer is given by the expected customer demand for the variant times the safety stock factor.

The safety factor is always larger than one. This captures the fact that the total quantity that the retailer buys from the manufacturer is an amplification of the expected demand. To understand the intuition behind this amplification, recall that the retailer backorders from the manufacturer whenever there is a shortage. Therefore, the total quantity the retailer buys from the manufacturer is never below the expected demand, but it may exceed the expected demand when the retailer overstocks. The factor θk
                            captures this effect. The size of the amplification depends on the retailer’s service level, zk
                           , and the demand’s coefficient of variation, σk
                           , as shown in (11).


                           Example continued: Return to the same example as before. In addition to the data introduced earlier, suppose that we have the following data about the manufacturer’s unit production cost, ck
                            for variant k: c
                           1 = 1, c
                           2 = 1, c
                           3 = 1.05. Furthermore, we can evaluate the safety stock factor (θk
                           ) for variants k = 1, 2 (these are the only variants carried by the retailer) by substituting the appropriate parameter values from Table 3 in Eq. (11). The safety stock factor θk
                            will be equal to 1.0393 for variant 1 and 1.1969 for variant 2. We now have all the ingredients needed to evaluate the manufacturer’s expected profit function, given by Eq. (10). This profit amounts to 2.6379.

In this section we explore the retailer’s and manufacturer’s pricing problem assuming a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader. For the time being, to examine the retailer’s pricing decision, we assume that the retailer’s assortment, SR
                     , is exogenously fixed. The sequence of decisions for this game is the following: (1) the manufacturer picks the wholesale prices, wk
                     , and direct channel prices, 
                        
                           
                              p
                              k
                              
                                 M
                              
                           
                           ,
                        
                      (2) the retailer sets its prices, 
                        
                           p
                           
                              k
                           
                           
                              R
                           
                        
                     . We first analyze the retailer’s pricing decision in response to the manufacturer’s wholesale prices, 
                        w
                     , and direct channel prices, 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              M
                           
                        
                     . As stated in the following proposition, we find that the retailer will price its products following an “equal effective margin property”.

                     Proposition 1 reduces the retailer’s pricing decision to picking a single effective margin,

                      for all the variants in its assortment SR
                     . Rodríguez and Aydın (2011) obtain the same structure for optimal pricing in a different context, which involves assortment and pricing decisions for products configured from multiple components.


                     Example continued: Let us return to the same example as before. So far, in our example, all the prices were exogenously fixed. Suppose that we continue to fix all the prices except for the retailer’s prices for variants 1 and 2, which the retailer can now choose optimally. A search procedure will reveal the retailer’s optimal prices for variants 1 and 2 to be:

                      (given by 1.5 and 1.55 for variants 1 and 2, respectively) and γk
                      (which we calculated in the earlier discussion of the numerical example to be 0.0395 and 0.2176 for variants 1 and 2, respectively), we will find that the effective margin for variant k (given by

                      chosen by the manufacturer. Given the retailer’s optimal pricing response, we next analyze the manufacturer’s optimal pricing decisions.

In the manufacturer’s profit function, the retailer’s price vector can now be replaced with the retailer’s optimal effective margin. The details of this simplification are provided in Step 1 of the proof of Proposition 3 in the Supplementary appendix. This simplification facilitates further analysis of the manufacturer’s pricing problem. The next proposition describes the properties of the optimal direct channel and wholesale prices.

                     Proposition 3 (a) shows that the manufacturer’s direct channel prices exhibit an “equal margin” property, much like the the retailer’s prices did. In particular, at optimality, the direct channel prices are such that all variants have the same effective margin. Notice that the manufacturer’s direct channel does not incur any inventory cost, so the effective margin for the direct channel is given by the direct channel price (
                        
                           p
                           k
                           
                              M
                           
                        
                      for variant k) minus the production cost (ck
                      for variant k). As such, this result is akin to equal margin results that previously appeared in the literature pertaining to pricing decisions under logit-type demand models (e.g., Anderson and de Palma, 1992 and Besanko, Gupta, and Jain, 1998).


                     Proposition 3 (b), on the other hand, speaks to the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale prices, and states that the optimal wholesale prices must be such that the “weighted wholesale prices” are the same across all variants. This property of the optimal wholesale prices has important consequences, which we describe in the next corollary.

                        Corollary 1
                        Let i and j be two of the variants carried in the retailer’ s assortment. Suppose i and j are identical in all respects except for the demand’s coefficient of variation such that σi
                            < σj
                           . Then, wi
                            > wj
                           .


                     Corollary 1 states that the larger the demand variability of a variant (measured by demand’s coefficient of variation), the lower the variant’s wholesale price. The intuition behind this result lies in the safety stock factor, θk
                      (which increases in the demand’s coefficient of variation – see Eq. (11)). Suppose we start with a number of products identical in all respects, and we then increase the coefficient of variation for one of them, say variant h. Now, the safety stock factor for variant h also increases. In other words, for variant h, the retailer’s order quantity is going to be a larger amplification of the expected demand compared to other variants. Hence, this variant now becomes more attractive for the manufacturer, so the manufacturer decreases the wholesale price to increase the market share of this variant compared to others.


                     Example continued: Suppose now we allow the manufacturer to set its prices optimally (both the wholesale prices and direct channel prices). Note that, when doing so, the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader and it anticipates the retailer’s eventual pricing decisions. Using a search algorithm, we found the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale price for variant k (wk
                     ) to be 5.8670 and 5.4897 for variants 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, we found the manufacturer’s optimal direct channel prices (
                        
                           p
                           k

                      for variant k) to be 6.0415 for variants 1 and 2, and 6.0915 for variant 3. These optimal wholesale and direct channel prices exhibit all the properties listed in Proposition 3 and Corollary 1. Indeed, the effective margin for variant k, given by

                              )
                           
                           
                              θ

                           ,
                        
                      one will find that it is 2.9800 for both variants 1 and 2. Thus, as stated in Proposition 3(b), the manufacturer uses the same weighted wholesale price for all variants sold through the retailer. Given the new optimal wk
                      and 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              M
                           
                        
                      the new optimal prices for the retailer are 6.9694 for variant 1 and 6.7701 for variant 2 which yields an expected profit for the retailer of 0.0628 and 4.0460 for the manufacturer. Finally, we observe that variant 2’s optimal wholesale price is lower than variant 1’s optimal wholesale price. This is in keeping with Corollary 1 – in this case, variant 2 has a higher coefficient of variation (in our ongoing example, σ
                     2 = 0.1 > σ
                     1 = 0.02 ) and it also has the lower wholesale price.

Using Proposition 3 we can recast the manufacturer’s profit as a function of a single effective wholesale price (instead of a wholesale price vector) and a single effective margin for the direct channel (instead of a price vector for the direct channel). These simplifications, which are presented in detail in Lemma 1 of the Supplementary appendix, allow us to further analyze assortment selection and pricing in a dual-channel setting.

In this section, we explore how adding an indirect channel (i.e. retailer) influences a manufacturer currently selling directly to the customer. In order to understand the benefits of dual channels, we first explore the effect of adding an indirect channel on the pricing decisions.

Recall that the manufacturer decides the wholesale prices and direct-channel prices. We find that the manufacturer will always increase the gross margin used by its direct channel when it adds an indirect channel.

                        Proposition 4

                            be the manufacturer’s optimal direct channel margin when selling through the direct channel only and 
                              
                                 m

                            be the manufacturer’s optimal direct channel margin when selling through dual channels. Then,

                                       M
                                    
                                 
                                 >
                                 
                                    m
                                    
                                       direct
                                    
                                    
                                       M
                                    
                                 
                              
                           .

It is interesting that the manufacturer increases its direct channel margin despite introducing a competing source of product, the retailer, into the channel mix. To understand the intuition behind this result, note that the manufacturer’s choice of direct margin is ultimately a trade-off between its sales volume and unit margin. Once the retailer is introduced to the mix, it is true that the volume sold through the direct channel will decrease as some customers will switch to the retailer. However, the manufacturer’s total sales volume, combined across both channels, will now be higher than it was when the manufacturer had only the direct channel, because fewer customers will now choose to go with the external alternative. Given that the manufacturer’s total sales volume will increase after the addition of the retailer, the manufacturer will respond by increasing its direct channel margin to take advantage of the larger total sales volume.

Given that adding a retailer results in an increase in both the total sales volume and the direct channel’s effective margin, the manufacturer will always benefit from using a dual-channel strategy. This observation is formalized in the following proposition.

                        Proposition 5
                        Let 
                              
                                 Π
                                 
                                    direct
                                 
                                 M
                              
                            be the manufacturer’s optimal expected profit when selling through the direct channel only and 
                              
                                 Π
                                 
                                    dual
                                 
                                 M
                              
                            be the manufacturer’s optimal expected profit when selling through dual channels. Then, for any given assortments SM
                            and SR
                            we have that

                           .

While the manufacturer always benefits from adding a retailer to the channel mix, the size of the benefit does depend on the assortment offered through the retailer. In Table 4
                     , we present an example with three alternatives: The first alternative is one where the manufacturer is only selling directly to the customer, i.e. SR
                      = ∅. In the second alternative the manufacturer is selling variant 1 through the retailer, i.e. SR
                      = {1}, and in the third alternative the manufacturer is selling variant 2 through the retailer, i.e. SR
                      = {2}. Notice that, as already proved in Proposition 5, the manufacturer’s profit is larger when the manufacturer sells a product through the retailer. In addition, the manufacturer’s profit is higher when the retailer carries variant 1 as opposed to variant 2. Also notice that variants 1 and 2 are identical in all respects except for the difference between γ
                     1 and γ
                     2, the parameters that capture the inventory-related unit costs associated with variants 1 and 2, respectively. This example highlights two aspects of the problem we are studying: First, the assortment decision on what to offer through the retailer plays an important role on the manufacturer’s profit. Second, even when the manufacturer builds to order (as is the case in our model), the inventory costs that the retailer incurs for its assortment will influence not only the retailer’s profit, but also the manufacturer’s profit. Hence, we next explore the assortment decision on what to offer through the retailer.

In this section, we explore the retailer’s assortment decision. Depending on the power structure in the supply chain, the retailer may choose its own assortment or the manufacturer may decide on the assortment it is going to offer through the retailer. Hence, in this section we explore both cases. In addition, the scenarios we consider differ in terms of the timing of the assortment decisions. In particular, we consider three scenarios. In Scenario 1, the manufacturer picks the assortment while it is choosing its direct channel and wholesale prices. In Scenario 2, the retailer picks the assortment after the manufacturer makes its pricing decisions. In Scenario 3, the retailer picks the assortment before the manufacturer makes its pricing decisions.

We first explore Scenario 1, in which the manufacturer can pick the assortment offered through the retailer, SR
                     . Then the manufacturer will offer every available variant as stated in the next proposition.

                        Proposition 6
                        In Scenario 1, where the manufacturer is choosing the retailer’s assortment in addition to setting the direct channel and wholesale prices, the manufacturer will always choose to offer all variants through the retailer.

This result may seem surprising given the fact that the retailer’s assortment is going to compete with the direct channel’s assortment. However, the manufacturer can always utilize its ability to manipulate the retailer’s demand through its wholesale price choice. Hence, the manufacturer can always price the products to get a favorable combination of market share and margin.

Now consider Scenario 2, where the retailer picks its assortment after the manufacturer makes its pricing decisions. In this scenario, we find that the retailer will always choose to carry all available variants.

                        Proposition 7
                        In Scenario 2, where the retailer picks its assortment after the manufacturer makes its pricing decision, the retailer will choose to offer every available variant.

What drives the result in Proposition 7 is the “equal effective margin” property, which characterizes the retailer’s optimal pricing. Recall that the retailer chooses its prices so that all variants have the same effective margin. Hence, ultimately, all variants are equally attractive to the retailer, and the retailer chooses to offer all variants to obtain a larger market share.

The common ground that joins Scenarios 1 and 2 is that they both assume that the assortment decision is made between the manufacturer’s pricing decisions and the retailer’s pricing decision. In contrast, Scenario 3 assumes that the retailer picks its assortment before the pricing decisions for either firm are made.

Under Scenario 3, we find that the retailer may choose to leave certain variants out of its assortment. We demonstrate this with the example shown in Table 5
                     . In this example, the manufacturer has an assortment of two variants and the retailer can choose to carry none, only one, or both of the variants. Observe that when the retailer carries variant 2 in its assortment (either on its own or along with variant 1) the retailer charges larger prices to the customer. The reason for the increase in prices is that variant 2 shows higher demand variability and, therefore, the inventory related costs associated with this variant are large for the retailer. It is interesting that the presence of variant 2 causes a price increase even though the manufacturer’s wholesale price for variant 2 will be lower than its wholesale price for variant 1, as discussed in Corollary 1. In this example, the retailer would choose to leave variant 2 out of its assortment in order to push the inventory related costs down.

An important assumption made in Propositions 6 and 7 is that there are no constraints on the number of variants that the retailer can offer. In this section we explore a problem where the retailer is constrained to offer only one variant. This setting allows us to explore what product characteristics present conflicts between the retailer and the manufacturer when it comes to the assortment offered by the retailer.

Consider the case where the retailer can offer a single variant. The next proposition compares Scenarios 1 and 2.

                           Proposition 8
                           Suppose that the retailer can offer only one variant from SM
                              . Then the variant that would be offered through the retailer under Scenario 1 (where the manufacturer chooses the retailer’s assortment) is the same as the variant that would be offered under Scenario 2 (where the retailer chooses its own assortment).

Recalling the definitions of Scenarios 1 and 2, Proposition 8 states that as long as the retailer’s assortment is chosen after the manufacturer sets its prices but before the retailer does, the manufacturer and retailer are in agreement about what variant the retailer should offer.

We next analyze the case where the retailer chooses its assortment before the manufacturer sets its prices: Do the manufacturer and the retailer still agree on what variant to offer through the retailer? In other words, we compare Scenario 1 (where the manufacturer chooses what to offer through the retailer) and Scenario 3 (where the retailer chooses what to offer, but before the manufacturer sets its prices). Proposition 9 identifies certain conditions under which the same variant is chosen under both Scenarios 1 and 3.

                           Proposition 9
                           Consider a manufacturer’s assortment that consists of only variants 1 and 2, i.e. SM
                               = {1, 2}.

                                 
                                    (a)
                                    Suppose variants 1 and 2 are identical in all respects except that variant 1’s unit overage cost is less than that of variant 2 (co
                                       1 < co
                                       2). Then, under both Scenario 1 and Scenario 3, the variant that will be offered through the retailer will be variant 1.

Suppose variants 1 and 2 are identical in all respects except that variant 1’s unit underage cost is less than that of variant 2 (cu
                                       1 < cu
                                       2). Then, under both Scenario 1 and Scenario 3, the variant that will be offered through the retailer will be variant 1.


                        Proposition 9 presents a setting in which the retailer and the manufacturer will not face a conflict in terms of what should be carried through the retailer. However, the same is not true for variants that differ only in the demand’s coefficient of variation. In such a case, we find that there exist situations where the manufacturer, in Scenario 1, will prefer to offer through the retailer the variant with the higher coefficient of variation whereas the retailer, in Scenario 3, will choose the variant that has the lower coefficient of variation. In Table 6
                        , we provide an example showing such a conflict. In this example there are two variants, labeled 1 and 2. They are the same in all respects but the demand’s coefficient of variation, σk
                        . The retailer decides according to Scenario 3. Here the coefficient of variation for variant 2 is significantly larger than the one for variant 1. Observe that the retailer’s expected profit is higher when it carries only variant 1, whereas the manufacturer’s expected profit is higher when the retailer carries variant 2.

The most significant driver of this conflict is the fact that variant 2 has a higher safety stock factor, i.e. θ
                        2 > θ
                        1. Hence, the manufacturer will show preference for variant 2. However, variant 2 also has higher inventory costs, i.e. γ
                        2 > γ
                        1, which makes it less attractive for the retailer. Hence, the retailer prefers variant 1, but the manufacturer prefers variant 2.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We study a supply chain where a build-to-order manufacturer sells through a retailer as well as selling through its direct channel. The customer is assumed to be able to purchase from either firm and the manufacturer will offer all available variants, whereas the retailer will offer only a subset of variants.

There are three main challenges this problem poses: First we have the manufacturer’s decision to set direct channel prices and wholesale prices, while taking into account the competition from the retailer. Second, the retailer manages not only prices but also inventory levels. Third, both the retailer and the manufacturer must be concerned about the effects of the retailer’s assortment on their profits.

In this setting, we first study the firms’ pricing problems. We find that for the retailer’s prices and the manufacturer’s direct channel prices satisfy an “equal effective margin” property, which is not unlike results obtained in the previous literature pertaining to pricing decisions under logit-type demand models (e.g., Anderson and de Palma, 1992, Besanko et al., 1998, Rodríguez and Aydın, 2011). The optimal wholesale prices on the other hand show a different structure: The wholesale price net of unit production and inventory costs, weighted by the item’s safety stock factor, must be the same across all items. Here, the safety stock factor is a function of the item’s service level and demand variability. This structure has some immediate implications. For example, if all items are the same but some show higher demand variability, then those items with higher demand variability will have a lower wholesale price attached to them. The rationale behind this result is that, for these items, the retailer’s order quantity will represent a larger amplification of the expected demand, compared to other items with lower demand variability. Hence, the manufacturer will want these items to have a larger market share, which can be induced by keeping the wholesale price low.

We also explore if a manufacturer, who is currently selling through a direct channel, benefits from adding a retailer to its channel mix. This decision is non-trivial because the two channels will be competing against each other. We find that even though the direct channel will observe a decrease in its market share, the manufacturer will increase its total market share (where total market share includes the demand from both channels). Hence, the manufacturer will always benefit from adding a channel, giving it another venue to capture more customers.

One of the main contributions of this work is that is explores the retailer’s assortment decision. We explore scenarios that differ in mainly two aspects: who decides the retailer’s assortment (the retailer or the manufacturer itself) and when the assortment decision is made relative to pricing decisions. We find that depending on the sequence of decisions, the manufacturer’s preference may conflict with the retailer’s. In particular, in certain cases, the manufacturer wishes the retailer to offer items with high demand variability while the retailer opts for low demand variability.

Perhaps the most immediate extension to this paper is a characterization of the retailer’s optimal assortment under what we called Scenario 3 (the retailer choosing its assortment before the manufacturer announces its prices). For that scenario, we showed that the retailer might choose to exclude some variants from its assortment, while the manufacturer would like to see the retailer include these variants. However, we stopped short of characterizing the retailer’s optimal assortment. This could be an interesting (but challenging) extension to pursue. Another possible extension is to study the case of non-overlapping assortments, that is, the case where the retailer and the manufacturer agree to split the complete assortment into two groups, one group carried by the retailer and the other carried by the manufacturer’s direct channel. It would be interesting to explore what characteristics make one variant more suitable for the direct channel as opposed to the indirect channel. Finally, the modeling framework we used here could be adapted to study an online channel competing with a physical store. To that end, our consumer choice model could be enriched to capture issues that are salient in online purchasing (for example, incorporating the idea that the consumer is more likely to return a product if it is bought online). Our nested-logit framework could handle such extensions, which could lead to fruitful studies of competition between an online channel and a physical store.
