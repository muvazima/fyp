@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Stacked die applications are one of the fastest-growing trends in the semiconductor industry. It presents various wire bonding challenges, including low-loop, big-span and multi-level wire bonding loop clearance requirements [1–4]. Optimal bonding machine performance and capillary designs are necessary for various requirement of span and clearance height. The ability to shape a wire bond looping, with well-controlled bends and kinks, has been continues development for almost 20years.

Evaluation of the desired profile was achieved through trial and error in 1990s [5,6]. The loop profile characterization points of gold wire were captured by a measuring microscope, and then compared with loop control variables. Groover et al. believed that the manufacturability for longer wire lengths may be more forgiving, because the longer loop has a bigger window of operation than that of short loop [5]. Liu et al. found that shorter reverse length and higher reverse height could provide stronger neck strength of a wire [6]. Ohno et al. observed that a V-curve hardness distribution near neck portion. This minimum hardness position corresponded to the maximum curvature in the loop profile [7]. Hu et al. found that the neckdown region is also the heat affected zone [8]. They reported that the first reverse move of tool could reduce tension in the wire.

The final profile of a wire should have a good resistance for possible external loading. If looping wire is totally inelastic, the looping skeleton, created by tool, would be like a boiled noodle which cannot be used for a big-span application; on the other hand, If looping wire is totally elastic, the looping profile would be very high which is bad for lower clearance height application. Therefore, the wire structure’s deformations should be mainly elastic but some wire segments into the inelastic regions. The nodes of a wire profile are called as break points or kinks.

A bond wire is fed through the tool capillary and bent by designed machine motion. Theoretical discussion of kink formation, such as for the relation of kink and tool’s move, criteria for wire break, plastic deformation and material parameters, is still necessary for a good bonder design. A kinetic understanding is needed for new looping design.

When a cable is hung between two poles, it takes the shape of a catenary—a hyperbolic cosine function. The catenary formula assumes that the cable cannot transmit bending moments. But a formed bond wire loop, it has residual bending that can be experimentally demonstrated as a spring back height, see Ref. [2]. This indicated that a bending phenomenon in wire looping must be taken into account.

There is a big difference between a moving wire and a traditional beam. The wire segment is continuously released from a moving capillary nozzle. The length, local properties and external loads of the wire segment change all the way, that makes the situation rather complicated.

The linkage-spring model for a moving wire was established in Ref. [9–11], for the quasi-elliptical downward stage of a looping process. A wire was represented by N segments of linkage and N+1 springs which transmit bending moments. Most linkages’ relative angles were proportional to their bending moments, and some with end plastic deformation. Assuming the rotation angle extends beyond the limited plastic rotation angle, the bending moment would be as “limited plastic bending moment”. The copper wires (0.36mm diameter and 180mm length) were tested to validate their models. However, there are some problems like sizes, constraints, loading rates for wires in the test and industrial practice. Liu et al. presented a three-dimensional finite element model to simulate a real wire bond looping with the 1.1mm span in industrial practice [12]. An empirical temperature-dependent elasto-plastic constitutive equation, as the material behavior of gold wire, was used in simulation. The actual modes with the standard triangle and trapezoidal loops were compared with the numerical simulations. The relation of significant bend of wire vs. tool’s reverse angle was obvious. The adapted first and second reverse angle was 15° and 30°.

A wire loop needs some residual deformation for maintaining desired profiles. However the wire should keep its integrity. We have to examine when and why these plastic deformations occur in specifically segments of wire. We still need experimental validation of the predictions in a real looping process.

Next issue is measurement. The wire is too thin for touch sensors, so the optical methods could be preferred. In particular, the high-speed record of a dynamic process provides its significant visualization information. A high-speed camera offers systems developers a means to capture, display, and analyze sequences of digital images. The experimental data on looping formation can be analyzed quantitatively by processing of the video sequences.

Complete control of the camera operating system includes frame rate, triggering, illumination and shutter speed. The camera objective was a professional close-up lens that can be focused very precisely.

There are several programmable kinks in BGA (Ball Grid Array) looping, the subject of our study. Real wire span between the 1st and 2nd bonds is 3.16mm. The first kink, near the 1st bond, is for loop height control and wire tension reduction. The last kink is near the 2nd bond that provides standoff over ground.

The looping formation was examined by high-speed video technique with a temporal resolution of 2000 or 5000images/s. The recording time was 200ms. The video file was avi format, 1668kB. mov=aviread (filename) reads the AVI movie filename into the MATLAB movie structure mov. The video file then was transferred 410 pictures as shown in Fig. 1
                     . The set of discrete pictures were saved as a 256 grey scale bitmap (bmp) images with a spatial resolution of 320×240pixels (225kB).

It had a frame rate of 2000 FPS with a frame interval of Δ
                        t
                     
                     =0.5ms, or 5000 FPS with a frame interval of Δ
                        t
                     
                     =0.2ms. The scale was 20μm/pixel since the capillary having a diameter of 0.063in. (1.6mm). The wire span (3.16mm) was 158pixels.

The next step was to remove the background region. Image subtraction was used to detect changes in images with the same scene.

There are a few direct observations by exploring all 410 pictures. 
                        t
                      show the picture number in the 410 pictures. During a whole process, the period of time 
                        t
                     
                     =1–30 was for tool down drop, 
                        t
                     
                     =30–65 was for the 1st bond; 
                        t
                     
                     =70–280 was for tool zigzag moving, 
                        t
                     
                     =280–350 was for downward stage, 
                        t
                     
                     =355–380 was for the 2nd bond, finally 
                        t
                     
                     =385–410 was for tool back to the original position. The time distribution for an overall cycle is shown in Fig. 2
                     . The phase of tool zigzag moving is the most important because of its time spent and complexity.

The bonding tool moves as a rigid body. It is easy to find all locations of moving bonding tool by computing the normalized cross-correlation of the tool template and one of image sequences.

A straightforward approach to match the interest points of different image patches is to use correlation. We simply selected an area near the tool tip as the template, then used a templates of 20×20pixels (Fig. 3
                     ) on the speed-accuracy trade-off.

Examine the inter-frame translation,the capillary’s trajectory (tool’s path) could be obtained, as shown in Fig. 4
                     . For example, 
                        t
                     
                     =90 was the end of a ramped down reverse motion of the tool.

The tool did not move with a constant velocity. It moved most the fastest at the stages for drop down and lift up (
                        t
                     
                     =4–7 and 408–410), as shown in Fig. 5
                     . The lifting vertical acceleration of tool was roughly estimated as 18.8G’s if assuming 0.5ms frame interval time, or 117G’s if assuming 0.2ms frame interval time (1G is the acceleration of gravity).

For tool’s zigzag and downward moving, the two components of motion are analyzed independent of each other. Vertical velocity of tool, V, was for wire’s fast releasing. Slower horizontal motion of tool, U, was for wire bending. Horizontal velocity of tool (U) regularly increased then reduced during 
                        t
                     
                     =80–90, 
                        t
                     
                     =100–116, 
                        t
                     
                     =126–166, with the increasing peak values of horizontal component velocity, as shown in Fig. 6
                     . Finally, there were one and two drops in duration for 
                        t
                     
                     =126–166 and 
                        t
                     
                     =206–280, corresponding the third and the fourth transverse motion of the tool.

The peak value of the transverse velocity of tool seemed proportional to its Y coordinate. But the average acceleration of tool was almost the same.

Morphological operations are good for wire extracting. We defined wire and capillary tip by creating a binary mask (Fig. 7
                     ). The mask contains 0’s for all pixels that are part of the region of interest (wire or capillary tip), and 1’s everywhere else.

Dilation and erosion, two of fundamental morphological operations, were used to trim the wire skeleton. Dilation adds pixels to the broken segments of wire, while erosion removes pixels on wire boundary. The number of pixels added or removed depends on the size and shape of the structuring element. The “ball-shaped” element with diameter of 5pixels was used to process the binary image data, as shown in Fig. 8
                     .

After zigzag moving, the tool’s motion is downward phase, as shown in Fig. 9
                     .

The length of wire segment released from capillary, as a measure for wire stretched-out or deformation, was obtained by using interlinkage arithmetic, as shown in Fig. 10
                     .

By exploring all 410 pictures, the most important phenomena are permanent (irreversible) deformation of wire segments. They were kinks, as shown in Fig. 11
                     . The kink near the 1st bond seemed big and risk, while employing a “tail” kink shaping near the 2nd bond was used to avoid lap joint contact.

After examine Figs. 4 and 10 carefully, one would find that 
                        t
                     
                     =90, 116, 166 and 206 were the ends of reverse motion, or the instants for new wire release. That suggested that these wire kinks were produced near tool tip and due to the transverse moving of tool. The distribution of kinks might result from transverse loads.

These wire kinks exhibited partly spring back characteristics also, as results of the elastic unloading, as shown in Fig. 12
                     . For example, 
                        t
                     
                     =80–90 was the formation of the first kink, corresponding to an obliquity 
                        α
                     
                     1
                     ≈140°. 
                        t
                     
                     =100–116 was the formation of the second kink, corresponding to an obliquity 
                        α
                     
                     1
                     ≈62°, then a rebound of the kink due to vertical moving of tool at 
                        t
                     
                     =126, corresponding to an obliquity 
                        α
                     
                     2
                     ≈67°. 
                        t
                     
                     =126–166 was the formation of the third kink, corresponding to an obliquity 
                        α
                     
                     1
                     ≈114.9°, then a rebound of the kink due to vertical moving of tool at 
                        t
                     
                     =177, corresponding to an obliquity 
                        α
                     
                     2
                     ≈107°.

In an initial attempt, we tried to recognize the individual kink by “phase correlation” and “chord-to-point distance accumulation” algorithms [13]. Kink detection could be finished through man-machine interaction also. Combination of them could accomplish kink detection very well.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

Firstly, there should be a higher stress than plastic yield stress at the kinks. Secondly, these wire kinks exhibited partly spring back characteristics that should be elastic unloading, as shown in Fig. 12. So there should be plastic zones develop around an elastic core in these kinks (or the wire segment near tool).

For the cantilever beam loaded at the tip, bending moment M, transverse force F and axial force F
                     a may simultaneously be superimposed on. As the load is increased, the greatest curvature of beam will occur at the “weakest” section. When the whole cross section at any point becomes plastic, a plastic hinge has deformed. See quasi-static loading conditions at the beam tip as shown in Fig. 14
                     . Case A refers a transverse force F applied at the tip of beam solely, and case B refers a moment MTip
                      applied at the tip solely. The maximum curvature will be at the root of beam (the left end of beam) in case A that is what people were trying to avoid [6]. Secondly, there will be a uniform moment and a constant curvature for whole beam in case B that is not coincident to the observed location of kinks. Both of cases cannot be used to explain why kinks were produced near tool tip. Actual deformation seems a combination of case A and B, namely:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              F
                              ·
                              L
                              
                              ≈
                              
                              
                                 
                                    M
                                 
                                 
                                    Tip
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

The bending moment diagram and shear force diagram for case C could be a superimposition of case A and B: the bending moment and curvature reaches their maximum at the right end, but the shear force F is constant curvature for whole beam, as represented in Fig. 14(C). That would be physically reasonable for kink formation at the end of wire.

When subjected to an axial stress as well as a bending stress, the neutral axis of a beam will be offset. As the moment is increased further, the elastic core radius λr
                      goes to zero, corresponding to a fully plastic status. However, for a partly spring back characteristics of kink as shown in Fig. 12, an elastic core should exist, then undergo an elastic unloading whereas residual plastic deformation remains. Considering the neutral axis’ offset by an axial tension stress, the total stress over the cross section of wire can be shown in Fig. 15
                     .

Moreover, rebound of the second and third kink was corresponding to obliquity 5° and 8°, as shown in Fig. 12. Kink formation must have involved a rather large plastic deformation of wire.

Assuming Δ
                        t
                      is 0.2–0.5ms, the maximum velocity of tool for the first kink was about 1–2 pixel/Δ

                      (40–200mm/s).

The interaction of bending moment and axial tension is rather complicated [14]. However, three stages of the response may be identified as follows: (1) initially, the flexural resistance of the beam is dominant; (2) next, the flexural resistance of the beam starts to decrease rapidly while the axial resistance of the beam increases quickly, or the overlapping mechanism prevails; (3) finally, the axial resistance of the beam becomes dominant under very large chord rotations [14]. Here, a chord-like wire will sustain large rotations without collapse.

Considering the time spent for kinks (Fig. 13
                     ), the conceptual sketch of moment-local curvature relations for kinks can be concluded as shown in Figs. 18 and 19
                     
                     . The first and second kink bear main deformation when bending moment increase, and the curvature of the fourth kink is negative that due to an upward bending when the tool touch down the 2nd bond. It provides low height and standoff over ground in BGA packaging.

The above analysis can be summarized as follows.

Slower horizontal motion of tool is for all kinks. The first kink does not exhibit spring back characteristics but it experiences a heavy loading, unloading and reverse loading. Kink formation involves a very large plastic deformation but keep an elastic core except for the first kink. Many interaction factors such as the properties of material, profile of capillary, dynamical loading and HAZ are involved in kink formation. The residual curvatures of kinks will give springiness to the configuration of wire loop. Real characteristics of the first and fourth kinks provide low height and standoff over ground for packaging.

The proposed method, high-speed video image analysis, has been shown to be good method to understand the dynamical behavior of wirebond looping. It provides a clear view on kink formation especially.

Capillary nozzle’s features affects kink formation by applying small, dynamic and localized moment to the segment of fresh wire. The deformation of the first kink is subject to a double bending plastic collapse so it cannot simply explained by temperature effect. The fourth kinks should provide an opposite residual curvature of wire for being off ground near the 2nd bond. The residual curvature of kinks, not geometrical reverse motion of tool, is major target for wire looping design.

Tensions of wire provide the offset of an elastic core. But the curvature of wire segment under end moment based on initial yield analysis, gives a conservative estimate for actual kinks.

Experimental tests with different material, sizes and rates are still needed in order to generalize the results reported here. Other factors, such as microplastic strain arising from bowback of dislocations and disintegration of dislocation cells, may affect the kink formation simultaneously.
