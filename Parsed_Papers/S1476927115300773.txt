                     GolS genes stand as potential candidate genes for molecular breeding and/or engineering programs in order for improving abiotic stress tolerance in plant species. In this study, a total of six galactinol synthase (GolS) genes/proteins were retrieved for 
                        Solanum lycopersicum and 
                        Brachypodium distachyon. GolS protein sequences were identified to include glyco_transf_8 (PF01501) domain structure, and to have a close molecular weight (36.40–39.59kDa) and amino acid length (318–347 aa) with a slightly acidic pI (5.35–6.40). The sub-cellular location was mainly predicted as cytoplasmic. S. lycopersicum genes located on chr 1 and 2, and included one segmental duplication while genes of B. distachyon were only on chr 1 with one tandem duplication. GolS sequences were found to have well conserved motif structures. Cis-acting analysis was performed for three abiotic stress responsive elements, including ABA responsive element (ABRE), dehydration and cold responsive elements (DRE/CRT) and low-temperature responsive element (LTRE). ABRE elements were found in all GolS genes, except for SlGolS4; DRE/CRT was not detected in any GolS genes and LTRE element found in SlGolS1 and BdGolS1 genes. AU analysis in UTR and ORF regions indicated that SlGolS and BdGolS mRNAs may have a short half-life. SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 genes may generate more stable transcripts since they included AATTAAA motif for polyadenylation signal POLASIG2. Seconder structures of SlGolS proteins were well conserved than that of BdGolS. Some structural divergences were detected in 3D structures and predicted binding sites exhibited various patterns in GolS proteins.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Plants overcome biotic/abiotic environmental stress conditions by acquiring stress tolerance (Seki et al., 2003). This is achieved by stress perception and signaling, leading to the induction of stress responsive genes or transcription factors (Loescher, 2010). Stress responsive genes are categorized in two main groups. First group contains osmoprotectants, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, antifreeze proteins, chaperones and detoxification enzymes, and play an important role in protecting the cell against dehydration. Second group includes transcription factors, protein kinases and enzymes involved in phosphoinositide metabolism, which serve as regulators in gene expression and signal transduction (Hasegawa et al., 2000; Seki et al., 2003). Under stress conditions, plants produce regulatory compounds such as mannitol, proline and a large number of soluble oligosaccharides (trehalose, raffinose and stachyose) to protect the cell against stresses (Cuin and Shabala, 2008). Especially raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) has been intensively studied because of its potential role in desiccation tolerance (Downie et al., 2003; Garcia et al., 2006). Raffinose is synthesized by the donation of galactose from galactinol to sucrose by raffinose synthase. Therefore, synthesis of galactinol is an important step in RFO biosynthesis (Zhou et al., 2014). Galactinol synthase (GolS) (EC 2.4.1.123) catalyzes the synthesis of galactinol from the UDP-d-galactose and myo-inositol (Liu et al., 1995). Galactinol synthase genes have been well characterized in many plants species and most of these genes were reported to be upregulated by abiotic stress conditions/treatments, indicating that overexpressed activities of GolS genes improve stress tolerance by increasing the synthesis of galactinol and raffinose respectively (Taji et al., 2002). Moreover, promoters of stress responsive genes generally include typical cis-regulatory elements such as DRE/CRT, ABRE and MYCRS/MYBRS, and these elements are regulated by various upstream transcriptional factors (Mahajan and Tuteja, 2005).

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an economically and experimentally important crop species and also widely used in domestication and breeding programs (Schauer et al., 2008), fruit development, ripening (Klee and Giovannoni, 2011), and plant defense studies (Cuartero et al., 2006). Brachypodium distachyon is a grass species and suitable model organism for functional genomics studies because of its small genome size, physical stature, short lifecycle, simple growth requirements, self-fertility and efficient transformation system (Draper et al., 2001; Ozdemir et al., 2008). In the present study, galactinol synthase (GolS) genes have been identified at genome-wide scale in S. lycopersicum and B. distachyon species. Also, we have performed a comparative in silico analysis of plant GolS genes/proteins in tomato (S. lycopersicum) and B. distachyon species. In this context, UTR and coding regions of genes were comparatively analyzed; physico-chemical properties and conserved motifs were determined; 3D structure of proteins was predicted and phylogenetic tree was constructed.

Reference galactinol synthase (GolS) protein sequences with AAO72744.1 (for S. lycopersicum) and AAQ07250.1 (for B. distachyon) accession numbers were retrieved from protein database of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). Then these sequences were queried against proteome datasets of S. lycopersicum and B. distachyon in Phytozome v.10 (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html) (Goodstein et al., 2012) database by using Blastp. Resulting sequences were filtered for ≤e-100 and finally a total of 6 genes (four genes for S. lycopersicum and two genes for B. distachyon) were obtained. Later, S. lycopersicum genes with Solyc01g100830.1, Solyc02g084980.2, Solyc01g079170.2 and Solyc02g062590.2 accession numbers renamed as SlGolS1, SlGolS2, SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 respectively, and B. distachyon genes with Bradi1g64120 and Bradi1g17200 accession numbers renamed as BdGolS1 and BdGolS2, respectively in this study (Table 1
                        ). Domain analysis of GolS sequences was performed by pfam server (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk) (Sonnhammer et al., 1997).

Sequence length, molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) of GolS proteins were analyzed by Expasy’s ProtParam server (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The conserved motif analysis was performed by using MEME tool (Timothy et al., 2009) (http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi) with following parameters; maximum number of motifs to find, 5; minimum width of motif, 6 and maximum width of motif, 50. The sub-cellular locations of GolS proteins were predicted by CELLO v.2.5 (subCELlular LOcalization predictor) (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/) (Yu et al., 2006).

Exon/intron organizations of GolS genes were analyzed by GSDS 2.0 (Gene Structure Display Server) (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) (Guo et al., 2007). Gene duplication was detected by using multiple alignment of blastn in NCBI with following criteria: (1) length of alignable sequence covers >80% of longer gene and (2) similarity of aligned regions >80% (Gu et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2008). Digital expression profiles of GolS genes were obtained from Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp) for anatomical and development stage levels (Hruz et al., 2008).

Putative functional annotations of GolS genes were done by using search tool in Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/) database (Yamazaki and Jaiswal, 2005). Annotation based on the gene ontology (GO) terms covering molecular function, biological processes and cellular localization (Table 3).

GolS sequences were aligned by ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) and phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA v 5.1 (Tamura et al., 2011) with neighbor-joining (NJ) method for 1000 bootstrap value. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with 31 GolS protein sequences from 11 higher plant species, including S. lycopersicum (4), B. distachyon (2), Populus trichocarpa (9), Arabidopsis thaliana (7), Gossypium hirsutum (1), Glycine max (1), Coffea arabica (1), Cucumis sativus (1), Brassica napus (1), Triticum aestivum (1), and Zea mays (3).

3D structure of GolS proteins was predicted by 3DLigandSite server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/3dligandsite/) (Wass et al., 2010) and analyzed by using Swiss Pdb Viewer 4.1.0. 3D model quality was checked by Rampage Ramachandran plot analysis (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/∼rapper/rampage.php) (Lovell et al., 2003).

5′ UTR region (−1000 to +0) of 6 GolS genes were retrieved from Phytozome database and a manual search was conducted to identify AU-rich regions, poly(A) signals and DST. Binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) for cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were analyzed by using PlantCARE (Plant Cis-Actin Regulatory Element) database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html//) (Lescot et al., 2002).

Transcript and coding sequences of GolS genes were retrieved from Phytozome database. A manual search was conducted to detect AU-rich regions, poly(A) signals and DST.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

A total of six (four for S. lycopersicum and two for Brassica rapa) GolS gene/protein sequences were retrieved from Phytozome database for ≤e-100 threshold value. GolS protein sequences were identified to include Glyco_transf_8 (PF01501) domain structure and have a very close molecular weight (36.40–39.59kDa) and amino acid length (318–347 amino acids) with a slightly acidic pI value of 5.35–6.40. Similar results were also reported in different plant species, including cotton (Zhou et al., 2012a), Coffea arabica (dos Santos et al., 2011) and tomato (Downie et al., 2003). Sub-cellular locations of GolSs were mainly predicted as cytoplasmic. This could be related with osmoprotectant function of GolSs in cytoplasm.

Motif analysis was performed for most conserved five motif sequences (Fig. 1
                        ). Although motif 1–4 were found to be related with Glyco_transf_8 (PF01501) domain structure, motif 5 did not relate any domain structure (Table 2
                        ). High e-values (3.6e−183 to 5.1e−261) and similar motif structures indicated that GolS proteins may have become to be well conserved in the course of evolution.


                        SlGolS1, SlGoIS2 and SlGoIS4 genes of S. lycopersicum included three exons while SlGoIS3 had 4 exons. In B. distachyon, BdGoIS1 and BdGoIS2 genes had 4 and 3 exons, respectively (Fig. 2
                        ). Exon numbers of GolS proteins in these two species varied between 3 and 4 with different exon–intron patterns. Similar exon–intron numbers were also identified in various plant taxa, including cotton with three exons (Zhou et al., 2012b), Salvia miltiorrhiza with four and two exons (Wang et al., 2012), and Pisum sativum with at least three exons (Lahuta et al., 2014). These variations in gene structure and number may be caused by mutations in GolS genes during monocot-dicot split. Moreover, different exon–intron pattern and number in the same species indicate that gene mutations (deletions, insertion etc.) may have become to occur after monocot and dicot divergence.

SlGolS genes were distributed on chromosome 1 (SlGolS1 and SlGolS3) and chromosome 2 (SlGolS2 and SlGolS4) while BdGolS genes only located on chromosome 1 (Fig. 3
                        ). Duplications in plant genomes can be in various scales such as tandem and segmental duplications (small-scale) or whole-genome duplications (large-scale) (Ramsey and Schemske, 1998). Tandem duplications consist of two or more genes that distributed on the same chromosome whereas segmental duplications are observed in different chromosomes (Liu et al., 2011). We detected a one segmental duplication between SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 genes, and one tandem duplication between BdGolS1 and BdGolS2 genes. Functional divergences in duplicated genes can lead to molecular innovations in higher organisms (Ganko et al., 2007). Therefore, it can be suggested that gene duplications may provide functional divergences to GolS genes for tolerance of various abiotic stress conditions.

Expression profile of S. lycopersicum GolS1 gene was evaluated at 15 anatomical parts (Fig. 4
                        A) and six developmental stage (Fig. 4B) levels. In anatomical parts, highest expression level was detected in fruit, seedling and pericarp parts. In developmental stage levels, fruit ripening complete stage had the highest expression level of SlGolS1 gene. It is well known that ethylene hormone accelerates the fruit ripening as well as having a variety of physiological processes such as senescence, abscission, and response to water deficit, mechanical wounding and pathogen attack (Abeles et al., 1992). Therefore, ethylene hormone might have become to induce some stress genes like GolS together with ripening process. To support this, we investigated the genes that have most similar profile to our target gene (SlGoSl1) by using co-expression tool in Genevestigator. We obtained the top most correlated 2 genes (AF096252.1 and Solyc04g082300.2). AF096252.1 gene was found to synthesize ER60 ethylene-responsive catalase enzyme. This implicitly indicates that SlGolS1 gene could have been induced by ethylene hormone.

Annotation based on the gene ontology (GO) terms covering molecular function, biological processes and cellular localization (Table 3
                        ). According to molecular function, all GolS genes showed transferase activities, including “transferase activity and transferring glycosyl groups” (GO:0016757), “transferase activity” (GO:0016740), and “inositol 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase activity” (GO:0047216). Besides, some genes (SlGolS1, SlGolS2 and SlGolS3) were found to show “ion binding” (GO:0043167) and “metal ion binding” (GO:0046872) activities. According to the biological processes, all genes have “carbohydrate metabolic process” (GO:0005975) and “galactose metabolic process” (GO:0006012) functions. Additionally, SlGolS1 gene included some other functions such as “response to stress” (GO:0006950), “cellular response to cold” (GO:0070417) and “cellular response to desiccation” (GO:0071465). Cellular component of GolS proteins was found as “intracellular” (GO:0005622) and “cytoplasm” (GO:0005737). Gene ontology data also compromised with the functions of GolS proteins mentioned in previous studies.

Transcription factors and cis-acting regulatory sequences are important elements in transcriptional control acting on upstream (promotor) region of genes (Mignone et al., 2002). To understand the stress-related transcriptional regulation mechanisms of GolS genes in tomato and Brachypodium, we performed an in silico investigation of cis-elements in their putative promoter regions (upstream region of 1000bp) using PlantCARE database. Three abiotic stress responsive elements, including ABA responsive element (ABRE) (Zhang et al., 2005), dehydration and cold responsive element (DRE/CRT) (Qin et al., 2004), and low-temperature responsive element (LTRE) (Gao et al., 2002) were searched (Table 4
                        ). ABRE element was found in all GolS genes, except for SlGolS4 but DRE/CRT elements were not detected in any GolS genes. LTRE element was only present in SlGolS1 and BdGolS1. This suggests that expression of GolS genes may have become to be regulated by corresponding cis elements in tomato and Brachypodium under abiotic stress conditions. Besides, light responsive cis-acting regulatory elements (Box-4, I-box and G-box) were present in all GolS genes. Also, temperature associated cis-acting elements HSE was detected in all GolS genes, except for SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 (data not shown), indicating that SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 may not have any functions in response to heat stress.

Length and secondary structure of 5′ UTRs are crucial for efficient initiation of translation in eukaryotic mRNAs (Kozak, 1991a). 5′ UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs contain three to several hundred nucleotides with an average length of about 90 (Kozak, 1991b). Østergaard et al. (1998) reported that 5′ UTRs of Arabidopsis peroxidases contained 40–71% adenine. It is also reported that, 80% of 5′ UTRs of heat shock proteins in invertebrates and plants includes AU-rich elements. Quantity of A-rich elements in 5′ UTR regions may affect transcription, translation and mRNA stability (Herrero et al., 2013). We found that 5′ UTRs of SlGolS2, SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 genes contained 75.56%, 63.33% and 77.91% A content, respectively while BdGolS1 and BdGolS2 genes contained 50.44% and 54.78% A content, respectively. These A contents were notably higher than previous studies, such as Arabidopsis peroxidases (39%, 38% and 27%) and Zinnia elegans peroxidases (27%) (Gabaldón et al., 2005). Therefore, it can be suggested that high A content in 5′ UTR regions of tomato and Brachypodium may indicate the unstable secondary structures of mRNA with a high decay rate.

Gene expression level is mainly affected by rate of translation and mRNA decay. In addition, mRNA longevity/half-life is regulated by several factors, including short longevity-conferring AREs and DSTs (Newman et al., 1993; Narsai et al., 2007). Short-longevity conferring elements of GolS transcripts (AAUUUU, UUUUUG, UUUUUU, AGUUUU, UUUUGU, AUUUUG, AUUUUU, GUUUUG, GUUUUU and UAGGAU) were tabulated in Table 5
                        . SlGolS1 contained at least four AU-rich regions (AREs); all AREs located in ORF (open reading frame) regions. SlGolS2 contained at least 18 AREs; one located in 5′ UTR, 10 located in ORFs and seven located in 3′ UTR. SlGolS3 contained at least 13 AREs; two located in ORF and 11 located in 3′ UTR. SlGolS4 contained 10 AREs; three located in 5′ UTR and seven located in ORF. BdGolS1 contained at least five AREs; all AREs located in 5′ UTR. Notably, BdGolS2 did not contain any AREs. This shows that SlGolS and BdGolS mRNAs, except for BdGolS2, may have short half-life.

                         mRNA polyadenylation is a vital process for maturation of most eukaryotic mRNA, and this process can affect its stability, translatability and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic export. Three common polyadenylation signals were analyzed in 3′ UTRs of GolS, including POLASIG1 (AATAAA), POLASIG2 (AATTAAA) and POLASIG3 (AATAAT) (Table 6
                        ) (Herrero et al., 2013). Particularly, only SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 contained the POLASIG2 (AATTAAA) signal, suggested that these genes tend to generate more stable transcripts.

Constructed phylogenetic tree was divided into six main groups namely as A, B, C, D, E, and F (Fig. 5). Remarkably, SlGolS proteins were separated from each other distinctively and distributed into different groups; SlGolS2 into group A, SlGolS3 into group B, SlGolS4 into group C and SlGolS1 in group F, whereas BdGolS1 and BdGolS2 were only clustered in group B.

Also, monocot GolS proteins were clustered in subgroup B with the high bootstrap value (99%) and this monocot clade was observed in previous studies (dos Santos et al., 2011; Sengupta et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014). Arabidopsis GolS1 and GolS2 were induced by drought, salt and heat stress while Arabidopsis GolS2 was induced by cold stress (Taji et al., 2002). In this study, SlGolS2 was grouped with Arabidopsis GolS1-3 in group A, suggesting that SlGolS2 may be related with response to the abiotic stress conditions. In this study, SlGolS3 was clustered with Populus GolS6 and GolS8. The PtrGolS4 and PtrGolS6 were highly expressed in all tested organs while other PtrGolS genes (PtrGolS1–PtrGolS3, PtrGolS5, PtrGolS7 and PtrGolS8) were expressed only in stem. Although many PtrGolS genes were expressed in salt, osmotic and drought stresses, PtrGolS2 and PtrGolS8 genes were induced by cold (Zhou et al., 2014). It can be proposed that SlGolS3 could play important roles in cold acclimation and response to various abiotic stress conditions (Unda et al., 2012). In maize, ZmGolS1 mRNA was not detected in any of the investigated tissues whereas ZmGolS1 and ZmGolS2 are predominantly in galactinol production during seed development and germination (Zhao et al., 2004). In current study, BdGolS1 was grouped with the ZmGolS1, 2, and 3, proposing that this gene may show various functions in plant stress conditions. SlGolS1 was the most divergent protein sequence and distinctly separated from other GolS proteins. This gene showed the different expression pattern in tomato that SlGolS1 was induced by dehydration in germinating seeds; in contrast, it was induced by dehydration coupled with cold in seedling leaves (Downie et al., 2003). Interestingly, any GolS proteins from Solanum and Brachypodium were not grouped together in phylogenetic tree. Blanc and Wolfe (2004) reported that 62% of duplicated genes in Arabidopsis indicated a difference in expression pattern and it may prove the divergences in functions. Based on this data, various phylogenetic relationships and clustering among the GolS genes in same species can be explained the duplications of GolS genes in Solanum and Brachypodium during the course of evolution and these duplications may cause the divergence of GolS functions against the different stress conditions in plant growth and development.

3D models were constructed for all SlGolS and BdGolS proteins (Fig. 6
                        ). It was predicted that SlGolS1 has 11 α-helices and 10 β-strands; SlGolS2 has 11 α-helices and 10 β-strands; SlGolS3 has 11 α-helices and 10 β-strands; SlGolS4 has 11 α-helices and 10 β-strands; BdGolS1 has 14 α-helices and 20 β-strands, and BdGolS2 has 10 α-helices and 8 β-strands. In general, SlGolS proteins had a well conserved secondary structure than that of BdGolS proteins.

In cotton, GhGolS1 contained 10 strands and 17 α-helices; these strands located in the core and helices surrounded this core (Zhou et al., 2012a). In maize, ZmGolS3 contained 20 α-helices, 7 β-strands and a large amount of loose coils (Sengupta et al., 2012). In current study, it was found to be 10 β-strands (except for BdGolS1 and BdGolS2) and 11 α-helices. This structural divergence in Brachypodium may be related with the functional diversities of GolS genes in monocots. Sengupta et al., (2012) reported that proteins containing high proportion of loops can support the flexible protein structure. Thus, high proportion of loops in GolS proteins may prove their relevance to biological fitness. Binding sites of GolS proteins showed various patterns; Asp143, Pro165, Arg166, Pro167, Asn172, Gln203 and Cys246 predicted for SlGolS1; Asp146, Cys147, Lys180, Pro181, Asn186, Gln217 and Cys260 predicted for SlGolS2; Asp124, Asp149, Asn190, Gln221 and Cys264 predicted for SlGolS3; Phe27, Leu28, Ala29, Tyr34, Asp119, Gly120, Gln170 and Gln216 predicted for SlGolS4; 146Asp, 147Cys, 181Pro, 187Asn, 218Gln and 261Cys predicted for BdGolS1; 140Asp, 166Val, 167Ser, 179Tyr, 181Asn, 212Gln, 254Tyr, 255Cys, 256Ala and 257Ala predicted for BdGolS2. In maize, it can be predicted that Asp123, Asp125 and Ala266 are involved in Mn+ binding while Phe31, Leu32, Ala33, Gly34, Tyr38, Ile103, Asp123, Ala124, Asp125, Asn191, Ala192, Gly193, Gly222, His263, Cys265 and Lys270 play role in binding UDP–sugar in ZmGolS (Sengupta et al., 2012). Variations in predicted binding sites may be related with different functions of GolS proteins.

Model quality was validated by Ramachandran plot analysis; 89.4%, 89.9%, 89.5% and 88.7% of residues were in favored region; 4.9%, 4.4%, 5.7% and 4.7% of residues were in allowed region, and 5.7%, 5.6%, 4.9% and 6.6% of residues were in outlier region in SlGolS1, SlGolS2, SlGolS3 and SlGolS4, respectively. For B. distachyon, 90.6% and 89.1% of residues were in favored region; 4.5% and 6.5% of residues were in allowed region, and 4.9% and 4.5% of residues were in outlier region in BdGolS1 and BdGolS2, respectively. This shows that 3D models are fairly in good quality.

In conclusion, we have performed a comparative in silico analysis of plant GolS genes/proteins in 11 different plant species, with an emphasis on tomato and Brachypodium. In this context, upstream, UTR and coding regions of genes were comparatively analyzed; physico-chemical properties and conserved motifs of proteins were determined; 3D structure of proteins was predicted, and phylogenetic tree was constructed. The results of this study can contribute to understanding of the structure and biological role of GolS genes/proteins in different plant species but wet-lab studies are needed to confirm the results of in silico analyses.
