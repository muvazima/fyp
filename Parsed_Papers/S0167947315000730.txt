Nonparametric kernel density estimator

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  Cross-validation methodologies have been widely used as a means of selecting tuning parameters in nonparametric statistical problems. In this paper we focus on a new method for improving the reliability of cross-validation. We implement this method in the context of the kernel density estimator, where one needs to select the bandwidth parameter so as to minimize 
                        
                           
                              L

                      risk. This method is a two-stage subsampling-extrapolation bandwidth selection procedure, which is realized by first evaluating the risk at a fictional sample size 
                        m
                        
                        
                           (
                           m
                           ≤
                           sample size  
                           n
                           )
                        
                      and then extrapolating the optimal bandwidth from 
                        m
                      to 
                        n
                     . This two-stage method can dramatically reduce the variability of the conventional unbiased cross-validation bandwidth selector. This simple first-order extrapolation estimator is equivalent to the rescaled “bagging-CV” bandwidth selector in Hall and Robinson (2009) if one sets the bootstrap size equal to the fictional sample size. However, our simplified expression for the risk estimator enables us to compute the aggregated risk without any bootstrapping. Furthermore, we developed a second-order extrapolation technique as an extension designed to improve the approximation of the true optimal bandwidth. To select the optimal choice of the fictional size 
                        m
                      given a sample of size 
                        n
                     , we propose a nested cross-validation methodology. Based on simulation study, the proposed new methods show promising performance across a wide selection of distributions. In addition, we also investigated the asymptotic properties of the proposed bandwidth selectors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cross-validation methodology has long been a popular method for selecting tuning parameters in non and semiparametric models. However, it has also been criticized for its high variability and its corresponding tendency to overfit the data.

This paper develops new methods for the improvement of the conventional cross-validation procedures. It is based on a blending of 
                        U
                     -statistic estimation and asymptotic theory. These new methods are realized by estimating the cross-validation risk with small training sets, then extrapolating the results to the desired sample size. The extrapolation step requires some asymptotic theory, but only the rate of convergence, not any unknown constants. We will show that such a two-stage procedure can dramatically reduce the high variability and overfitting that is the major liability of the conventional unbiased cross-validation.

We view our results as part of the following paradigm: when one is estimating nonparametrically a statistical property of samples of target size 
                        m
                     , such as the risk inherent in using a particular model, then one can do a much more accurate estimation when the target 
                        m
                      is much smaller than the actual sample size 
                        n
                     . The intuition is that there are many, many more subsamples of size 
                        n
                        /
                        2
                     , say, than there are subsamples of size 
                        n
                      or 
                        n
                        −
                        1
                     .

To motivate our extrapolation methodology, we will here show how it works when used in risk estimation in the context of nonparametric kernel density estimation. In the process we will also show that for this problem the risk function for arbitrary 
                        m
                      is surprisingly simple. In particular, cross-validation estimation at an arbitrary training sample size of 
                        m
                      does not require repeated subsampling at size 
                        m
                     , thereby greatly speeding up and improving accuracy of the methods we propose. We believe this to be a major new insight in the kernel density estimation literature.

To simplify notation, consider a univariate random variable 
                        X
                        ∈
                        R
                     . In statistical practice, we often know little about the underlying distribution of 
                        X
                      which is crucial in exploratory or inferential analysis (Silverman, 1986). So, our main task is to estimate the unknown density function 
                        f
                        
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      based on a set of observations. In this paper, we focus on the nonparametric kernel density estimator (Fix and Hodges, 1951). Given an i.i.d. sample of size

                      However, our proposed methodologies do not depend on the choice of 
                        K
                     , and the theoretical results in this paper will be stated in terms of an arbitrary symmetric kernel function 
                        K
                      of order 
                        r

                     . For the definition of the order of a kernel function, please see Turlach (1993).

Although one has free choice of the kernel function in a density estimator, the choice of the bandwidth 
                        h
                      is generally viewed as much more crucial. In order to select the optimal smoothing parameter 
                        h
                     , we need to evaluate how closely 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    f
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              h
                           
                        
                      can approximate 
                        f
                      for a given data set. Most bandwidth selectors are based on first choosing a risk function that measures the error made in using a particular bandwidth 
                        h
                     . One can then estimate the risk function for a given data set and choose the bandwidth that minimizes the empirical risk. Such bandwidth selectors are referred to as data-driven methods.

The main result of this paper is to propose a two-stage subsampling-extrapolation bandwidth selection procedure. This work is closely related to the rescaled bagging cross-validation method of Hall and Robinson (2009) and the partitioned cross-validation method of Marron (1987). Recent work involving bagging and subsampling in problems other than kernel density estimation includes Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) and Shah and Samworth (2012). Unlike the bandwidth selectors discussed in Park and Marron (1990) and Sheather and Jones (1991), which are based on asymptotic theory, our proposed methodology is a hybrid of the cross-validation method and the asymptotic theory. As such it does not require the estimation of

We present an extensive simulation study in Section  4.1 to compare the proposed methods with the conventional cross-validation estimator. It will be seen that our bandwidth selectors achieve a smaller expected integrated square error that is much closer to the theoretical optimum than the standard cross-validation. Moreover, a comparison of the proposed methods to indirect cross-validation (Savchuk et al., 2011, 2010; Mammen et al., 2012) can be found in Section  4.2. In addition, we compare our methods to the asymptotic selection of the subsample size 
                        m
                      that was described in Marron (1987).

In this section, we will derive a simple 
                        U
                     -statistic form estimator for the risk that arises from

                      distance. It is a new representation for the unbiased risk estimator and enables us to calculate the aggregated risk at subsamples of size 
                        m

                      much more efficiently than the repeated bootstrapping done in Hall and Robinson (2009) or the partitioning method used in Marron (1987).

Following the footsteps of Ray and Lindsay (2008) and Lindsay and Liu (2009), we propose to estimate the risk at sample sizes 
                           m
                         that may be much smaller than the actual size 
                           n
                        . Our 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         paradigm motivates us to hypothesize that these estimators will have much lower variability. Our simulations verify this. We also know that the cross-validation criterion for bandwidth selection tends to choose the bandwidths that are too small, and so overfit the density (Loader, 1999). As we will show, the new methodology particularly avoids the overfitting problem by reducing the chances of selecting a small bandwidth. Throughout this paper, we use 
                           m
                         to represent the subsample size, which we might also call the fictional sample size. As we will see, it is closely related to the training sample size in cross-validation.

                                 U
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 ,
                                 m
                              
                           
                         is equivalent to the unbiased cross-validation formula when 
                           m
                           =
                           n
                        . That is, both of them are unbiased estimates for the relative MISE and are functions of the order statistics (modulo terms that do not depend on 
                           h
                        ). In addition, the un-rescaled bagging cross-validation bandwidth selector proposed by Hall and Robinson (2009) is actually nothing more than the bandwidth selector based on (2.9) if one makes the bootstrap size equal to 
                           m
                        . However, the simple expression for our 
                           U
                        -statistic risk estimator enables us to compute the aggregated risk much more efficiently than bootstrapping. First, we can generally compute the complete 
                           U
                        -statistics, being of order two, much more efficiently than subsampling subsets of size 
                           m
                        . Secondly, the calculations can be done for all 
                           m
                         at once, in effect.

If we minimize (2.9) over 
                           h
                         by setting the derivative in 
                           h
                         to zero, we have

                           It is easy to plot the empirical curve

                                             ˆ

                               for any particular data set. If the empirical curve is not monotonic decreasing in the region of 
                                 m
                               values of interest, we would recommend against using extrapolation or plug-in methods.

In this section we will examine several ways to use 
                        m

                        n
                      risk estimation to improve performance in 
                        
                           
                              L

The simplest way to use the reduced variability of the risk estimator for smaller values of 
                           m
                         is to pick the bandwidth 
                           h
                         selected based on 
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 ,
                                 m
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              h
                              )
                           
                        . In addition to reducing variance in 
                           h
                         estimation, however, one is introducing bias, and so one must consider the trade-off that occurs between bias and variance.

We carried out a simulation study that indicated that as 
                           m
                         decreased the optimal bandwidth 
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 m
                              
                           
                         became larger (see the 2012 Pennsylvania State University Ph.D. thesis of Q. Wang which is available electronically from Pennsylvania State University library). The average integrated square error decreased as one used fictional size 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         until 
                           m
                         reached a certain threshold, beyond which further improvement in MISE could not be achieved. For instance, in the standard normal case half-sampling with 
                           m
                           =
                           n
                           /
                           2
                         gave us the smallest simulated MISE, with an improvement of about 12% over 
                           m
                           =
                           n
                         for samples of size 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                        . This conclusion agrees with the result in Hall and Robinson (2009).

Although using a fictional size 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         can help to reduce the variability of the bandwidth selector and therefore achieve a smaller MISE, it turns out there are simple techniques to reduce this bias without increasing variance. We will show next in Section  3.2 how to do this.

We now propose a two-stage, subsampling-extrapolation, approach in bandwidth selection. We will first develop a first-order extrapolated bandwidth selector. Motivated by the rule-of-thumb criterion, the two pieces we combine are the estimated optimal bandwidth at 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         and the rate of convergence of the estimator as 
                           n
                           →
                           ∞
                        . Later we will offer further refinements to this method. We will then provide a simulation comparison of all methods.

                           log
                           
                              
                                 m

                         and 
                           log
                           h
                         found in (2.7). Fig. 1 displays the comparison between the rule-of-thumb criterion and the optimal risk criterion on the log–log scale when the underlying distribution 
                           f
                         is the standard normal, and the kernel function 
                           K
                         is Gaussian. It can be seen that for a fixed value of 
                           m
                         the rule of thumb always yields a smaller bandwidth than the one given by the exact risk curve, but their left hand asymptotes match.

Our derivation of (3.1) from the rule-of-thumb selection rule was heuristic. We therefore show more formally that this relationship is valid for any arbitrary smooth kernel function 
                           K
                         and density function 
                           f
                        . The following lemma verifies this statement. For proof, please see Appendix.

According to Lemma 1, the optimal risk curve approaches the rule-of-thumb straight line on log–log scale as 
                           log
                           h
                           →
                           −
                           ∞
                        . In particular, when one considers a Gaussian kernel, the order of the kernel function 
                           r
                         is 2. In this case, we would have 
                           d
                           log

                              (
                              h

                           /
                           
                              (
                              d
                              log
                              h
                              )
                           
                           →
                           −
                           5
                         as 
                           h
                           →
                           0
                        . This confirms that the asymptotic slope of the optimal risk curve in Fig. 1 is indeed −5, the same as the slope of the rule-of-thumb straight line.

As a result, if one knows the bandwidth selected for 
                           m
                        , one simple way to remove the bias introduced by using 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         is to extrapolate the bandwidth selected at size 
                           m
                         to the optimal value at 
                           n
                         based on the approximate linear relationship between

For any particular density 
                           f
                         there will exist an optimal choice of the fictional size 
                           m
                         such that it optimizes the trade-off between bias and variance of the bandwidth selector. Fig. 2
                         shows the density curves for the sampling distributions of the simple subsampling bandwidth selector

                         from the standard normal distribution. This plot demonstrates graphically how the first-order extrapolation corrected for the bias incurred by using 
                           m
                           <
                           n
                         while simultaneously reducing variability over standard cross-validation (

                           h
                         that were “too small”, corresponding to overfitting. Later in Table 4 it will be seen that the first order extrapolation improved the MISE efficiency ratio,

                        , of the standard cross-validation from 64% to over 80%. Here EISE stands for expected integrated square error. The use of EISE rather than MISE in assessing bandwidth selectors was suggested by Jones (1991). In our simulation section we will determine the optimal value of 
                           p
                           =
                           m
                           /
                           n
                         for a number of sampling distributions. It will be shown there that the optimal value of 
                           p
                         varies somewhat based on the smoothness of the density, but 
                           p
                           =
                           0.3
                         worked well for many. One possible strategy for the extrapolation estimator is to use a fixed value of 
                           p
                         regardless of the data. We will compare this strategy with a few others in the simulation section.

The first-order extrapolated bandwidth selector introduced in Section  3.2 is based on an approximate linear relationship between 
                           log

                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              h
                              )
                           
                         and 
                           log
                           h
                        . We have shown in Lemma 1 that the true optimal risk curve approaches the rule-of-thumb straight line as 
                           h
                         goes to 0. That is, the linear approximation is most accurate when 
                           h
                         is fairly small. Therefore, we wonder whether we could improve the approximation and seek a more accurate relationship between 
                           log
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              h
                              )
                           
                         and 
                           log
                           h
                         that would be useful for smaller values of 
                           n
                        .

Notice from Fig. 2 that the first-order extrapolated bandwidth tends to be biased, more and more so as the range of extrapolation increases. As the optimal risk curve of

It can be clearly seen that the second-order extrapolation curve was surprisingly close to the true optimal risk curve for the standard normal case. It should provide less bias than the first-order extrapolation, but it could add variability. In other words, we might expect the second-order extrapolation method to outperform the linear extrapolation bandwidth selector for cases where the density function is fairly smooth.

In our implementation of this second-order extrapolation in the simulation, we chose

                                       ˆ

                         for a given value of 
                           m
                        .

To illustrate the advantage of the second-order extrapolation in comparison with the first-order extrapolation, we revisited the numerical study presented in Fig. 2 but now implemented the second-order extrapolation technique. In Fig. 4
                         we compared the simulated density plots of the first-order and second-order bandwidth selectors when the fictional sample size 
                           m
                           =
                           0.1
                           n
                           ,
                           0.3
                           n
                           ,
                           0.5
                           n
                         or 
                           1.0
                           n
                        . It is clearly seen that for small values of 
                           m
                        , the improvement of the bandwidth selector based on second-order extrapolation is noticeable.

We will see in our simulation section that the optimal fictional size for both first and second-order extrapolation depends on the choice of 
                           p
                           =
                           m
                           /
                           n
                        . In real problems one cannot determine the optimal choice of the fictional size 
                           m
                           =
                           p
                           n
                         that minimizes the risk at 
                           n
                        . As a result, when implementing the two-stage bandwidth selection procedure, one needs to either fix the choice of 
                           m
                         prior to bandwidth selection, or implement an automatic, data-driven method to pick the best choice of 
                           m
                         based on a data set. Previous literature, such as Hall and Robinson (2009), Shah and Samworth (2012), and Shao (1993), suggest to use 
                           m
                           ≤
                           n
                           /
                           2
                        . However, in their papers there does not exist an automatic selection method for picking the best choice of 
                           m
                         in the subsampling (or bagging) procedure. Here we propose a nested cross-validation methodology in selecting the optimal fictional sample size 
                           m
                         that overcomes the drawback of choosing fictional size 
                           m
                         subjectively. This method seems to perform consistently well across a wide selection of distributions (Section  4.1). We note that this two-layer cross-validation is made computationally feasible by our 
                           U
                        -statistic estimation of the bandwidth selector curve.

Let 
                           p
                           =

                         be the fixed proportion of data used in the fictional sample. We consider a cross-validation strategy for selecting 
                           p
                        . Let

                               can be obtained with the help of Corollary 6.4.1. in Aldershof et al. (1995). We refer to Marron’s formula as MCV. Based on Marron’s formula, 
                                 p
                               goes to zero as 
                                 n
                               goes to infinity. To compute the optimal partition size, one needs to estimate the integrated square derivatives of the unknown density function using two-stage estimators such as those proposed in Jones and Sheather (1991). We will compare Marron’s formula with our nested cross-validation proposal through simulation studies in Section  4.1.

We have now developed four possible methods for bandwidth selection based on subsampling plus extrapolation: we have the first- and second-order extrapolations carried out at a fixed, pre-chosen 
                        p
                     , plus the two extrapolation methods using 
                        p
                      chosen from a nested cross-validation. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed two-stage bandwidth selection procedures, we conducted the following simulation studies.

We consider 
                           R
                           =
                           500
                         random samples of size 
                           n
                         (
                           n
                           =
                           100
                         or 200) drawn independently from a certain distribution. A list of the seven distributions under consideration can be found in Table 1
                        , among which there are bimodal/multimodal, outlying, and heavy-tailed distributions. A particularly difficult density is the claw, with 5 extreme spikes, each with only 10% of the data. As we will see later in Table 4, it will create an outlier in our results. Other literature that consider the claw density and notice its unusual behavior include Marron and Wand (1992) and Loader (1999).

For each subset taken out of 
                           
                              
                                 X

                        , we consider ten possible values of 
                           p
                           =
                           m
                           /
                           n
                        , i.e. 
                           p
                           =
                           0.1

                           1.0
                        . In selecting the optimal choice of 
                           p
                        , we first compare the performance between the nested cross-validation with 
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           =
                           n
                           /
                           2
                         and Marron’s formula (see Remark 3). We compute percent of times each 
                           p
                         value is selected out of the 500 replications based on each method. Tables 2 and 3
                        
                         reveal that the selection of 
                           p
                         is quite noisy for 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                        , but does improve for 
                           n
                           =
                           200
                        . In making comparisons between the two methods, one should notice that Marron’s optimal 
                           p
                         is not exactly the minimizer of Eq. (3.7) but the asymptotic minimizer of

                         being the minimizer of MISE. Regardless of the different target functions for minimization, Marron’s formula has less variation than our nested method, and so might be expected to show somewhat better performance. We will investigate this point in our simulation section.

Next, we conduct an empirical investigation of how well one could estimate the optimal

                        . For several samples from each distribution, we plot the empirical expected integrated square error (EISE) curve as a function of 
                           p
                         based on formula (3.8) in order to see whether we could do a good job at estimating the risk as a function of 
                           p
                        . In Fig. 5
                         each of the panels displays three empirical curves (dashed curve) based on three random samples of size

                           =
                           100
                        , taken from the corresponding distribution, and the theoretical true risk curve (solid curve) at size 
                           n

                        . (The curves for t(2) distribution are omitted here, as they show similar pattern as in the normal case.) Although the empirical curves are quite variable, the shape of each curve seems to follow the truth in most of the cases except the claw density. Thus, we will use the nested cross-validation methodology in the following discussions.

We then compare the performance of different bandwidth selectors in terms of the efficiency ratio,

                           n
                         samples, the optimal choice of 
                           p
                         at size 
                           n
                         is not obtainable. We first determine how the optimal choice of 
                           p
                         varies over our sampling distributions. In Table 4
                         EX1 and EX2 stand for first- and second-order extrapolations respectively. In the last two columns of Table 4, one can see the relative efficiency ratio that can be attained when one uses the optimal value of 
                           p
                         for that density. The optimal 
                           p
                         seems to vary somewhat over the densities. One can also see that the second-order extrapolation, with optimal 
                           p
                        , seems to do better than first-order extrapolation. After comparing the EISE over a grid of values of 
                           p
                        , we choose to use 
                           p
                           =
                           0.3
                         for the fixed-
                           p
                         first-order extrapolation and 
                           p
                           =
                           0.2
                         for the fixed-
                           p
                         second-order extrapolation; these values seem to yield satisfactory results across a wide range of distributions.

Then, we focus on the comparison between the four proposed bandwidth selectors, i.e. the first- and second-order extrapolated bandwidth selectors with pre-chosen 
                           p
                         or with nested cross-validation, and the unbiased cross-validated bandwidth selector. In addition, we also include the comparison between Marron’s formula (see Remark 3) and nested cross-validation in selecting the optimal 
                           p
                         in the context of first-order extrapolation. Because Marron (1987) only focuses on the study of first-order extrapolation, the comparison between Marron’s optimal 
                           p
                         and the nested cross-validation method is only fair for the first-order extrapolated bandwidth selector

Our first observation from Table 4 is that the results from the claw density are distinctly different from the rest. This density is considered in Loader (1999) to demonstrate that plug-in methodologies could perform very poorly relative to conventional cross-validation. Van Es (1992) shows that the relative rate of convergence of ordinary cross-validation bandwidth selector is faster for non-smooth cases, such as in the case of claw density. It is noted in Marron and Wand (1992) that the true MISE curve of the claw density has local minima when the sample size

                         shape in the region of 
                           m
                         of interest as seen in Fig. 7
                        . It is clear from this plot why extrapolation of this curve can work so poorly at some sample sizes. Only when 
                           n
                         increases to above 100, does the MISE curve start to have an obvious global minima. In this example, we have found that the efficiency ratio for the plug-in bandwidth selector of Sheather and Jones (1991) is as small as 9.9% for 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                         and 6.1% for 
                           n
                           =
                           200
                        . Our extrapolation methods do perform much better than plug-in methods in the case of claw density. Moreover, a user who follows our advice not to use extrapolation methods or plug-in when 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       m
                                    
                                    
                                       ˆ
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              h
                              )
                           
                         is non-monotonic in the region of interest would end up using conventional cross-validation most of the time.

If we ignore the claw density, we can make the following general observations: If we compare the methods that use first-order extrapolation, it is clear that for both sample sizes 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                         and 
                           n
                           =
                           200
                        , the fixed-
                           p
                         method yields slightly better results than nested cross-validation. The performance of Marron’s formula is similar to our proposed nested cross-validation in the context of first-order extrapolation at sample size 
                           n
                           =
                           100
                        , but MCV shows a small systematic superiority over NCV at 
                           n
                           =
                           200
                        . However, the realization of Marron’s formula involves complex formulas as defined in Remark 3. Overall, we could obtain over 80% efficiency in all cases. The fixed-
                           p
                         second-order extrapolation is almost a clear winner over the fixed-
                           p
                         first-order extrapolation. Moreover, the nested cross-validation using second-order extrapolation gives very similar performance as the fixed-
                           p
                         second order extrapolation. Both seem promising bandwidth selection tools.

In conclusion, we note that fixed-
                           p
                         first-order extrapolation is a computationally inexpensive way to improve upon standard cross-validation when 
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              h
                              )
                           
                         is reasonably behaved. For additional refinements, one can apply the second-order extrapolation.

Following a referee’s suggestion, we will show below a numerical comparison between our proposed subsampling-extrapolation bandwidth selectors and the ICV bandwidth selector.

                         that our proposed bandwidth selectors perform comparably, or even better, than the indirect cross-validation bandwidth selector. 
                           Remark 4
                           Although indirect cross-validation bears similarity with our subsampling-extrapolation method, we use extrapolation techniques differently. Their method is to shift the optimal risk curve based on a selection kernel, say

                              . It seems possible to implement extrapolation techniques in indirect cross-validation. That is, one can implement subsampling-extrapolation method on the risk curve based on a selection kernel, then shift the selected bandwidth to one that is based on a Gaussian kernel.

                           p

In short, the relative rate of convergence for the second-order extrapolated bandwidth selector is the same as the first-order extrapolation method in both cases that 
                           p
                         is a fixed constant and 
                           p
                         is dependent on 
                           n
                        . However, we have illustrated that it can improve upon the first-order extrapolation methodology and reduce the positive bias in finite sample scenarios.

This paper has been focusing on the discussion of one particular scenario, risk estimation and bandwidth selection in a kernel density estimator. However, the proposed subsampling-extrapolation procedures can be easily generalized to other important problems in which one seeks an optimal smoothing parameter as long as some basic asymptotic results about rates of convergence are known. In addition, the subsampling-extrapolation technique could be in theory extended to other interesting applications, such as variance estimation and quantile estimation; we will study these applications in another paper. In particular, when considering the estimation of a 
                        U
                     -statistic variance, the application of extrapolation techniques can enable one to relax the restriction of the kernel size needed in the unbiased variance estimator of a general 
                        U
                     -statistic devised in Wang and Lindsay (2014).

From another aspect, the two-stage bandwidth selection procedure can be easily applied to cases where the risk is evaluated based on the Kullback–Leibler distance. We have preliminary simulation result showing that similar conclusions hold when one changes the loss function from 
                        
                           
                              L
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      to Kullback–Leibler distance. The asymptotic properties of Kullback–Leibler risk (also called likelihood cross-validation) are quite complex, as discussed in Hall (1987). van Es (1991) found the rate of convergence of a likelihood cross-validation bandwidth selector for a bounded kernel function 
                        K
                      over the unit interval, a more general result for any arbitrary kernel does not seem present.

There are a number of possible ways to tune our methods. For example, we used 
                        
                           
                              n
                           
                           
                              ∗
                           
                        
                        =
                        n
                        /
                        2
                      for nested cross-validation without further inspection. We did not try to tune the risk estimation for 
                        p
                     , even though the selection mechanism showed some significant bias at 
                        n
                        =
                        100
                     . Notice from Tables 2 and 3 that at sample size 
                        n
                        =
                        100
                     , nested cross-validation tends to over-select small values of 
                        p
                     . One possible solution to avoid selecting small 
                        p
                      is to implement the “1-SE rule” (Breiman et al., 1984) in nested cross-validation based on a reasonable estimation of the standard error of the risk estimator. According to the 1-SE rule, one would choose the largest

                      no more than one standard error above the minimum risk score. We have investigated the application of jackknife variance estimator in the 1-SE rule. However, due to the large positive bias of jackknife variance estimator, there was no gain in applying the 1-SE rule in this scenario. In addition, as seen in Fig. 5 many of the empirical risk curves are fairly flat, indicating that choosing a smaller 
                        p
                      value in the stage of nested cross-validation may not have a large effect on the final bandwidth selector.
