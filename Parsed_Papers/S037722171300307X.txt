                  This paper studies an image collection planning problem for a Korean satellite, KOMPSAT-2 (KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite-2). KOMPSAT-2 has the mission goal of maximizing image acquisition in time and quality requested by customers and operates under several complicating conditions. One of the characteristics in KOMPSAT-2 is its strip mode operation, in which segments of continuous-observation areas with known sizes are captured one at a time. In this paper, we regard the segment as a group of adjoining geographical square regions (scenes), whose size must also be determined. Thus, the problem involves the determination of proper segment lengths as well as an image collection schedule. We present a binary integer programming model for this problem in a multi-orbit long-term planning environment and provide a heuristic solution approach based on the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods. We also present the results of our computational experiment based on randomly generated data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The satellite imagery, one of the major satellite-based services, has been utilized in various practical areas, such as natural disasters management, Geographic Information System (GIS), and cartography. KOMPSAT-2 (KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite-2), a Korea’s earth observing satellite, was launched with the goal of high level resolution image acquisition. It is equipped with a multi-spectral camera that can acquire panchromatic images in 1meter resolution and color images in 4meter resolution. With KOMPSAT-2, the pictures of buildings and even a car can be obtained. KOMPSAT-2 operates under several complicating operational constraints such as camera roll tilt, satellite resource availability, weather conditions, and order priorities.

The satellite image collection planning problems are known to be difficult in practice. Because customer requests usually span large geographical areas and their images can only be obtained from certain satellite orbits, each of the requested areas is usually divided into several small-size continuous-observation areas, which are called segments. Under the strip mode operation, the satellite collects the segments one at a time. The length of a segment is determined beforehand by an expert based on the configuration of the region of interests before the image collection planning starts. Given a set of several segments, many of which are overlapping, the planning problem becomes a selection problem to choose as many non-overlapping segments as possible under several operational constraints.

The expert-oriented approach, which is currently used for KOMPSAT-2, has two significant drawbacks. The first is the dependence on expert’s intuition. Depending on who the experts are, the outcome varies. It is hard to tell whether a poor schedule is due to an inadequate choice of segment lengths or an ill-judged selection of non-overlapping segments. The second is the difficulty with the growing number of customer requests. The number of feasible task sequences to schedule explodes as the number of customer orders increases. Such an explosion brings many challenges to the service providers who try to satisfy customer requests as much as possible under the complicated operational constraints.

In this paper we present an approach that deals with the Korea’s satellite image collection planning problem. Specifically, we present a practical method that is free from expert intuition and that can also handle a large number of customer requests. To this end, we consider the segment as a group of adjoining geographical square regions (scenes), whose size must also be determined. Thus, the problem involves the determination of proper segment lengths as well as an image collection schedule. Our approach includes a binary integer programming model for the problem in a multi-orbit long-term planning environment and a heuristic solution procedure that uses the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides previous studies in the literature. In Section 3, we describe the satellite image collection planning problem and the parameters for KOMPSAT-2. A pre-processing procedure is also described in that section. In Section 4, we present a binary integer programming model for the problem. In Section 5, we describe a heuristic decomposition method which uses the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods to solve the problem. Section 6 provides the computational results of our numerical experiments on randomly generated test data. The concluding remarks and future works are provided in Section 7.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Many researchers developed mathematical models to solve different practical versions of the satellite image collection planning problem. Bensana et al. (1996), Vasquez and Hao (2001), Mansour and Dessouky (2010), and Ribeiro et al. (2010) studied the daily photograph scheduling problem (DPSP) associated with the SPOT5, which was developed by CNES (French Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales). Bensana et al. (1996) focused on a daily scheduling and formulated the problem as an integer linear programming problem, aka the variable-valued constraint satisfaction problem. They used the data from CNES, which became a benchmark data set for the DPSP in several computational comparison studies. Vasquez and Hao (2001), quoting the problem description in Bensana et al. (1996), generalized the satellite image collection planning as a version of the knapsack model, in which the objective was to maximize a profit function. They proposed a Tabu search algorithm to determine the image collection schedule. Mansour and Dessouky (2010) developed a genetic algorithm to solve the problem in Vasquez and Hao (2001). Ribeiro et al. (2010) presented a model which extended Vasquez and Hao (2001)’s formulation. They used CPLEX to solve the set of benchmark instances by CNES. Gabrel and Vanderpooten (2002) considered the problem with roll-tilt constraints as an extension of the single-satellite–single-orbit scheduling problem (Gabrel et al., 1997). They formulated the problem as a multi criteria longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph and proposed a two-stage approach, which consisted of a path generation stage and a path selection stage, to solve the problem in an interactive environment.


                     Wolfe and Sorensen (2000) described the scheduling problem in the NASA’s earth observation system as a window-constrained packing problem. They focused on the maximization of the total number of collected images. They proposed and compared three algorithms, a dispatch algorithm, a look-ahead algorithm, and a genetic algorithm. However, they noted that the computation time or the solution quality would be hard to accept when the problem size grew large. To deal with large-scale problems, a number of researchers proposed to use decomposition methods. Lin et al. (2005) formulated the problem as an integer programming problem and applied the Lagrangian relaxation method to decompose the problem into independent subproblems. They maintained that the subproblems could be solved by an explicit enumeration method, which they called a linear search method, because the number of feasible solutions in each subproblem was relatively small. They also developed a Tabu search algorithm based on the algorithm in Vasquez and Hao (2001). Jin et al. (2008) used the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods to get upper bounds. They described the Lagrangian relaxation problem with the constraint graph that was used in Wolfe and Sorensen (2000). Also, they developed a greedy algorithm to schedule the image collection sequences.


                     Yao et al. (2010) studied a multi-satellite image collection scheduling problem. They decomposed the problem into single-satellite subproblems and developed a heuristic and two different meta-heuristic algorithms to generate task assignment schedules. Globus et al. (2002, 2003) also considered an image collection scheduling problem for multiple satellites and presented evolutionary meta-heuristic algorithms. More studies related to the satellite planning can be found in Bianchessi et al. (2007), Cordeau and Laporte (2005), Habet et al. (2010), Marinelli et al. (2011) and Sun et al. (2010).

Our study is distinguished from the earlier researches in the literature in two aspects. One of the two aspects is that we consider the satellite image collection problem as a scene based problem even in the strip mode operation while most researches handle the problem as a task (or job or segment) based problem. Our model chooses non-overlapping segments so as to maximize the total profit from collected scenes in a given period while the operational constraints are satisfied. This view point is important particularly when the mixture of the spot and strip modes is considered. For instance, the joint planning of image collections by KOMPSAT-2 with the strip mode operation and KOMPSAT-3 with the spot mode operation, which is scheduled to be deployed in near future, is of special interests to the service provider in Korea. The other aspect is the size of the problem considered in our study. The long-term image collection planning calls for the consideration of multiple orbits and usually results in very-large-scale image collection problems even for a moderate size of customer requests. For instance, for a problem instance with 100 customer requests tested in our experiment, hundreds of thousands of scenes are considered and hundreds of thousands of variables and millions of constraints have to be tackled in our model.

A customer order of the satellite images of a specific area defines AOI (Fig. 1
                           ). Since the requested area is usually of irregular shape, it is approximated by a rectangular region, namely AOI. Each customer order, or equivalently its AOI, includes specific requirements such as a due date, weather (cloud cover) conditions, customer-requested roll-tilt angles, and an order priority, all of which must be satisfied as much as possible when the task for the customer is accomplished. For convenience, the x–y coordinates of the corners of an AOI are expressed in clock-times of satellite orbit positions rather than in latitudes and longitudes.

A geographically large AOI is divided into several small-size scenes of equal width and length, which depends on the maximum observation area of KOMPSAT-2 (Fig. 1). A scene inherits the specific requirements of the AOI which it belongs to. In addition, it has a start time and an end time for image collection in each observable satellite orbit. KOMPSAT-2 operates in a near-polar, circular Sun-synchronous orbit at a height of 685kilometers.

In this study, a segment is defined as a set of adjoining scenes in an AOI as shown in Fig. 1. It represents an observation time window and must obey the operational requirements of KOMPSAT-2. Since KOMPSAT-2 has minimum and maximum duration for each observation, the length of a segment must lie between them. In our approach, the segments of varying lengths are generated in a pre-processing stage and they may overlap each other. Moreover, since KOMPSAT-2 can roll its camera angle, there can be more than one segment in the same time window.

The angular position of the satellite camera at the time of observation determines the quality of an image. The center position provides the highest quality image. It is possible to roll the camera angle to obtain the images of a segment at the expense of image quality. When customers order satellite images, they can specify acceptable ranges of roll tilt to meet their needs. The roll tilt operation must be carried out before the observation of a segment begins and it requires preparation time. The roll tilt cannot be altered once the observation of a segment starts until it is completed. Upon completion, the roll tilt can be adjusted for the next observation of another segment and the angle of the roll tilt change can take any value in [−a, a], where a is the limit on the angle of a roll tilt change between two consecutive observations.

Because KOMPSAT-2 operates under the strip mode, it captures the images of the candidate areas contiguously for at least 20seconds and at most 180seconds. Even if the candidate area is smaller than 20seconds of observation, equivalent to 10 captured scenes, KOMPSAT-2 would still collect extra wasted images by depriving the observation opportunities of other candidate areas. Intuitively, it is desirable to form the segments long enough, but it is impossible to decide their best lengths a priori. Thus, our problem is to decide both the image collection schedule and the segment lengths. The image collection schedule includes the start time and the end time of the image collection period, its orbit, and the roll tilts. The objective is to maximize the total weighted profit from the captured scenes for a given planning period. For practical propose, we assume that planners can determine the weights in the objective by considering relative importance of AOIs, such as customer priority and closeness to due dates.

Usually, the schedule of a day has effects on the next day scheduling. The collection of the best schedule for each day would not comprise a good long-term plan because of the short-sighted nature of the 1-day scheduling. Therefore, we consider the long-term image collection planning problem in this paper.

The satellite image collection planning problem for KOMPSAT-2 includes the following constraints:
                           
                              (a)
                              Orbits have an image acquisition time limit.

The satellite has a daily image acquisition time limit.

Orbits have a maximum number of segments that can be scheduled.

A pair of segments can be scheduled only if the setup time requirement between them is satisfied.

A pair of segments can be scheduled only if the angle to turn for the one that follows its predecessor is within the maximum allowable roll-tilt change angle.

A segment can be scheduled only if its roll tilt satisfies the customer-specified roll tilt.

A segment can be scheduled if its weather condition satisfies requested weather condition.

The satellite serves only one segment at one time.

The constraints (f) and (g) are enforced through a pre-processing step. After a set of candidate segments is generated based on the orbits, weather conditions and customer-specified roll tilts are checked and unfit segments are discarded from the set. The constraints (d) and (e) are simultaneously handled by a conflict set C, which is defined as a set of segment pairs that violate the constraint (d) or (e) in the pre-processing step. A pair of segments belongs to the conflict set if the minimum time-delay, i.e. setup time, requirement between the segments is violated. The segments of a pair in the conflict set cannot be scheduled together.

When customer requests are submitted their order information are stored in an order database. All image requests that have not been finished go through the pre-processing stage. The pre-processing stage includes three steps; a candidate-segment pool construction step, a weather-condition and roll-tilts check step, and a conflict set construction step. The result of the pre-processing stage provides a pool of segments for the succeeding optimization stage. After the optimization stage, deselected segments are put back to the order database whereas selected segments are activated for the daily scheduling.

In the pre-processing stage, we first construct a candidate-segment pool with available scene data. Fig. 2
                         depicts our method to generate candidate segments. In it, the rows represent the columns of an AOI, which are rotated by 90 degree clockwise. The cells in a row represent the scenes. In a row of n scenes, we successively construct the candidate segments of the maximum size, 90 scenes, from left to right (Fig. 2(1)). Similarly, we successively group the maximum number of scenes from right to left (Fig. 2(2)). Additional segments are constructed from the segments that have just been generated by making use of the differences between the end times of the overlapping segments, which would yield shorter segments (Fig. 2(3)). The segment construction procedure described here may be modified to include more candidate segments; in fact, with s the maximum number of scenes per segment, around s
                        *
                        n potential candidate segments could all be generated for each column of an AOI. But for obvious practical reasons, the total enumeration is ruled out.

Because weather conditions also have effects on the quality of collected images, it is essential to capture the images with low percentage of cloud covers. Like roll-tilt conditions, the customers can specify a limit on the percentage of cloud covers to meet their needs. After the candidate-segments are generated they are checked for the cloud cover conditions and the customer-specified roll tilts. If any violation occurs, the corresponding segments are removed from the candidate-segment pool. The final step of the pre-processing constructs a conflict set which consists of pairs of conflicting segments that violate the minimum time-delay requirement or the maximum roll-tilt change requirement, both of which must be satisfied between two successive segment observations. The minimum time-delay requirement is due to the set-up required for the camera preparation time. Upon the completion of the pre-processing stage, we have all the data and the parameters for the optimization of the satellite image collection planning for a given period.

Given a set of segments and a conflict set, we formulate the satellite image collection planning problem as a binary integer programming model. We use two kinds of binary decision variables in the formulation. An indicator variable 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           ∈
                           {
                           0
                           ,
                           
                           1
                           }
                        
                      specifies whether segment j in AOI i is scheduled or not. The other binary variable 
                        
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           ∈
                           {
                           0
                           ,
                           
                           1
                           }
                        
                      is used to indicate whether the scene k in AOI i is collected or not. Hereafter, we assume that each segment is associated with a unique day and orbit. This assumption is reasonable since a segment spanning two consecutive days or orbits can be split into two separate segments with a unique day and orbit. The notations used in the formulation are summarized below:

The objective in (P) is to maximize total profit from the collected scenes. The marginal profit coefficient may include factors such as weighted coverage, order priority, and penalty on due date violation. The first three constraints in (P) enforce the limits on the operation time per orbit, the operation time per day, and the number of scheduled segments per orbit, respectively. Constraint (4) prevents conflicts between the segments. The relationship between the segment and the scene can be established by imposing two conditions. One is that a scene can be collected if a scheduled segment contains it. Constraint (5) expresses this condition. The other is that if a segment is scheduled then all scenes that are contained in it must be collected. The latter condition can be expressed as

                      because the objective is to maximize to total profit. The assumption is generally acceptable in many practical situations, e.g., in the case when only the weighted coverage of scenes is considered, but the omitted constraint should be explicitly considered if the assumption does not hold.

Three observations can be made on the model constraint structure. First, (P) has a block diagonal structure with coupling constraints as shown in Fig. 3
                     . Constraint (5) forms a block diagonal structure. The coupling constraint structure is formed by Constraints (1)–(4). Second, the coupling constraints take the form of knapsack constraints. Third, Constraint (4) constitutes a large portion of constraints because of the cardinality of the conflict set.

We adopt the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods to obtain an upper bound on the objective function value in (P). Two different relaxation approaches are possible. One is to dualize Constraint (5) and the other is to dualize Constraints (1)–(4). Both approaches have advantages in solving the relaxed problem. In the former approach, the relaxed problem becomes a multi-dimensional knapsack problem, which can be solved by an efficient algorithm. In the latter, the relaxed problem can be decomposed into several small size subproblems. Considering the size of real world problem instances, often millions of constraints in Constraint (4) to consider, we adopt the latter approach.

The subgradient method is applied to obtain an optimal or near optimal solution of the Lagrangian dual problem. The subgradient method is a well-known approach to minimize a non-differentiable convex function. This method iteratively searches solutions along a subgradient direction of the function to find the minimum value. In our problem, the Lagrangian dual problem has a piece-wise convex function of 
                        
                           λ

By dualizing the coupling constraints, we can decompose the Lagrangian subproblem (LR(λ)) into several subproblems, which turn out to be integer programming problems of manageable sizes. For notational convenience, we suppress the superscript i and replace the coefficient of xj

To improve the solvability of (LRi
                        ), we develop a column-fixing rule that fixes a part of solution in advance by examining the cost structure of the segment variables. Since the segment variable xj
                      is free in (LRi
                        ), we could schedule a segment solely based on its cost coefficient. But, the selection of a segment affects the scene variables because the scenes that belong to a segment must be also scheduled if the segment is scheduled. Moreover, it influences the selection of the other segments. Thus, we consider upper and lower bounds on the contribution of a segment to the objective function. Let Gj
                      denote a set of indices of scenes that belong to the segment j. Then, the contribution of xj
                      to the objective function lies in an interval

The lower bound LB is obtained by a greedy insertion heuristic (Fig. 4
                     ). It starts with an empty schedule and successively selects the segments with the largest contribution to the objective function until no segment can be further scheduled. To restore the feasibility of the Lagrangian solution, we use a greedy deletion heuristic, in which all segments are initially scheduled and the segments of the least contribution to the objective function that reduce the infeasibility are sequentially deleted until the schedule becomes feasible.

Parameter γt
                      controls the step-size of the subgradient search direction. In our implementation, we initially set γt
                     
                     =2.0, then at every 20 iterations we compare the best and worst objective values of the Lagrangian relaxation solutions. If the difference between the two values is larger than 10%, γt
                      is halved. If the difference is within 1%, γt
                      is multiplied by 1.5. We terminate the subgradient method if the improvement ratio is less than 1% in 100 iterations. During the subgradient iteration, feasible solutions are sought by applying the greedy heuristics. Using the solution of (LR(λ)), we apply the deletion and the insertion greedy heuristics and update the lower bound if a better solution is found. The overall scheme of the proposed algorithm is provided in Fig. 5
                     .

In this section, we provide a detail description of our computational experiment on randomly generated problems of different sizes. We implemented the algorithm described in the previous section and compiled the code using Microsoft C# complier. Numerical experiments were carried out under WindowsXP OS on an Intel Dual-core 2.66gigahertz personal computer with 2gigabytes of memory. The integer programming subproblems in the subgradient algorithm were solved by CPLEX 12.4.

In the experiment, we generated random problem instances in accordance with the data structures of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. In particular, we focused on generating random data of European regions for a 31-day planning period. The objective in the experiment was to maximize the total coverage, i.e. the total number of scenes captured during the planning period. Five problem instances each for AOIs of small (10), medium (50,100), and large (200) sizes were randomly generated with the following attributes.
                        
                           •
                           The number of scenes in an AOI was randomly generated from U[20,70].

The roll tilt angles of AOIs were randomly selected from U[0,10].

The cloud coverage percentages were randomly generated from U[5,30].

The orbit interval was 5958.9seconds.

                      shows a map of a randomly generated problem instance.


                     Table 1
                      and Fig. 7
                      show the characteristics of the 20 randomly generated problem instances. In Table 1, the first column indicates the problem number which is represented by the number of AOIs followed by the instance numbers. The second and the third columns represent the numbers of days and orbits in the planning period, respectively. The 4th and 5th columns show the number of scenes to consider in the planning period and the number of the segments obtained by the pre-processing steps described in Section 3, respectively. The candidate segments in our experiment have the maximum length of 180seconds and the minimum duration of 40seconds. Even with a relatively small number of AOIs, the number of the constraints in (P) is large as shown in the 6th column in Table 1.

The following four methods have been tested on the randomly generated problem instances.

The greedy insertion heuristic is based on our segment generation scheme. In contrast to a simple greedy approach, which has no segment generation but just selects possible scenes successively according to the satellite movement, the greedy insertion heuristic successively selects the segments with the most significant contribution to the objective function. The priority dispatch algorithm given by Wolfe and Sorensen (2000) is originally developed for the scheduling problem in NASA’s Earth Observing Systems. Their approach consists of three phases, namely selection, allocation and optimization. The selection phase ranks unscheduled jobs according to priority or slack. The slack represents the number of available scheduling options (segments) for a job. Then, the allocation phase selects a job according to the rank criterion, i.e. the job with the smallest slack, and schedules the segments with the minimum length. Finally, the optimization phase adjust the scheduled segments by extending them just before any of the constraints in the model is violated. In our algorithm, a job and a slack can be interpreted as a column of consecutive scenes in an AOI and the number of consecutive scenes, respectively. We note that a direct comparison may be fruitless because of the differences in the problem settings, i.e. set-up times and utility function in scenes. To accommodate the set-up times, we have modified and implemented the priority dispatch algorithm so that the jobs with the largest slack, as opposed to the smallest, get the highest rank in the selection phase.

The test results of the randomly generated problem instances are summarized in Table 2
                     . The “err” in Table 2 indicates CPLEX memory error with no feasible solution. Moreover, the solution indicated by “*” is a best feasible solution without the guarantee of optimality. The solution with boldface indicates that the Lagrangian solution is the same as CPLEX solution.


                     Table 2 shows that the proposed approach provides near optimal solutions in the problem instances with 10- and 50-AOIs. All the problem instances with 10-AOIs and four of the five problem instances with 50-AOIs, CPLEX finds out the optimal solutions. However, if the problem sizes grow, i.e. the problem instances with 100- and 200-AOIs, CPLEX cannot produce any feasible solution in all but two problem instances.

Since CPLEX cannot find the optimal solutions when the problem size is large, we compare our approach with the greedy insertion heuristic and the priority dispatch algorithm. The 12th and 13th columns in Table 2 show the percentage gaps between the results obtained by the Lagrangian relaxation method and two local search procedures, i.e. the greedy insertion heuristic and the priority dispatch algorithm. The average gap percentage of the greedy insertion heuristic and the priority dispatch algorithm over the Lagrangian relaxation approach is 9.45/7.65, respectively, with the standard deviation of 5.23/6.13. The minimum gap percentage is 4.89/−0.54 and the maximum gap percentage is 26.68/27.06. Recall that the object of our problem is to maximize the number of collected scenes during the planning period. Table 3
                      shows the differences in the number of captured scenes between the Lagrangian relaxation method and the local search procedures. For all the problem instances tested, the Lagrangian relaxation method has resulted in more collected scenes except for the problem 10_3; at least 70/−4 scenes, at most 529/757 scenes and on average 254.8/256.6 scenes. As each image acquisition needs 2seconds per scene, the results in Table 3 indicate that by using the Lagrangian relaxation method we could save at least 140/−8seconds, at most 1058/1514seconds and on average 509.6/513.2seconds for image acquisition compared to the local search procedures.


                     Fig. 8
                      shows the average percentage gaps between the Lagrangian relaxation method and the local search procedures. The average improvement of the Lagrangian relaxation method in comparison to the local search procedures is above 5% for all problem sizes. In our computational experiments, the proposed algorithm is forced to terminate when the termination criterion is met or when the computation time for the subgradient step exceeds 3600seconds, whichever comes first.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have proposed an approach that handles the image collection planning problem for KOMPSAT-2, which includes the determination of proper segment lengths and an image collection schedule in a long-term planning environment. The proposed approach is free from expert intuition and it can handle the large number of customer requests. It is particularly well suited for the case when the number of customer orders is large and they are cluttered in a region or when the planning horizon is long. It is possible to additionally include decision variables to determine the segment length in the binary integer programming model. An investigation of a solution approach in this direction remains as a future study. Also, an extension of the method to deal with the joint operations of multiple satellites under the strip and the spot modes is worthy of further investigation.
