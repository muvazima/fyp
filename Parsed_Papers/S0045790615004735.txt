@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, with rapid technology development, increasingly sophisticated micro-embedded electronic devices and advances in wireless networks, more literature is being generated on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applications. WSNs are comprised of a large number of wireless sensor nodes. These wireless sensor nodes require environmental monitoring and sensing abilities, and must be small and easy to deploy in a variety of environments, with a wireless communication function, low power consumption and low cost characteristics. Their applications include: home security, video surveillance, lighting control, industrial applications, environmental monitoring, battlefield surveillance, biological detection [1,2], and so on. In addition to the application of WSNs, another research direction is the energy efficiency of wireless sensors. Since WSNs are scattered in various places, a large number of these wireless sensors will have sensed data sent to the base station (BS) or a sink [3,4]. Additionally, Chen et al. [5] proposed LEACH architecture with IBCA and the hybrid architecture with IBCA to further extend the system lifetime. These two architectures can achieve the distribution of energy loads, and reduce energy consumption when data is transmitted by sensor nodes.

Chen and Lai [6] suggested that sensor nodes (SNs) sending data to the sink node without calculating the distance may consume too much energy. In order to reduce the energy consumption of SNs, the multi-hop approach is used to find the relay nodes. These sensor nodes are called relay nodes. Muruganathan et al. [7] discussed a method for direct transmission protocol. This agreement must consider wireless sensor nodes and the distance to the sink. When the wireless sensor nodes send data directly to the sink, they consume too much energy, thereby affecting the wireless sensor node energy consumption rate. Therefore, in order to reduce energy consumption, help from other sensor nodes in forwarding data nodes can reduce the transmission distance; these sensor nodes are called relay nodes, with one turn passed to the next in one direction, they send data to the Base Station (BS) or sink, in a process called multi-hop transmission [8, 9] or indirect transfer. The multi-hop process not only consumes less energy but also extends the WSN life-time. Since wireless sensor energy is derived from a battery, once the battery is depleted of its limited power, the wireless sensor ceases to work properly [10].

These two transmission types have the same purpose which is to shorten the data transmission path to the sink, so the sensing node uses the forwarding method to adjacent nodes rather than direct transmission mode, thereby consuming significantly less energy; minimum energy consumption extends the lifecycle of WSNs. On the issue of energy efficiency, the current WSNs relevant agreements or algorithms' [11] main purpose is to reduce the wireless sensors' transmission energy consumption, and thus extend the reach of the whole life cycle of WSNs.

Kailas et al. [12] proposed an Opportunistic Large Array (OLA) algorithm to find numerous relay nodes. OLA refers to a large group of data forwarding relay nodes, which relay node data without coordination between themselves; when the node receives a broadcast from the source node, the node receiving the broadcast message sends the data broadcast until the destination node is reached. OLA is a kind of cooperative transmission routing. The drawback of the OLA algorithm is that it consumes too much unnecessary energy.

Thanayankizil et al. [13] proposed the Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm (OLACRA) to improve Kailas et al.'s protocol. OLACRA is sink-centered, forming a concentric architecture. When the source node wants to transmit data to the sink, it will broadcast the message to the inner layer to form the OLA area. A source node uses OLA areas to transmit data to the sink node. However, if the number of layers is excessive, the outer layer will become very large. If the outer layer becomes too large, the link between the inner and outer layers may not be established. If no link has been established, then no data can be transmitted. This study therefore aims to change the OLA form to establish the node's link, with appropriate relay nodes not consuming too much energy. Thus, two architectures are proposed including an Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm with Geographic Relay Nodes (OLACRA-GRN) architecture, and an Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm with Relay Nodes (OLACRA-RN) architecture in order to determine the appropriate reduction of the number of relay nodes and layer size. By improving these aspects, the proposed algorithm can reduce node energy consumption of nodes.

The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 consists of an investigation of related research regarding WSN data transmission methods; Section 3 provides details regarding the proposed OLACRA-GRN architecture for improving transmission; Section 4 provides details regarding the proposed OLACRA-RN architecture for improving transmission; Section 5 contains the simulation results; and Section 6 offers conclusions.

In recent years, many studies on routing algorithm, such as Karkvandi et al. [14] proposed the use of the greedy forwarding method to find a way to send data; when the node does not find neighbors to forward the information, it may result in the failure of greedy forwarding. Zhang and Shen [15] proposed Energy-Efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing (EBGR); geographic routing algorithms mainly employ sensor node one-hop neighbor nodes to determine the routing path transmission, thus avoiding maintenance of the overall network topology area and information overhead transmission of energy, in accordance with the characteristic adjustment algorithm to find the threshold of relay nodes for transmitting data to the BS.

EBGR geographic routing is shown in Fig. 1
                        ; first, node S wants to send data to node D, but the transmission range precludes node S from sending data to node D. After calculating the distance, it must search for the best relay node location, h, in the search range; through the RTS / CTS handshake mechanism it finds the most appropriate competent relay node, h, and forwards the data to node D.

Heinzelman et al. [16] proposed the First Order Radio Model (FORM) to calculate total energy consumption in WSNs. This energy model is applied in our proposed OLACRA-GRN and OLACRA-RN. FORM architecture is shown in Fig. 2
                        ; the left block is the transmitting terminal, and the right block is the receiving terminal.

Assuming that the terminal transmits nbits at distance d to the receiving terminal, and the energy of transmitting terminal is ETx
                        (n, d), the formula of ETx

Thanayankizil et al. [13] proposed the Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm (OLACRA); it was divided into two stages: stage one as downstream, and stage two as upstream. The downstream is the initialization phase, with the sink in the center of concentric circles, and the upstream as source node in the center of concentric circles.

                           , it means that the node can forward and decode messages. Nodes are randomly distributed in the sensing area. The density of sensing area is σ. In relative reference distance drsf

Kailas et al. [12] introduced a user-defined parameter called the transmission threshold τb
                           which is used to limit the participation threshold of the sending node to reduce the number of participating radio relay nodes. Therefore, they can reduce transferring energy OLACRA when data is sent by sensor nodes.

Thanayankizil et al. [13] proposed to improve the OLACRA expansion of concentric circles layer and upstream links issue. The first one is OLACRA with transmission threshold (OLACRA-T); it increases the user-defined threshold value τb
                            in the formation of concentric circles, divided into the convert transmission area and the non-convert transmission area, which receives energy less than the threshold limit value of τb
                            nodes to be employed in convert transfer, reducing the number of nodes in the convert transfer to save transmission energy consumption.

Another is OLACRA-T with limited flooding (OLACRA-FT); when the outer layer source as step size is too large, it results in the Upstream layer 1(U
                           1) area after not produce U
                           2, preventing data node convert transfer, In order to improve the upstream node which cannot be found in the transmission convert transfer, it increases the number of nodes participating in U
                           1 convert transfer. To improve the layer which is too large and does not participate as a transmission node, increasing the number of nodes participating in convert transfer, causes excessive node broadcasts. In order to save energy consumption, we limit the downstream in the broadcast; there is no convert transfer near the border node in the layer, so these nodes contribute little. Therefore, we proposed Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm with Geographic Relay Nodes (OLACRA-GRN) architecture and Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm with Relay Nodes (OLACRA-RN) architecture to improve the upstream connection problems.

We proposed OLACRA-GRN architecture, which is divided into two phases. Phase I is the analysis of the energy consumption; it is necessary to calculate the distance d between source node S and sink node D. If dis smaller than d
                     0, it means that the direct transmit is better. Otherwise, it needs to execute phase II. Phase II is using EBGR to find several suitable relay nodes to transmit the data. The flow chart of OLACRA-GRN architecture is shown as Fig. 3
                     . OLACRA-GRN need obtain the Geographic information of relay nodes.

In this section, if the source node wants to transmit data to the sink node, our proposed OLACRA-GRN architecture needs to know the position of the source and sink node. And then we can judge the number of relay nodes through analyzing the position of the source and sink node so as to reduce the energy consumption.

According to the research on wireless sensor networks, when a source node needs to send data to the sink center field area, it needs to know the source node and sink two point position information; by analyzing two known locations, the information determines the need to pass data through relay nodes in turn, to reduce the transmission energy consumption. Assume node S is the source node, and node D is the sink, Send data from node S to node D, as shown in Fig. 4
                        ; d is the distance from D to S.

                         is required to transmit the energy consumed by the power amplifier; α is the path loss coefficient.

When d is smaller than the threshold distance d
                        0, transfer node S does not require data transmitted through relay nodes, the information will be sent directly to the node D, representing saved energy. If the distance d is greater than the threshold d
                        0, it represents a direct transfer of energy consumption and a greater need to transfer data through relay nodes to save energy consumption.

Due to the use of two different energy models, OLACRA in the system model does not consider the electron energy Eelec
                        , but the First Order Radio Model energy models included the electron energy Eelec
                        . Therefore, we need the equivalent of two different energy modules, power modules, and consider the situation into two different cases; Case 1 does not consider the energy electron energy Eelec
                         modules, while Case 2 considers the energy of the electron energy Eelec
                         modules.

Case 1:

Without considering the electron energy Eelec
                        , both models consume energy transmission electron energy Eelec

In our experimental simulation environment, in order to compare two kinds of energy to the module, the electron energy is considered without considering the Eelec
                         and Eelec
                         electron energy of the two cases.

If the distance d is greater than the threshold d
                        0, it enters the relay node selection stage, with node S used to find the best relay node, and to forward information transmitted through relay nodes to node D.

In the relay selection phase, we find the position of the relay node and divided our algorithm into two cases. Case 1 divides the distance d into two equal sub-segments. Case 2 divides the distance d into K equal sub-segments, where K > 1; equation K is given by:

In our proposed OLACRA-GRN architecture, the geographic information of relay nodes must be obtained in order to be able to calculate the best relay nodes, while in [13], it is not necessary to first obtain the geographic information of relay nodes. The aim of this study is to prevent the concentric outer class becoming too large, improve relay node selection, and reduce energy consumption for the transfer area of each layer. Therefore, another Opportunistic Large Array Concentric Routing Algorithm with Relay Nodes(OLACRA-RN) architecture is also proposed, which does not require the geographic information of relay nodes. Furthermore, it is possible to find the optimum number of concentric sectors in a sensor field and obtain suitable relay nodes for each layer to relay node data to the sink in order to reduce energy consumption. The proposed OLACRA-RN architecture is divided into three phases: energy consumption phase, the optimum number of concentric circles sectors and the relay node selection phase.

The energy consumption phase in Section 3.1 is used.

In the concentric circles [13] framework, a based sink is the center of a wireless sensor network. The method used by Stojmenovic and Lin [17] is used for energy analysis, in which the relay node is able to calculate the optimal number of concentric strata. The Flow chart of OLACRA-RN architecture is shown in Fig. 9.
                        
                     

First, in the deployment field area of WSNs, d is the distance from the sink to the border of the field area. The distance d and the threshold value d
                        0 are compared; the number sectors of the concentric field area are calculated according to Eq. (8). The optimum number of concentric sectors K is thus obtained. Each layer of concentric circles of transmission range B is defined as follows:

                           
                              (21)
                              
                                 
                                    B
                                    =
                                    
                                       d
                                       
                                          K
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

OLACRA-RN architecture in the downstream is the initialization phase, to place the sink in the center of concentric circles; in a sink when the broadcast message is received correctly, the sink forms neighboring nodes Downstream level 1(D
                           1) layer; in the D
                           1 area, all nodes send messages, in D
                           1 when the message is received correctly, a sink forms neighboring nodes D
                           2 layer, and so on until each node is assigned to the layer, forming an n-layer concentric circles D
                           1, D
                           2, ..., Dn
                           , as shown in Fig. 10
                           . The distance of each layer to the next layer is called the step-size; when the layer node number is larger, it causes a larger layer width [17], and the upstream data transmission link will lead to problems.

Upstream refers to a node wanting to send data to the sink direction, we relay the data through an intermediate node that is the node between the source layer and the sink layer. The transmission node, called the source node, is shown in Fig. 11
                        . The source node is at the center of concentric circles, forming the first layer, and so on, until each layer is included in the layer produced by the sink; the first layer is formed by the source node and the downstream D
                        4 layer overlapping area Upstream layer 1 (U
                        1). The source node forms second layer and the downstream D
                        3 layer overlapping area U
                        2. In the upstream layer and downstream layer each area overlaps until D
                        1 and upstream also overlap with the node layer area. OLACRA-RN architecture broadcasts the message from the source node to all nodes in U
                        1, and then broadcasts the message from U
                        1 to all nodes in U
                        2, and then from U
                        2 to all nodes in U
                        3, and so on, until the broadcast message reaches the sink. OLACRA-RN architecture completed three stages for send data to the sink.

The sink node in the transmission range B of the first layer is formed concentrically as D
                           1. In the transmission range B of the boundary of D
                           1, neighbor nodes can receive to the message sensors from D
                           1 that they are formed of D
                           2 downstream in the second layer. Finally, the optimum number of concentric sectors can be found step by step. The source node locates the center of the transmission range B, and upstream sensors of the first layer form the first concentric circle, when the data of the source node is sent.

The first layer is formed from an upstream node transmission range concentric boundary layer upstream of B to result in the second concentric circle. Sensing field areas are divided step by step.

An example in Fig. 12
                            illustrates the OLACRA-RN architecture when the upstream source node is in D
                           15. The level membership of downstream nodes are shown by circles with contrasting shades (yellow circles for even indices and cyan-blue circles for odd indices in Fig. 12), and the upstream nodes are darker shades.

The proposed OLACRA-RN architecture can obtain the optimum number of concentric sectors to improve the original OLACRA. Each layer of concentric circles has the optimal layer size. This will reduce the required transmission energy of relay nodes.

In each layer of the upstream region (blue nodes) find a suitable node as a relay node to be shown in Fig. 13
                        . In the first node in the overlap region U
                        1, the source node sends an RTS message to sensor nodes, the node with the shortest delay time is selected as the relay node to send a CTS message to the source node. In the first overlap region U
                        1, the relay node broadcasts an RTS message to neighbor nodes in the overlap region U

Each concentric layer has relay nodes, and the source node can send messages to the first relay node. The first relay node can then forward messages to the second relay node. Finally, the sink can receive messages from the last node. In each layer, the relay node with minimum energy consumption forwards data transmission in order to reduce energy consumption and extend system life.

In our simulation, the parameters are set as shown in Table 1
                     . Nodes are randomly distributed. 1965 nodes are deployed in the sensing field area 100 m × 100 m, the coordinates of the sink are (50, 50), node density has four different values: 0.25 node/m2, 0.5 node/m2, 1 node/m2 and 2.2 node/m2, our simulation is executed 400 times. The source node is located between (0, 0) and (100, 100). Our energy module parameters are as follows: electric energy

Thanayankizil [13] proposed two important performance issues in wireless sensor networks: fraction of energy saved (FES) and packet delivery ratio (PDR).

FES is the total transfer in our proposed method of energy consumption, the ratio of OLACRA-GRN, OLACRA-RN, OLACRA-T and OLACRA-FT with basic OLA, when the FES value is higher, representation and the basic OLA save relatively more energy. FES is defined as follows:

PDR is the packet delivery success ratio between the source node and sink node; to avoid collision, we assume that at any point of time of each transmission, only one source node is sending data to the sink.

OLACRA [13] uses a relative transmission threshold (RTT) unit that is dB, τd
                      is a threshold of user-defined, τd

When the value of RTT is larger, the number of relay nodes becomes more. Conversely, the number of relay nodes becomes less.

                     , node density is 2.2 node/m2, in RTT = 1 dB, OLACRA-T is about 0.95, OLACRT-FT is about 0.94; in RTT = 2 dB, OLACRA-T is about 0.94 and OLACRT-FT is about 0.87. The larger value of RTT represents more relay nodes; our proposed OLACRA-GRN is about 0.99 and OLACRA-RN is about 0.99. In comparison with the previous methods it shows obvious improvement, as shown in Fig. 14.

OLACRA-T and OLACRA-FT when the value of RTT is larger, the FES value and PDR value becomes larger. Conversely, the FES value and PDR value becomes small. The value of RTT is larger because the relay nodes keep increasing. Conversely, the number of relay nodes becomes less. In comparison with the previous methods, our proposed OLACRA-GRN and OLACRA-RN shows obvious improvement.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In WSNs, an efficient routing protocol is a very important issue. This paper proposes OLACRA-GRN and OLACRA-RN architectures. First, the OLACRA-GRN architecture was proposed to achieve an appropriate reduction in the number of relay nodes and layer size resulting in reduced energy consumption of nodes. OLACRA-GRN is divided into two phases. Phase I is an analysis of the energy consumption; it requires the calculation of the distance d between source node and sink node. If dis smaller than d
                     0, then that direct transmission is better. Otherwise, it must execute phase II. Phase II find several suitable relay nodes to transmit the data. OLACRA-RN is divided into three phases. Phase I is energy consumption; Phase II is optimal number of concentric circle hierarchy, which obtains the optimum number of concentric sectors K; Phase III find suitable relay nodes to forward the data. The first OLACRA-GRN architecture must know the geographic information of relay nodes in order to calculate the best transmission route and reduce energy consumption. However, the OLACRA-RN architecture does not require the geographic information of relay nodes. The energy consumption of our two proposed architectures is similar, and both architectures outperform the OLACRA architecture in this regard.

In the simulation results, our proposed architectures were compared with OLACRA-T and OLACRA-FT. As can be seen, OLACRA-GRN and OLACRA-RN in FES save 5% of the energy. As can be seen, OLACRA-GRN and OLACRA-RN in PDR improved by 80% in regard to the success rate. Our proposed architectures scores significantly higher than the OLACRA-T and OLACRA-FT due to the analysis of energy consumption and employment of the transmission relay node selection method. Each relay node transmission requires minimal energy consumption, thus reducing the total energy consumption of transmission; relay nodes are easily found, so packets can be successfully transmitted by relay nodes.
