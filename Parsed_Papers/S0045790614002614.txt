                  Online induction machine faults diagnosis is a concern to guarantee the overall production process efficiency. Nowadays, the industry demands the integration of smart wireless sensors networks (WSN) to improve the fault detection in order to reduce cost, maintenance and power consumption. Induction motors can develop one or more faults at the same time that can produce sever damages. The origin of most recurrent faults in rotary machines is in the components: stator, rotor, bearing and others. This work presents a novel methodology for the online faults diagnosis in induction motors. This technique uses the smart WSN to obtain the machine condition based on the motor stator current analysis. The implementation of the proposed smart sensor methodology allows the system to perform online fault detection in a fully automated way. Simulation results presented show the efficiency of the proposed method to detect simple and multiple faults in induction machine. It provides detailed analysis to address challenges in designing and deploying WSNs in industrial environments, and its reliability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The fast advancement in WSNs is due to not only the innovations in the communications and computer-engineering fields, but also the development of new transducers, since as data-capture devices they play a key role in online monitoring systems. Taking into account the features of WSN motes (e.g., consumption, price, and size), special attention should be paid to the research and the achievement of new generation transducers, provided that they are compatible with these features and can therefore be included within the nodes of a WSN [1,2]. The development of wireless sensor networks is the result of the deployment of large number of these smart sensors. The collaborative operation of WSN brings significant advantages including flexibility, high fidelity, self-organization, aggregated intelligence via parallel processing, low cost, low consumption and rapid deployment. These features make WSN a promising platform for online and remote implementation of fault diagnosis system. Instead of proposing a new fault detection method for a specific motor failure, the main focus of this work is to perform a system overview for a global automated current motor analysis especially where the nonintrusive nature of electrical signal based machine. This enables us to implement the online induction machine fault detection in a smart WSN architecture. In the proposed smart WSN scheme, every smart sensor attached to the induction motor determines the condition of the motor if it is healthy or faulty and sends the fault nature if it exists. The smart sensor takes this decision based on the electrical data measured from the induction motor, and then the fault detection scheme is applied at the same smart sensor. Only the detected fault nature is sent to the local supervisory center via WSN and to the remote user via IP networks. In this approach the data communication burden is reduced because the WSN transmits only the motor condition to monitor efficiency and health condition in an online and nonintrusive manner. In other alternative approach, the electrical data are collected and transmitted through WSN and processed in the diagnosis center using alternative algorithms for fault detection. This method needs high bandwidth especially for great number of sensors and high capacity (for the diagnosis center) to process all gathered data. In case that, in some applications, other sensors data such as temperature and vibration are readily unavailable, it presents also many complexities for real time applications. Due to the limitation of WSN technology such as long latency, relaxed data throughput, limited reliability, and the system scalability are the objectives of applying the smart WSN scheme to perform online faults diagnosis for industrial machine [3,4].

Induction motors are key elements in every industrial process; their robustness, low cost, easy maintenance and versatility make them popular in many applications from home appliance to sophisticated industrial equipments. In industry, the most popular induction motor is the squirrel-cage motor that they can keep working under certain fault conditions without giving any sign of failure until it is too late when production costs have excessively risen or the machine have suffered irreversible damage. Thus, when induction motor start developing incipient faults it is important to detect the fault early because it is easier to repair and benefiting the industry in cost and maintenance time. Online continuous monitoring of rotary machine can diagnose electrical and mechanical faults opportunely avoiding expensive reparations and unscheduled shutting downs of production line preventing incoming losses. The approach presented in this paper minimizes the time interval between the fault occurrence and its diagnosis, and to provide a system overview where the non-invasive enables its application in a WSN architecture. To attain this short detection time, the proposed fault detection method should be implemented at the smart sensor level. The paper discusses the development of sensors for identifying mechanical faults in induction motors is organized as; Section 2 describes the wireless sensor networks implemented in this architecture. Section 3 presents the fault diagnosis method based on WSN. Section 4 describes the architecture design of the proposed online fault detection method and Section 5 presents the experimental validation of this architecture. Finally the work is concluded in Section 6.

Induction motors are nowadays extensively used in industrial, commercial, aerospace, and military applications due to their simple construction and the reliability. In this way, early fault detection and identification permit preventative and condition-based maintenance to be arranged for the electrical machines during scheduled downtimes [5].

Various methods for induction motor fault detection have been reported in the literature. In [6], authors have suggested an online induction motor diagnosis system using motor current signature analysis with advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms. The proposed system diagnoses induction motors have four types of faults such as breakage of rotor bars and end-rings, short-circuit of stator windings, bearing cracks, and air–gap eccentricity. Advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are composed of an optimal-slip-estimation algorithm, a proper-sample-selection algorithm, and a frequency auto search algorithm for achieving MCSA efficiently. In [7], authors have investigated the detection of rolling-element bearing faults in induction motors by stator current monitoring. A fault model has been suggested, which takes in consideration fault related air–gap length variations and changes in the load torque. The frequency contents of the stator current are obtained for the three major fault types. The spectral analysis shows that characteristic vibration frequencies are discernible in the torque spectrum. The torque oscillations lead to changes in the stator current spectrum. In [8], a formulation of a mixed eccentricity index has been developed considering the interaction between static- and dynamic-eccentricity flux density waves. In [9], authors have taken the initial step to investigate the efficiency of current monitoring for diagnostic purposes. The effects of stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. The frequency signatures of some asymmetrical motor faults are well identified using advanced signal processing techniques such as high-resolution spectral analysis. In [10], authors have presented the use of the induction motor current to identify and quantify common faults based on bi-spectrum analysis. A modified bi-spectrum based on the amplitude modulation feature of the current signal is then adopted to combine both lower sidebands and higher sidebands simultaneously.

The signal processing tools used in induction motor fault diagnosis are much diversified. In [11], author presents an original fault signature based on an improved combination of Hilbert and Park transforms. The fault signature is analyzed using the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT), the effects of mechanical faults are described, and the related frequencies are determined. In [12], author proposes the use of the Wigner–Ville distribution for the time–frequency decomposition of the startup current signals, since this is a tool showing a good trade-off between time and frequency resolution both for low and high frequency regions. In [13], authors have presented a diagnosis method of induction motor faults based on time–frequency classification of the current waveforms. This method is composed of two sequential processes: a feature extraction and a rule decision. In the process of feature extraction, the time–frequency representation has been designed for maximizing the separability between classes representing different faults. The disadvantages of time–frequency tools are: first the compilation of their algorithms is time consuming compared to that of FFT. Second, the extraction of information necessary for diagnosis is difficult.

The aim of most of these works is to detect the motor failure rather than the root of failure. The main challenge here is developing a computationally inexpensive system which can be implemented on industrial platform for online continuous real-time performance and condition monitoring of induction motors. In this research a smart WSN system is implemented for real time fault detection in induction motor.

The primary problems in induction motors are (1) air–gap eccentricity, (2) rotor bar damage, (3) bearing damage, (4) stator winding imbalance [8]. These problems are often neither sudden nor independent. Therefore, by using the progressive nature of these problems, a continuous monitoring system can track the faults as they develop and help identify the root cause of faults and prevent the consequent failures.

Motor current signature analysis is one of the most powerful methods of online fault motor diagnosis. This method has advantages such as no estimation of motor parameters and the simplicity of current sensors and their installation. A current spectrum contains potential fault information. Frequency components have been determined for each specified fault. These frequencies are derived from the physical construction of the machine.

The fault detection uses the monitoring of the line current Fourier transform modulus. These are based on the appearance or the increase of the component amplitude at frequencies related to the fault. Appearance or increase are two terms which imply the comparison with a reference which is often the Fourier transform modulus of the line current absorbed with a healthy motor.

The basic fault in three-phase induction motors is the eccentricity of stator and rotor. The eccentricity occurs when [13]:
                              
                                 •
                                 Elliptical stator inner cross-section.

Relative misalignment of rotor and stator in the fixing and commissioning stage.

Wrong placement of ball-bearing.

Rubbing of ball-bearing.

Misalignment of load axis and rotor shaft.

Unbalanced load and rotor axis slanting.

Between the inner stator and outer rotor circumferences, the eccentricity fault causes radial unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP). The direction of the UMP is such that it amplifies the eccentricity. Any eccentricity in the induction motor structure therefore generates extreme fatigue of the ball-bearings. The interaction of the UMP on the stator core also causes abnormal vibration of the stator winding, which could be dangerous.

Some consequences of the eccentricity fault in the motor could be [14]:
                              
                                 –
                                 Asymmetry and deviation of air–gap flux and line currents.

Decreasing average torque.

Increasing losses and decreasing efficiency.

Rising temperature.

For fault diagnosis, some of the above-mentioned consequences or their secondary effects can be used as indices. In reality, static and dynamic eccentricities tend to coexist. Ideal centric conditions can never be assured. Therefore, an inherent eccentricity is implied for any real machine, even in newly manufactured ones due to the manufacturing and assembly methods. The combined static and dynamic eccentricities are called mixed eccentricity. In this condition, both rotor and rotation axes are displaced. When mixed eccentricities is present, low frequency components also appear in the current spectrum, which can be given by [14,15]:

The presence of rotor slot harmonics (also called the principal slot harmonics or PSH) and the other eccentricity related harmonics is absolutely essential for most of the sensorless adjustable speed induction motor drive schemes and diagnosis of eccentricity related faults.

Bearing faults are the main factor for accidental downtimes of induction machines. For this reason, early bearing fault detection can considerably help decrease the costs that these downtimes will require. Various factors like low lubrication, mounting failures, or contamination lead to a lifetime reduction. Inappropriate installation such as misalignment or deflection of the shaft and unacceptable tilt of inner or outer races produce irregular forces on the bearings [17]. Therefore, reliable online condition-monitoring methods for bearings are important features for industrial plants to apply maintenance on time.

Faulty bearings cause the variation of air–gap length when a rotor turns. Since this variation comes from the faulty structure of a ball bearing, the irregular harmonic frequencies of a ball bearing can be resulting from the bearing model. This fault causes the appearance of characteristic fault frequencies in the spectrum of the measured parameters which are often utilized for fault diagnosis. The characteristic fault frequencies depend on the mechanical dimensions of the bearing, the number Nb
                            of bearing balls, and the rotational frequency fr
                            of the inner raceway for a fixed outer ring. For bearings with between 6 and 12 balls, the fault frequencies for an outer raceway fault for
                            can be approximated using, respectively, the following [17]:

To develop advanced scheme that can monitor motor failure at an early stage, advanced modeling and intelligent data processing techniques are commonly used including motor modeling and analysis, system identification and optimization, pattern recognition, stochastic and statistical process, and digital signal processing methods [20]. Many of these methods are based on monitor signature analysis, where the fault signatures in the motor electrical data such as current, voltages and power are extracted to detect the faults. The non-invasive nature to apply these methods makes them the best candidate for remote motor monitoring and diagnosis system in WSN scheme where motor controls, data acquisition, and data processing and reporting often happen at distant location.

The digital information is passed through the proposed smart sensor that is in charge to assert the motor diagnosis. The block diagram that describes the executed steps at the smart sensor level to diagnose the motor condition and send the nature of fault is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The proposed methodology of online fault detection in induction motor based on current signature analysis: The system uses a primary sensor (current clamp or Hall-effect sensor) to measure the stator current in the induction motor through a Data Acquisition Card; then, signal conditioning is applied. Subsequently, the conditioned signal is digitalized at the analog-to-digital converter block (ADC). The outgoing data from the ADC is time windowed with a Blackman window to reduce the leakage in the frequency domain and the frequency operation of the signal is computed by a frequency estimator. Then, FFT is applied to get the current spectrum. In order to cover motors with different power capabilities and a wide load range the spectrum is normalized according to the magnitude of the fundamental frequency. Afterward, the bands of interest for the different faults are evaluated through the estimation of the value of these selected bands according to Eqs. (1)–(5). Then a peak search is applied to detect all peaks and their frequencies in the selected bands to be compared over a database. The database contains results analyses of stator current (all peaks and their frequencies) of healthy motor and diagnosis of faulty motor presenting different types of failures. The data from the peak search is compared to the corresponding values from the database to deliver the motor condition. The threshold to detect motor failure is fixed based on results analyses of current stator of faulty motor. Finally, if the motor is faulty the radio is switched on to send the nature of fault to diagnosis center, then the radio is switched off if the data is send with no error [21].

Wireless communications are an effective and reliable solution in home and office automation. WSNs are used for monitoring and control of noncritical function in the residential, commercial, and industrial application standardized low rate wireless personal area networks. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained world-wide attention in recent years, particularly with the proliferation in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology which has facilitated the development of smart sensors [22,23]. These sensors are small, with limited processing and computing resources, and they are inexpensive compared to traditional sensors. These sensor nodes can sense, measure, and gather information from the environment and based on some local decision process, they can transmit the sensed data to the user. A WSN typically has little or no infrastructure. It consists of a number of sensor nodes (few tens to thousands) working together to monitor a region to obtain data about the machines, which are densely deployed either inside the phenomenon or very close to it. The position of sensor nodes needs to be engineered or predetermined for known target. Each network node in our proposed architecture contains a processor unit, a network interface unit, localization system unit, mobile unit, and a sensor or multiple sensors can be connected to each node through an electronic interface (Fig. 3). Every network has its own custom-designed interface for sensors and sensor manufacturers have to support various networks and protocols. The purpose of the IEEE 802.15.4 is to provide simple wireless communication with relatively short range, limited power, relaxed data throughput, and small size which are sufficient to satisfy the requirement of most remote monitoring system for industrial applications [24].

IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard which specifies the physical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). The standard defines the channel access mechanism, acknowledged frame delivery, network association and disassociation. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines two layers, the MAC and the physical layer (PHY), and uses the three license-free frequency bands. These license-free bands have a total of 27 channels divided into 16 channels at 2.4GHz with data rates of 250kbps (O-QPSK modulation), 10 channels at 902–928MHz with data rates of 40kbps (BPSK modulation), and one channel at 868–870MHz with a data rate of 20kbps (BPSK modulation). However, only the 2.4-GHz band operates worldwide and when multiple machines are monitored; the others are regional bands and when the processed data such as algorithm results are transmitted instead of real-time continuous data. The 868–870-MHz band operates in Europe, while the 902–928-MHz band operates in North America, Australia, and other countries. The MAC layer provides communication for star, mesh and cluster-three topologies with controllers. The transmission range of the nodes is assumed to be 10…100m [25].

Devices may be implemented with very simple and-low cost platforms. The standard designates these low-complexity platforms as Reduced Function Devices (RFDs). Platforms with the complete set of MAC services are called Full Function Device (FFD). The standard use 2 type of address: long (64-bit) and short (16-bit) addresses. Once the devices associate with a network, they get a short address for operating in the network (max number of nodes is around 65,000). The MAC protocol transfers data as frames with a maximum size of 128B with a maximum payload of 1024B. In this work the 2.4-GHz high bandwidth is used for the WSN implementation.

The system follow a sensor fusion approach to detect single fault or combination of faults in their incipient stage and provides early warning of impending problems. The wireless system provides a low-cost alternative, the key performance objectives for the wireless system are:
                              
                                 •
                                 Detect faults in induction motor with a probability of 99%.

Produce false alarm no more than 5%.

Have high accuracy (>99%) of correctly identifying the nature and severity of the fault. The faults of interest are static and dynamic air–gap eccentricity, bearing damage and rotor bar damage.

An over view of the proposed online fault diagnosis scheme for industrial induction machine system using smart WSN is presented in Fig. 2
                           
                           . Our proposed solution is a smart WSN system for continuous real-time performance and condition monitoring of induction motors. The proposed system employs multiple sensors mounted on a common wireless platform with the capability of installation inside the motor on the stator end-coils or outside on the test bed. Every smart sensor attached to the induction motor determines the condition of the motor if it is healthy or faulty and sends the fault nature if it exist. The smart sensor takes this decision based on the electrical data measured from the induction motor, and then the fault detection scheme is applied at the same smart sensor. It continuously collects and buffers data during 5s at a sampling rate of 10kHz. When the buffer is full, the fault diagnosis scheme is executed also during the same period (5s). Only the mechanical fault nature is sent to the local supervisory center via WSN and to the remote user via IP networks. The same time (5s) is used to send correctly the fault nature from the sensor node to the receiver in the form of packets. When all the packets are sent out, the smart sensor node starts to collect data again. Each packet consists of the sensor node ID and the packet number ID followed by the processing data. In the data area, 114byte is used for the fault nature and one additional byte is used to mark the Cyclic Redundancy Check.

The online fault detection method based on smart sensor is fully implemented in a single FPGA in order to keep low cost of the smart sensor and to comply with the processing speed requirements. Once the data from current signals have been acquired, the FPGA based smart sensor performs the motor condition diagnosis as follows:
                        
                           •
                           The sensor measure the stator current.

The CAN digitalyze the acquired signal from the induction machine and store the data at the memory RAM1.

The FFT computes the FFT transform and estimate the power density spectrum of the stored data using the Blackman window.

The peak search processor seeks the data outputted by the FFT processor and find all peaks and their frequencies around the frequencies established by Eqs. (1)–(5).

If all peaks related to each fault are found, then the processor compares these values to the values stored in the database of a healthy and faulty motor to decide the motor condition.

If the measured magnitude is equal to the magnitude of a healthy motor so the motor is healthy, else if the magnitude is equal to the faulty then the motor is faulty and the nature of the fault is identified based on the compared frequency.

If the motor is faulty, the nature of fault is sent to the diagnosis center via WSN.

The proposed smart sensor architecture is made up of five basic components as shown in Fig. 3: sensor unit, processor unit, a network interface unit, localization system unit, and mobile unit. They may also have application dependent additional components such as a power source unit [26,27].

The sensor unit is in charge of acquiring data from the induction machine, it is usually composed of two subunits: sensors and Analogue to digital converters (ADCs). Sensors sense the three phase stator current of the induction motor. The analogue signals produced by the sensors based on the observed phenomenon are converted to digital signals by the ADC, and then fed into the processor unit.

The processor unit which is generally associated with a small memory unit manages the procedures that make the sensor node collaborate with the other nodes to carry out the assigned sensing tasks. However, in our proposed architecture the processor unit manages the communication procedure and the fault detection procedure, so it is also associated with a fault detection unit. The fault detection unit is composed of:
                           
                              •
                              Two memories RAM1 (128Kbytes) and RAM2 (4 Kbytes). RAM1 is used to store the measured data and RAM2 stores the training motor database and faults thresholds. We have used two memories to accelerate the fault detection process. We have used two memories to accelerate the fault detection process.

The FFT processor implements the FFT algorithm using the Blackman window.

The peak search algorithm seeks the spectral density power outputted by the FFT processor around the frequencies ranges established by Eqs. (1)–(5) to find all peaks.

The classifier classify all peaks outputted by the peak search algorithm into four classes: normal, eccentricity fault, bearing fault and broken rotor bar fault.

The fault detection unit automatically makes the motor condition diagnosis based on the output of the classifier algorithm and the stored motor training database with simple comparison. The fault detection unit contains the signature data for the analyzed motor and the thresholds to determine if the motor is healthy or faulty. Then it determines the fault nature when it is detected to be sent by the sensor.

The network interface connects the node to the network. It is responsible for data transmission from the node to the network.

One of the most important components of a sensor node is the power source unit. Power source units may be supported by a power scavenging unit such as solar cells.

Most of the sensor network routing techniques and sensing tasks require the knowledge of location with high accuracy. Thus, it is common that a sensor node has a location finding system.

A mobilizer may sometimes be needed to move sensor nodes when it is required to carry out the assigned tasks.

The overall system feasibility of the proposed smart WSN scheme is investigated through a series of laboratory experiments and field tests. In this section, the concept of a remote and online fault diagnosis system is demonstrated using 2 steps.

The test motor used in the experimental investigation was a three-phase 50-Hz, four-pole, 28 rotor bars, 1.1-kW induction machine (Fig. 4
                        a). The induction machine shaft is mounted with a powder brake in order to simulate different level of load torque during the tests.

The studied faults are: air–gap eccentricity, broken rotor bar and the outer raceway ball bearing defect. In order to create an air–gap eccentricity fault in the induction motor, a simple mechanism was used. Each of the two bearing housings of the rotor was changed to a pair of eccentric rings placed one into the other (Fig. 4b). The bearings used in this study have the following reference (SKF6205). The defective bearings were installed on the load side of the induction motor. The diagnosis of bearing failures on the load side of the mechanics succeeds as well. The generated artificial faults that have been installed for the following results are shown in Fig. 5
                        c for the outer raceway faults. Eroding the rings of the bearings resulted in a slot with a width of 2mm at the outer raceway. The investigated bearings contain 9 balls.

Three phase current sensors are used to monitoring the induction machine during operation at steady state. Low-pass anti-aliasing filters are implemented in order to set the frequency bandwidth of the analyzed signals to a correct range. Then, the outputs of the low-pass filters are directly connected to a data acquisition board (dSpace DS1104 processor board) which contains a Motorola Power PC 603e model and a DSP (TMS320F240 – 20MHz). The process can be commanded and monitored via the Control Desk software of dSpace. The data sampling is performed using differential channels and a sampling frequency of 10kHz. The software used is MATLAB™ for the data acquisition and processing. The suggested fault signatures are analyzed in the frequency domain using FFT. The Blackman window is chosen because it gives the best compromise between the relative side lobe attenuation and the main lobe width, in order to differentiate the analyzed frequency components used by the tested diagnosis methods.

All measurements of healthy machine and faulty machine are stored to be used as a database for our system. The experiments concerned the drive system driving the full load at 1458rpm. The power density spectrum plotted in blue represents then, in our case, the supposed healthy motor; the power density spectrum plotted in red represent the faulty motor.

When mixed eccentricities are present, low frequency components also appear in the line current spectrum, which can be given by:

                        .

To show the efficiency of the proposed method, some selected spectra are presented. In fact, one could identify in Fig. 5 eccentricity harmonics at 1.3Hz, 24.3Hz, 74.3Hz and 97.3Hz. The low frequencies related at the air–gap eccentricity fault are summarized in Table 1
                        .

                        However, when zooming the power spectra more frequency information appears clearly around PSH1 and PSH2. It can be seen that the spectral components coincide with the predicted values (Fig. 6
                        ). The high frequencies related at the air–gap eccentricity fault are summarized in Table 2
                        . It shows that experimental frequencies are conformed with theoretical frequencies value and their signal magnitude of each appeared fault, so at high frequencies air–gap eccentricity faults appear at 606.5Hz, 630.8Hz, 655.1Hz, 706.5Hz, 730.8Hz, and 754.9Hz.

The outer raceway defect causes the appearance of characteristic fault frequencies in the spectrum of the measured parameters which are often utilized for fault diagnosis. The outer raceway ball bearing fault can be observed in several frequency ranges

                        . These frequencies of outer raceway bearing fault are summarized in Table 3
                         which indicate that the fault appears if the magnitude of the frequencies are (123.5Hz, −70.8dB), (210.7Hz, −87.14dB), (224.2Hz, −75.53dB) and (296.2Hz, −85.06dB). Fig. 7
                         shows outer raceway bearing fault around 150Hz, and Fig. 8
                         presents outer raceway bearing fault around 250Hz. The fault sensitivity of each diagnosis media can be obtained comparing the magnitudes of the frequency components with respect to their initial value in healthy conditions.

The focus of the field tests in this section is to present the feasibility of applying the proposed smart WSN scheme for online fault diagnostic for a motor system in a laboratory environment. It can be reasonably assumed that similar non-invasive fault diagnostic methods can be used to achieve comparable performance in industrial environment if the WSN communication is reliable. The acquired information (stator current) is analyzed for faults detection at the proposed smart sensor that is implemented in LabView 2010 platform using NI CompactRIO. The experimental setup consists in using the steady-state current signal provided by the motor under test for detecting the multiple-combined faults and to classify the conditions of the induction motor. The tested motors described in sub-Section 5.1 are used for testing the performance of the proposed methodology identifying the single and multiple combined fault diagnosis described in this work. The data sampling is performed using differential channels and a sampling frequency of 500Hz. Many series of simulations are made for healthy and faulty tested motors presented in Fig. 4 in order to determine the fault detection probability and the false alarm probability. Table 4
                         presents the statistical analysis of these simulations. The proposed approach can correctly detect almost all faulty condition from normal condition (>95% accuracy). It should be noted that the system can discriminate between different fault categories with a high accuracy, fault can be detected with 99% accuracy.


                        Fig. 9
                         presents an air gap eccentricity fault that is detected at low frequency (1.27Hz, 25.7Hz, 74.2Hz). Air–gap eccentricity fault appeared also at high frequencies (630.7Hz, 655Hz, 730Hz) is presented in Fig. 10
                        . The eccentricity harmonics at low and high frequencies detected and transmitted through the proposed Smart WSN show the efficiency of the implemented method. Moreover, the proposed smart sensor detects the outer raceway bearing fault around 150Hz shown in Fig. 11
                         and around 250Hz presented in Fig. 12
                        . Fig. 13
                         shows that a broken rotor bar fault is detected for a full loaded motor at frequencies (47.8Hz and 52.2Hz). It has been seen that the proposed method gives similar results compared to the trained method based on MATLAB simulation for the same cases at different frequencies ranges. However the detection is even smoother and it is more much visible this is due to that our proposed method can detect and send simple or combined faults via WSN when this method is implemented to each smart sensor attached to the induction machine.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The proposed research develops an inexpensive smart wireless sensor system to perform real-time condition monitoring of induction machines. We propose the use of smart sensors and wireless sensor networks combined with motor current signature analysis using FFT to monitor motor current and detect faults in induction machines in an automated way. The paper presents simulation results of the method being successfully used to detect simple and multiple faults in induction machines. The proposed method is novel as it is important to install low cost sensors and detection mechanisms along with induction machines to achieve short detection time and an automated way of reporting the fault. The proposed wireless system can distinguish a faulty motor from a healthy motor with a probability of 99% with less than 5% likelihood of false alarm. It can also discriminate between different fault categories and severity with a high accuracy. In this research a single smart sensor is used to provide high level status and diagnostic information. Previous studies on wireless sensors feasibility were their limited battery life when they were required to transmit raw data signals to the basic station. This limitation is partially solved by performing all computations on the smart sensor and thus eliminating the need to send raw signals. The approach presented in this paper minimizes the time interval between the fault occurrence and its diagnosis, and to provide a system overview where the nonintrusive enables its application in a WSN architecture. The implementation of the proposed smart senor methodology allows the system to perform online fault detection in a fully automated way. This development comprises proprietary signal processing and targets a low cost FPGA, making the system a reliable solution for industrial application on online monitoring the induction machine condition especially in nonintrusive systems. This implementation shows that an FPGA platform is a suitable solution for smart processing units in developing smart sensors.
