                  Market segmentation comprises a variety of measurement methodologies that are used to support management, marketing and promotional policies in tourism destinations. This study applies ClustOfVar, a relatively recent algorithm for cluster analysis from mixed variables. The technique finds groups of variables by using a homogeneity criterion based on the sum of correlation ratios for qualitative variables, and squared correlations for quantitative variables. Then principal components from each cluster of variables are extracted in order to segment cruise passengers. CART analysis is finally used for the sake of finding the variables that drove the formation of the clusters. All the analysis is based on an official survey of tourists who disembarked in Uruguayan ports. The analysis identified five clusters, both for variables and cruise passengers. Findings highlight the importance of the enjoyment of the contact with local people for the economic impact, as well as the important role of age and gender related variables. Managerial implications are also discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With a remarkable growth in the last decades, cruise industry has become one of the most dynamic and growing segments of the travel and tourism industry [28]. This increase has occurred since 1990 with an average annual passenger growth rate of 7.4% [20]. The cruise industry has responded to the worldwide ports growth with a rapid increase in the world’s cruise fleet, the creation of appealing itineraries that reflect the interests of today’s travellers and the ability of cruise ships to visit new and exotic locations [17]. Recent numbers reported by the FCCA [20], an organization that represents member lines operating more than 100 vessels in Floridian, Caribbean and Latin American waters, announced that 17 million passengers chose to cruise in 2012. Thus, the industry will be well on the way to maturity [36,43].

In this context, South American markets, together with the Mediterranean areas (with an annual growth rate of about 10%) are also increasing their shares. They belonged to the top world destinations in 2012 [17]. The country of Uruguay is in line with this trend. It is a small country located in southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Argentina and Brazil. With two main ports Montevideo and Punta del Este, the country has experienced a significant increase in the number of vessels, as well in the number of disembarking cruise passengers. According to the data of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Uruguay [34], during the 2011–2012 season 225 cruise ships arrived to the country in the two ports of Montevideo (53%) and Punta del Este (47%). This corresponds to an increase of 32% with respect to the previous season, and it is also the most outstanding outcome for both ports since 2004 [8]. From this context, a deeper understanding of the main characteristics of the cruisers disembarking in the two ports could be an important feature in order to improve the positive impact generated by this kind of activities.

The main focus of this paper is to find and analyse homogeneous groups of cruise passengers who disembarked in Uruguayan ports. This would allow to identify market segments, and suggest managerial recommendations to destination managers and port authorities. Indeed, market segmentation techniques comprise a set of tools that are appropriate not only to segment markets and identify target markets, but also for assisting a business analyst to understand the relationship between destination and tourists [3].

Segmentation tools have been widely used in both industry and academic research for the sake of gaining more insights into a wide range of markets [40,19,21]. Their number has sensibly grown [31,18], with each method presenting a peculiar view of the data [30]. Hence, scholars have improved them in order to make them less prone to error and misinterpretation [19]. The wide set of techniques ranges from elementary percentiles and quartiles [35] to more complex techniques such as factor analysis, principle components and cluster analysis [3]. Nowadays, segmentation techniques and methodologies have evolved in order to overcome a series of limitations [3]. For instance, artificial neural networks (ANN) have been proven as better method in yielding market segmentation [26,33]. In many market segmentation researches, ANN based clustering has been dominated by Self-Organizing Feature Map-SOFMs or SOMs [26]. These neural networks have apparently primary advantages over cluster analysis [3,6,24]. On the other hand, other techniques have been developed in order to ‘refine’ classic ones [7]. However, for what concerns the studies of cruise passengers, only few papers have applied these techniques for detecting and analysing characteristics, behaviors and onshore experience of cruise passengers while visiting a port of call (see [2,9,12,10,42]).

This paper adopts a three-step multivariate market segmentation analysis, where clustering techniques are adopted for both variables and units. The first step consists in the dimensionality reduction of the original set of variables. This is a classic problem in statistical analyses [32]. The reduction of the number of variables in a few latent dimensions has the twofold purpose of imploding highly linearly dependent variables that might carry too similar information, and at the same time of finding and interpreting common latent dimensions to such variables. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Multivariate Correspondence Analysis (MCA), respectively for quantitative and qualitative variables, are usually applied in order to detect latent traits. However these techniques are not able to handle mixed datasets. In addition, they are built on the hypothesis that all variables share a common ‘aspect’, i.e. come from a common ‘semantic’ group, and they ‘only’ need to be imploded via a technique that would extract latent variables. The latter components are found in such a way that they are independent each other. Therefore they do exclude the possible presence of links within the set of latent dimensions. This paper faces these methodological issues through ClustOfVar [16], a recent algorithm for clustering datasets where mixed variables are present. The methodology is based on PCAmix, a generalization of PCA and MCA.

After finding groups of variables, the second step is to segment the cruisers via classic clustering algorithm. Specifically, Ward’s [44] method and the comparison of different stopping rules were adopted to determine groups of units. Finally, the third step consists in using CART analysis [5], for the sake of estimating those variables that significantly affect the partition in clusters of the original set.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 resumes the adopted methodology. Section 3 presents the datasets. Section 4 shows the results and discusses them. Section 5 concludes.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

Redundancy of information is one of the problems that often arises when clustering units. Strongly related variables can in fact coexist, thus determining duplication of linear information that may lead to misleading classifications of the units. Consistently, the dimensionality of a dataset is usually reduced by techniques such as the ones that are based on the extraction of latent variables. The most commonly used techniques are PCA for quantitative variables, and MCA for qualitative variables. Nevertheless these approaches consider all variables as being part of a common set. For this reason, a commonly used practice is to first cluster variables into groups. This way, each group will carry elements with the most similar information.

Among the several methods that have been proposed for dimensionality reduction, little attention has been paid to mixed qualitative-quantitative datasets. To this end, ClustOfVar [16] is a relatively recent algorithm for the statistical software R [37] to handle mixed dataset. It finds group of variables by using a homogeneity criterion that is based on the sum of correlation ratios for qualitative variables, and squared correlations for quantitative variables. Identification of the number of clusters is made from the analysis of aggregation levels and stability of the partitions via bootstrapped mean-adjusted Rand index. Then from each cluster a synthetic representative variable is extracted through PCAmix [15,23]. The latter is a generalization of PCA and MCA that allows handling of mixed datasets. The extracted new variable is the main principal component of PCAmix applied within each group of variables.

Though relatively recent, the algorithm has been applied in different fields, as gene expression data [14], cardiac diseases [4], car diagnosis [4], chemistry [45], detection of morphometric features [29], farming and environment [25]. Chavent et al. [14] showed also that the algorithm can outperform PCA for what concerns dimension reduction.

The subsequent clustering of units in groups is based on the extracted first components from each cluster of variables. It is performed via the hierarchical agglomerative criterion of Ward [44]. Different stopping rules were used in order to determine the optimal number of clusters of cruisers. Specifically we compared the trace of the total-sample sum-of-squares and crossproducts matrix, and the indices of Scott, Marriot, Friedman and Rubin, Calinski and Harabasz, Krzanowski and Lai – see [13].

The analysis of the key variables driving the aggregation of units in clusters was conducted via the Classification And Regression Tree (CART – [5]). CART is one of the most important and popular nonparametric techniques in machine learning and data mining [39]. Given a partition of units in groups and a set of variables, it estimates hierarchical rules for the variables to be predictors of the groups. Results are plotted through a tree structure, which displays graphically how variables rule the formation of clusters of units. A main advantage is the easy-to-interpret representation of the groups’ drivers, useful for marketing and policy indications.

The method operates through binary recursive partitioning. The initial measurement space X, called ‘root node’ is split into two descendent subsets, each one having a label that indicates which variable and modality determined the splitting. The new subset can be either itself a ‘parent node’ of other ‘nodes’ (‘recursivity’ of the technique), or a ‘terminal node’ (i.e., ‘leaf’) that corresponds to a cluster of units. At every stage subsets are mutually exclusive (generated ‘partitioning’). To build a tree, the main tasks involved in this method are the following ones.
                           
                              –
                              Select a splitting criterion.

Decide whether a node should be split further.

Assign a cluster of units to each terminal node, according to the majority vote criterion.

At each node, the split that maximizes the decrease in impurity (i.e., heterogeneity of nodes obtained in the splitting) is chosen. This can be based on measures such as Gini index, entropy, misclassification error. The final tree is obtaining from ‘pruning’: after determining a nested sequence of subtrees, least important splits are recursively snipped off, based on the complexity parameter. The latter is found via classic cross-validation criteria. Among the various available estimation methods, we used the ones implemented in the package rpart of the software R [41].

This study is based on a survey conducted by the Uruguayan Ministry of Tourism (MINTURD) during the 2011–2012 cruise season. Original dataset consisted of 3537 records, which reduced to 2585 due to missing data. Data were collected at the two ports of call of Montevideo and Punta del Este. The sampling strategy used a two-step stratified approach. In a first phase cruise vessels were selected randomly, from a list of the ships expected to arrive during the season, through a systematic sampling. In the second stage, cruise passengers from travel groups were chosen to ensure equiprobability. Trained interviewers approached cruise passengers prior to return to the ship.


                     Table 1
                      reports the list of variables that are used in this paper together with the labels that are used in our analysis. They include the following items.
                        
                           –
                           Socio-demographic. This category includes classic variables such as gender, age and place of residence. Occupation was considered also as proxy of wealth levels, since information about income was not available. In addition, we considered the number of past visits to Uruguay. Repeat visit is a widespread phenomenon in the country, as many tourists from neighbor countries use to return because they own second homes, particularly in Punta del Este [11]. In addition, notable flows of repeaters come from Argentina, because of the closeness of its capital city to Montevideo, and the related high frequency of land and maritime means of transportations [1]. However, as also descriptive statistics of Table 1 point out, the percentage of cruise passengers who already visited the country, also through other forms of tourism, is low.

Trip-related. This category comprises travel party information (size and composition by age and gender), port of call where the ship stopped, per capita expenditure in USD (total, and for separate items such as food & beverage, shopping, tour, transportations, other).

Psychographic. The surveyed psychographic variables reported whether the tourist enjoyed particular aspects of the visit, namely buildings, landscape, hygiene, people, tranquillity, food and beverage, other.

Descriptive statistics from Table 1 highlight that the sample was composed mainly by women (62.9%), and a large percentage of respondents were in the middle class age (36–64, 78.26%). The majority of passengers were resident in the two neighbor countries (Brazil, 41.97%, and Argentina, 36.63%), and were mainly first time visitors (65.57%). They disembarked to Montevideo in a bit lower percentage (43.6%) than in Punta del Este (56.4%). The majority of them were professionals (33.66%), retired or housewives (26%) and entrepreneurs (13.97%). The main satisfaction-related aspect was local people (31.26%), followed by buildings and architectures of the visited places (25.79%) and hygiene (9.01%). The average visitor spent USD 139.75, with shopping (USD 95.93) and food and beverage (USD 31.45) being the main items in terms of average expenditure. Travel parties were composed on average by more than two passengers (2.43), and consistently with the information about age, the highest average shares were of women in the class age 30–64 (42.94%), but also men (27.79%) in the same age bracket.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                        Fig. 1
                         reports the dendrogram for the clustering of variables. Aggregation distances (Fig. 2
                        ) can be examined in order to choose the cutting threshold of the dendrogram to determine groups. It emerges that three and five are two candidate numbers. This is confirmed by the bootstrapped mean-adjusted Rand criterion reported by Fig. 3
                        , where however a slightly higher value is reported for K
                        =5. The higher stability of the five-partition solution emerges also from the boxplots of Fig. 4
                        , which report a lower dispersion and a higher median value for that K.


                        Table 2
                         displays the composition of each cluster of variables (VClust), together with factor loadings. The latter correspond to correlation ratio for qualitative variables, and squared correlation for quantitative ones. In addition, we also reported correlation between the first principal component of each VClust and original quantitative and dummy variables.

The examination of the clusters of variables suggests that VClust 1 refers to economic impact. It aggregates all expenditure items, as well as the enjoyment for local people. All reported variables are positively related with the extracted component. Indeed this is an interesting indication about the behavior of disembarking cruise tourists, inasmuch as their economic impact in all the items appears to have something in common with the enjoyment of personal characteristics of locals. This also suggests that economic impact is not correlated to a segment of tourists with other specific characteristics, which turns out to be quite a strong indication to market operators.

Age is the other important element for the definition of cruisers’ characteristics in two VClust. VClust 3 collects variables of age and group composition that are related to teenagers and young people. In addition also ‘other’ occupations are present. The latter reinforces such age-related VClust, since students compose about 30% of this category. Another age-related set of variables is VClust 5, which can be attributed to the segment of elderly travellers (65years or more). This is confirmed by group composition, the negative correlation with the middle-aged segment (36–64), and the positive one with the occupation items of retired and household. Consistently, the cluster reports other occupations in a negative relationship with the extracted first component (professionals, entrepreneurs, employees).

VClust 4 instead reports gender-related characteristics, where specifically a direct correlation with females is found, together with an inverse correlation with the percentage of males aged 30–64 in the travel party.

VClust 2 is the group that collects the highest number of variables. It is made of people from Argentina and disembarking at Punta del Este. They did not visit Uruguay for the first time and are not part of the crew of the ship. Group size has also a positive correlation, as well as the percentage of the youngest group members (<15years) of both genders, which may indicate also the presence of families. The first principal component within the cluster is positively related to the enjoyment of hygiene and tranquillity. Consistently with some of these characteristics, negative correlation occurs with disembarking in Montevideo, first time visiting and living in other places than Argentina. The first principal component shows also negative correlation with those who indicated satisfaction with more material elements such as food, buildings and landscape.

The five principal components of each VClust were used to obtain the clusters of units of Fig. 5
                        . Five out of eight of the stopping rules mentioned in Section 2.3 suggested a number of five partitions of units. The description of their main discriminating variables via CART adopts two points of view. The first one illustrates how all ‘raw’ variables used for the ClustOfVar analysis (Table 1) affected the formation of the five clusters of units (Fig. 6
                        ). The second one (Fig. 7
                        ) shows instead how the synthesis of ClustOfVar, i.e. the first principal components of each VClust, ruled the aggregation in the same five clusters of units.


                        Fig. 6 shows that, within the broader set of variables used for forming the clusters (see Table 1), only age, gender, port of disembarking and total expenditure concur in discriminating the groups. Age is the first and most important variable that enters the binary splitting process of the tree. It divides Cluster 4 (right branch) from the remainder. This group reports the age of cruisers of 65 and more as most distinctive feature. The complementary subset (left branch of the tree) is characterized by cruisers of younger age. For these units, the port of call is a very important further discriminating variable. The right sub-branch comprises those who disembarked in Montevideo, and it splits further in two parts where age acts again as a discriminating factor. Middle-aged cruisers (36–64) are part of almost the totality of Cluster 5 (91.7%), whereas tourists of other ages enter 48.9% of Cluster 3. For those who instead disembarked in Montevideo, gender concurs to discriminate further between men, who enter 89.3% of Cluster 1, and women, who are further discriminated according to their age. In this further step, again Cluster 3 results to be composed by non-middle aged tourists, this time for its 35.1%, whereas cruisers aged between 36 and 64 take another step of splitting. The latter involves total expenditure levels and generates 91.3% of Cluster 2 and 4.7% of Cluster 5, where high spenders affect such small portion of the latter.

The interpretation of clusters’ main discriminating variables is less direct if we take into account the latent dimensions that synthesize each VClust – Fig. 7. Of course, the higher complexity of this second tree structure might be due to the fact that the latent dimensions of VClust express concepts that are themselves more complex than the single indicators of Fig. 6. Here VClust 2, that is the highly related variable to Argentineans disembarking at Punta del Este, is the most important discriminating feature. Those that present the lowest values of this variable are part of the right side branch, which is split further by age-related variables (VClust 5 for elderly, and then VClust 3 for young travellers). Then what reported for Fig. 6 appears again: elderly travellers enter 43.9% of Cluster 4, whereas young ones are part of 42% of Cluster 3, and middle aged enter 89.3% of Cluster 5. Cruisers in the left-side branch generated by VClust 2, which is those that show a high score for this variable, are further divided according to VClust 4 that reports a women-related dimension. Then, male cruisers are further distinguished according to their economic impact (VClust 1) into a group entering 2.3% of Cluster 1 (high economic impact), and another one of non-high impact being part of 93.5% of Cluster 1. Women instead are split for their age (VClust 5), with elder ones being divided again into younger (part of 51.9% of Cluster 3) and not (54.5% of Cluster 4). Younger women are split according to their economic impact (VClust1) into Cluster 5 (only 5.9% of it) and 97.9 of Cluster 2.

Overall, results of both the CART analyses highlighted the primary importance of variables such as age and port of disembarking, and to a second extent of gender and expenditure. The latter deserves peculiar attention. In both CART diagrams, the segment of very high spenders is isolated. But if on one side the raw variable in Fig. 6 regarded only 4.7% of Cluster 5, on the other side such element percentage increased when dealing with a broader concept of ‘economic impact’ as measured by VClust 1 (2.3% plus 5.9%). It is also interesting to note that the model does not apply any other splitting rule within the subsample of the spenders with relatively lower levels. This might confirm that, after isolating for very high spenders, the economic impact of cruisers might be quite widespread and somehow similar across the subsets.

Despite the remarkable growth of the cruise industry and its great changes, studies on cruise passenger’s behavior while at port are not common in the academic research. In this sense, the present paper contributed both to the cruise industry literature, and to provide some insights to destination stakeholders, who can use the results as an input to design suitable managerial strategies and to offer a pleasant and satisfactory visitation during the time ship passengers are onshore.

In this work we adopted a three-step multivariate market segmentation analysis. Given the classic problem in reducing dimensionality we used ClustOfVar, a relatively recent algorithm for the statistical software R that is able to handle qualitative-quantitative datasets. There are few studies designed to handle mixed datasets in the tourism field and, particularly to best of our knowledge, in the cruise tourism analysis. Key findings reported the importance of the cruiser onshore expenditure in general terms, thus suggesting that cruise tourists find good shopping opportunities while at Uruguayan ports. In addition, economic impact in all the items appears to have something in common with the enjoyment of personal characteristics of local people. Thus, it would be desirable to create a good atmosphere for cruisers while at port, through positive experience derived from the interaction with locals. With this regard, the synergic cooperation with local partners may lead also to effects that go beyond the single cruise trip, such as the increasing loyalty of customers [38], and the development of local firms [27].

As to managerial implications from other findings, suggestions regard the launch of targeted market strategies and campaigns focusing on attracting passengers from nationalities different from the Argentinean one. As results indicate, being resident in Argentina is in the same group and positively correlated with loyalty indicators. Promotion of cruise tourism can be a good strategy in order to increase the volume of the segment of travellers who have never visited the country.

In addition, variables such age and port of disembarking, and to a lesser extent gender and economic impact, have shown to be the main drivers for cluster formation. This is a further strong suggestion towards the organization of specific on-site activities for differently aged cruisers. Moreover, the specific features of each place of disembarking should be highlighted while promoting the activities at the port of call, and at the same time be an important part of the experience of the tourist. Once more, all this reinforces the idea of creating or strengthening the relationships with local partners. For what concerns the economic impact, at Punta del Este there has been a reduced number of tourists exhibiting very high levels of spending, mainly women. But after isolating for these, no further discriminating thresholds of expenditure or economic impact were functional to identify segments of tourists. This might suggest that the profitability of disembarking tourists could be quite widespread within the great majority of them.

The used dataset comes from an official survey from the Uruguayan Ministry of Tourism (MINTURD), which reports a large sample of cruisers. Of course, this is a strong point. However the main limitation of this study is given by the used dataset itself. Important variables such as income, and behaviors-related ones while at the port are absent. In addition, the presence of psychographic variables is limited. For future researches, it would be of great importance to include these key variables. This would allow a better understanding of attitudes and behaviors that are crucial for market operators and promoters of activities related to cruise ship visit. Future research directions can consist in applying the technique to other surveys of cruisers visiting other places and in different times, in order to better define the tourists’ profile of this growing segment in the tourism industry. More in general, the combination of information from clusters of variables and of units can support market segmentation and analysis in a wide variety of business contexts.
