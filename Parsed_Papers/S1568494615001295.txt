                  In this article, a meta-heuristic technique based on a backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is employed to produce solutions to ascertain distributed generators (DGs). The objective is established to reduce power loss and improve network voltage profile in radial distribution networks by determining optimal locations and sizes of the DGs. Power loss indices and bus voltages are engaged to explore the initial placement of DG installations. The study cares with the DG type injects active and reactive power. The proposed methodology takes into consideration four load models, and their impacts are addressed. The proposed BSA-based methodology is verified on two different test networks with different load models and the simulation results are compared to those reported in the recent literature. The study finds that the constant power load model among various load models is sufficed and viable to allocate DGs for network loss and voltage studies. The simulation results reveal the efficacy and robustness of the BSA in finding the optimal solution of DGs allocation.
