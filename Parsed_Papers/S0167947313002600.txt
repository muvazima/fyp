                  Categorization is often needed for clinical decision making when dealing with diagnostic (prognostic) biomarkers and a binary outcome (true disease status). Four common methods used to dichotomize a continuous biomarker 
                        X
                      are compared: the minimum 
                        P
                     -value, the Youden index, the concordance probability and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane. These methods are compared from a theoretical point of view under Normal or Gamma biomarker distributions, showing whether or not they lead to the identification of the same true cut-point. The performance of the corresponding non-parametric estimators is then compared by simulation. Two motivating examples are presented. In all simulation scenarios, the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane and concordance probability approaches outperformed the other methods. Both these methods showed good performance in the estimation of the optimal cut-point of a biomarker. However, when methods do not lead to the same optimal cut-point, scientists should focus on which one is truly what they want to estimate, and use it in practice. In addition, to improve communicability, the Youden index or the concordance probability associated to the estimated cut-point could be reported to summarize the associated classification accuracy. The use of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach for cut-point finding is strongly not recommended because its objective function is computed under the null hypothesis of absence of association between the true disease status and 
                        X
                     . This is in contrast with the presence of some discrimination potential of 
                        X
                      that leads to the dichotomization issue.
               
            

In the presence of a continuous response test or a biomarker 
                        X
                     , it is often necessary to identify a cut-point value to classify subjects as testing positive, considered at high risk of being diseased, from those testing negative, considered at low risk of being diseased.

In this setting, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) is often the starting point for determining the optimal cut-point. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive fraction (TPF)–or sensitivity (probability of correctly classifying diseased subjects)–and the false positive fraction (FPF)–or 1-specificity (probability of incorrectly classifying non-disease subjects)–for all possible cut-point values of 
                        X
                      (Pepe, 2003).

Two methods based on the ROC curve are commonly used to determine the optimal cut-point for 
                        X
                     : the Youden index (Youden, 1950) and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach (Perkins and Schisterman, 2006). The Youden index method selects the optimal cut-point that maximizes the Youden function, defined as the difference between TPF and FPF over all possible cut-point values of 
                        X
                      (Youden, 1950). The point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach selects the optimal cut-point for 
                        X
                      as the one minimizing the Euclidean distance between the ROC curve and the (0, 1) point. The (0, 1) corner in the ROC curve represents the ideal situation with maximum sensitivity (
                        
                           TPF
                        
                        =
                        1
                     ) and specificity 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           
                              FPF
                           
                           =
                           0
                           )
                        
                     . Perkins and Schisterman (2006) showed that these ROC-based methods may not lead to the same optimal cut-point, and they advocated for the use of the Youden index method. In fact, this latter is a commonly used measure of overall classification accuracy, while the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach involves the minimization of a quadratic term that does not own a clinical meaning.

A third approach to determine the optimal cut-point for 
                        X
                      relies on the maximization of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) function (Glas et al., 2003), defined as the ratio between the odds of TPF and FPF over all possible cut-point values of 
                        X
                     . Böhning et al. (2011) have recently showed that the DOR strategy is no longer recommended since it might easily lead to the choice of cut-point values on the boundary of the parameter range of 
                        X
                     . In fact, when considered within a parametric homoscedastic normal distribution scenario, the log-DOR is a convex function. Conversely, this deficient behavior is not present for the Youden index method, that should be preferred to the DOR approach (Böhning et al., 2011).

A more recent simulation study (Liu, 2012) compared the performance of the Youden index method and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach with a new concordance probability criterion based on the choice of the optimal cut-point that achieves the maximum of the product of sensitivity (TPF) and specificity 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           
                              FPF
                           
                           )
                        
                     . This latter method performed well within the proposed Normal and Gamma distributions scenarios (Liu, 2012).

Indeed, within the class of ROC-based methods, the Youden index seems the most commonly used and sound intuitive criterion for cut-point finding (Perkins and Schisterman, 2006; Böhning et al., 2011). The recently proposed concordance probability (Liu, 2012) has a meaningful interpretation as well. It corresponds to the probability of being below or beyond the cut-point for any random pair of non-diseased and diseased subjects, respectively. However, none have so far compared the Youden index, the concordance probability and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane methods with the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach (Miller and Siegmund, 1982). This latter is based on the exploration of all observed values of 
                        X
                      to identify the optimal cut-point that best separates the two risk groups (i.e., diseased and diseased-free) according to the maximum achievable value of the Chi-square statistic on the association between 
                        X
                      and the binary outcome variable (true disease status).

Thus, the aim of this paper is to compare theoretically the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach, the Youden index method, the concordance probability criterion and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach in order to investigate whether they lead or not to the identification of the same optimal cut-point, and further investigating their performance through simulations. However, it has to be considered that when methods do not lead to the same optimal cut-point, scientists should focus on which one is truly what they want to estimate, and use it in practice.

We first outline the context by discussing the background methodology of each method in order to investigate any mathematical similarities and get insights into the meaning of the corresponding cut-points. Then, we generate data from either Normal and Gamma distributions in order to evaluate and compare the behavior and the performance of the investigated methods in cut-point finding. In practice, the cut-point for each of the four methods is non-parametrically estimated by empirical maximization of objective functions.

Two application examples are discussed through the paper. The first one deals with the cut-point finding task for the continuous remodeling index (CRI), defined in electrocardiology as a function of signal-averaged 
                        P
                     -wave duration and left atrial anteroposterior diameter at end-diastole (Vincenti et al., 2012). Moreover, we use a subset of data from a nested case-control study on prostate cancer (Etzioni et al., 1999) aimed to find a cut-point value for the serum prostate specific antigen velocity (Smith and Catalona, 1994).

Some final statistical considerations are given in discussion to guide researchers to the choice of the appropriate statistical approach when dealing with cut-point finding for a continuous test or biomarker.

                        X
                      denote a continuous biomarker which is supposed to be related to the binary outcome (true disease status), where 
                        D
                      stands for the presence of disease and

                     -value of the Chi-square test statistic on the absence of association between the resulting dichotomized biomarker and the binary outcome, or, in other words, the maximum of the associated Chi-square statistic on matrix (3) over all possible cut-point values

                        J
                      could be seen as the maximum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the diagonal chance line (Fig. 1
                     , length of the thick segment line). Moreover, 
                        J
                      could also be interpreted as the net gain of the true positive fraction with respect to the false positive fraction (Linn and Grunau, 2006).

Thus, in other words, the Youden function (6) is the square root of the numerator of the Chi-square function (5).

However, despite this mathematical similarity, it can be shown that the associated cut-point finding methods do not necessarily identify the same true cut-point. This is discussed in Appendix B, where it is described the special normal homoscedastic case where the ROC-based methods (6)–(8) identify the same true cut-point

                     -value approach increases with decreasing prevalence of the disease in the sample. A closed form for the cut-point can be derived only for the Youden index method (Liu, 2012).

In order to investigate the effect of heteroscedasticity, we first reduce the standard deviation of diseased subjects

                      to 0.5 (Fig. 2 Panel C) and then increase it to 1.5 (Fig. 2 Panel D). In these heteroscedastic scenarios, the maximum points of the four objective functions are different even in the case of a balanced design. In the first case (Fig. 2 Panel C), we observe that

In these scenarios, the objective functions (5)–(8) do not reach the maximum in correspondence of the same true cut-point (Fig. 3
                     ). Moreover, a closed form for the true cut-point cannot be derived for the investigated methods (Liu, 2012).

We compare the performance of the minimum

                     -value and the three ROC-based methods, Youden index, concordance probability and point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane, in the estimation of the optimal cut-point. We consider first the normal homoscedastic scenario with balanced design (

Consequently, we separately generate for the diseased and non-diseased groups 1000 samples of size

Moreover, in order to estimate the standard deviation and the confidence interval (CI) for the optimal cut-point, we apply the bootstrap resampling technique (Carpenter and Bithell, 2000). Within each of the 1000 generated samples, random sampling with replacement is used to draw 200 bootstrap samples to calculate the bootstrap estimate

                      bootstrap distribution in order to construct a 95% CI of the optimal cut-point.

Each bootstrap sample contributes one cut-point estimate, so that the standard deviation of the 200 cut-point estimates is used as the bootstrap estimator of the standard deviation 
                        
                           (

                      for the estimated cut-point. Within each of the aforementioned simulation scenario, the CI for the cut-point for each of the investigated methods is subsequently evaluated by computing coverage probability and mean length. Moreover, coverage symmetry of the bootstrap confidence interval is computed for the unbalanced design under Normal homoscedastic biomarker distributions.

The results of the balanced design under Normal homoscedastic distributions are shown in Table 1
                     . The relative bias of the investigated methods is small on all levels of classification accuracy. While the minimum 
                        P
                     -value, concordance probability and point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane methods generally underestimate the true cut-point

                     , the Youden index method overestimates 
                        
                           
                              c

                     . By comparing the MSEs, it can be noticed that the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane and concordance probability methods have better performance in the estimation of the optimal cut-point with respect to the other methods. Indeed, the MSE is inversely related to sample size. The performance of all methods improves with increasing classification accuracy.

                      of the three ROC-based methods. 95% bootstrap CIs are systematically narrower when considering the scenarios with better classification accuracies, i.e.  
                        J
                      of 0.6 and 0.8, and CZ of 0.64 and 0.81. Moreover, the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method achieves the narrowest CIs with respect to the other methods in all the analyzed scenarios. Coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level, except for the highest classification accuracy scenario, i.e, 
                        J
                      of 0.8 and CZ of 0.81, when considering the total sample size of 200 and 400. Moreover, the coverage probabilities for the point closest-to-(0, 1) in the ROC plane approach were generally lower than the nominal level if compared with those from the Youden index method.

The relative bias of the investigated methods is small on all levels of classification accuracy, except for the lowest classification accuracy scenario, i.e.  
                        J
                      of 0.2 and CZ of 0.36, when considering the three ROC-based methods. The MSE is lower for the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method, too.

                      shows the bootstrap standard deviation, coverage probability and mean length of the 95% bootstrap CI for the cut-point for the unbalanced design under Normal homoscedastic distributions. Even in this scenario, the SD

                      and mean length of the 95% bootstrap CI are lower for the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method with respect to the other investigated approaches. Coverage probabilities are also close to the nominal level, except for the highest classification accuracy scenario, i.e, 
                        J
                      of 0.8 and CZ of 0.81, where the coverage probabilities for all the investigate methods are lower than the nominal level. The coverage symmetry of the bootstrap confidence interval (Supplementary web-only Table 1, Appendix C) generally reveals a left coverage failure, while a right coverage failure is showed for the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach when considering the scenarios with better classification accuracy, i.e 
                        J
                      of 0.6 and 0.8, and CZ of 0.64 and 0.81.

Under a Gamma distribution assumption with a balanced design (Table 5
                     ), it can be noticed that the theoretical true cut-points

                      are all different. However, we fail to recognize a systematic ordering between these theoretical cut-points. Concerning the relative performance of the investigated methods, we note a negligible relative bias in the estimate of the optimal cut-point, except for the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach in the scenario with poor classification accuracy, 
                        J
                        =
                        0.2
                     . In all the analyzed cases, the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 SD
                              
                           
                           
                              B
                           
                        
                      and mean length of 95% CI are lower for the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method with respect to the other investigated approaches (Table 6
                     ). Coverage probabilities are also close to the nominal level, except for the highest classification accuracy scenario, i.e, 
                        J
                      of 0.8 and CZ of 0.81.

Summarizing, in all the analyzed simulation scenarios, the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane and concordance probability approaches show a better performance in the estimation of the optimal cut-point with respect to the minimum 
                        P
                     -value and Youden index methods. This finding is also confirmed by the bootstrap standard deviation and mean length of the 95% bootstrap CI. It has to be noticed, however, that in several scenarios methods do not lead to a common cut-point. Thus, the choice of the estimation method cannot be performed only relying on MSE considerations but also on the meaning of the objective function on which the estimation method is based.


                     Case study leading to the same cut-point
                  

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent arrhythmia associated with almost all heart diseases. An AF episode is defined paroxysmal (ParAF) when it spontaneously stops within 7 days from the onset and persistent (PerAF) when pharmacological or electrical interventions are needed for interruption.

A continuous remodeling index (CRI) aimed to separate patients presenting ParAF from those with sustained PerAF (i.e., AF episodes interrupted 7 days or more after the onset) has been recently developed (Vincenti et al., 2012). Briefly, this index is computed for each AF patient using the individual values of the 
                        P
                     -wave duration (SAPWd) and the left atrium diameter (LADd) as

                     . SAPWd is an expression of the intra-atrial conduction time, while LADd is a measure of atrial dimension. The modifications of intra-atrial conduction time and of atrial dimensions are characteristics of atrial remodeling.

Supplementary Web-Only Table 2 (see Appendix C) reports some descriptive statistics of SAPWd and LADd for the ParAF and sustained PerAF groups. We can note that SAPWd is significantly longer in sustained PerAF than in ParAF patients (153

                     Fig. 4
                      Panel A shows the ROC curve of the continuous remodeling index, along with the indication of the Youden index 
                        J
                     , the concordance probability CZ and the distance from the (0, 1) corner ER. The points on the normal QQ plot graphs of ParAF (Fig. 4 Panel B) and sustained PerAF (Fig. 4 Panel C) fall approximately on the straight diagonal line. Even if a small departure from normality emerges within the sustained PerAF group (Fig. 4 Panel C), the CRI could be considered normally distributed. As a confirmation, the Shapiro–Wilk non-parametric normal distribution test returns a 
                        P
                     -value of 0.29 and 0.16, respectively for the ParAF and sustained PerAF groups. However, care must be used when interpreting normality test results for small samples. The theoretical distributional scenario of the CRI is shown in Fig. 4 Panel D. We tested the homoscedasticity assumption through the Bartlett’s test, that returns a 
                        P
                      of 0.26.

A cut-point 
                        c
                      is needed to dichotomize the CRI result to define a criterion to divide AF episodes into PerAF or ParAF, so that the criteria identifies a PerAF condition when CRI is greater or equal to 
                        c
                     , and a ParAF condition when the CRI is less than 
                        c
                     . Since we are analyzing a relatively balanced design (33 vs. 26 patients) with Normal homoscedastic distributions, the investigated methods lead to the same cut-point

                        0.9
                     . We also estimate the 95% bootstrap CI estimate for the cut-point for each of the investigated methods, finding respectively for the minimum 
                        P
                     -value, Youden index, concordance probability and point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane methods the following 95% CI estimates: (−1.12, 2.34), (−1.18, 0.46), (−1.12, 0.46) and (−1.09, 0.24). Indeed, the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method achieves the narrowest CI. This is consistent with the results of the normal homoscedastic simulation study.


                     Case study leading to different cut-points
                  

We use data from a nested case-control study (Etzioni et al., 1999) (available for free download at http://labs.fhcrc.org/pepe/book/#datasets). This study aimed to analyze longitudinally the variation of total serum levels of PSA for 71 cases of prostate cancer and 70 controls matched to cases on date of birth and number of serum samples available for analysis.

PSA velocity (PSAV) measures how quickly PSA levels increase over time before prostate cancer diagnosis and it may have advantages over a single PSA measurement in differentiating between men with prostate cancer and controls (Smith and Catalona, 1994). Several methods are available to compute PSAV (Connolly et al., 2007). Given that PSA measurements are separated by a sufficient long time period (4.9 years for prostate cancer cases and 4.8 years for matched controls, see Supplementary Web-Only Table 3, Appendix C), in our case study we decide to compute PSAV through the rate of PSA change between the first and last PSA measurement.

Supplementary Web-Only Table 3 (see Appendix C) shows some descriptive statistics of prostate cancer cases and controls. Our analyses are restricted to 57 prostate cancer cases and 60 matched controls reporting at least two PSA measurements. Mean ages are similar between men diagnosed with cancer compared with controls (62 vs. 60, 
                        P
                        =
                        0.07
                     ), while initial PSA levels (5.8 ng/ml vs. 1.2 ng/ml, 
                        P
                        <
                        0.0001
                     ) and last PSA levels before diagnosis (18.1 ng/ml vs. 1.7 ng/ml, 
                        P
                        <
                        0.0001
                     ) are different between the considered groups. The mean number of total PSA tests is not statistically significant different between men diagnosed with cancer compared with controls (3.8 vs. 3.9,

                     , the concordance probability CZ and the distance from the (0, 1) corner ER. The distributions of the PSAV within controls (Fig. 5 Panel B) and within the prostate cancer group (Fig. 5 Panel C) are positive skewed, with some overlapping. The PSAV follows a Gamma model both in cases and controls group, even if a small departure from Gamma distribution emerges for prostate cancer subjects (Fig. 5 Panel C).

A cut-point c for the PSAV is needed to discriminate suspicious prostate cancer. Here, the minimum

                     -value, Youden index, concordance probability and point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane methods. This latter approach achieves the narrowest confidence interval. This is consistent with Gamma simulation results presented in Table 6.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this article, we present a theoretical investigation and a simulation study aimed to compare four methods commonly used to define cut-points of continuous biomarkers: the minimum 
                        P
                     -value (Miller and Siegmund, 1982), the Youden index (Youden, 1950), the concordance probability (Liu, 2012) and the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane (Perkins and Schisterman, 2006). We proved that these methods are mathematically related, since the Youden function is the square root of the numerator of the Chi-square function of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach. However, these methods do not necessarily identify the same optimal cut-point when considering the analyzed scenarios of Gaussian and Gamma distributions. The equality between the underlying true cut-points is observed for the three ROC-based methods in the case of Gaussian homoscedastic distributions of the biomarker (Liu, 2012). However, even under these conditions, the equality of these common true underlying cut-points to that of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach is not guaranteed unless we are in a balanced design.

We evaluated the performance of the investigated methods in finding the optimal cut-point through simulations. The optimal cut-point is determined non-parametrically by numerical maximization (Fluss et al., 2005) of the four investigated objective functions within all the proposed simulation scenarios. The use of non-parametric empirical estimators may introduce a bias in our evaluations. However, a closed parametric expression of the cut-point could be derived only for the Youden index method in case of Gaussian biomarker distributions (Schisterman et al., 2005; Liu, 2012).

We have shown that the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane (Perkins and Schisterman, 2006) and concordance probability (Liu, 2012) approaches perform well and outperform both the minimum 
                        P
                     -value (Miller and Siegmund, 1982) and Youden index (Youden, 1950) methods in the estimation of the cut-point within the investigated scenarios of Gaussian and Gamma biomarker distributions. In fact, while the relative bias is essentially zero for the investigated methods in all the considered scenarios, the MSEs of the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane and concordance probability (Liu, 2012) approaches are similar, but lower with respect to the MSEs of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value (Miller and Siegmund, 1982) and Youden index (Youden, 1950) methods, considering all levels of classification accuracy. As expected, MSE is inversely related to sample size. Moreover, we also provide estimation of the standard deviation and the 95% confidence interval for the cut-point through the bootstrap resampling technique. From this result, we can conclude that the bootstrap 95% confidence interval estimate of the cut-point for the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane method is systematically narrower with respect to the bootstrap confidence interval estimate of the other methods. However, we noted that coverage probabilities were lower than the nominal level when considering the highest classification accuracy case in both the Gaussian and Gamma biomarker distributions scenarios. To this aim, Schisterman and Perkins (2007) showed that the use of the Delta method for the Youden index approach yields coverage probabilities closer to the nominal value and narrower confidence intervals for the cut-point with respect to the bootstrap method. However, the application of the Delta method to the other three methods leads to cumbersome calculations.

More in general, the observed difference in the MSE behavior between the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach (Miller and Siegmund, 1982) and the three ROC-based methods (Liu, 2012) is due to the variance component included in the denominator of the Chi-square statistic of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach. This variance component is computed under the null hypothesis of absence of association between the true disease status and the biomarker. However, the identification of a cut-point is based on the possible presence of a discrimination potential of the biomarker, i.e. the alternative hypothesis. For this reason, this variance component included in the denominator of the Chi-square statistic could not be considered as an advantage of the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach.

We also note within the Gaussian non-balanced scenario that the true cut-point underlying the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach varies with the disease prevalence in the sample. In particular, a reduction of the sample disease prevalence determines a systematic shift of 
                        
                           
                              c
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    χ
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                      towards the distribution of disease subjects, while 
                        
                           
                              c
                           
                           
                              ROC
                           
                        
                      is unaffected. This is certainly a key limitation of this approach that rules out its usefulness as method for cut-point finding.

It was noted in Böhning et al. (2008) that the Youden function is invariant with respect to small changes in the cut-point when considering the Gaussian distributed biomarker scenario. While this is a positive characteristic of the Youden index in a meta-analysis setting (Böhning et al., 2008), this is not a good behavior in a cut-point finding scenario. This additive invariance property do not hold for the concordance probability function, making this last criteria more suitable for cut-point finding.

Within our investigation, the Youden index function gives equally weights to sensitivity and specificity. However, when disease prevalence is not close to 50%, the weighted Youden index should be employed to take into account the relative importance attributed to a true positive or true negative result by addressing aspects related to both disease prevalence and patient’s benefit associated with a correct positive test result (Jund et al., 2005; Smits, 2010). In low prevalence settings more weight should be attributed to specificity since a small defect in specificity will lead to an important number of false positives. Conversely, in high prevalence settings, more weight should be putted on sensitivity to ensure a low number of false negatives.


                     Perkins and Schisterman (2006) advocated for the use of the Youden index method after comparison with the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane criterion for its sound intuitive clinical meaning, while Böhning et al. (2011) recently showed that the Youden index method should be preferred to the diagnostic odds ratio approach (Glas et al., 2003). Our work completes these series of evidences (Perkins and Schisterman, 2006; Liu, 2012)) by addressing the minimum 
                        P
                     -value approach (Miller and Siegmund, 1982).

While we showed that point estimation is better done with the point closest-to-(0, 1) corner in the ROC plane approach, we also must consider that this does not necessarily lead to the “better cut-point”. Considering that methods may point to different true cut-points (as in the Gamma scenario), scientists should focus on which one is truly what they want to estimate, and use it in practice. For instance, the Youden index method (Youden, 1950) could be chosen if the researcher is interested in interpreting the net gain of the true positive fraction accounting for the false positive fraction (Linn and Grunau, 2006), while the concordance probability approach (Liu, 2012) could be used if the researcher aims to interpret the probability of being below or beyond the cut-point for any random pair of non-diseased and diseased subjects. This motivates an ever-increasing body of literature (Nakas et al., 2010; Perkins and Schisterman, 2005), comprising methods for constructing confidence interval of the Youden index and its corresponding optimal cut-point (Schisterman and Perkins, 2007; Lai et al., 2012). More in general, great care should be taken when establishing a biomarker cut-point for clinical use. Methods for categorizing new biomarkers are often essential in clinical decision-making even if categorization is gained at a considerable loss of power and information (Royston et al., 2006). In the future, new methods involving the study of the functional form between the biomarker and the outcome through regression techniques such as fractional polynomials or splines should be considered to alternatively define cut-points for clinical use.
