                  Given a set of players and the cost of each possible coalition, the question we address is which coalitions should be formed. We formulate mixed integer linear programming models for this problem, considering core stability and strong equilibrium. The objective function looks for minimizing the total cost allocated among the players. Concerned about the difficulties of managing large coalitions in practice, we also study the effect of a maximum cardinality constraint per coalition. We test the models in two applications. One is in collaborative forest transportation and the other one in inventory of spare parts for oil operations. In these situations, collaboration opportunities involving significant savings exist, but for several reasons, it may be better to group the players in different sub-coalitions rather than in the grand coalition. The models we propose are thus relevant for deciding how to partition the set of players. We also prove that if the strong equilibrium model is feasible, its optimal cost is equal to the optimal cost of the core stability model and, consequently, a coalition structure that solves one problem also solves the other problem. We present results that illustrate this property. We also present results where the core stability problem is feasible and the strong equilibrium problem is infeasible. Setting an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of the coalitions, allows us to study the marginal savings of enlarging the cardinality of the coalitions. We find that the marginal savings of allowing one more player significantly decreases as the bound increases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Collaboration among different agents is an effective way to improve logistic operations. Evidence has been provided in many industries. For instance, Nagarajan and Sŏsić (2009) and Nagarajan and Bassok (2008) refer to a variety of contexts where different suppliers create coalitions to achieve the benefits of collaboration, including complementary component-suppliers for car assembly systems, the health-care industry and various service sectors. Other examples arise in inventory management (Chen, 2009; Özen, Fransoo, Norde, & Slikker, 2008) and transport (Frisk, Göthe-Lundgren, Jörnsten, & Rönnqvist, 2010; Lozano, Moreno, Adenso-Díaz, & Algaba, 2013). In order to implement collaboration, there needs to be an agreement among the agents with respect to how to share the benefits. A growing body of literature in Operations Research and Management Science has applied principles of cooperative game theory to resolve this sharing issue. One of the main streams in this literature aims at defining allocation rules to predict or prescribe how rational players will distribute the gains they obtain from cooperation, assuming in general that the grand coalition will be formed, in line with the classical approach to transferable utility games (Meca-Martínez, Sánchez-Soriano, García-Jurando, & Tijs, 1998). The formation of the grand coalition may find support in the assumption of superadditive games, i.e., where the value of a coalition is at least as good as the sum of the values of its members acting separately. This would mean that the more agents collaborate, the better is the outcome they achieve (or at least “not worse” than if only some of them or none of them collaborate). In practice, however, several reasons might exist for the grand coalition not to be formed. Some of these reasons, for example, are the managerial complexity of conforming large coalitions and the political issues that can affect the decision of changing from a non-collaborative to a collaborative solution. For example, in transport operations, collaboration usually involves just a few partners, because as the number of partners grows coordinating the cooperation becomes more problematic and/or costly (Lozano et al., 2013). Then, given a set of players and the cost of each possible coalition, the relevant question arises of which coalitions should be formed. The formed coalitions define a partition of the set of players, which in game theory is called a coalition structure (Aumann & Dreze, 1974). In contrast to a vast body of game theory literature dealing with coalition structure and coalition formation issues (see e.g. Greenberg, 1994), the OR/MS literature is more sparse in this stream. Some of the exceptions addressing issues related to coalition structures in OR are Axelrod, Mitchell, Thomas, Bennett, and Bruderer (1995), Leng and Parlar (2009), Nagarajan and Sŏsić (2009) and Sŏsić (2006, 2010). Other recent works have acknowledged the relevance of the coalition structure issues, although without addressing them (Chen, 2009; Kim & Jeon, 2009; Lozano et al., 2013).

In this article, we propose mixed integer linear programming formulations to simultaneously approach the coalition structure and cost allocation problems. Our formulations aim at deciding which coalitions should be formed and the cost allocation to the players in each of them, subject to stability conditions. These stability conditions are of two types. First, we formulate constraints to model internal stability, i.e., the core constraints for the members within a coalition. Second, we formulate constraints to model the strong stability, i.e., where no group of players, whether from the same coalition or from different ones, can get together and form new coalition(s) in such a way that they are all better off (Aumann, 1959; Hart & Kurz, 1983). Concerned about the complications of implementing large coalitions in practical situations, we also incorporate conditions on the maximum number of players that can form a coalition. We test our models in two applications. The first is a collaborative forest transportation problem presented by Frisk et al. (2010), which includes eight companies operating in Sweden. As the companies operate in similar regions, the opportunities for collaborative transportation represent important savings, in the range 5–15%. The second is a problem on collaboration in inventory of spare parts for oil operations, where risk pooling represents an important source of savings of about 20% of the inventory costs (Guajardo, Rönnqvist, Halvorsen, & Kallevik, 2014).

Our work contributes in both practical and theoretical aspects. In the practical aspects, we approach two cases motivated in forestry and oil operations, where collaboration in transport and inventory operations improve the non-cooperative case. Since we do not assume any particular form of the cost functions, the potential for applications may also be extended to other industries using collaborative logistics. In the theoretic aspects, we introduce model formulations for a relevant problem in the interface of Game Theory and Operations Research. The models consist of a set partitioning problem subject to stability constraints. Because of the combinatorial structure of this problem and its relevance in theory and practice, we believe our work opens a rich source of challenges where OR solution methods can play an important role.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize concepts of stability in cooperative games. In Section 3, we formulate models for coalition structure and cost allocation. In Section 4, we apply the models in collaborative problems in the forestry and oil industries, and also discuss its applicability in larger scale problems. Our conclusions are presented in Section 5.

A growing body of literature has incorporated concepts from cooperative game theory in collaborative logistics. Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011) review a number of references on collaborative inventory management. In other areas of operations management, however, the use of cooperative game theory is much less prevalent (Hu, Caldentey, & Vulcano, 2013). In the following, we introduce some notation and summarize the concepts on stability in cooperative games that are relevant for our article.

We consider a game consisting of a set of players N. We refer to the cardinality of this set by 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           |
                           N
                           |
                        
                     . Players can form coalitions, in order to take advantage of collaboration opportunities. The set N is the grand coalition. We refer by

                      to the cost incurred by coalition Z, where

                     Constraints (1) correspond to the rationality conditions, which state that there is no subset Z of players such that should they form a coalition separately from the rest they would perceive less total cost than the total cost allocated to them in u. In the case of Z containing only one player, the constraint corresponds to the individually rational condition, which states that the cost allocated to each player j must not be greater than its stand-alone cost. Constraint (2) corresponds to the efficiency condition, which states that the sum of the costs allocated to all the players must be equal to the optimal expected cost of the grand coalition. The core of the game is the set of all vectors u satisfying constraints (1) and (2). An allocation that belongs to the core is said to be stable. In order to differentiate this type of stability from a following concept, we will refer to it as core stability.

As mentioned in the introduction, several reasons might exist for the grand coalition not to be formed. Therefore, it becomes relevant to study the stability of cooperative situations where different group of players may form different coalitions. The formed coalitions define what in game theory is called a coalition structure (Aumann & Dreze, 1974). Following the notation of Sŏsić (2006), a coalition structure

We assume the cost of all coalitions are given parameters. This in practice does not necessarily mean that the costs and the information needed to compute them are known by all the players, but it is enough if there would be a decision maker who could gather this information. Then, this decision maker needs to find the coalitions that should be formed, aiming at minimizing the total allocated cost while satisfying the constraints. In the two cases that primarily motivated our work, this decision maker emerges in two different ways. In the forestry case, there is a consulting team that gathers the information from the companies and conduces the analysis, in order to come up with a suggestion on how to implement the collaboration among the companies. It is crucial that this third party manages the information under confidentiality, since part of the information is sensitive to the companies. In fact, this has been the only viable way for them to provide the information. The third party also needs to be impartial and, therefore, the minimization of total cost is an appropriate overall objective when making the suggestion on how to implement the collaboration. This objective is also convenient from an environmental point of view, as usually the savings in transportation cost are associated to a reduction of emissions from the trucks. In the oil case, the suggestion is made by a main company which has the operational responsibility for all the warehouses that hold inventory of spare parts, despite some different ownership structures involving other companies and stakeholders. The data from all these warehouses are managed in the same enterprise resource planning system SAP. The operational responsible acts with impartiality and a cost efficient criterion, therefore the solution is also driven by an overall cost minimization objective.

Although in both cases all players are willing to conform to the suggested coalitions, we would like to prevent deviations that can affect the stability of the coalition structure. We quote Hart and Kurz (1983) to emphasize that “forming a coalition does not eliminate the individual players as decision makers. In all interactions with the other players, coalition members act as one unit (it may be useful to think of a ‘representative agent’ taking their place); however, this arrangement will continue only as long as each player finds it desirable to act this way”. For this purpose, they refer to the notion of strong equilibrium introduced by Aumann (1959). This refers not only to the stability within the formed coalitions, but also in the whole structure, so that for all players there would be no incentives to form a coalition that is not contained in the structure. For example, let us assume a structure

                      to this strong stability problem composes the core of a game in the coalition structure sense defined by Aumann and Dreze (1974).

To our knowledge, no general optimization model has been proposed for these problems. The few works in OR/MS addressing related issues have rather focused in more particular settings. Also, they have adopted a predictive perspective on how the agents will group rather than a decision making perspective on how the agents should group. Such predictive perspective is presented by Axelrod et al. (1995), in a setting of alliances forming to develop and sponsor technical standards. Nagarajan and Sŏsić (2009) focus on a dynamic setting where different suppliers can create alliances for selling components to an assembler. They assume the coalition members divide the profit equally, unlike our case where the allocations are decision variables of the problem and, therefore, may differ from one to another member. Sŏsić (2006, 2010) incorporates the notion of farsighted stability, proposed by Chwe (1994), in an inventory sharing setting and in an information sharing setting firstly approached by Leng and Parlar (2009). In the dynamic of these games, the outcomes are described by a set of possibilities within several time periods and the relevant information is common knowledge for all players. In contrast, we focus on single-period games with side payments, i.e., where the outcome to a coalition can be captured by just one real number, namely the characteristic function (Kaneko & Wooders, 2004), and this function is not necessarily known by all the players.

In the following, we formulate mixed integer programming models for the core stability and the strong stability versions of the coalition structure problem. First, let us introduce the notation on sets, parameters and decision variables.

                        We refer to this model by M1. Objective function (3) minimizes the total allocated cost among the players. Constraints (4) correspond to the rationality conditions, which state that in the resulting coalition structure there is no set of players

                         such that should they form a coalition separately from the rest they would perceive less total cost than the total cost allocated to them in the allocation u. Constraints (5) correspond to the efficiency condition, which states that the sum of the costs allocated to all the players in a formed coalition equals the optimal cost of such coalition. Constraints (6) state that each player is assigned to one and only one coalition, thus the solution to the model, if such exists, defines a partition of set N. Constraints (7) state the binary nature of variables x and the non-negativity of variables u.

Note that constraints (4) and (5) recover the stability and efficiency constraints (1) and (2) for any coalition k such that

Model M1 is a mixed integer programming model that solves a set partitioning problem, subject to the stability constraints. A solution to this model exists (in the worst case where collaboration does not achieve any savings, the structure of all players standing alone is stable). If we knew beforehand that the core of each coalition (or at least the core of each of those coalitions that minimize cost) is not empty, an equivalent approach to solve the problem could be given by the following two-stages procedures. In the first stage, a pure set partitioning problem is solved, for instance, through an integer programming model in the binary variables

                         subject to constraints (6). In the second stage, a stable allocation must be determined for each coalition k such that in the optimal solution to the set partitioning model

                        . However, the information on the non-emptiness of the core in our setting is not known beforehand, since we do not make any related assumption on the cost parameter values

                        . That is why it is important to consider the coalition structure and the cost allocation problems simultaneously in the same model. Then, if a solution (
                           
                              £

                              u
                           
                        ) to this model is found, it assures the cost allocation vector u satisfies the stability conditions within each coalition in the structure 
                           
                              £
                           
                        . Then, the implementation of the structure could re-allocate the cost within each formed coalition through any other desirable allocation rule.

The coalition structure resulting from model M1 assures that players from the same coalition that is formed have no incentives to deviate and create their own coalition. However, the structure does not assure that players who belong to different coalitions have no incentive to conform a new coalition. This needs incorporating the notion of strong equilibrium, in order to assure not only stability within the formed coalitions, but also in the whole structure, so that for players who were assigned to different coalitions there would be no incentives to form a different coalition. We formulate a mixed integer linear programming model for this problem in a similar way to model M1, maintaining objective function (3) and constraints (5)–(7), but replacing constraints (4) by the following constraints:

Concerned about the complications of managing large coalitions in real-world situations, an interesting question is how to structure the players in sub-coalitions such that a maximum cardinality constraint is satisfied. That is, each structured coalition must contain at most m players, where m is a positive integer parameter that represents the maximum number of players allowed in each coalition. The size of a coalition has been identified by D’Amours and Rönnqvist (2010) as an important aspect in collaborative logistics. In practice, the upper bound on the coalitions’ size might be motivated for several reasons. For example, Lozano et al. (2013) point out that although transportation costs are always reduced through collaboration, as the number of partners grows coordinating the cooperation becomes more problematic and/or costly, which is one of the reasons why in practice cooperation in transport usually involves just a few partners. Other reasons are argued by Stein (2010), who remarks that the formation of coalitions might be restricted due to structural issues, laws and culture ideology. He refers to some other references in restrictive cooperative game theory (so called “network games”), and remarks that although some of them date from early times, the literature in this field is still sparse and fragmentary. As another reason, in one of the cases that primarily motivated our work, we have observed that managers are subject to some political issues which do not allow the implementation of a grand coalition, but only of smaller sub-coalitions. For example, in our inventory management case, it might be clear that because of the risk pooling effect, a completely centralized solution performs better in terms of costs than the decentralized solution where there is no collaboration. However, in order to change a previously implemented decentralized solution, the managers’ decision needs to consider that a centralized solution would perhaps need significantly less staff. In some organizations this might involve some difficult issues.

In general, all these reasons affecting the maximum cardinality of a coalition may not be easy to reflect in the cost functions. Therefore, it becomes relevant to analyze the coalition structure problem subject to a maximum cardinality constraint. An obvious alternative to incorporating this condition in models M1 an M2 is to simply re-define the set K including only coalitions of cardinality less than or equal to m (or just to set

Note that the coalition structure problem subject to the maximum cardinality constraint presents similarities with k-partitioning problems, which arise in multiprocessor scheduling of jobs on machines at minimum makespan (Babel, Kellerer, & Kotov, 1998, Kellerer and Kotov, 2011). These problems also look for a partition into subsets subject to a cardinality limit. However, while in k-partitioning problems the weight (processing time or cost) depends only on the item and not in the subset (machine) it is assigned to, in the coalition structure problem the cost is associated to the subset rather than the sum of the costs of its members. Also, the coalition structure problem includes the stability constraints and the allocation variables which do not appear in k-partitioning problems.

In the following, we present a proposition that relates the solutions of models M1 and M2.
                           Proposition 1
                           
                              If the strongly stable coalition structure model (M2) is feasible, then its optimal objective value is equal to the optimal objective value of the core-stable coalition structure model (M1). Likewise, if model M2 is feasible, a coalition structure that solves any of the two models, also solves the other model.
                           

This relationship between the solutions to the two models is fairly intuitive because the strong stability condition is more restrictive than the core stability condition. In fact, since constraint (8) must hold for all

In this section we present two examples of applications of the MIP models presented in the previous section. The first one corresponds to a problem in forest transportation, where different players can collaborate by means of backhauling and wood bartering. The second one corresponds to a problem of inventory of spare parts for oil operations, where different players can collaborate by means of inventory pooling. In order to find optimal coalition structures and cost allocations, we proceed in two stages. First, we solve the corresponding cost minimization problem (transportation or inventory) for each possible coalition k. This cost minimization problem provides an optimal plan for each coalition and the characteristic function

                                 k
                              
                           
                        
                      of the cooperative game. In the second stage we use such cost as parameters in the MIP models and solve them to find the coalition structure and cost allocation. Then, the coalitions contained in the structure implement the collaboration according to the corresponding plan, which was obtained when solving the cost minimization problem.


                        Frisk et al. (2010) studied a problem of cost allocation in collaborative forest transportation, motivated by a real-world case. The case study was done by the Forest Research Institute of Sweden and included eight companies with operations in southern Sweden. In this context, collaboration among companies creates opportunities to better utilize their overlaps and distances to mills. The authors studied a number of instances of this problem and found that savings of up to 14.2% can be achieved by implementing collaboration. This can be done by wood bartering and/or backhauling. Wood bartering can be used in such a way that destinations between supply and demand nodes are changed. This means that one company may send some of its own supply to another company’s mill, and in return get the same volume back to its own mill but from another company. This can be achieved when the supply areas of the companies cover each other as this lowers the overall average transportation distances. The flows can be direct flows between a supply and a demand point or more complex routes where backhauling possibilities are included. Backhauling can be used to find better routes by combining two or several destinations (combination of supply and demand points) to reduce the proportion of empty driving. All computations were done in the decision support system Flow-Opt (Forsberg, Frisk, & Rönnqvist, 2005). This system was used to solve a transportation model for each possible coalition of companies.

                         the set of supply and demand points, respectively, at company j. Constraint sets (10) and (11) represent the supply and demand respectively at each company j in coalition k, and (12) the non-negativity conditions. We note that direct flow variables are represented using columns including only 2 nonzero elements (i.e. one pick up and one delivery). There is often a huge number of potential backhaul routes (often several hundred millions) and they can typically not be used explicitly in a solver. Instead, they are generated in a column generation approach (Carlsson & Rönnqvist, 2007). The restrictions imposed on the backhaul routes are e.g. driving time or the number of pick ups and deliveries. In tactical planning, there is often a practical limit for using backhaul routes consisting of two direct flows.

We implement these models in AMPL and solve them using the software CPLEX 12.5 on an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.26gigahertz processor with 8gigabyte of RAM. The solutions to models M1 and M2 in these instances are quickly obtained, in a matter of a second. Note, since there are eight companies, there are 255 coalitions, and consequently 255 binary variables

                         of model M1 is strictly decreasing in m. This means that the structure of stable coalitions that minimizes total cost always include at least one coalition of the maximum cardinality allowed by the upper bound m. This suggests that the more companies are allowed to collaborate, the less total cost, as expected in this case. However, the relative cost savings of including an additional company decreases in most cases when increasing the upper bound from m to

                        . It can be observed that the cumulative savings of allowing coalitions of cardinality up to 
                           
                              m

                         already account for more than a half of the total savings achieved by the grand coalition. And when setting

                        , more than 90% of these savings are achieved.

This analysis provides insights about the marginal savings of allowing one more player into the coalitions. These marginal savings becomes considerably less significant when m approaches the total number of players. In consequence, the decision maker in practice should analyze whether these savings overwhelm or not the managerial complexities of forming larger coalitions.

In order to illustrate how the structures change from one to another value of m, we have included Fig. 3
                        . This figure shows the coalition structures resulting for

                         it consists of the grand coalition). The driver to create a coalition depends on the participating companies, geographical distribution and their assortment distribution. If the companies have more geographical overlap, it creates better potential savings. In the case study, there are close to 40 assortments based on specie, diameter, length and quality. Any delivery between companies must be balanced for each assortment.

                              P

                        . These observations illustrate that the upper bound on the cardinality may have important implications.

Another observation from the results in Table 1 is that model M1 always had a solution, which is not surprising because a coalition structure satisfying the core stability within each coalition formed always exists. Also, for all

                        , model M2 was feasible and, consistently with Proposition 1, the optimal objective value was the same as the optimal objective value of model M1. Interestingly, when

                         there exists no strongly stable coalition structure, thus if the upper bound would be fixed to a maximum of six companies per coalition, there will always be incentives for some of them to deviate from their coalition to join with other players. For example, the solution we obtained by running model M1 to this instance results in the structure

                         would have incentives to form their own coalitions. These types of features are not easy to identify beforehand, especially since the characteristic function is a sort of black box with no particular properties. Therefore, the modeling approach we present can serve as a useful support tool for the decision maker.

When the strong equilibrium does not exist, it is worthy to explore the possibilities for some of the players to conform coalitions. It can be argued that the goal of any individual player is to minimize his own cost while keeping stability for all the players who conform his coalition. We tackle this problem by introducing some modifications to model M1. Without lost of generality, let player

                            be the one for which we minimize the cost. Let

This suggests that in a game where a single player motivates the formation of a coalition, the final structure may strongly depend on who is this player. Note, however, that the individual cost minimization problem may require this player to have the information from all players, which in practice can turn to be inviable as we pointed out in Section 2.

In their case study, Frisk et al. (2010) discussed the suitability of traditional cost allocation methods for sharing the costs in collaborative forest transportation, such as the Shapley values and the nucleolus. When it came to the acceptance of the cost allocation among the companies participating in the case study, the authors found some disadvantages of using these traditional methods, because of the large difference in size among the companies. In order to overcome this problem, they proposed a new method called Equal Profit Method (EPM). This method looks for a stable allocation such that the relative savings are as similar as possible for all participants. Such allocation solves a linear programming model, whose objective function is to minimize the maximum difference in pairwise relative savings between the players. Being g a continuous variable, such a linear programming model minimizes g subject to the core stability constraints and to

However, the minimization of the maximum of these differences would lead to a coalition structure where all player stand alone, because in this fully non-cooperative structure all coalitions save zero and, therefore, the difference among their relative savings is also zero (which is the minimum that can be achieved). Therefore, we rather keep the objective function (3) that minimizes the total allocated cost, and introduce a parameter 
                              
                                 φ
                              
                            as an upper bound on this difference. We also introduce a binary variable

                           Table 3
                            shows the results obtained in this forestry case using five different values of 
                              
                                 φ

It can be observed that relatively low values of

                            often leaves the strong stability problem without any feasible solution. This can be explained because the coalition structure of minimum cost does not necessarily fulfill the constraint on the bound 
                              
                                 φ
                              
                           . In fact only for 
                              
                                 φ

                            do the results match with the minimum cost solutions (which were reported in Table 1). Comparing the optimal objective values with those obtained by the original core stability model gives a sort of price of fairness, understanding by fairness the EPM’s notion of equality in relative savings among coalitions. This price of fairness obviously turns to be higher for lower values of 
                              
                                 φ
                              
                           , where the space of feasible solutions becomes smaller, while lower for higher values of

Looking for the maximum number of players in a game for which the core exists is mentioned by Frisk et al. (2010) as an alternative to the EPM’s objective function. How this subgroup of players should be selected was, however, left for further research in their article. We can easily answer this question by using model M1 with the following two modifications. First, the following objective function is used:

                           Constraint (23) states that only one coalition will be formed, while objective function (22) maximizes the number of players in it.

When running the resulting model for this instance, we obtain

                           . This is not surprising, since it was known from Frisk et al. (2010) that the core of the game considering the grand coalition in this instance was not empty.

Adding a cost on the coalition cardinality might be useful for reflecting the issues of managing large coalitions. How this cost should be calculated is, however, a tough task. As we discussed earlier, these issues are not easy to translate into a cost function. In order to illustrate the effects that this type of cost could have, we introduce an additional cost 
                              
                                 ζ
                              
                            on each coalition. We assume that 
                              
                                 ζ
                              
                            can be modeled as a convex increasing function of the cardinality of the coalition. This cost does not affect the structure of the models, but just modifies the cost parameter values C in constraints (4), (5) and (8). Namely, the new cost parameter value for coalition Z is

                            leads to savings of 0.40% with respect to the case where

                            is relatively high, the large coalitions do not form, thus increasing the upper bound on the number of payers per coalition has no impact. For example, when 
                              
                                 α
                                 =
                                 0.5
                              
                            any bound

                            leads to the same solutions, so coalitions of cardinality greater than 4 are not part of the optimal coalition structure.

When considering the cost 
                              
                                 ζ
                              
                           , the strong stability model has solution for all values of m in the four instances where 
                              
                                 α

                           . This happens still in the case where 
                              
                                 m
                                 =

                           , which without this cost had turned to be infeasible.

As for the optimal structures, for relatively small values of m, we observe the most convenient coalitions tend to form despite the increase in cost 
                              
                                 ζ
                              
                           . For example, when 
                              
                                 m

                                 2
                              
                            we find four coalitions take part in the optimal structure for all values of 
                              
                                 α
                              
                           . However, when m increases, the impact of changing 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            in the optimal structure is more notorious. For example, when fixing

These results illustrate that a cost on the cardinality of the coalitions may have an important effect in the resulting coalition structure.


                        Guajardo et al. (2014) studied a case of inventory of spare parts in an oil and gas company headquartered in Norway. The operations at the platforms offshore involve sophisticated equipment, usually expensive and subject to long lead times. Therefore, the inventory of spare parts plays an important role to facilitate operating conditions. Since some identical pieces of equipment are used at different platforms, pooling inventory presents important opportunities for savings. The authors estimated cost savings of about 20% from risk pooling in comparison to the case where inventory is carried separately for each platform. The spare parts are held at inventory plants or licenses located along the Norwegian coast. Some of these plants lie right next to each other, within a same warehouse. Although the company is the majority owner of the licenses, there is also a set of other companies owning a share of them. Given the important consequences of stock out in oil operations, in terms of safety and downtime costs, an approach divided in stages as in Anupindi and Bassok (1999) and Granot and Sŏsić (2003) where the stage of collaboration is agreed after demand is realized, is not appropriate in this case. The coalitions rather need to be formed beforehand. On the other hand, due to several reasons, including political, operational and managerial difficulties, it is not straightforward to implement an inventory pool of spare parts to cope centrally with the demand from all the platforms.

For each coalition, we consider a single-item problem under continuous review (

The optimal base-stock S for each coalition k is found through a procedure aimed at minimizing ordering plus holding cost subject to a fill-rate constraint, that is, S is the positive integer number that solves the following inventory control problem:

The solution to this inventory control problem is simply the minimum positive integer

                         can be computed by evaluating the fill-rate starting from 
                           
                              S
                              =
                              1
                           
                         and consecutively increasing S by one, until the target 
                           
                              λ
                           
                         is fulfilled. This procedure tends to finish quickly in inventory control of spare parts, where the optimal base-stock levels are relatively low quantities. It not rarely happens that the optimal base-stock level for a coalition is lower than the sum of the optimal base-stock levels of its players standing alone and, therefore, the potential for collaboration appears. We implement and solve this inventory control problem by using Matlab. The solution to each instance is obtained in a matter of a second. More details about this case can be found in Guajardo et al. (2014) and Guajardo and Rönnqvist (2014).

We test our models in an instance including 16 players (each representing an inventory plant), 19 spare parts and 53 possible coalitions. These coalitions result from limiting the possibilities to only those where at least one item is used by all the players in the same coalition. The resulting coalitions include 2 sets of 4 players, 13 sets of 3 players, 22 sets of 2 players and 16 single-player coalitions. All players in this instance are somehow related with each other, either because they can directly collaborate in a same coalition or because another coalition includes one of its collaborator or another descendent in the collaborative relations. Therefore, the problem of finding the best structure cannot be separated in sub-problems for some players beforehand.

                        . This structure also solves model M2. What we believe is interesting from this instance is that only one of the two coalitions of four players (the largest cardinality of the possible coalitions) are part of the optimal solution.

                        . These do not form any coalition among themselves, because they do not use a same item, from the 19 items in this instance. On the other hand, these players could have formed coalitions with other players, but these other players are better forming coalitions with some others.


                        Table 5
                         shows the results of imposing an upper bound on the maximum number of players that can form a coalition.

Allowing coalitions of up to two players leads to savings which represent 91% of the savings achieved when allowing coalitions of up to four players. Note here that the optimal coalition structure obtained through model M1 is not strongly stable. In fact, model M2 is infeasible. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the optimal coalition structure of model M1 when 
                           
                              m

                              2
                           
                         consists of seven two-player coalitions, and players 
                           
                              P
                              5

                              6
                           
                         stay alone (note these two players cannot collaborate between themselves, because they have no common item). We have verified that such structure with the allocation vector found for model M1, violates the strong stability in five cases. The individual cost minimization model of Section (4.1.1) can be run for each player j, requiring the strong stability constraints only for the player who joins j. Similarly as in the forestry case, the structure and allocations so obtained may strongly depend on j.

                        . These three players do not have any item in common, and that is why they do not form any coalition among themselves. Players who could collaborate with them are better joining other coalitions.

The number of common items and their value is a main driver for the players to conform a coalition. Another driver is given by average demand values which complement each other, in the sense that the target service level for a coalition between players i and j can be satisfied by a base-stock level lower than the sum of the base-stock levels for the separate players. Because of the discrete nature of the base-stock level, the solution

Although our instances have been solved by the straight use of a solver, we would like to conclude this section with a brief discussion on the applicability of the models in larger scale instances.

                         is a deflector parameter (we use 
                           
                              α

                        .

Note the difference between these two sets of instances is given by the penalty term involving the deflector parameter 
                           
                              α
                           
                         and a term that, subject to 
                           
                              x
                              =
                              1
                           
                        , increases with the number of players. This attempts to consider that the implementation of larger coalitions is likely to involve larger costs.

We set a time limit of 1hour in each run of the models. For both data set instances, we have verified in our computational experiments that the models turn to be directly solved at least for a number of players up to 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              17
                           
                        . An example of how the solution time varies with the cardinality bound is shown in Fig. 5
                        . This figure shows the solution times of both models for the second set of instances with 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              12
                           
                        . It can be observed that model M1 runs quickly for all values of m. The instances that take longer times to be solved are those corresponding to model M2 where the upper bound on the maximum number of players per coalition lies between 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              6
                           
                         and 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              8
                           
                        . For all other values of m, model M2 runs relatively fast, in no more than three minutes. We explain this relation between m and the time solutions by the combinatorial structure of the problem and the tendency of the optimal structure to include coalitions of cardinality m or very close to it. Note when 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              n
                           
                        , there is only one structure of cardinality m, obviously the grand coalition. If the grand coalition is the optimal structure, we interpret it is evident for the solver to find this out quickly. If the grand coalition is not the optimal structure, the optimal is likely to be found in a structure containing one coalition of cardinality close to it, because the savings usually tend to increase with the number of players. From combinatorics, it is known that the number of coalition structures that can be formed from a set of n players is given by the Bell number, recursively defined as

                        . Note only one of these structures contains a set with 12 players (namely, the grand coalition) and only 12 of them contain a set with 11 players. On the other extreme, when

                        , there also exists only one coalition structure, obviously the one conformed by all players standing alone. When m is about the half of the total number of players, then there are more coalition structures of maximum allowed cardinality and it might become trickier for the solver to find the optimal solution, and we interpret that is why the solution time presents the shape in Fig. 5.

For a given number of players n, in order to solve the instances of model M1 for all values of m, it might be useful to start by solving the instance with the lowest relevant value of m (i.e., 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              2
                           
                        ). It is easy to note that the solution to the instance where the bound is set at m must be feasible in the instance where the bound is set at 
                           
                              m
                              +
                              1
                           
                        . Then the run of an instance with the bound set at 
                           
                              m
                              +
                              1
                           
                         may use the optimal solution of the instance where the bound was set at m as initial solution. Similar procedures have proved to be effective in other problems in need of solving several similar instances, such as the multiple scenarios solved in a combinatorial auction by Catalán, Epstein, Guajardo, Yung, and Martínez (2009). Also, heuristics based on initial solutions have proved to be effective in set partitioning problems, for example, in the ship scheduling problem studied by Brønmo, Christiansen, Fagerholt, and Nygreen (2007).

As for solving model M2, because of Proposition 1, it is enough to verify whether a cost allocation vector exists such that the optimal structure obtained when running model M1 satisfies the strong stability condition. This verification can be done without the use of binary variables, since the coalition structure is already fixed by the solution obtained when running model M1. Instead, running a purely linear programming formulation can complete the verification. This linear programming formulation consists only of variables

                        , which refers to the cost allocated to player j. These variables must satisfy efficiency and strong stability constraints. The efficiency constraints can be written as

Further testing of solution methods falls beyond the scope of this article. Some literature has dealt with the combinatorial issues in cooperative games where the characteristic function is solution to a problem with a particular structure. These include assignment games and travelling salesman games, among others. We refer the reader to Curiel (2008) for a detailed overview on these types of games. Another stream of literature has introduced some concepts from network problems in restricted cooperative games. In a recent article, Stein (2010) gives account on the immaturity of the literature on this stream. A couple of decades ago, Axelrod et al. (1995) point out the identification and quantification of the payoffs of each player in every conceivable set of alliances as a shortcoming of the game theoretic approach. Although we would certainly agree it is not straightforward to compute all relevant cost parameter values, current information technologies have made it possible to advance in this direction. And as for the solvability of the model, in this article we have provided empirical evidence this can be carried out for a relevant number of players in two applications and some experimental instances. Recent advances in core stability problems based on mathematical programming have proved to be effective in large-scale problems, as reported by Drechsel and Kimms (2010), who propose a procedure that allows them to compute core elements in games with up to 150 players. Other recent advances in set partitioning problems with side-constraints by Delorme and Soumis (2013) also support the possibilities of solving large-scale problems of similar characteristics. Overall, because of the combinatorial features of the problem we have studied in this article and its relevance in theory and practice, we believe our work opens a rich source of challenges where OR solution methods can play an important role.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Motivated by the context of collaborative logistics, we have formulated mixed integer linear programming models for coalition structure and cost allocation. The models consist of a set partitioning problem together with stability constraints. These stability constraints come from game theoretic principles, and consider both core stability and strong stability. We have tested the models in two applications; one in collaborative forest transportation and one in inventory pooling of spare parts for oil and gas operations. By running the models, we were able to determine coalition structures that satisfy the stability constraints at minimum cost, or, in the strong stability problem, to determine whether the problem has or not a feasible solution. If the latter is feasible, we have proved that a same structure solves both the core stability and the strong stability problems. The consideration or not of the strong stability conditions can have important effects. In some instances of the cases we have studied, it was verified that while the core stability problem is solved, the strong stability problem turned to be infeasible. This certainly can have practical implications, thus highlighting the notion of strong equilibrium in addition to the traditional core stability concept.

Our approach also allowed us to study the effects of restricting the maximum cardinality of the coalitions contained in a structure. We reported results where most of the savings from collaboration are achieved by allowing a certain number of players in the coalitions. Still if the grand coalition achieved more savings than the coalition structure subject to the maximum cardinality constraint, in practice a decision maker should analyze whether these savings overwhelm or not the managerial complexities of forming large coalitions. In the forestry case, for example, we found that increasing the upper bound on the cardinality of the coalitions from 7 to 8 companies provided only 0.08% of relative savings.

Although previous literature in OR has incorporated game theoretic principles into collaborative problems, most of it has paid attention to problems assuming the grand coalition is formed. Instead of making this assumption, we approached the cost allocation problem simultaneously with the problem of finding an optimal coalition structure. A vast source of opportunities derives from this research. First, although the coalition structure problem has been studied in game theory for several decades, there appear to be no particular solution methods to deal with the core stability and strong stability problems with general characteristic functions. Since this is basically a set partitioning problem subject to additional constraints, a direction for further research is to formulate solution methods that could efficiently find the optimal structures and cost allocation vectors. This is specially challenging in large-scale problems, because the number of coalitions increases exponentially with the number of players. We have reported examples where the models can be directly solved in short time including up to 17 players and about 131,000 coalitions. Any further dimension remains worthy of exploration. Second, it might be interesting to set conditions for the uniqueness of the solution to these problems, since beforehand there is no guarantee that the optimal structure and the cost allocations are unique. Also, since the costs have been assumed as parameters of the models, a natural extension is to study the case where these parameters are exposed to some type of uncertainty or where some data are missing. We have also assumed a fully cooperative behavior of the players. Another extension could consider the case where they can adopt non-cooperative or partly cooperative strategies. Finally, the implementation in practice of these types of models appears to be one of the challenges for achieving the benefits of collaboration. As referred by Chen (2009), getting all players to agree on how to share costs and benefits was identified as one of the major barriers to collaboration in practices on logistics and commerce. We believe our article has pointed in the correct direction to break these barriers.
