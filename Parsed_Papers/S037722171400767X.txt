                  In this paper we study a classical parallel machine scheduling model with m machines and n jobs, where each job is either accepted and then processed by one of the machines, or rejected and then a rejection penalty is paid. The objective is to minimize the completion time of the last accepted job plus the total penalty of all rejected jobs. The scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. We find some new optimal properties and develop an O(nlog n + n/ε) heuristic to solve the problem with a worst-case bound of 1.5 + ε, where ε > 0 can be any small given constant. This improves upon the worst-case bound

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Machine scheduling with rejection (also named “order acceptance and scheduling”) has attracted considerable attention from scheduling researchers as well as production managers who practice it in the past a few decades. One important application of scheduling with rejection arises in make-to-order production systems with limited production capacity or tight delivery requirements, where order rejection and scheduling decisions have to be made simultaneously (Cesaret et al., 2012). In practice, due to production capacity constraints and short delivery due dates, a typical manufacturer may have to reject some orders which have long processing times but contribute relatively small profits. Another important application of scheduling with rejection occurs in scheduling when outsourcing is an alternative option (Shabtay et al., 2013). Scheduling with rejection combines outsourcing and production scheduling decisions together.

Machine scheduling with rejection (MSR) has been studied extensively in the scheduling literature. Most of the MSR models are considered in the single-machine environment (e.g., Zhang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2009; Talla Nobibon and Leus, 2011; Oguz et al., 2010; Lee and Sung, 2008; Slotnick and Morton, 1996; Slotnick and Morton, 2007; Zhong et al., 2014, among others), or study on-line scheduling (e.g., Bartal et al., 2000; Seiden, 2001; Hoogeveen et al., 2003; Epstein et al., 2002, among others). MSR models with industrial applications are studied by Cheng and Sun (2009),Guerrero and Kern (1988),Cesaret et al. (2012), and Rom and Slotnick (2009), among others. Excellent literature review articles on MSR are provided by Slotnick (2011) and Shabtay et al. (2013) recently.

In this paper, we study a basic off-line parallel-machine MSR model. Bartal et al. (2000) are the first to introduce parallel machine scheduling models with rejection, where each job is either accepted and then processed by one of the machines, or rejected and then a rejection penalty is paid. The objective function is to minimize the makespan of all accepted jobs (i.e., the completion time of the last accepted job) plus the total rejection penalty of all rejected jobs. They study both the on-line model and the off-line model. For the on-line model, they present an on-line algorithm with the best-possible competitive ratio of 2.618. For the off-line model, they develop an O(nlog n) heuristic with a worst-case bound of

                      (here n is the number of jobs, while m is the number of machines), and present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the case when m is fixed, and a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the case when m is arbitrary. The running time complexity of their FPTAS is O((n/ε)
                        m
                     ), while the running time complexity of their PTAS is

                           )
                           ,
                        
                      where ε > 0 can be any small given constant. Note that such a PTAS has a running time complexity of O(n
                     27) when ε = 1. Thus, it is interesting to develop efficient heuristics with a better performance ratio to solve the off-line model, especially for the general case when m is arbitrary. Surprisingly, in terms of developing fast heuristics, the worst-case bound of

                      for the general off-line model in Bartal et al. (2000) is the best known result in the scheduling literature (see the very recent review papers Slotnick (2011); Shabtay et al. (2013)). In this paper, we study the off-line model in Bartal et al. (2000) for the general case when m is arbitrary, and present an O(nlog n + n/ε) heuristic with a worst-case bound of 1.5 + ε.

The scheduling problem we study can be described formally as follows: We are given a set of m identical parallel machines M = {M
                     1, M
                     2, …, Mm
                     } and a set of n > m jobs J = {J
                     1, J
                     2, …, Jn
                     }. Associated with each job Jj
                      is a processing time pj
                      > 0 and a rejection penalty wj
                      > 0. Job Jj
                      is either rejected and then a rejection penalty wj
                      is paid, or accepted and then processed by one of the m machines. Job preemption is not allowed during job processing, and each machine is available for processing jobs at time zero. Each machine can process at most one job at a time. Denote A⊆J as the set of jobs to be accepted, and R = J∖A as the set of jobs to be rejected. Denote Cj
                      as the completion time of job Jj
                      on a machine if Jj
                      ∈ A. The objective is to determine A and a feasible schedule for the jobs in A on the m machines, so as to minimize objective function

                      i.e., the makespan of all accepted jobs plus the total rejection penalty of all rejected jobs. We denote P|rej|C
                     max + ∑wj
                      as the scheduling problem.

Note that the classical parallel machine scheduling problem P||C
                     max is a special case of problem P|rej|C
                     max + ∑wj
                      when wj
                      = +∞ for j = 1, 2, …, n. Problem P||C
                     max is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense (Garey and Johnson, 1979). Therefore, P|rej|C
                     max + ∑wj
                      is also NP-hard in the strong sense. It is also well-known that problem P||C
                     max can be solved by some simple heuristics with constant worst-case bounds. For examples, the list schedule has a worst-case bound of

                      (see Pinedo, 2012 for more details and more heuristics). However, when job rejection is allowed, it becomes much more complicated to design efficient heuristics with low running time complexity and good worst-case bounds. In this paper we focus on developing an efficient heuristic to solve problem P|rej|C
                     max + ∑wj
                      with near-linear time complexity.

We will present a heuristic 
                        H
                      to solve problem P|rej|C
                     max + ∑wj
                      in this section. Heuristic 
                        H
                      is shown to have a worst-case bound of 1.5 + ε and running time complexity of O(nlog n + n/ε).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we study the classical parallel machine scheduling model with rejection, where the objective function is to minimize the makespan of all accepted jobs plus the total penalty of all rejected jobs. We show some new optimal properties and have different insights on how to solve the problem efficiently. We develop an O(nlog n + n/ε) heuristic to solve the problem with a worst-case bound of 1.5 + ε (here ε > 0 can be any small given constant), which improves upon the worst-case bound

For future research, it is unknown whether the worst-case bound of our heuristic is tight. It is an interesting and challenging research topic of developing an efficient heuristic with a better worst-case bound, say 
                        
                           
                              4

                           +
                           ϵ
                        
                     . To achieve a worst-case bound of

                           ,
                        
                      the job acceptance rules and the scheduling of all accepted jobs become much more complicated, and the corresponding running time complexity may be much higher than the one of our heuristic. Another interesting research topic is to study the extension of the current scheduling model with different job release dates. It is also interesting to consider the extension of the current model with machine eligibility constraints, i.e., each machine is only allowed to process a specific subset of jobs.
