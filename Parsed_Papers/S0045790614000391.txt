                  In cognitive radio networks, it is well known that the cooperative spectrum sensing can overcome damaging effects of fading and shadowing. However, it also increases the amount of energy consumption which is a critical factor in low powered wireless communications. In this paper based on bi-threshold energy detection, we maximize the network throughput such that the energy consumption is below a predefined value and also sufficient protection of primary users against interference is guaranteed. Convex optimization analysis is presented to jointly obtain the optimal values of sensing time and detection thresholds. Simulation results show that the proposed method is very flexible such that a good tradeoff between achievable throughput and energy efficiency can be established, while it often outperforms the conventional sensing method significantly.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In existing static spectrum allocation policy, a specific frequency band is assigned to each licensed user. Spectrum scarcity on the one hand and growing demands for spectrum on the other hand, make this policy inefficient and point out the necessity of using some dynamic spectrum managements [1]. Cognitive radio (CR) is reputed to be an encouraging technology, resolving the spectrum scarcity problem by allowing the secondary users access idle frequency bands, opportunistically and without deleterious interference to primary users (PU) [2].

One of the most important functionalities of each CR network is spectrum sensing, with the aim of recognizing idle frequency bands in order to enhance the spectrum efficiency [3]. Among various spectrum sensing methods, the most common is energy detection, because it has low implementational complexity and require no information about PU [4]. The energy detection process is carried out by comparing a threshold with the test statistics, which is an estimation of received PU signal energy. The performance of local spectrum sensing by individual CR nodes, is degraded in presence of fading and shadowing. Cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed to overcome the problems associated with fading and shadowing effects [5,6].

Cooperative spectrum sensing usually is accomplished in two consecutive phases, sensing and reporting. In sensing phase, each CR node measures the received signal energy and makes one bit local decision regarding the activity of PU. In reporting phase, all the local decisions are sent to a common receiver referred to as the fusion center (FC), which extracts the global decision based on some fusion rules. Such a cooperation method is known as decision fusion. Another cooperation method is data fusion, in which the measured energy by each CR node is sent to the FC, normally without much processing.

The network life time is a crucial parameter of energy limited wireless technologies, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) [7] and mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) [8], that are often battery powered. Recently, equipping such networks with cognitive capabilities are proposed which are known as CR-WSN and CR-MANET, in order to utilize the benefits of CR technology [9,10]. Cooperative spectrum sensing in CR networks leads to more detection accuracy, but at the same time causes the CR network to consume more energy due to more data and control signal exchanges. Therefore, it is necessary to develop energy efficient methods to prolong the network life time.

In cooperative spectrum sensing method, the PU detection is performed at each CR node usually by using one threshold value [11]. We refer to such method as conventional sensing, throughout this paper. In contrast, bi-threshold detection [12] is proposed to reduce the energy consumption of cooperative spectrum sensing in CR networks. In bi-threshold cooperation, by using two threshold at each CR node, only reliable local decisions are reported to the FC and thus the energy consumption can be reduced significantly. The sensing result is unreliable, when the estimated amount of received energy at a CR node falls between high and low threshold values. Since such results are not allowed to be sent to the FC, the energy consumption of reporting phase will decrease. As a result the total energy consumption will decrease, as well.

It is obvious that more energy can be saved as the probability of unreliable sensing increases. However, this leads to more performance loss rather than conventional sensing method which uses one threshold. It is shown in [13] that increasing the probability of unreliable sensing, worsens the complementary receiver operating characteristic (CROC). In other words, for a given value of missed detection probability, the false alarm probability increases which degrades the throughput. Thus, the tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption needs to be investigated in cooperative bi-threshold spectrum sensing method.

In this paper we adapt and optimize the bi-threshold cooperative sensing in a CR network. It is interested to know how much throughput and energy saving can be achieved, simultaneously. We investigate the problem of throughput maximization, subject to the following constraints:
                        
                           1.
                           PUs are immune enough against CR network interference.

Energy consumption of cooperative spectrum sensing is limited to a desired value.

We use the decision fusion as the cooperation mechanism, due to the lower communication load and energy consumption [6]. An optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize detection parameters including sensing time, high and low thresholds such that a good tradeoff between throughput and energy efficiency can be made. Under practicable conditions we show that the problem is convex.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the related works are summarized. In Section 3 the system model is introduced and the problem is formulated. Section 4 deals with convex optimization of the problem. Section 5 presents the simulation results, followed by conclusion in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

During recent years, the literature take the energy efficiency in CR networks into more consideration. In [14] the energy efficiency is increased by optimizing detection threshold and sleeping rate. The authors of [15] found the optimal number of CR nodes for maximizing energy efficiency. An energy minimization approach based on power amplifier efficiency is investigated in [16]. In [17] all sensors of a CR-WSN are divided into optimized number of groups, so that only one group is activated at each period of time and the others forced to be inactive in order to save energy.

Throughput enhancement in CR networks, is of greater importance than conventional wireless networks. Because, a CR network accesses a frequency channel opportunistically and must vacate the channel as soon as a PU is detected. In the literature, a lot of works concerning throughput analysis in CR networks can be found. Most of them investigate a tradeoff between throughput and sensing performance. Basically, lower false alarm probability leads to more network throughput and jointly higher missed detection probability, which causes more interference to PUs. In [18] by proposing some coding techniques in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based CR network, the interference reduction is demonstrated at the cost of acceptable throughput degradation. The authors of [11] and [19] aim to maximize throughput by optimization of sensing time and decision fusion rule respectively, while the interference to PUs are restricted to an allowable value. The effect of cooperation overhead on throughput is explored in [20]. The optimal detection thresholds are obtained in [21] for a multiband spectrum sensing, to maximize throughput. In [22] the sum of CR and primary network throughputs, is proposed to be maximized.

A large number of existing works focus only on either maximizing throughput or minimizing energy consumption, while coping with sensing performance constraints. Recently, a few papers perform joint investigation of throughput and energy efficiency in CR networks. In [23] the authors aim to maximize average throughput divided by average energy consumption, based on ‘K out of N’ fusion rule. They separately optimize ‘K’ and detection threshold, by fixing all other parameters and show the effects of ‘N’ and sensing time through simulation. A power allocation and channel assignment mechanism is designed in [24] to minimize the difference between energy consumption and throughput of a distributed CR network (without the FC). The mentioned works use the conventional (one threshold) energy detector for local sensing at each CR node, whereas our model is based on bi-threshold detection, for which throughput and energy consumption formulations are quite different from conventional detection. Moreover, we restrict the energy consumption up to a desired value, which can better reflect the energy resources limitation in actual low power sensor networks and also look at the problem from convex analysis point of view. The authors of [25] consider the problem of energy consumption minimization, provided that throughput, delay and sensing constraints are met. As the main idea, they propose a switch/wait handoff procedure to reach a compromise between energy consumption and throughput for a multichannel non-cooperative (single user) CR system, based on conventional one-threshold energy detection. Our work is different from [25] since we explore the performance of bi-threshold sensing, mainly to know whether this method can improve both throughput and energy efficiency rather than conventional method or not. Unlike [25] we consider a cooperative CR network, which is more applicable in practical conditions due to fading and shadowing effects, rather than single user CR system. Furthermore, in our work the energy consumption of reporting phase is taken into account as a part of total cooperative spectrum sensing energy consumption.

In such case, the CR node does not send its sensing result to the FC and waits for another sensing phase. Otherwise, when the test statistic is smaller than

Based on a fusion rule, the FC combines these reliable decisions and makes the global decision. To further decrease the interference, we use the common ‘OR’ rule in which the FC decides on H
                     1 whenever at least one local decision denotes H

                      is the energy needed for reporting one bit local decision to the FC at the ith CR node. Cognitive radio accesses the frequency band, opportunistically and must vacate it as soon as a PU is detected. Thus, high data transferring rate for a given frequency band is an important task.. The average throughput of the CR network is:

                     0 and r
                     1 denote throughputs in absence and presence of the PU, respectively. Using cognitive radio in environments with a large percentage of spectrum, occupied by the PUs is not so helpful. So, it is assumed that most of the time idle spectrum is available for the CR network i.e. P(H

                     P(H
                     0). In addition, due to the PU interference and channel capacity deficit, throughput of a CR network in presence of the PU is much less than when it is absent i.e. r

In this section simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In conventional method there is no control on spectrum sensing energy consumption, but in the proposed method we can set up a tradeoff between maximum throughput and energy efficiency. We want to make an in depth comparison between the proposed method and conventional sensing. To this end the energy consumption is forced to be less than E
                     0 to a certain percentage, where E

                      is the conventional sensing energy consumption and τo
                      is the optimal sensing time for it to gain its maximum throughput. In (25) let put β as β
                     =

                     =100(1−
                     v), it can be regarded as the energy efficiency parameter, which is the minimum percent of energy that can be saved rather than the conventional sensing. Another useful parameter is the energy ratio defined as ρ
                     =
                     Er
                     /Es
                     . It is the ratio between the needed energy for transmitting decisions to the FC and the needed energy for sensing only one sample of primary signal and thus regularly is a large number.

Consider a cognitive radio network with 8 CR nodes and a frame duration equal to 10ms. The general detection probability of the FC assumed to be at least 0.999, the sampling frequency of received signal is set to 3MHz and the energy ratio is 2000. For different SNRs and energy efficiency parameters, Figs. 1
                      and 2
                      show the optimal values of sensing time and threshold, respectively. It is observed from Fig. 1 that the proposed method is more agile than the conventional one i.e. it gains access to maximum throughput at a smaller optimal sensing time for each SNR. This is reasonable, because according to (P2) throughput of the proposed method includes the square of false alarm probability, whereas in case of conventional method it is a function of false alarm probability. Therefore, the changes of throughput with sensing time in the proposed method, is faster than the conventional sensing method.

As Fig. 1 shows, by reducing SNR the optimal value of sensing time increases. This means that the CR network needs more received samples to optimally detect a very weak PU signal. Furthermore, at low SNRs the detection probability decreases and may not satisfy the detection constraint. In this case, the optimal threshold must be reduced such that the detection constraint can be satisfied, as indicated by Fig. 2. These figures demonstrate also the relation between optimal detection parameters and energy efficiency of the proposed method. By enhancing energy efficiency, the optimal sensing time and threshold decrease. Because, forcing the system to undertake greater amounts of energy efficiency, applies tighter restrictions on the optimization parameters in order to satisfy the energy constraint. This, limits the acceptable ranges of optimization parameters in the feasible set of the problem.

In Fig. 3
                      it is shown that how much throughput can be achieved for various energy efficiency requirements. We impose the CR network to save different percents of energy. It is seen that saving larger amount of energy leads to more throughput reduction, specially at lower SNRs. Nevertheless, even for very low SNRs like −18dB, the proposed method reaches a higher throughput than conventional sensing, while consumes 50% less energy. We are interested in determining how much the system is able to save energy. Maximum energy efficiency and corresponding throughput are shown in Fig. 4
                     . It is shown that for SNRs above −10dB, about 90% energy efficiency is accessible by guaranteeing approximately the same throughput as conventional sensing.

In Fig. 5
                      we evaluate the performance of proposed method from a different point of view i.e., in terms of throughput-energy consumption ratio (throughput divided by energy consumption). So, one can easily find how much energy is required to achieve a given throughput and vice versa, how much throughput is accessible for a predetermined value of energy consumption. It is observed that for any SNR the proposed method has better performance. For higher SNRs throughput of both conventional and proposed methods are comparable (as indicated by Fig. 4), but the energy consumption of proposed method is much lower. This leads to great advantage of the proposed method. By SNR reduction, throughput is also reduced and energy consumption increases, which results in performance degradation. But, according to Fig. 5, the performance is still better than conventional one.

In Fig. 6
                      the effect of energy ratio on the performance of proposed method is investigated. By increasing the energy ratio the performance improves for any energy efficiency. For larger energy ratios, it is seen that all energy efficiency values lead to the same throughput, much higher than conventional sensing throughput. In reality, a larger energy ratio for a given throughput means that the reporting energy Er
                      is more determinant than the sensing energy Es
                      is. In this case, large percents of energy efficiency can be obtained in the proposed method, since unreliable local sensing results are not reported to the FC.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We considered the problem of throughput maximization in a CR network under energy consumption and interference constraints, based on the bi-threshold cooperative spectrum sensing method. The practicable conditions on false alarm and detection probabilities were explored such that the optimization problem can be converted to a standard separately or jointly convex optimization problem in sensing time and detection threshold.

Simulations demonstrated that a good tradeoff can be obtained between throughput and energy efficiency using the proposed method. Generally, increasing the energy efficiency reduces the achievable throughput. Meanwhile, in a wide range of SNRs while large percents of energy efficiency are accessible, achievable throughput is also higher than or comparable to the conventional sensing method. For example for SNRs above −10dB, it was shown that the proposed method has the ability to save about 90% of energy with the same throughput as conventional sensing. For lower SNRs such as −18dB, we found that the proposed method with 50% energy efficiency, still reaches higher throughput rather than the conventional method. In terms of throughput-energy ratio, the better performance of the proposed method was demonstrated for all SNR values.

We explored a CR network in which by optimizing detection and energy parameters, both throughput and energy consumption can be adjusted such that the network requirements be fulfilled. This flexibility encourages us to use the proposed method instead of the conventional sensing one.
