                  We consider a p-norm linear discrimination model that generalizes the model of Bennett and Mangasarian (1992) and reduces to a linear programming problem with p-order cone constraints. The proposed approach for handling linear programming problems with p-order cone constraints is based on reformulation of p-order cone optimization problems as second order cone programming (SOCP) problems when p is rational. Since such reformulations typically lead to SOCP problems with large numbers of second order cones, an “economical” representation that minimizes the number of second order cones is proposed. A case study illustrating the developed model on several popular data sets is conducted.

Clearly, existence of such a separating hyperplane is not guaranteed (namely, a separating hyperplane exists if the convex hulls of sets 
                        
                           A
                        
                      and 
                        
                           B
                        
                      are disjoint); thus, in general, a separating hyperplane that minimizes some sort of misclassification error is desired.

In the next section we introduce a new linear separation model that is based on p-order cone programming, and discuss its key properties. The proposed solution approach, based on a reformulation of p-cone programming problems as second order cone programming (SOCP) problems when p is rational, is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains a case study on several popular data sets that illustrates the developed discrimination model.

Since definition (1) involves strict inequalities, it is not well suited for mathematical programming models of selecting the “best” linear separator. However, the fact that the separating hyperplane can be scaled by any non-negative factor allows one to formulate the following observation:

                     , respectively. Further, instead of minimizing the expected misclassification error, one may select the parameters 
                        
                           w
                        
                      and γ so as to minimize the risk of misclassification. As it is well known in stochastic optimization and risk analysis, the “risk” associated with random outcome of a decision under uncertainty is often attributed to the “heavy” tails of the corresponding probability distribution. The risk-inducing “heavy” tails of probability distributions, are, in turn, characterized by the distribution’s higher moments. Thus, if the misclassifications introduced by a separating hyperplane can be viewed as “random”, the misclassification risk may be controlled better if one minimizes not the average, or expected misclassification errors, but their moments of order

Noting the zero duality gap for the constructed pair of feasible solutions of (6) and (8), and recalling that the primal problem is bounded and strictly feasible, we immediately obtain that this pair of primal–dual solutions is optimal (Nesterov & Nemirovski, 1994). Hence, from (7a) it follows that an optimal solution of (6) exists with

Intuitively, a norm of higher order places more “weight” on the outliers. For example, use of 
                        
                           p
                           =

                      norm entails minimization of the average of misclassifications; in contrast, application of the 
                        
                           p
                           =

                      norm implies minimization of the largest misclassification for a set. Thus, by selecting appropriately the orders

We conclude this section by pointing out a connection between the p-norm separation model and the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. SVM models are widely used in classification problems (see some recent works in, e.g., Carrizosa & Morales, 2013; Khemchandani, Jayadeva, & Chandra, 2009; Trafalis & Gilbert, 2006). The linear SVM for non-separable sets can be written as a quadratic programming problem of the form

In the next section we discuss the details of practical implementation of the p-norm linear discrimination model (6).

The p-order cone constraints (6b), (6c) are central to practical implementation of the p-norm separation method (6). In the special cases of 
                        
                           p
                           =

                      or 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           ∞
                           ,

                     -order cone constraints reduce to linear inequalities; specifically, the

                      version of model (6) has been studied in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992). In general, the amenability of 1-norm to implementation via linear constraints has been exploited in a variety approaches and applications, too numerous to cite here. Another prominent special case is that of 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        
                     , when (6b), (6c) represent second order, or quadratic cones. The second order cone programming (SOCP) constitutes a well-developed subject of convex optimization, and a number of efficient self-dual “long-step” interior point (IP) SOCP algorithms have been developed in the literature and implemented in software (Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Andersen, Roos, & Terlaky, 2003; Sturm, 1998). The “general” case of 
                        
                           p
                           ∈
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           )
                           ∪
                           (
                           2
                           ,
                           ∞
                           )
                        
                     , when the p-cone is not self-dual, has received relatively limited attention in the literature. IP approaches to p-order cone programming have been considered in, e.g., Xue and Ye (2000), Nesterov (2012), and Glineur and Terlaky (2004); a polyhedral approximation approach was proposed in Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010).

In this work, we pursue an approach to solving p-cone programming problems that is based on the possibility to represent a p-order cone via a sequence of second order cones when p is rational (Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Nesterov & Nemirovski, 1994). Reformulation of a rational-order p-cone programming problem as a SOCP problem allows for employing the efficient self-dual SOCP methods, albeit at a cost of a large number of second order cones required for such a reformulation. Moreover, since such a reformulation is not unique, in Section 3.2 we introduce a constructive “economical” representation of rational-order p-cones via second order cones.

Without loss of generality, consider a p-cone in the positive orthant of

Each inequality in (15) can then be viewed as a subgraph with two arcs that connect the “parent” node (the variable at the left-hand side of the inequality) to the two “child” nodes (the variables at the right-hand side of the same inequality). Given this binary structure, the set of second order cones in (15) can be regarded as partitioned into

Observe that the number of second order cones in representations (17) and (18) correspond to the upper and lower bounds in (16), respectively.

Since a reduction in the number of second order cone inequalities in (15) leads to a reduction in the number of quadratic cones representing a rational-order p-cone (13) by the order of dimensionality n of the p-cone, it is of interest to devise an “economical” second order cone representation of rational-order cones.

Below we demonstrate that the lower bound on

In this section we report computational results on using the p-norm discrimination model (5) and (6) for linear separation of sets. In particular, we employ the presented above “economical” SOCP reformulation approach to solving pOCP problem (6) in the case when p is rational, and compare it with the polyhedral approximation technique of Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010).

In our computational experiments we used three data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The first data set is Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set with a total of 683 instances and 9 attributes. It contains 444 instances with benign diagnosis and 239 instances with malignant diagnosis. The second data set, Cleveland Heart Disease data set, contains 281 instances with 13 attributes, of them 125 instances correspond to positive diagnosis and 156 instances correspond to negative diagnosis. Finally, the Pima Indians Diabetes data set reports 768 instances with 8 attributes, including 266 instances of positive diagnosis and 502 instances of negative diagnosis. Both the Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Cleveland Heart Disease data sets (in their then-up-to-date versions) were used in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992).

For each data set, training and testing was performed by randomly selecting 100 training sets with equal number of points of both types, and testing the obtained separator on the data not included in the training set. For computational purposes, the data in training data sets was normalized and scaled by a factor of 104; the same transformation was then applied to testing data. After the training and testing procedures were performed, the average misclassification error on testing set was computed. It is important to comment on selection of parameter p in (6): as a general rule that follows from our numerical experiments and is consistent with the motivation presented in Section 2, smaller values of p (around 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        
                     ) are beneficial for well-separable data sets with smaller misclassification errors, whereas larger values of 
                        
                           p
                           ⩾
                           3
                        
                      allow for reducing large misclassification errors in linear separation. With this in mind, a particular value of p can be selected during the training procedure.


                     Table 1
                      reports the average out-of-sample misclassification error for each data set, together with the respective “best” value of p at which this error was obtained. It also includes results for the cases of 
                        
                           p
                           =

                     , which corresponds to minimization of the average of misclassifications due to Bennett and Mangasarian (1992), 
                        
                           p
                           =

                     , corresponding to minimization of the largest misclassification errors, and SVM model (11). Figs. 1–3
                     
                     
                      illustrate the behavior of the misclassification error in the described data sets with respect to the value of parameter p in (5) and (6), which was varied in the range of 1.0–4.0 with a 0.1 step. As it follows from Table 1 and Figs. 1–3, the p-norm separation model (5) and (6) with 
                        
                           p
                           >
                           1
                        
                      allows for an improved classification accuracy as compared to the cases of 
                        
                           p
                           =

                      proposed in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992), the SVM model (11), and the worst-error approach of 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           ∞
                        
                     .

In addition to classification capabilities of the p-norm linear separation model (5) and (6), its computational properties were investigated. In particular, for all the data sets described above we compared the running times of the cutting plane procedure for polyhedral approximations of problem (6) due to Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010), denoted as LP/CP, and the “economical” SOCP reformulation of (6), along with the corresponding results for SVM model (11) and 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           ∞
                        
                      case. All models were coded in C++ and CPLEX 12.2 solver was used to solve the resulting LP, SOCP, and QP problems. A dual-core 3GHz CPU computer with 2GB of RAM was used to run the computations. Fig. 4
                      illustrates corresponding running times on the example of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set, along with the values of the parameter

                           ⌈

                     , where 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           r
                           /
                           s
                        
                     , which is proportional to the number of second order cones in the SOCP reformulation of rational-order p-cone programming problem (6). From Fig. 4 it follows that the solution times for SOCP reformulation of a rational-order p-cone programming model (6) are highly correlated to the number of second order cones in the reformulated problem. On the other hand, solution times of a polyhedral approximation of (6) solved with a cutting plane method (LP/CP) exhibit relatively little dependence on the value of the parameter p, and are competitive with the running times of the SVM model. Computational performance of the considered models on other data sets is very similar to that presented in Fig. 4.
