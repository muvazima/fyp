                  Firms that experience uncertainty in demand as well as challenging service levels face, among other things, the problem of managing employee shift numbers. Decisions regarding shift numbers often involve significant expansions or reductions in capacity, in response to changes in demand. In this paper, we quantify the impact of treating shifts in workforce expansion as investments, while considering required service level improvements. The decision to increase shifts, whether by employing temporary workers or hiring permanent employees, is one that involves significant risks. Traditional theories typically consider reversible investments, and thus do not capture the idiosyncrasies involved in shift management, in which costs are not fully reversible. In our study, by using real options theory, we quantify managers’ ability to consider this irreversibility, aiming to enable them to make shift decisions under conditions of uncertainty with the maximum level of flexibility. Our model aims to help managers make more accurate decisions with regard to shift expansion under service level targets, and to defer commitment until future uncertainties can be at least partially resolved. Overall, our investigation contributes to studies on the time required to introduce labour shift changes, while keeping the value of service level improvements in mind.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper, we define a model that is intended for application in make-to-order manufacturing environments and “no inventory” businesses in which short lead times are desired. Nevertheless, given its generality, the model can also be used by service firms to estimate shift work volumes in accordance with expected service levels. We exclude the use of inventory, long lead times, or outsourcing, in order to buffer the negative impact of variability in demand, and focus instead on the mechanism through which shifts can be used to increase capacity. We also concentrate on the decisions that firms typically make in adding labour shifts to improve the service level.

For the sake of generality, we employ the terminology: (1) ‘service level improvement value’, to quantify the impact on sales order fulfilment made by increasing the number of labour shifts, and (2) ‘service level improvement deferred value’, to quantify the impact of delays in labour shift changes on the improvement of service levels.

The role played by the number of labour shifts in uncertain environments continues to evolve, meaning that greater emphasis on the timing of shifts changes is necessary. Moreover, due to legal and cost constraints, organisations cannot always rapidly engage and dismiss employees in response to demand volatility (Sillekens et al., 2011). In addition, today’s manufacturing jobs tend to involve more skilled work, carried out with increasingly sophisticated equipment, and thus require production workers to receive extensive introductory training programs, which count as irreversible costs. One way to deal with this trend is to anticipate when labour shifts will need to be changed, for which a ‘trigger moment’, or decision point is needed.

Today’s companies work at much higher levels of uncertainty than in the past, facing either a range of possible outcomes or unbounded possible outcomes. In highly uncertain environments, the traditional methods of workforce shift planning are of little use, and new approaches are required. With this in mind, the present study addresses new challenges involved in the use of real options in workforce planning, and identifies possible future directions for extending approaches to multi-planning periods.

In this study, we focus on two important questions: (1) How can a decision regarding shift increases or expansion delays be valued while considering service level requirements? (2) What is the decision point or trigger moment for applying a shift increase?

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Labour shift planning involves considering the availability, allocation, and transition of workforces. Our model uses the real options theory to value the advantages of using a workforce shift increase mechanism as a hedge against demand volatility. To frame our research, we explore existing theories on workforce planning, contingent approaches, and real options methodology.

Historically, Holt et al. (1960) pioneered the research into workforce planning and flexibility by analysing the differences between maintaining permanent surplus workforce levels and engaging in frequent capacity adjustments. Günther (1989) introduced the cost function in workforce planning models. Barnes-Schuster et al. (2002), Cachon (2003), and Pac et al. (2009) modelled workforce problem using option contracts. In 2003, Pinker and Larson argued that the sizes of regular and temporary labour workforces should be seen as variables in planning decisions. One year later, Dellaert and Kok (2004) emphasised the importance of the links between workforces and companies, while Azmat and Widmer (2004) proposed an algorithm for determining a company’s minimum required workforce. Mundschenk and Drexl (2007) investigated workforce planning optimisation under deterministic conditions. Zhu and Sherali (2009) addressed the problem of workforce planning by using recruitment capacity constraints and demand uncertainty. Sillekens et al. (2011) presented an aggregation of planning factors, such as technical features, and workforce limitations to support an evaluation of production flexibility. Lusa and Pastor (2011) proposed an optimisation model for dealing with uncertainties in required capacity. Overall, the majority of workforce planning models aim to facilitate decisions on future workforce supply (Chien et al., 2008).

A review of existing literature allows us to identify two types of planning models (Purkiss, 1981): descriptive or exploratory models and normative models. Descriptive models (e.g. Ugwuowo and McClean, 2000) are analytical tools that simulate the response of a workforce system under certain conditions, as can be seen in Markov models (e.g. McClean, 1991), renewal models, and semi-Markov models (e.g. Yadavalli and Natarajan, 2002)). Normative models are optimisation tools that support ideal workforce system under given criteria. The main techniques used in these optimisation models are linear programming, integer programming, goal programming (used when there are multiple targets, such as workforce size, personnel flow and costs (e.g. Corominas et al., 2005)), stochastic programming, and dynamic programming (e.g. Caia et al., 2010).

Discussions of real options are presented below. Our central focus is addressing the problem of capacity expansion and decision irreversibility. In doing so, we start by describing the main assumptions that support the application of a real options approach to general capacity expansion problems. We then discuss the applicability of real options to workforce capacity problems. Finally, we debate the advantages of a contingent approach to workforce planning.

Real options have been used in stochastic market environments to evaluate manufacturing capacity problems on both the strategic and operational levels. Numerous studies have been conducted on capacity expansion problems (Higle and Corrado, 1992; Lieberman, 1989; Li and Tirupati, 1994). Pindyck (1988) has explored capacity expansions as options based on the irreversibility of investment and the uncertainty of outputs, while Majd and Pindyck (1989) quantified the value of flexible options with regard to production firms’ capacity. In the 1990s, Abel et al. (1996) discussed options for capacity expansion by using incremental investments. In 2000, Birge applied real options, stressing the benefits of adjustable human resources. Dangl (1999) and Billington and Johnson (2003) conducted studies on optimal timing and capacity adjustments under conditions of uncertainty. Wu et al. (2005) supported the use of real options for planning capacity at a strategic level. Capacity choices are typically closely related to investment decisions, and the real options theory is similar to the resource-based perspective, in that it claims that present resources and capabilities are the results of past investments. However, the real options framework offers economic logic for incremental investments, and specifically addresses the issue of finding a mechanism for resource dimensioning (McGrath et al., 2004), which the resource-based view does not.

It is important to address the issue of why real options are particularly relevant to workforce planning. The determination of time when expansions occur originally became a topic of interest for planning purposes, mainly in uncertain markets in which it is difficult to anticipate workforce needs. The idea behind real options is that it is able to limit the exposure to losses, and capitalise on opportunities for higher profits. Consequently, enterprises can be more flexible in adapting to changes that result from internal or external requirements and conditions, such as service level and market uncertainty. Dixit and Pindyck (1994) explain that the use of real options allows for the valuation of flexible workforce investment decisions in uncertain environments. D. Nembhard et al. (2005) have proposed a real options model for valuing workforce flexibility while considering work heterogeneities. Jacobs (2007) discussed the application of options in the solution of problems involving uncertain human resource demands. Qin and Nembhard (2010) studied the intensity of labour per unit of production. In doing so, they stressed the importance of using real options in highly uncertain environments, considering workforce planning as a series of investments in capacity. Chou (2011) has applied options to intellectual assets such as human resources.

The general consensus found in existing literature is that the application of real options requires two main conditions: first, that the underlying feature under analysis be modelled through a stochastic process, and second, that the value of managerial flexibility be dependent on the underlying stochastic process. If workforce capacity is adjustable, then workforce dimensioning is also an option. Under this reasoning, companies with more flexible resources, including workforce levels, are more capable of maximising potential results under uncertain market conditions or different service level requirements. Two main differences between traditional techniques and real options can be established. First, traditional techniques must be optimised so that decisions can be oriented toward long-term profit. Second, traditional planning tools do not take a long-term perspective on workforce planning, while real options do. The use of real options involves the broader context of sequential decision making, which means that the link between different planning periods can be supported through the use of sequential options.

Another important question is how workforce expansion can be valued. Investments in workforce capital include the costs of selecting, hiring, and training, as well as compromised dismissing costs. Since demand can change substantially in a stochastic environment and companies can establish different targets for their service levels, efficiency yields, and output rates, it is necessary that manufacturing capacity, including workforce planning, be dynamic (Dorroh et al., 1994). A concern with the combined effect of irreversibility and uncertainty led Weisbrod (1964) to introduce the concept of option value. He argued that if a decision has irreversible consequences, then the flexibility of choosing the timing of that decision should be included in a cost–benefit analysis. The expansion of the workforce may also be considered with regard to timing the acquisition of worker numbers and skills to address uncertainties in future demand. The irreversibility of decisions related to workforce expansion costs are supported when there are high fluctuations in firm results due to demand volatility, because expenses associated with regular employees are relatively fixed, while there are sunk costs associated with changes in the quantitative or qualitative composition of the workforce.


                     Bengtsson (2001) has discussed the value of the option of hiring personnel on short contracts when demand is uncertain, and has examined the irreversibility of the costs involved. Other studies have also explored the significance of contingent or temporary workers. Foote and Folta (2002) find that there may be an optimal productivity point in the balance between temporary and regular employees, Pinker and Larson (2003) analyse how temporary workers create options for a firm, and Cardon (2003) recommends a mix between temporary and regular employees as a means of maximising profits or flexibility while minimising the risks of diminished trust and reduced productivity on the part of regular employees. Mayer and Nickerson (2005) have reiterated Cardon’s recommendations.

Based on A. Sethi and S. Sethi’s (1990) discussion of the different types of flexibility, we value a particular type of flexibility related to volume and expansion. While previous studies have recognised the flexibility value associated with temporary workers, they have not explored how a workforce made up of a mix of regular and temporary workers shifts expansion decisions. However, past studies, such as that of Zhu and Sherali (2009), have emphasised the importance of considering service- or production-level targets in integrated workforce planning, while Callahan and Stuebs (2010) have defined labour flexibility as the capacity to modify the workforce’s size, composition, and link with a company.

The model presented in this study is based on the fact that companies want to fulfil promised service levels by satisfying sales orders in the desired quantity and within the desired timeframe. Service levels are subject to downstream work center outputs, which depend on the available number of shifts. We aim to calculate the right moment for the creation of a new shift, using a critical demand level to support this decision. This involves irreversible costs, including the labour costs incurred during the minimum time contract, the costs of initial employee training, and the potential costs of future dismissals. We ignore possible social costs, since their value cannot be assessed (Worrell et al., 1991), but feel that this does not bias our conclusions.

Due to the training period and specific capabilities required, we employ a dual strategy for adjusting the actual situation to the targeted service level (which is better than the actual level). This involves shift expansion using regular, full-time workers within a set period of time, and shift expansion using a mix of regular and temporary workers. For this study, we ignore the temporary use of cross-trained regular workers from other work stations, because we assume that upstream work stations are balanced and there is no internal workforce availability. Using demand uncertainty and the available fixed output of each shift, we determine the optimal moment to change a shift, assuming the existence of irreversible costs within a certain planning period [0,
                     T]. We assume that hiring or subcontracting additional workers does not have any use beyond the specific situation that we are considering. Investing in a new shift to improve service levels, under stochastic demand, should be analysed by considering that the results of an investment, deducted from the value of the option to defer, should be equal or above the actual profit.

The model is applied to a single work center with a fixed number of workers per shift (as in Mundschenk and Drexl, 2007), so that capacity expansion size refers to additional shifts. We differentiate workers who work directly on the flow shop production line from those performing common tasks (the importance of this assumption is related to the skills required to execute tasks (Ahn et al., 2005; Thompson and Goodale, 2006)). The firm studied follows a make-to-order policy, is oriented by a pull strategy, and is subject to stochastic demand.

Demand “Dt
                     ” is the main uncertainty source affecting number of shifts. We will consider two different models to represent demand (possible models are referred in Appendix A, Table A.1
                     ). First, we will assume that the demand follows a geometric Brownian motion
                        1
                        GBM implies that the change in transaction volume over time conforms to a lognormal distribution (Benaroch et al., 2012; Brandão et al., 2012).

                      is the variation term (deviation from the tendency or term of uncertainty). Intuition underlying Eq. (1) is that the proportional change in demand quantity during a small interval of time is composed of a non-random drift term and a random shock driven by the Wiener process.

Second, considering that demand can suddenly change, we assume that demand follows a mean reversion process (MRP) with jumps (an assumption also made by Khajuria (2008) in a study of the timber market, which is the same market involved in this case study). Demand is described by using the MRP equation (Huang, 2009), complemented with jumps estimation:

                      is the equilibrium level to which the process reverts in the long run, and Φ is the jump size, with distribution dq (Poisson) used for jumps occurrence. Jump size is modelled as a random variable.

It is expected that at a certain moment, demand level will support the decision to expand shifts, based on the expected outcome. To model our problem, we assume that there are different profit functions, one before, which we denote as π
                     0(Dt
                     ), and another after this decision, for each different strategy, which we denote as, π
                     1(Dt
                     ) and π
                     2(Dt
                     ) .

We assume that the shift change will occur within a single period, and that there will be instant production availability. For this purpose, we define a planning period as the period in which a decision is made with regard to labour shift expansion. We ignore the time involved in the adaptation period, which is mainly related to training, but consider the training costs within the required investment value. We use the service level performance to leverage the decision process with regard to shift increases. The unit profit functions before and after investment will be defined analytically, according to the following equations:

                     Eqs. (3) and (4) represent, respectively, the unit profit function before and after a shift increase for “Strategy 1” (pure regime: regular ‘full-time’ workforce). In this strategy, the increase in shifts is carried out by using regular workers for all tasks.

                     Eq. (5) represents the profit function after a shift increase for “Strategy 2” (mixed regime: regular workforce plus temporary workers, on-call workers, or comp-time arrangements for common tasks). In this strategy there are tasks requiring a high level of qualification and there are tasks that can be handled by workers with low levels of qualification. Since the jobs requiring higher qualifications have higher costs for the company, costs and numbers of qualified workers are relevant parameters. In this strategy, shift increases are carried out by using regular line workers and temporary workers for common tasks. Nevertheless, based on the work of Sillekens et al. (2011), we reinforce the need for practical terms to limit the proportion of temporary workers, considering line specificity.

                     , above which an additional shift investment should be made, in order to fulfil a required service level target. More specifically, we want to maximise the two profit functions, considering a trigger moment for change that is based on demand quantity. In the analysis, we use the following objective function for each strategic approach. There will be a moment t
                     ∊[0,
                     T], at which the number of shifts should clearly be increased to maximise value for the company in question.

The first source of flexibility comes from the option to exercise. In this case, a company’s management can execute its option to buy an additional workforce shift. The second flexible source is the option to defer. In this case, the company’s managers can wait to see whether demand justifies expanding existing shifts.

We simulated the demand behaviour for each stochastic process by using the formulas available in Appendix B. The most commonly used simulation model is the Monte Carlo method,
                        3
                        The study of Huang (2009) claims that Monte Carlo simulation can accurately project the random variation involved in a demand stochastic process.

                      which we apply to solve the optimisation problem. By using the Monte Carlo method, we simulated repeated pay-offs, in order to calculate the expected value of the options. The general formula for calculating the expected value of the service level improvement is presented as:

We tested our model by applying it to an industrial flooring company. We focused on a single activity, which was painting. The work center of the company in question involves one machine operated in one shift, with 10 people per shift: four line workers and six common task workers. The core business of the company experiences stochastic demand. The painting process requires a workforce with specific design capabilities, which means that temporary workers can only carry out ordinary or common tasks, like filing, packing, or running errands. The minimum investment period of a labour agreement is 1year, which helps the company anticipate salary costs, as well as other costs pertaining to employee contract termination. There are also fixed costs involved in initial training. In this study, we assume that the annual salaries and initial training costs represent the company’s investment cost. Some additional fixed costs are also incurred in supporting activities arising from a new shift, including auxiliary services involving compressed air and dust extraction. The company’s target is the fulfilment of a certain service level, and this takes into account actual capacity, the use of overtime, and the employment of temporary workers for common tasks. Internal workers were not considered for this study. The company needs to reinforce its painting activity with a new shift, but this change must be supported by a decision point that is based on the expected fulfilment of an improved service level. Agreements with customers, mainly in the mass-chain segment, involve a penalty cost in the case of a lack of delivery or delay in delivery. In this paper, we exclude the inventory alternative, since the company provides customised products and follows a made-to-order production policy, which is oriented by a pull strategy. The data used in the example is provided in Appendix A, Table A.2
                     .

The demand in the example we are using is uncertain and subject to jumps. We collected data for more than 6years, so as to understand the pattern and employ the most appropriate forecasting process. A series of model calibrations
                        4
                        Model calibration is the process of estimating the model parameters (Oliva, 2003).
                     
                     
                        4
                      have been performed to identify sets of input parameters that perform well against historic data. We also applied several different forecast methods for the generality of the model (see Fig. 1
                     ).


                     Table 1
                      presents the results of the evaluation, with regard to the increase of an additional shift, for “Strategy 1” and “Strategy 2”, considering that demand follows a mean reversion process involving jumps.

According to the results for “Strategy 1”, the company should increase the number of shifts only when the demand reaches 174.554 square meter. This should not be carried out if at that moment the company’s discounted cash flows are negative, which is not currently the case. The value of exercising the option (increase the number of shifts) is 92.638 euros, while the alternative to withhold the decision is valued at 27.857 euros.

In Fig. 2
                     , we explore the relationship between service level targets and critical demand. When the gap between the actual situation and a new service level is wide, the company has an opportunity that should be quantified. We keep this situation in mind by taking into account that critical demand level decreases to justify an increase in the number of shifts. “Strategy 1” refers to the use of regular workers to carry out common tasks, while “Strategy 2” considers the use of temporary workers. The critical demand that supports the decision is lower in “Strategy 2”, allowing for the anticipation of the decision.


                     Fig. 3
                      displays the relationship between service level target and service level improvement value, complementing the results of Fig. 2. For high service level targets, the service level improvement value increases, which is consistent with the anticipation of the moment at which a decision is made to increase the number of shifts. “Strategy 2” is more flexible than “Strategy 1”, meaning that the use of temporary work for common tasks adds value in uncertain environments. There is an interesting relation between “go” or “wait” decisions, which we show as service level improvement value (go) and deferred value (wait). When the improvement value is higher than the deferred value, the firm should decide to invest in creating a new shift. There is also a neutral moment, when the improvement value equals the deferred value, after which the opportunity to invest becomes more attractive.

The relationship between critical demand and service level improvement value is illustrated in Fig. 4
                     . Firms that use temporary workers (“Strategy 2”) are more flexible during the decision process, and so can anticipate decisions. This is denoted by the lower level of critical demand for the trigger moment that supports a shift increase. With a more flexible workforce, the service level improvement value increases for both strategies, but the intensity is higher for the most flexible strategy: “Strategy 2”.

In Fig. 5
                     , we have introduced the relationship between workforce composition and service level improvement value, under different strategies. A higher weight of common workers increases value. The impact is more expressive in “Strategy 2”, in which common workers have a temporary contract with the firm. Using these results, we can also conclude that the use of simple equipment, requiring less qualified workers, allows for faster changes in shift numbers. The number of workers and the relation between qualifications is also relevant to equipment investments involving new technology. In Table 2
                     , we denote the influence of the number of required workers, for each shift, with regard to service level improvement value. These results can be used to support an investment in equipment that allows for the optimisation of the number of employees. It might pay to have a few specialists handling uncommon hard tasks when they occur. However, adjusting the qualifications of the workforce according to requirements and breaking them down to a disaggregated level within a work flow can reduce the overall cost of the workforce and improve its performance.

The results presented in Table 3
                      show that the gap between actual and targeted service level influences the value of a decision to increase shifts. For relevant service level gaps, the improvement value increases, but is limited by the agreed-upon service level, above which opportunity value decreases. We have tested these results in a theoretical situation in which the target equals the actual service level. In this situation, the company should not invest in an additional shift, based on the service level argument.

The purpose of this study is to identify the optimal moment for changing the number of labour shifts, in order to enhance performance by improving service level. In it, we used the service level improvement value concept as a flexibility measure to quantify changes. Our model provides a relevant perspective on the very complex and difficult problem of determining the right moment to increase workforce shifts, which is subject to the hiring of permanent employees, due to process requirements and legal conditions involved, under uncertain demand. We believe that firms can benefit from an improved understanding of the conditions under which they should increase capacity by creating additional shifts, after considering the right time to do so, with regard to hiring and training periods.

In this model, we have incorporated a number of parameters used for planning purposes in operational approaches such as overtime, but also for strategic concerns regarding workforce composition, in terms of the proportion of common and qualified workers. More specifically, our model, by using real options theory, is able to identify the trigger moment and quantify the value for shift decisions on a single work center, under conditions of uncertainty and management flexibility, while also considering service level requirements. Further research should look into multiple work centers, exploring the additional flexibility value from cross training workforce.

We have paid special attention to the generality of the model, by adapting the Monte Carlo optimisation mechanism for different demand forecast models and different parameters. This will allow for its future application in other industries with different demand patterns, as well as the inclusion of other constraints affecting timeframes between decisions and operative dates.
