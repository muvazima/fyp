                  This paper introduces the Weighted Uncapacitated Planned Maintenance Problem (WUPMP). Based on guaranteed maximum service intervals, the WUPMP pursues the finding of a maintenance schedule that minimizes the resulting total fixed and variable costs. One finding is that significant polyhedral attributes of its solution space are derived. Among them, quasi-integrality that allows for applying an integral simplex algorithm is proven. Moreover, we prove strong

Since at least one restriction applies to most real-world applications, the algorithm provides practical decision support. Furthermore, the complexity status of various polynomial special cases of the WUPMP is resolved.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Maintenance comprises all technical, administrative and managerial activities, which are carried out during the life cycle of a system in order to retain it in or restore it to a state in which it functions as originally intended (Comité Européen de Normalisation, 2001). Various studies show a positive effect of maintenance on the profit, the productivity, the quality, the overall equipment effectiveness, the service level as well as the efficient use of the system and of the personnel. These effects are mainly ascribed to significant improvements of the system reliability measured in a reduction of downtimes, failures, and maintenance costs (Ahmad & Kamaruddin, 2012). Maintenance strategies can be classified into two categories: corrective maintenance that is carried out after failure and preventive maintenance that performs activities prior to failure either according to prescribed criteria (condition based maintenance) or at predetermined intervals (planned maintenance). This study solely focuses on planned maintenance. By scheduling necessary maintenance activities in predetermined intervals, it pursues the minimization of the number of unexpected failures that may lead to costly production faults or stoppages. However, since maintenance activities block and consume resources, efficient schedules have to be determined. For this purpose, this paper introduces the Weighted Uncapacitated Planned Maintenance Problem (WUPMP) that pursues the finding of a maintenance schedule with minimal costs. A predefined finite planning horizon that comprises a predetermined number of periods is considered. In doing so, the WUPMP assumes the knowledge of a suitable set of different maintenance activities that have to be executed in individual intervals (denoted as coverages in what follows) that are measured in periods. If for each maintenance activity at least a single execution is scheduled during the coverage, the plan guarantees a maximal reliability and, therefore, is denoted as feasible. Note that the given coverages are assumed to be valid throughout the entire planning horizon. Therefore, technical obsolescence is handled by an iterative application of the model with modified parameter values. Depending on the considered application, maintenance activities may be defined for processes of lubrication, calibration, cleaning, repair, overhaul, replacement, or inspection of a specific facility.

The WUPMP measures the resulting resource consumption of each scheduled maintenance activity by variable and fixed cost rates that may differ from period to period due to varying resource availabilities. While variable costs result from the respective maintenance activities that are executed, fixed costs of a period occur if at least a single maintenance activity is scheduled. For instance, variable costs comprise the consumption of all personnel and material resources that are caused by the execution of a specific maintenance activity. In contrast to this, typical examples of fixed costs are all resource consumptions caused by administrative activities that are necessary if at least one maintenance activity is scheduled.

Potential applications of the WUPMP are, for instance, processes that have to guarantee a high degree of accuracy while downtimes or faults are extremely costly. Since the derivation of reliable data is one of the major problems in practice (Ahmad & Kamaruddin, 2012; Pintelon & Gelders, 1992), the applicability of stochastic approaches to such applications is strongly limited (Scarf, 1997). Reasons may be lacking knowledge or data, secrecy of some suppliers, or unexplored incompatibility problems between modules and the condition of the production system. In contrast to this, by referring to empirically estimated lower bounds on the coverages, expert knowledge, or given guarantees of suppliers, the requirements of the WUPMP can be fulfilled much more easily by a pragmatic derivation of deterministic service intervals. The aforementioned characteristics can be found, for instance, in the automotive industry. Due to the adoption of JiT policies and mass customization, production processes in the automotive supply chains have to fulfill high service level agreements for a large variety of product variants (Boysen, Emde, Hoeck, & Kauderer, 2015). A second area where the WUPMP is applicable can be found in the aircraft industry (Knotts, 1999). Production processes of aircrafts as well as flight schedules have to comply with various security restrictions that require inspection intervals to be fulfilled and critical components to be replaced. Moreover, while evaluating two exact solution approaches by a numerical study, Section 4 sketches a potential application of the WUPMP for oil platform maintenance.

Aspects and attributes of the WUPMP are discussed in the literature. For instance, time-based maintenance policies (e.g. age-based replacement and block replacement) are presented in Barlow, Proschan, and Hunter (1965, pp. 84–118). Wagner, Giglio, and Glaser (1964) consider a deterministic preventive maintenance problem that schedules maintenance activities within a planning horizon. Each maintenance activity consumes manpower and is allowed to be scheduled in a predetermined set of periods while its processing time is measured in periods. The authors propose different objective functions. In the repair cost method of Drinkwater and Hastings (1967), preventive maintenance is applied to a fleet of vehicles. It is assumed that each vehicle has cumulative maintenance costs that consist of repair and of replacement. Through the decision of repair or replacement the approach minimizes the average cost per vehicle. Anily, Glass, and Hassin (1998) consider a deterministic periodic maintenance problem where the maintenance plan comprises a repeating sequence of minimal length while at most one machine can be maintained per period. Operation costs are assumed to increase linearly in the number of periods between two maintenance activities while maintenance costs are negligible. Grigoriev, van de Klundert, and Spieksma (2006) augment this periodic maintenance problem by considering maintenance fixed costs while pursuing the minimization of the sum of operation and maintenance costs. The deterministic maintenance scheduling problem proposed by Lee (1996) simultaneously considers machine scheduling and maintenance such that on every machine either a maintenance activity is performed or a job is processed. It is assumed that one maintenance interval per machine is fixed and known in advance. A job can either be preempted upon maintenance or not (resumable and non-resumable job processing). An analysis of the complexity of different problem variants that provides numerous optimal solution approaches for various alternative objective functions is given. An extension of this scheduling problem is provided by Chen (2008). In this approach two subsequent maintenance activities have to be scheduled within a predetermined interval. More recently, Bock, Briskorn, and Horbach (2012) integrate maintenance activities into single machine scheduling.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the mathematical model of the WUPMP. The polyhedral results of the WUPMP are derived in the following Section 3. Based on these findings, Section 4 analyzes the complexity status of various problem variants. Moreover, the applicability of two optimal algorithms is evaluated in a numerical study.

                              N: number of considered maintenance activities (index i).


                              T: number of periods in the considered planning horizon (index t).

                               ≤ T ∀i, we prevent trivially solvable cases without maintenance or with at least one maintenance activity per period. All activities are numbered according to non-decreasing coverages, i.e.,

                                    =

                               and 
                                 
                                    t
                                    =

                              : fixed costs of scheduling at least one maintenance activity in period t.

A solution of the WUPMP is determined by the following variables:

                        
                           
                              yt
                              : binary variable indicating one or several maintenance activities in period t.


                              x
                              
                                 i, t
                               : binary variable indicating an execution of maintenance activity i in period t.

Based on these parameters and variables, we define the WUPMP as follows:

The WUPMP is closely related to two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP) and the Uncapacitated Network Design Problem (UNDP) that can be briefly described as follows: in the UFLP, the task is to find a feasible assignment of customers to facilities, which satisfy customer demands, at minimal total costs. Note that fixed costs per facility arise at most once and variable costs are paid for the assignment itself. The task in the UNDP is to find a feasible flow for a set of commodities at minimal total costs within a given weighted, directed graph. For each commodity, a unit demand has to be sent along a path from a source node to a sink node and flow costs are caused by every unit that is sent along an arc in the graph. Fixed costs per arc are caused at most once if the flow is non-zero. Polynomial reductions from VERTEX COVER for the UFLP and STEINER TREE IN GRAPHS for the UNDP prove strong

                              π
                              i
                           
                           =
                           T
                           
                           ∀

                     . The following Remark 2.2 sketches how to transform the WUPMP into a special case of the UNDP. The resulting problem has a polytope that is included in the UNDP polytope. Hence, the WUPMP is solvable by any algorithm that solves the UNDP (e.g. Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998).

                           . All other arcs have zero fixed costs and the variable transportation costs are equal to c
                           
                              i, t

In this section polyhedral attributes of the WUPMP that allow for conclusions concerning the resulting computational complexity are derived. In particular, we prove the results:

The WUPMP has the single-assignment property (see Lemma 3.8).

The polytope of the presented WUPMP formulation is quasi-integral (see Theorem 3.13).

In what follows, we briefly introduce some basic results of polyhedral theory that are needed later.


                     Valid inequalities and faces: An inequality π · x ≤ π
                     0 is a valid inequality of a polytope S if it is fulfilled by all elements x ∈ S. If the face

                      of S is non-empty, we say that the hyperplane 
                        
                           {
                           x

                      with the valid inequality π · x ≤ π
                     0 supports S. If it holds that

                           =

                           x

                      for some x ∈ S the element x is denoted as a vertex or an extreme point of S. An integral face F contains only integral vertices (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, pp. 88–93; 536–537).


                     Quasi-integrality: Let S be a polytope and let SI
                     ⊆S be the set of integer points in this polytope. A polytope S is denoted as quasi-integral if every edge of the convex hull of SI
                      is also an edge of S (Yemelichev, Kovalev, and Kravtsov, 1984, pp. 189–191). This property allows for the development of effective integral simplex algorithms (e.g. Zaghrouti, Soumis, & El Hallaoui, 2014).


                     
                        Lemma 3.1
                        
                           Assume SI belongs to the set of vertices of a polytope S. Then, if for every pair of two integer points x
                           1, x
                           2 
                           of S there exists an integral face containing x
                           1 
                           and x
                           2, then S is quasi-integral.
                        


                     Polyhedral-integrality: We briefly describe two criteria that prove that all extreme points of a polyhedron are integer. A matrix A is denoted as totally unimodular (TU) if and only if every square submatrix of A has a determinant of 
                        
                           −

Hence, the system of inequalities (13) and (14) is TDI. Since it holds that

In what follows, we show that the WUPMP has the so-called single-assignment property as also known from the UFLP and the UNDP (Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998; Krarup & Pruzan, 1983). Its main consequence is as follows: if y is binary, then x is implicitly binary as well.

                        Observation 3.9 is of particular importance since the polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} has fractional extreme points. Example 3.10 illustrates such an instance. Due to the later polyhedral findings of Lemmas 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5, we neither can reduce N, T nor change π without losing the fractional extreme points. Hence, the instance has minimal dimensions.

Quasi-integrality is a property, which is tighter than Remark 3.11. In what follows, we prove quasi-integrality of the polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} that is also known for the polytopes of the UFLP and the UNDP (Yemelichev et al., 1984, pp. 192–193); (Hellstrand, Larsson, & Migdalas, 1992). For this purpose, we transform the WUPMP into an extended UFLP. In this reformulation, the Restriction (1) is disaggregated such that there are altogether

Analogously to the original problem, the objective function (15) pursues the minimization of the total costs. In a feasible solution of the reformulated model each planning period of a maintenance activity has to be covered by exactly one real period due to Restriction (16). This is done at zero cost only if the time distance of the chosen real period is not above the coverage of the respective activity. The connection between the newly introduced z-variables and the x-variables is provided by Restrictions (16) and (17) covering Restriction (2). The LP relaxation is defined by Restriction (18). The variable domains (19) are integral. It is obvious that a feasible solution (x, y) of the reformulated problem with a finite objective function value corresponds to a feasible solution of the WUPMP and vice versa (see Example 3.12). Specifically, it holds that:

                           
                              •
                              To every integer (fractional) point in {(x, y, z)∣(16)–(18)} there exists one integer (one fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)}.

To every integer (fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} exists one integer (one fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(16)–(18)} and at least one integer (at least one fractional) point in {(x, y, z)∣(16)–(18)}.

                              The polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} is quasi-integral.

Since a similar property presented in Remark 3.11 applies to P and the convex hull, we have to show that any two integral vertices

In what follows, we prove the integrality of F by the attribute of total unimodularity. Let A be the coefficient matrix of (16)–(18) without slack variables that contains only the columns from LF
                              . Hence, compared to the coefficient matrix of the original problem (16)–(18), all columns that correspond to variables with

                               are removed. Clearly, all entries of A are either 0, 1, or −1. We consider Restriction (16) and ask for the number of non-zero entries in the corresponding J rows of matrix A. Since s

                              2. All other columns do not belong to A since the variables of the two integer solutions are identical. Due to this assignment, the two “+1”-values that may occur in rows resulting from Restriction (16) are assigned to different sets of columns. This results from the fact that each “+1”-value results from another of the two solutions. Moreover, the “+1” and “–1” that may simultaneously occur in a row of Restriction (17) either result completely from the integer solution s
                              1 or from the integer solution s
                              2. Therefore, they are assigned to the same set of columns. Thus, the matrix A is TU (Lemma 3.2), F is an integral face (Lemma 3.3) and we obtain that P is quasi-integral (Lemma 3.1).

Finally, we consider the WUPMP. Since Remark 3.11 holds, we construct a face F′ as presented for P for two integral vertices of

In order to solve the WUPMP to optimality, we introduce two alternative algorithms.

The first algorithm is a Dynamic Programming approach (DP). Its computation transforms the WUPMP into a Shortest Path Problem. This path has to be found in a weighted, directed graph G(V, E) that possesses the following set of nodes V: Each node is an encoding of a partial solution

The second algorithm is denoted as an Iterative Shortest Path procedure (ISP). In order to find an optimal schedule, it iteratively enumerates all feasible y-vectors. After fixing these periods by a currently considered y-vector, N independent subproblems arise that can be solved to optimality in time O(T · log T) to yield values for x. This is done by applying the shortest path procedure introduced in Lemma 4.2. Hence, integer values of x are obtained in time O(N · T · log T). The number of feasible binary vectors y is asymptotically bounded by O(2

In order to evaluate the practicability, both algorithms that are proposed in Lemma 4.3 were programmed in C++ and applied to numerous instances. These instances were randomly generated according to a basic setting that was derived from a specific practical application of the WUPMP. In this application, a maintenance schedule for an oil platform has to be generated for the next T weeks. For this purpose, various maintenance activities have to be performed in predetermined time intervals (the coverages π) in order to guarantee safety and quality restrictions. Depending on the scheduled maintenance activities, different teams of engineers are flown to the platform. The flight costs depend on the week the flight is actually booked, but they are independent of the transported teams. Hence, they are considered fixed costs. In contrast to this, the variable costs may differ considerably with the needed resources and their availability at a requested period.

All computational tests were conducted on an Intel Core i7-4790K CPU (4.00 gigahertz) that is equipped with 32 gigabytes working memory. All in all, we applied both algorithms to 180 randomly generated instances that are clustered in 18 problem groups. Hence, each group comprised 10 instances that have a predetermined number of planning periods T and number of maintenance activities N. By drawing π-values uniformly between 0.1 · T and 0.3 · T each maintenance activity has to be performed five times in the average, while a significant difference between the generated π-values ensures a considerable complexity. Fixed costs are randomly chosen out of the uniform interval [200, 50] and the variable costs are randomly drawn out of the interval [40, 10]. Therefore, maintenance activities with different cost structure characteristics are obtained due to a high variability of the resulting ratios of variable and fixed costs.

The measured results that are depicted in Table 5
                      underscore the derived asymptotic running times of the algorithms proposed by Lemma 4.3. However, while, as expected, the number of considered periods T significantly increases the running time of the ISP-approach, an increase of the number of maintenance activities N may slightly reduce its complexity. Both effects can be ascribed to the fact that the number of enumerated y-vectors clearly dominates the running time of the procedure. While this number increases exponentially with T, a larger number of maintenance activities N tends to reduce the minimum of coverages π
                     min , which in turn may substantially decrease the number of feasible y-vectors. Note that this reduction (that is not considered in the running time function) may slightly dominate the linearly increasing effort of solving a larger number of shortest path problems.

In contrast to this, the complexity of the DP-algorithm increases with larger values of both parameters. However, as defined by the running time function, the exponential impact of N significantly dominates. Therefore, instances with more than 10 maintenance activities cannot be solved by the DP-approach to optimality in reasonable time. In these cases, the DP-approach is outperformed by the ISP-procedure. The exponential complexity of the DP-approach can be also observed by analyzing the listed number of generated nodes that is significantly reduced by applying the proposed dominance rule.

In what follows, we consider further special cases that are polynomial.

                           Table 6 on the right shows the coefficient matrix of (1) and (2) for maintenance activity i. In order to show the polyhedral result, our proof is analogous to Lemma 4.4. The number of variables of the LP relaxation is asymptotically bounded from above by O(N · T). Thus, the LP relaxation is solvable in time O(N

This paper introduces the Weighted Uncapacitated Planned Maintenance Problem (WUPMP) and analyzes its polyhedral structure and computational complexity. Moreover, relations to the well-known Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem as well as to the Uncapacitated Network Design Problem are shown. Specifically, we prove that the WUPMP is strongly

                     -hard, even if each maintenance activity has to be executed once during the planning horizon (i.e., the coverage comprises the entire planning horizon) and fixed costs are uniform. Despite its intractability, it is shown that the WUPMP has a quasi-integral polytope, the single-assignment property and a generalization of the period covering constraint has an integral polytope. Two alternative exact solution procedures that attain an asymptotic running time of

                        T
                     ), respectively, are proposed. Consequently, the WUPMP can be solved in polynomial time if the number of maintenance activities or the number of periods is limited by a constant (i.e., N ∈ O(1) or T ∈ O(1)). Note that this applies to most practical applications. Besides a theoretical complexity analysis of both procedures, the performance of both approaches is also empirically tested by a computational study. Furthermore, efficient polynomial solution algorithms and insightful polyhedral properties are derived for several special cases of the WUPMP.

Future research should be devoted to the development of a best-first branch and bound approach for solving the WUPMP to optimality. Since the applicability of the procedures proposed in the proof of Lemma 4.3 is limited to moderately sized instances, further speedups may be attained by a more sophisticated searching and bounding process as proposed in Bock (2015). In order to allow a more efficient exploration of the solution space, specific dominance rules and lower bounds have to be designed. Furthermore, because of the quasi-integrality property, it seems promising to additionally develop an integral simplex method for the WUPMP. Another research focus should be set on extending the considered WUPMP by capacity issues. In practical applications, the maximum number of maintenance activities executable in a considered period is restricted due to personnel, technical, or material requirements. Therefore, the proposed optimization model and its solution techniques have to be adapted accordingly.
