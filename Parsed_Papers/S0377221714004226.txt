@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision trees, influence diagrams, Bayesian networks and event trees support the solution of decision analysis problems in several applications. Their use is nowadays facilitated by a number of software programs (see Bielza, Gomez, & Shenoy, 2011; Jensen & Nielsen, 2007).

                        1
                      Computer implementation enables analysts to develop sophisticated codes that incorporate a variety of aspects of the problems under investigation (Dillon, Paté-Cornell, & Guikema, 2003). However, model complexity exposes analysts and decision-makers to the risk of a partial understanding of the model input–output response. Then, deriving insights about the structure of the model becomes essential to make robust conclusions and inferences.

Researchers have developed methods for exploring the informational content of decision-support models. For Bayesian networks several of the most recent findings rest on the fundamental result that the input-mapping in Bayesian networks is a multilinear polynomial (Castillo, Gutiérrez, & Hadi, 1996, 1997). For instance, multilinearity is crucial for arithmetic and decision circuits (Bhattacharjya & Shachter, 2012; Darwiche, 2003). However, there are unique challenges in sensitivity analysis for influence diagrams due to the non-linearities created by maximization operations for making decisions (Bhattacharjya & Shachter, 2010, p. 1). Indeed, this issue is transversal to all decision-support models that include a maximization (or minimization) operator. The maximization operation induces piecewise-definiteness and impairs differentiation. Thus, properties of Bayesian networks cannot be transferred directly to models such as influence diagrams, decision trees and decision circuits. The difficulties associated with differentiation then raise broader issues concerning the methodology for deriving managerial insights from decision-support models.

In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation into the mathematical properties of decision-support models. We show that the decision-theoretical principles underlying their construction (Savage, 1954) lead to a piecewise defined input–output mapping. Each piece corresponds to an available strategy and is multilinear in probabilities and utilities. We call the mapping a decision-network polynomial.

Non-differentiability occurs at those values of the model inputs (probabilities/utilities) for which the decision-maker is indifferent among alternative strategies. Using the terminology of Howard (1968) (see also Bhattacharjya & Shachter, 2010),
                        2
                        Drawing from the systems analysis literature, Howard, 1968 
                           refers to varying a parameter and computing the certain equivalent at a fixed strategy as open loop analysis; when the strategy is allowed to vary by re-evaluating the decision situation, it is closed loop analysis (Bhattacharjya & Shachter, 2010, p. 3).
                     
                     
                        2
                      this result suggests that differentiation finds its natural application in an open-loop analysis, i.e., when the preferred strategy (or any other strategy) is under scrutiny. In a closed-loop analysis differentiation might not be possible. We then employ sensitivity measures based on an orthogonal decomposition via finite difference operators (Borgonovo, 2010), that do not require differentiability. These finite change sensitivity indices allow us to obtain a clear understanding of the model response, by apportioning the change in expected utility to the individual effects and interactions among the model inputs.

The next step is the analysis of the model structure when consequences are monetary and certainty equivalents are the output of interest. Findings show that the input–output mapping remains piecewise-defined but each piece is composite multilinear. We link high order derivatives of certainty equivalents polynomials analytically to the derivatives of the corresponding decision-network polynomials. Finite change sensitivity indices acquire a direct interpretation as the monetary gain (loss) associated with the model input variations.

The well known case-study of Felli and Hazen (2004) helps us illustrating how the approach can be used for: (i) understanding direction of change, (ii) quantifying the relevance of interactions; and (iii) identifying the model inputs on which to focus managerial attention during implementation (Eschenbach, 1992, pp. 40-41).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a literature review. Section 3 presents decision-network polynomials. Section 4 investigates the link between indifference and differentiation. Section 5 discusses the presence of interactions and specializes finite change sensitivity indices to the case of decision-network polynomials. Section 6 discusses results for certainty equivalents. Section 7 illustrates the derivation of decision-making insights through a case study in the medical sector. Section 8 offers conclusions. All proofs are in Appendix A.

This section offers a concise overview of relevant literature on decision support models and their sensitivity analysis. For a broad overview of these models we refer to Bielza et al. (2011).

Bayesian networks are among the most widely used decision-support models for the factorization of probability distributions. Their applications range from reliability analysis to genetics (Darwiche, 2010; Jensen & Nielsen, 2007). Technically, a Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph 
                        
                           G
                           =
                           (
                           N
                           ,
                           A
                           )
                        
                     , where N and A are the sets of associated nodes and arcs. N contains chance nodes. Each chance node represents a random variable. A contains arcs or edges, which join pairs of nodes. The lack of an arc signifies probabilistic independence, while the presence of an arc signifies a possible probabilistic dependence. A conditional probability table (CPT) is assigned to each random variable. Algorithms for evaluating Bayesian networks have been widely studied. We refer to Jensen and Nielsen (2007) and Darwiche (2010) for thorough overviews.

A second class of decision-support models for the factorization of probability distributions are event trees. Event trees are often applied in reliability analysis in conjunctions with fault trees. Papazoglou (1998) offers a rigorous mathematical formalization. Marsh and Bearfiled (2008) show that there is always a unique Bayesian network corresponding to an event tree, but there might be multiple event trees corresponding to a Bayesian network. The event tree is unique once the Markovian assumptions of a Bayesian network are satisfied (Darwiche, 2010).

Influence diagrams are Bayesian networks augmented with decision-nodes and value nodes, where value nodes have no descendant (Nielsen & Jensen, 2003, p. 223). Thus, the set of nodes is now partitioned into value, chance and decision nodes (Shachter, 1986, p. 874). Value (or utility) nodes conclude the diagram and display the decision-maker’s utility (or payoff) over consequences. Arcs evidence the flow of information, besides probabilistic dependence Shachter (1986, p. 417). As far as chance nodes are concerned, the corresponding random variables can be discrete (Howard & Matheson, 1981; Shachter, 1986, 1988) or continuous (Cobb & Shenoy, 2008; Shachter & Kenley, 1989). Influence diagrams fully retain the probabilistic meaning of Bayesian networks so that the various well established algorithms for Bayesian net evaluation can be used in influence diagram evaluation (Qi & Poole, 1995, p. 501). Bhattacharjya and Shachter (2010) provide a thorough review on solution methods for influence diagrams.

The compact representation offered by influence diagrams does not allow us to appreciate the detailed combination of decisions and outcomes. To reveal them, we need to convert the influence diagram into the corresponding decision-tree. Under the single decision-makerand no-forgettingconditions (which we assume throughout this work) Howard and Matheson (1981), an influence diagram can be uniquely associated with a decision-tree. At the graphical level, a decision tree contains decision, chance nodes, branches and end nodes (or leaves). They display the combinations of outcomes and alternatives that lead to the end consequences. Any such combination is called a scenario. The size of decision trees grows exponentially with the number of nodes, which is one of their main limitations Bielza and Shenoy (1999).

Sequential decision-diagrams (Covaliu & Oliver, 1995), unconstrained influence diagrams (Jensen & Vomlelova, 2002), limited memory influence diagrams (Lauritzen & Nilsson, 2001), valuation networks (Shenoy, 1992), sequential valuation networks (Demirer & Shenoy, 2006) extend the family of decision-support models.

Given the complexity of decision-support models in practical applications, their sensitivity analysis plays a central role for extracting managerial insights. For Bayesian networks, we recall one-way, distance-based and differentiation based sensitivity analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis is the simplest type of analysis and it consists of systematically varying one of the network’s parameter probabilities while keeping all other parameters fixed (
                     van der Gaag, Renooij, & Coupé, 2007, p. 104
                     ). The works of Castillo et al. (1996, 1997) obtain analytically the sensitivity function, namely the dependence of the posterior probability of interest on the network parameter under scrutiny. An intrinsic limitation of any one-way approach is its reliance on the variation of a single parameter. Chan and Darwiche (2005) extend the robustness question to simultaneous variations. They introduce a new metric for bounding global belief changes that result from either the perturbation of local conditional beliefs or the accommodation of soft evidence (Chan & Darwiche, 2005). Brosnan (2006) relies on Shannon’s entropy and the Kullback–Leibler divergence for answering the same questions. As to differentiation, Chan and Darwiche (2004) discuss the determination of the individual or simultaneous changes in Bayesian network-parameters that ensure the satisfaction of a query constraint using a differential approach. In Bayesian networks, partial derivatives can also be obtained by differentiating sensitivity functions; the result is called sensitivity value in van der Gaag et al. (2007, p. 104). In Blackmond-Laskey (1995) partial derivatives are used to focus elicitation efforts on the most important model inputs. Darwiche (2003) and Park and Darwiche (2004), augment differentiation with probabilistic semantics. They also introduce numerically efficient ways of obtaining first and second order derivatives by upwards and downward passes in arithmetic circuits.

In influence diagrams, the same sensitivity questions can be asked, but we have two notable differences. The first distinction is marked by the need to consider decision sensitivity besides value sensitivity. That is, changing the model inputs does not only modify the value of the decision-problem, but may cause the decision-maker to change strategy. Robustness then becomes the problem of assessing the region in the input parameter space over which the optimal policy is invariant. The second distinction is marked by the presence of utilities in influence diagrams, which play the role of parameters together with probabilities. Nielsen and Jensen (2003) discuss thoroughly both value- and decision-sensitivity while performing one-way and n-way sensitivity analysis of influence diagrams with respect to (w.r.t.) the parameters. In particular, Nielsen and Jensen (2003) elaborate on the concept of admissible domain, studying the set of values over which a parameter/group can be varied without changing the optimal strategy. Bhattacharjya and Shachter (2008) discuss sensitivity analysis in influence diagrams based on decision-circuits (Bhattacharjya & Shachter, 2012). Bhattacharjya and Shachter (2008) address admissible intervals, one-way sensitivity and differentiation. Bhattacharjya and Shachter (2010) present three new ways for sensitivity analysis in decision circuits based on the knowledge of partial derivatives obtained by the decision-circuit encoding.

A further widely used technique is represented by Tornado diagrams (Howard, 1988). Their construction is detailed in Eschenbach (1992). Tornado diagrams are graphical representations of a series of one-at-a-time sensitivities, in which a single model parameter is varied, with the others remaining fixed. From a Tornado diagram one infers sign of change and can rank parameters based on their impact on the value of the decision-problem. The sensitivity measures of Tornado diagrams have been recently generalized to include interaction effects in Borgonovo and Smith (2011).

An analysis of the literature reveals also the following. First, one tends to transfer properties from Bayesian networks to influence diagrams directly. However, the properties of Bayesian networks that remain valid when we augment the network with decision-nodes have to be determined. Second, several sensitivity methods rely on differentiation. However, differentiability of decision-support models is not insured. Third, the most well studied methods consider individual parameter variations. However, also simultaneous variations are of practical interest.

In the next sections, we provide an investigation towards filling these gaps; our first step is determining the mathematical form of the input output mapping.

The purpose of this section is to obtain the formal representation of the input–output mapping in decision-support models starting from the theoretical principles of expected utility theory. In fact, decision support models are developed consistently with the normative perspective of decision-making, namely, the expected utility model of 
                     von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) 
                     and the subjective expected utility model of 
                     Savage (1954) (Smith & von Winterfeldt, 2004, p. 561).

In this respect, we observe that the solution of influence diagrams and decision-trees requires that decision-makers are capable of fully specifying the utilities and probabilities needed to solve the associated decision problems. This assumption is transversal in the literature mentioned sofar and will be maintained throughout the reminder of this work. However, a wide research stream has addressed the solution of decision-analysis problems when decision-makers are unable to fully specify utilities and/or probabilities (see Hazen (1986) on potential optimality and Moskowitz, Preckel, & Yang (1993) for imprecisely assigned utilities and probabilities. Liesiö & Salo (2012) offer a thorough overview). The optimization problems a decision-maker faces might be different than the ones we are to address in this work. Their study is, however, outside the scope of the present work.

For clarifying notation, we make reference throughoutto the running example in Fig. 1
                     . In the decision-problem of Fig. 1, the decision-maker has to select between alternatives I and II, then, after having observed the realization of random variable 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     , she has to choose between alternatives III and IV. If she chooses III, she is then faced with the realization of random variable 
                        
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     . The decision-tree reveals asymmetries in the problem.

In accordance with Savage (1954), a strategy is a function from the state space (
                        
                           Ω

By Savage (1954), the decision-maker selects the strategy with the associated highest expected utility. Savage (1954) shows that this expected utility is, for each strategy m, a functional of the form:

We recall that fixed a strategy – i.e., once the operators in decision-nodes are fixed, – a decision-network polynomial reduces to a Bayesian-network polynomial. Thus, a decision-network polynomial is a sequence of Bayesian-network polynomials.


                     Table 1
                      summarizes the observations developed so far. Models that concern the factorization of probability distributions (e.g., Bayesian networks, event trees, fault trees) are characterized by Bayesian-network polynomials. Models that, in addition, allow for decision evaluation are characterized by Decision-Network polynomials. In particular, Eq. (9) holds for all decision-support models sustained by the powerful theoretical axioms of subjective utility theory. Of course, implementation issues can make analysts prefer one representation tool over another.

                            in Eq. (10) has been written in normal form. However, the input–output mapping of the decision problem can also be written in extensive form. In our example, we would have

                           By simple manipulation, we find that Eq. (11) is equivalent to Eq. (10). This observation is true in general. In fact, dynamic consistency, one of the fundamental properties of expected utility theory, insures us that the normal and extensive forms of any decision-problem are equivalent.

Piecewise-definiteness represents the main departure of decision-network polynomials from Bayesian-network polynomials. The differentiability of a piecewise-defined function is a subtle matter. A general result is presented in Proposition 1 of Borgonovo and Peccati (2010) states that not only the regularity of the pieces, but also by the order of their contact along the frontier of each admissible domain determines differentiability. For decision-network polynomials, the following holds.

From a decision-analytical viewpoint, Proposition 2 amounts to state that a decision-network polynomial is differentiable if and only if the decision-maker selects a preferred strategy. Thus, differentiation finds its full meaning in a post-optimality or in an open-loop setting.

                     Proposition 5 unveils a peculiar feature of the response of decision-support models to input changes, which is generated by their piecewise-definiteness. The first three conditions in Proposition 5 concern a model input

                      has a null total effect, because we register an interaction effect equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to its individual effect. Conditions 1–4–5 address the symmetric situation of a model input that appears in the piece of the decision-network polynomial at

                      but is not involved in the preferred strategy at

                     . In this case, we obtain a null first order effect, but a non-null total effect.


                     Propositions 3–5 concern sensitivity both in an open-loop and closed-loop settings. In particular, Proposition 5 sheds further light on the differences between the two settings. In an open-loop setting, we are interested in the sensitivity of a given strategy (the preferred or another strategy). In this case, the decision-network polynomial is a multilinear function of the parameters. We can write

In several applications, consequences are monetary payoffs and a utility function u over monetary consequences might be assessed. With a slight abuse of notation, let

An important feature of this representation is the possibility of utilizing certainty equivalents. “The certainty equivalent for an alternative is the certain (monetary) amount that is equally preferred to the alternative” (Kirkwood, 2002, Ch. 2, p. 19). Under the above assumptions on u, the certainty equivalent of alternative m, denoted by

                     Because a certainty equivalent is a monotonic transformation of the corresponding expected utility, the link between certainty equivalents and expected utilities is strict.

In this section, we discuss the derivation of managerial insights through a well-known case study. The case-study is presented in Felli and Hazen (2004), and refers to the giant cell arthritis problem (GCA) of Buchbinder and Detsky (1992), which describes a realistic-size application (Felli & Hazen, 2004, p. 101). We refer to Buchbinder and Detsky (1992) and Felli and Hazen (2004) for a thorough overview. The treatment of the GCA problem foresees a prednisone therapy, which may lead to collateral complications. Four medical strategies are possible: (I) Treat None, (II) Biopsy and Treat Positive, (III) Biopsy and Treat All, (IV) Treat All. The problem is represented as an influence diagram in Fig. 3
                     . The chance nodes are: GCA; severe complications (GCAcompl); answer to biopsy test (Test), and prednisone therapy complications (Prednisone Complication).

                     . Also, the sign of the interaction effects coincides with the sign of the first and total effect, in practically all cases, signaling that interactions tend to amplify individual effects.

This leads us to a third aspect, namely, direction of change. We observe that all factors have null or negative total effects. This is in accordance with the decrease in expected utility (certainty equivalent) when passing from

Finally, the application of finite change sensitivity indices to certainty equivalents provides us with an additional managerial interpretation, namely, we can appreciate the monetary amount associated with each model input in the change from the base case to the worst case.

                      is associated with a potential loss of around 0.37USD, of which 0.14USD due to its individual action and the remainder due to interactions with the other factors. In this respect, it is well known that when a model input is prevented from varying, not only its individual effect is canceled, but one annuls also its interaction effect. Thus, fixing

                     , we avoid the (potential) monetary loss of 0.37USD. A Tornado diagram would allow us to appreciate a loss of 0.14USD, but not the additional loss of 0.23USD associated with the interactions of

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have derived the representation of the input–output mapping in decision-support models from the principles of expected utility theory. We have called this representation a decision-network polynomial. We have seen that it is a piecewise defined function of probabilities and utilities. Each piece is multilinear and infinitely many times differentiable at points interior to an admissible domain. Differentiability is lost at indifference points. At these points, directional derivatives exist, provided that the decision-maker resolves indifference. Thus, differentiation finds its natural setting in an open-loop analysis. In a closed-loop setting, sensitivity information cannot be retrieved through differentiation in general. We have then studied the application of finite change sensitivity indices. First order indices are in direct correspondence with one-way sensitivity functions and, when, the model is differentiable, finite change sensitivity indices are in one-to-one correspondence with partial derivatives.

For certainty equivalents, formally identical results hold for the decomposition of finite changes. Finite change sensitivity indices acquire an additional managerial interpretation. They allow us to appreciate the portion of the gain/loss in problem value attributable to the individual action of a model input or due to its interactions with the other model inputs involved in the change.

                            at these points, but, if these points were left in, we would be dealing with a multi-function, in principle; problem which is, however, readily avoided by this assignment. One can then proceed in a similar way with the higher order terms.□

The proof of Eq. (25) follows in a similar way and is omitted for brevity.□

This corollary follows immediately by the fact that if u is a monotonic utility function, then the ranking induced by certainty equivalents is equivalent to the ranking induced by expected utility. More formally, we observe that
