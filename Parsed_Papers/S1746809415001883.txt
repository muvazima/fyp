                  This paper deals with the estimation of glucose levels in ICU patients by the application of statistical filter theory to the data provided by a commercial continuous glucose monitoring system using a microdialysis sensor. Kalman and particle filtering are applied to simple models of the glucose dynamics. The particle filter enables the joint filtering and calibration of the sensor. The results show that the proposed filters lead to significant reduction in the estimation error with computational cost well within the capabilities of modern digital equipment. Additionally, the filters can be used for the automatic recognition of sensor faults. These results show that suitable filters can help in the construction of an artificial pancreas.
