               Abstract
               
                  Networked control of a class of nonlinear systems is considered. For this purpose, the previously proposed variable selective control (VSC) methodology is extended to the nonlinear systems. This extension is based upon the decomposition of the nonlinear system to a set fuzzy-blended locally linearized subsystems, and further application of the VSC methodology to each subsystem. Using the idea of parallel distributed compensation (PDC) method, the closed-loop stability of the overall networked system is guaranteed, using new linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). For the real-time implementation, real-time control signals are constructed for every entry of pre-specified vector of time delays, which is selected based on the presumed upper-bound of the network time delay. Similar to the traditional packet-base control methodology, such control signals are then packed as a control-side packet and transmitted back to a time delay compensator (TDC) located on the plant-side of the network. According to the most recent network time delay, the TDC selects just one entry of the control vector and applies it to the actuator through a zero order hold element. A sufficient condition for closed-loop asymptotic stability is determined. Simulation studies on nonlinear benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
