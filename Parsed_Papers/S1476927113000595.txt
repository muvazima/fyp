                  Domains are the structural basis of the physiological functions of proteins, and the prediction of which is an advantageous process on the study of protein structure and function. This article proposes a new complete automatic prediction method, PPM-Dom (Domain Position Prediction Method), for predicting the particular positions of domains in a target protein via its atomic coordinate. The presented method integrates complex networks, community division, and fuzzy mean operator (FMO). The whole sequences are divided into potential domain regions by the complex network and community division, and FMO allows the final determination for the domain position. This method will suffice to predict regions that will form a domain structure and those that are unstructured based on completely new atomic coordinate information of the query sequence, and be able to separate different domains in the same query sequence from each other. On evaluating the performance using an independent testing dataset, PPM-Dom reached 91.41% for prediction accuracy, 96.12% for sensitivity and 92.86% for specificity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The rapid-cumulated data of protein structures offer both great opportunity and challenges in exploring the relationship between protein structure and function. Protein structure is a determinant for molecular interaction and function, which makes the comparison and classification of it a difficult but important task (Penner et al., 2011). Proteins can be considered to be built up from domains, and each of which can be considered as a semi-independent structural unit of a protein capable of folding independently (Richardson, 1981; Wetlaufer, 1973). Domains, the protein subsequences, may fold and function independently of the rest of the protein (Koehl and Levitt, 1999; Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2005), and in most cases are the structural basis of the physiological functions of proteins. Sometimes, it makes more sense to associate terms with individual domains instead of only with full-length proteins (Fang and Gough, 2013). Consequently, the position prediction of protein domains is a crucial step for functional classification, homology-based structure prediction (Bondugula et al., 2009) and structural genomics (Liu and Rost, 2003), which is always an important aspect of research in the study of proteins.

Several computational tools and methods have been proposed for the prediction of domains. Limited success were made in describing protein domains from sequence alone (Busetta and Barrans, 1984; Kikuchi et al., 1988; Vonderviszt and Simon, 1986), however, new attempts were made recently such as Predoms, a computational toolkit predicting domains based on the entropy parameters of the given sequence (Khan et al., 2010). Protein domain position was predicted based on random forest and mRMR feature selection (Li et al., 2012). Some of the methods require secondary structure data. The SSEP-Domain protein domain prediction approach based on the secondary structure elements was presented (Gewehr and Zimmer, 2006). An ab initio machine learning approach known as DOMpro was developed to predict protein domains based on predicted secondary structure combined with profiles and predicted relative solvent accessibility (Cheng et al., 2006). DomSSEA was presented to predict continuous domains using predicted secondary structure (Marsden et al., 2002). Other domain prediction methods require 3D structural data. In an early study, a method named scooby-domain was recommended to identify globular domains in protein sequence based on the observed lengths and hydrophobicities of domains from proteins with known tertiary structure (George et al., 2005). On the other hand, methods based on the atomic coordinates were discussed such as PDP (Alexandrov and Shindyalov, 2003), DomainParser (Xu et al., 2000), and web servers such as 3Dee (Siddiqui et al., 2001) and DIAL (Pugalenthi et al., 2005). Furthermore, other webservers for domain prediction were available. DHcL was introduced, which read PDB identifier(s) or a 3D protein structure in a PDB format from the user and gave back the location of domains at different levels of hierarchy (Koczyk and Berezovsky, 2008). Servers such as Meta-DP (Saini and Fischer, 2005) and InterProScan (Zdobnov and Apweiler, 2001) provide interface for domain prediction using a number of methods. Kinds of databases providing related information of domains. The dcGO database annotates protein domains with ontological terms, the approach of which takes the terms attached to full-length sequences with the domain composition on a large scale (Fang and Gough, 2013). NCBI's CDD provides resource for the annotation of protein sequences with the location of conserved domain footprints together with inferred functional sites (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011). SMART provides identification and annotation of protein domains and the analysis of domain architectures (Letunic et al., 2012). Databases of this kind are available such as InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012), Pfam (Punta et al., 2012), PROSITE (Sigrist et al., 2010), and so on.

In many aspects of the researches in bioinformatics, the exact domain position is the precondition for the later processes such as studies based on DDI (Domain–Domain interaction) (Lee et al., 2006; Xiao-Li et al., 2005). The study of domain architectures in multi-domain protein families is a common tool in sequence classification and would always reveal their evolutionary history (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011). However, methods for the prediction of domains did not have high accuracy in predicting multidomains, and some of them can only predict the specific domains, while almost all of them could only predict the number and boundaries of domains, but not the exact position of domain regions. Boundary residues are designated as 20 residues before and after the true domain boundary (as defined by SCOP) (Bondugula et al., 2009) for multidomain proteins. The labeling protocol was widely used (Bryson et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2005) in the domain researches. Although the approximate domain positions could be inferred from the domain boundaries, only the regions around the boundaries could be obtained without knowing the position of amino acids on the other end of domain region in the sequence. Moreover, none of the amino acids in domain regions could be inferred from the domain boundary study for single domain proteins, which suggested that it reminds in need of improvement. Besides, non-contiguous sequences were discarded in former studies, and the quantity of such domains were around 7% in SCOP in 2009 (Bondugula et al., 2009). That is, when such proteins were taken as the query proteins, the prediction performance may well not be satisfactory.

The annotation of protein sequences with the location of domains is a common practice in the analysis of sequence data (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011). A few articles were contributed to domain region prediction (Cheng et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012; Linding et al., 2003; Suyama and Ohara, 2003). PPM-Dom could predict the exact position of each domain fragment in any query proteins, and moreover, it could indicate amino acids belonging to each domain region in the 3D space, that is, separate different domains in the same query sequence from each other, which make up for the aforementioned deficiency to some extent. With the recent advances in domain prediction, fuzzy mean operator (FMO) has been shown to make contributions to it. In a recent study, FIEFDom was used to predict the domain boundaries of a multidomain protein using an FMO (Bondugula et al., 2009). Learning from the former researches, this study proposed a new prediction method, known as PPM-Dom, for predicting the particular positions of domains in a query protein via its atomic coordinate, and the number of domains would be inferred effortlessly after that. The method is composed of complex networks, community division, and FMO. On evaluating the performance using an independent testing dataset of 100 proteins, PPM-Dom reached 91.41% for prediction accuracy, 96.12% for sensitivity and 92.86% for specificity. PPM-Dom is a widely applicable method which can be employed for proteins with domain/domains of which each amino acid has its spatial coordinates.

In the present study, the complex networks, community division, and fuzzy mean operator (FMO) for predicting the particular positions of domains in a query protein were employed. The whole sequences are divided into potential domain regions by the complex network and community division, and FMO allows the final determination for the domain position. The whole flowchart of the PPM-Dom is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The query protein was PDB code 1BZ7, chain A, which was determined to have two different domains by PPM-Dom. Referring to its accuracy, sensibility and specificity, the protein reached 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Moreover, when taken into the consideration the identification of different domains in the same sequence, the accuracy, sensibility and specificity reached 99.03%, 99.07%, and 99.01%, respectively.

The protein structure data set in this analysis was derived from the protein data bank (PDB). Proteins with a pairwise sequence identity ≤30% were downloaded to ensure the nonredundance of the data. The information on domains in proteins were then collected from SCOP (database 1.75, structural classification of proteins) (Andreeva et al., 2004, 2008; Brenner et al., 2000), a database which organizes proteins hierarchically according to their families and folds, which is considered the standard for protein structure classification (Day et al., 2003). Protein domains in SCOP are grouped into species and hierarchically classified into families, superfamilies, folds and classes (Lo Conte et al., 2002), which ensures that the data are picked up more comprehensively and make the results of prediction more believable. In this study, all the information of domains was collected from SCOP, which was then used to label the proteins collected in advance. In order to ensure the clear structure of the proteins, only those in which the structures were solved by X-ray crystallography with resolution ≤2.5Å were kept. The remaining 2847 proteins comprised the final data set, from which 100 proteins were randomly chosen as the independent testing dataset, and the other 2747 were the learning dataset. For learning dataset, each sequence is used as a query protein, while the remaining proteins are used as the reference set for fragment searches. The compositions of the each dataset were listed in Table 1
                        .

Protein structures can be treated as complex systems comprised of residues, known as the amino acid complex network. The method of complex network was widely applied in many fields (Barabasi et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2012; Karni et al., 2009). In this study, a protein structure is represented by a complex network, in which a vertex is a residue and an edge is an interaction between residues. The purpose of network community division methods is to divide the vertexes of the networks into groups, within which the connections between the vertexes are dense and the connections between which are sparser in the same time (Girvan and Newman, 2002). Consequently, community division method could be used to organize and analyze the complex networks, and has been widely used in various studies in recent years (Ahn et al., 2010; Kovacs et al., 2010; Szalay-Beko et al., 2012).

Based on the former research, the effect of different cutoff values of edges for constructing complex networks were analyzed. It was observed that for analyzing domain data, the optimal numerical interval of the cutoff values was 5.0–7.5Å (Cα–Cα distances), and the ideal community division method was based on edge betweenness (Newman and Girvan, 2004) for this kind of data (Sun et al., 2013).

With the recent advances in domain prediction, fuzzy mean operator (FMO) has been shown to make contributions to it. The amino acid label identification method employed in this study is composed of PSI-Blast and FMO (Bondugula et al., 2009), which is utilized to label the communities as domain region and sequence regions.

The results of community division were introduced here without presenting the labels of each community, that is, whether each belonged to the domain region or sequences region, and moreover, whether two different communities (continuous or discontinuous in the query sequences) belonged to the same or different domain regions. Here, ideas were borrowed from FIEFDom (Bondugula et al., 2009), and the practical method was then improved when combined in this study. The steps are explained below. First, sequence alignment of the query protein by PSI-Blast using the database previously constructed was used, from which the fragments of the protein were obtained; Second, each amino acid of the query protein was estimated that whether they belonged to a domain region by a voting scheme after estimating the expectation value of the fragments of the protein by FMO; Third, each community obtained by community division method was classified, and whether it belonged to a domain region was determined using the labels of each amino acid; Finally, whether two different communities (continuous or discontinuous in the query sequences) belonged to the same or different domain regions was estimated.

In the first step, sequence alignment of the query protein was determined by PSI-Blast using the database previously constructed, from which the fragments of the protein were obtained. Here, the expectation value (e-value) was the result of the sequence alignment, which was set at 10,000. This score ensured sufficient information for the vote later.

In the second step, the same pretreatment as outlined of FIEFDom (Bondugula et al., 2009) was employed using the following scoring scheme (Bondugula and Xu, 2007):

                         is the expectation of the ith fragments of the protein, b
                        
                           i
                         is 0 when the ith fragment does not belong to the domain region and 1 when it does, P is the probability that one blind amino acid belongs to a domain region, which is the objective of this step.

In the third step, the arithmetic mean values of the probability of all amino acids in one community were calculated, which were designated P. Here, a threshold was introduced called p′, which was defined as the measure of probability of a community belonging to a domain region (the probability increased as the threshold increased). When P
                        ≥
                        p′, the whole community was judged to belong to the domain region, and the identity of all the communities in the given protein was decided.

In the final step, there may be two or more different communities beside each other all belonging to the domain region, as a result, it must be decided whether these regions are in the same domain. Here, sequence alignment was used for the exact 20 amino acids in each critical place of the communities beside each other using PSI-Blast, namely 40 amino acids in all, from which the fragments were obtained, which were then put into practice using the following formulas:

Moreover, when referred to the estimate that whether two different communities (continuous or discontinuous in the query sequences) belonged to the same or different domain regions, amino acid from different kinds of domains would be treated as different samples. In this case, for a query protein sequence, amino acids belonging to the exact domain region were treated as positive samples, and the others in the same sequence were the negative samples.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, the effects of different thresholds p′ for labeling the identity of amino acids and the cutoff values for construction the complex networks of the query protein were analyzed. The method was used on the dataset analyzed by amino acid complex networks constructed under the optimal numerical interval of the cutoff values 5.0–7.5Å (Cα–Cα distances) and the ideal community division method based on edge betweenness, which were determined in the preliminary work (Sun et al., 2013).

In this study, p′ was defined as the measure of probability of a community belonging to a domain region (the probability increased as the threshold increased). In order to obtain the best prediction performance, different thresholds of p′ and were set. 9 different numerical values (0.1–0.9) of p′ were optimized, respectively, the step size of which was 0.1. Moreover, different cutoff values 5.0–7.5Å (Cα–Cα distances) for construction of complex networks are optimized, respectively, the step size of which was 0.5. Moreover, the final prediction performance of learning dataset based on both thresholds p′ and cutoff values (Cα–Cα distances) are listed in Figs. 2–4
                        
                        
                        . The results indicated that the highest value of accuracy reached 92.38% when threshold p′ was set at 0.1 and Cα–Cα distance was 7.5Å, which were then set as the optimal thresholds of PPM-Dom.

For analyzing the effect on the prediction performance of single domain and multidomain proteins, respectively based on different values of p′, the performance was investigated additionally. When Cα–Cα distance was 7.5Å, final accuracies of single domain and multidomain proteins based on different threshold p′ are shown in Fig. 5
                        . When the accuracies of domain with single and multidomain proteins were compared additionally, p′ had more influence on single domain protein. The reason for this is that there are more sequence regions in single domain proteins, which makes the prediction for single domain proteins more complicated when using software based on the similarity of sequences such as PSI-Blast, that is, the accuracies will change more along with the change of p′.

In this section, PPM-Dom for predicting the particular position of domains in a query protein via its atomic coordinate was analyzed. The method was used on the dataset under the cutoff value of 7.5Å (Cα–Cα distances), a threshold p′ of 0.1, and the community division method based on edge betweenness.

When tested on the learning dataset, the results of prediction performance were listed in Table 2
                        . For the learning dataset, accuracy, sensibility, and specificity reached 92.38%, 97.03%, and 93.48%, respectively. Specifically, accuracy reached 90.00% for proteins with a single domain and 94.78% for multidomain proteins, the sensibility were 95.98% and 98.09%, respectively, and specificity were 90.90% and 96.08%, respectively. On evaluating the performance using an independent testing dataset, as shown in Table 2, accuracy, sensibility, and specificity reached 91.41%, 96.12%, and 92.86%, respectively. For single and multidomain proteins, respectively, accuracy reached 90.29% and 92.77%, sensibility were 95.65% and 96.68%, and specificity were 90.29% and 95.97%. The prediction performance was always better for multidomain proteins than that for single domain proteins, and it was observed from these results that the stability of this method was good.

For the independent dataset, the accuracy, sensibility, and specificity increased as the number of domains in a query protein increased, which means that the prediction performance for multidomain protein performs better than single domain protein. The tendency of the result was consistent with the learning dataset.

Additionally, whether two different communities (continuous or discontinuous in the query sequences) belonged to the same or different domain regions, namely, to identify different domains in the same sequence, the prediction performance of PPM-Dom based on the independent dataset were listed in Table 3
                        . Here, both learning and independent datasets were tested for this aim.

When tested on the learning dataset, accuracy, sensibility, and specificity reached 76.20%, 97.77%, and 73.09%, respectively. To be specific, for single domain proteins and multidomain proteins, respectively, accuracy reached 93.08% and 59.22%, and the average (sensibility, specificity) for single domain proteins was (96.41%, 97.09%). For multidomain proteins, the average (sensibility, specificity) was (99.14%, 48.96%). On evaluating the performance using an independent testing dataset, as shown in Table 3, accuracy, sensibility, and specificity reached 79.90%, 97.36%, and 76.12%, respectively. To be specific, accuracy reached 94.46% for proteins with a single domain and 62.07% for multidomain proteins, the sensibility were 95.65% and 99.43%, respectively, and specificity were 95.65% and 52.48%, respectively. It was observed from these results that when taken the identification of different domains into the consideration, the sensibility of single domain proteins was always lower (little difference of the numerical value) than that for multidomain proteins, and the specificity of single domain proteins was always much better than that for multidomain proteins. Moreover, the stability of this method was good.

For the independent dataset, the accuracy and specificity decreased as the number of domains in a query protein increased. The results were attributed to the emphasis in constructing PPM-Dom to distinguish different domains, that is, the number of amino acids in the domain boundaries increased when the number of domains in a protein chain increased, which showed that the proportion of inaccurately classified amino acids increased, and so it was the reason. However, the tendency of the result was in accord with the learning dataset.


                        Fig. 6
                         shows an example of discrepancies between SCOP and PPM-Dom. The query sequence in Fig. 6 was chosen from the independent dataset, PDB code 1FNN, chain A, which has two different domains containing 388 amino acids as described in SCOP, and the position of the first one range from the 1st to the 276th amino acid, while the second one range from the 277th to the 388th amino acid. The prediction result of this sequence predicted by PPM-Dom is that it has two different domains, and the position of the first one range from the 1st to the 263th and the 266th amino acids, while the second one range from the 264th to the 265th and the 267th to the 388th amino acid. When TP denotes the amino acids belonging to domain regions correctly predicted as amino acids belonging to domain regions without distinguishing these two different domains from each other, the accuracy for this protein would be 99.74%. When referred to distinguish two kinds of amino acids from two different domains, the accuracy would be 70.95%.

Moreover, in the aforementioned example, amino acids in two different domains were all continuous sequence. Inspection results of all the predicted proteins show that amino acids of discontinuous domain regions could also be identified as the same kinds regardless of the region between them in the sequence belongs to another kind of domain region or sequence region, that is, PPM-Dom really realize the distinction of different domains, and furthermore, and the number of domains would be inferred effortlessly after that.

Furthermore, the prediction performances based on both SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2004, 2008; Brenner et al., 2000) and CATH (Greene et al., 2007; Orengo et al., 1997) were compared. Although SCOP database is considered the standard for protein structure classification (Day et al., 2003), there is not a single or true domain assignments but only different assignments that can differ on some case. When taken the domain information of SCOP as reference dataset, while the domain information of CATH as the measure of the prediction results. On evaluating the performance using the same independent testing dataset of 100 proteins, the prediction accuracy, sensibility and specificity of PPM-Dom reached 30.81%, 33.50% and 30.98%, respectively. If the domain information of SCOP and CATH are resemble, then the prediction performance of the two parts would not have too much difference. However, CATH and SCOP show great differences on domain assignments, especially for the position and number of domains in protein sequences, since the same protein sequence may be defined have one domain in SCOP and eight domains in the CATH at the same time. That is, the low results may attributed to the different domain information and classification between the two databanks.

In a word, PPM-Dom will suffice to predict the particular positions of domains in a target protein via its atomic coordinate, regions that form a domain structure and those unstructured could be separated from each other, and so could be for different domains in the same query sequence.
