                  A new group decision-making approach is developed to address a multiple criteria sorting problem with uncertainty. The uncertainty in this paper refers to imprecise evaluations of alternatives with respect to the considered criteria. The belief structure and the evidential reasoning approach are employed to represent and aggregate the uncertain evaluations. In our approach, the preference information elicited from a group of decision makers is composed of the assignment examples of some reference alternatives. The disaggregation–aggregation paradigm is utilized to infer compatible preference models from these assignment examples. To help the group reach an agreement on the assignment of alternatives, we propose a consensus-reaching process. In this process, a consensus degree is defined to measure the agreement among the decision makers’ opinions. When the decision makers are not satisfied with the consensus degree, possible solutions are explored to help them adjust assignment examples in order to improve the consensus level. If the consensus degree arrives at a satisfactory level, a linear program is built to determine the collective assignment of alternatives. The application of the proposed approach to a customer satisfaction analysis is presented at the end of the paper.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The multiple criteria sorting (MCS) problem is concerned with the assignment of a set of decision alternatives evaluated on a family of criteria into predefined ordered categories. In practice, MCS is used in many fields, such as supplier management (Araz & Ozkarahan, 2007), water resource planning (Chen, Hipel, & Kilgour, 2007), ABC inventory classification (Chen, Li, Kilgour, & Hipel 2008), energy management (Neves, Martins, Antunes, & Dias, 2008), credit rating (Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2011), assisted reproduction (Figueira et al., 2011), construction project management (Mota & Almeida, 2012), regional competitiveness analysis (Fernandez, Navarro, Duarte, & Ibarra, 2013), water contamination risk assessment (Macary, Almeida-Dias, Uny, & Probst, 2013), recommender system (Marin, Isern, Moreno, & Valls, 2013), climate classification (Mailly, Abi-Zeid, & Pepin, 2014), and research unit evaluation (Kadziński & Słowiński, 2015).

Various approaches for addressing the MCS problem have been proposed in the literature. These approaches can be classified into the following four categories: (1) the methods inspired by the outranking relations (e.g., Almeida-Dias, Figueira, & Roy, 2010, 2012; Janssen & Nemery, 2013; Köksalan, Mousseau, Özpeynirci, & Özpeynirci, 2009; Kadziński, Tervonen, & Figueira, 2014; Nemery & Lamboray, 2008; Rocha & Dias, 2008); (2) the methods motivated by the value functions (e.g., Doumpos, Zanakis, & Zopounidis, 2001; Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2004; Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, 2011; Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2010; Kadziński, Ciomek, & Słowiński 2015; Köksalan & Özpeynirci, 2009; Kadziński & Tervonen, 2013; Köksalan & Ulu, 2003); (3) the methods based on the weighted Euclidean distance (e.g., Chen et al., 2007, 2008; Vetschera, Chen, Hipel, & Kilgour, 2010); and (4) the rule induction-oriented methods (e.g., Dembczyński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2009; Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński, 2010; Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2014). These methods were originally designed to address the MCS problem for which the preferences are expressed by a single decision maker (DM). However, group decision-making is the most important and frequently encountered process within companies and organizations (Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2012). Therefore, it is important to study the MCS problem in the context of group decision-making. Moving from a single-DM setting to a multiple-DM setting introduces a great deal of complexity into the MCS problem. In the extant literature, Dias and Clímaco (2000) addressed the sorting problem of a group of DMs with imprecise information on the parameters. Damart, Dias, and Mousseau (2007) provided a methodology that could help a group iteratively reach an agreement on how to sort exemplary alternatives. Jabeur and Martel (2007) proposed a sorting method that determines at least one collective assignment from the individual preference systems. Bregar, Györkös, and Jurič (2008) implemented an active iterative mechanism for group consensus seeking that could automatically unify the opinions of the DMs. Greco et al. (2012) and Kadziński, Greco, and Słowiński (2013) extended the robust ordinal regression to the sorting problem in the context of group decision-making. Cai, Liao, and Wang (2012) proposed an interactive sorting approach based on the assignment examples of multiple DMs with different priorities. Bezerra, Melo, and Costa (2014) applied the visual, interactive and comparative analysis methodology to the ELECTRE Tri method (Yu, 1992) for the consensus-building in cooperative groups.

Most of the MCS approaches proposed in the literature assume that the evaluation of alternatives on criteria is accurately defined. However, in real life, the evaluation of certain alternatives on particular criteria may involve various types of uncertainties such as ignorance, fuzziness, interval data, and interval belief degrees (Fu & Yang, 2010). It is therefore necessary to use a scheme to represent and process such uncertain information. Within the field of MCS, few methods suit scenarios in which the evaluation of alternatives is not precisely defined. One of the exceptions is the study developed by Janssen and Nemery (2013) in which the authors extended the FlowSort method (Nemery & Lamboray, 2008) to the case of imprecision in the input data which are defined by intervals. Dembczyński et al. (2009) considered an extension of DRSA (the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach) to the context of the imprecise evaluation of alternatives on criteria and the imprecise assignment of alternatives to categories. However, the two methods are not suitable for handling situations in which the data for measuring the performance of an alternative on a criterion is absent or incomplete or in the form of a probability distribution.

Within the field of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the evidential reasoning (ER) approach (Yang & Xu, 2002a, 2002b) is a well-known method for addressing decision situations characterized by uncertainty. Unlike the majority of conventional MCDA methods, the ER approach describes the performance of an alternative on a criterion with a distributed assessment using a belief structure. In addition, the ER approach uses a new procedure for aggregating multiple criteria based on the distributed assessment framework. The ER approach provides a new avenue for handling various types of uncertainties in a unified format that includes precise data, the absence of data, incomplete data and probability uncertainty. It has been applied to decision problems in many areas, such as engineering design (Chin, Yang, Guo, & Lam, 2009; Yang, Xu, Xie, & Maddulapalli, 2011), environmental impact assessment (Wang, Yang, & Xu, 2006), business management (Hilhorst, Ribbers, van Heck, & Smits, 2008), and group decision-making (Fu & Yang, 2010).

In this paper, we propose a group decision-making approach based on ER to address the MCS problem with uncertainty. We employ the belief structure and the ER algorithm to represent and aggregate uncertain assessments, respectively. In the ER approach, it is necessary for the DMs to specify the utilities of grades in the assessment framework to obtain the global evaluation of alternatives. This elicitation of the preference information is often referred to as the direct elicitation technique, in which the DMs are guided to directly specify the values of the parameters used in the preference model (Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008). However, such direct elicitation is considered to be cognitively cumbersome and difficult for the DMs. Alternatively, there is a preference elicitation technique known as indirect elicitation, which is of interest because it requires relatively less cognitive efforts from the DM (Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012; Kadziński & Słowiński, 2013; Köksalan et al., 2009). For the indirect elicitation technique, the DMs specify certain examples of holistic judgments, from which compatible values of the preference model parameters are induced using the disaggregation–aggregation (or regression) paradigm. The approach proposed in this paper utilizes the indirect preference elicitation technique. Specifically, the DMs participating in the sorting process are required to provide assignment examples for some reference alternatives. A methodology using the disaggregation–aggregation paradigm is then adopted to infer a set of compatible utility function models integrating the utilities of grades from these assignment examples, which is applied to sort other alternatives.

In the context of group decision-making, one major issue to consider is how to help a group cooperatively develop a common MCS model to sort alternatives into categories. However, due to the DMs’ different knowledge bases and levels of experience, there may be a diversity of opinions among the group members. What makes the process more difficult is that an agreement between the DMs may have to be reached in spite of the diversity of judgments and the subjective perception of reality (Damart et al., 2007). Thus, prior to the actual sorting of alternatives it is necessary to reach some type of consensus among the DMs in the decision process. In the proposed approach, a consensus-reaching process is developed to help the DMs to interact for the purpose of iteratively reaching an agreement on how to sort alternatives, with consistency preserved at both the individual level and the collective level. A consensus degree is defined to analyze, control and monitor the consensus-reaching process. The consensus degree measures the agreement among the DMs’ opinions. The iterative process is composed of several rounds of consensus-reaching. When the consensus degree is at a low level and the DMs are not satisfied with it, we explore possible solutions to help the group adjust assignment examples in order to improve the consensus level. If the consensus degree arrives at a satisfactory level, we build a linear program to determine the collective assignment of alternatives.

The approach proposed in this paper is distinguished from the previous methods by the following new features. First, the ER approach is extended to the case of the sorting problem for the first time. Despite its successful application to ranking and choice problems with uncertainty, no previous method has introduced the ER approach to the sorting problem. The approach proposed in this paper reveals the applicability and flexibility of the ER approach in modelling the uncertainty in the MCS problem. Second, the proposed approach employs the disaggregation–aggregation paradigm to infer a compatible utility function model from the assignment examples provided by the DMs. This technique reduces the cognitive efforts of the DMs to specify the utilities of assessment grades in the ER approach. Third, this paper develops a consensus-reaching process to support interaction among the DMs, helping them to reach a consensus on how to sort the alternatives. The process contributes to the search for a transparent, justifiable and collectively constructed consensus. An additional appeal of this paper stems from the fact that it provides a definition of the consensus measure for the MCS problem in the context of group decision-making. The definition of this consensus measure could be easily integrated with the other existing MCS approaches to the case of group decision-making and could help accelerate the consensus-reaching process.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief introduction to the ER approach. In Section 3, we present a group decision-making approach based on ER for the MCS problem with uncertainty. Section 4 demonstrates the approach using an example. The paper ends with conclusions and discussion regarding future research.

The ER approach is a general approach for analyzing MCDA problems characterized by various types of uncertainty using a unified framework – belief structures (Xu, 2012). With belief structures, the performance of an alternative on a criterion is described as a distribution assessment using belief degrees.

We should mention that for the assessment of different qualitative criteria, however, different sets of evaluation grades may need to be defined to facilitate data collection. Moreover, some criteria are quantitative and may be assessed using precise or random numbers. This increases the complexity in criteria aggregation. Yang (2001) proposed the rule and utility based information transformation techniques to deal with various types of assessment information under a unified belief structure defined by the same set of grades.

Based on the unified belief structure, Yang and Xu (2002a, 2002b) developed the ER algorithm for the aggregation of multiple criteria. The algorithm in detail can be found in Appendix A. After all the L criteria have been aggregated, we obtain the combined belief degrees for the grade Hn
                     , denoted by βn
                     (ai
                     ), 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           N
                        
                     , and the combined belief degree that is not assigned to any individual grade, denoted by βH
                     (ai
                     ).

If it is required to rank alternatives or choose the best one or assign them to predefined categories, their performances represented by belief structures may not be directly comparable. Hence the concept of expected utility is introduced as a measure to evaluate the performances of alternatives, which requires that the utility of one assessment grade is disjoint from the utility of any other assessment grade in the belief structure. The expected utility of alternative ai
                      is given by:

                         is expressed by belief structure sl

                        ). The DMs share the same “description” of the sorting problem, i.e., the set of alternatives A, the family of criteria G, the performance matrix S, and the set of categories C (Greco et al., 2012). We consider the different role of each DM in the decision process and hence differentiate their priorities by a weight vector

In this study, we focus on introducing the ER approach to address the MCS problem and developing a consensus-reaching process. Note that the raw data of alternatives on criteria could be either qualitative or quantitative in different formats and we should transform them into the unified belief structure in advance. Moreover, similarly to some multiple criteria group decision-making methods (Chin et al., 2009; Fu & Yang, 2010; Huang, Chang, Li, & Lin, 2013; Tavana, Sodenkamp, & Suhl, 2010), we assume that all members of the group accept the common weights of criteria, i.e.,

The collective weights of criteria can be obtained by using some methods such as direct rating (Doyle, Green, & Bottomley, 1997), eigenvector method (Takeda, Cogger, & Yu, 1987), and Delphi method (Hwang & Yoon, 1981). Concerning the DMs’ priorities, the leader of the group could specify the weight vector

In the context of group decision-making, the DMs may have different utility values on u(Hn
                        ),

                        . Thus, we use ut
                        (Hn
                        ) to denote the utility of the DM et
                         on grade Hn
                         and Ut
                        (a) to denote the expected utility of the DM et
                         for alternative α. In the proposed method, we take the threshold-based sorting procedure (Greco, Mousseau et al., 2010), and the sorting is performed through the comparison between the utility of each alternative with category thresholds

Determine the collective assignment of alternatives (see Section 3.6 for more details) and present the sorting results to the group.

The MCS approach proposed in this paper extends the disaggregation–aggregation paradigm to the case of group decision-making. In this case, a group of DMs collaborate to sort a set of alternatives into predefined ordered categories. The approach aims to support interaction among the DMs and to help them to reach a consensus on the assignment of alternatives. In this context, we identify two types of inconsistency that may occur at the individual level and the group level. The former stems from the possible inconsistency in the assignment examples of an individual DM. Indeed, the preferences of a DM may be incoherent and unstable, so it is difficult for him/her to provide consistent assignment examples. The second type of inconsistency arises from the group's pursuance of an agreement on the assignment of alternatives. Due to the difference of the DMs’ preferences, there is usually a divergence about the assignment among the DMs. Thus, it is required to make the entire group move toward a collective assignment while keeping the individual assignment consistent.

To meet this requirement, we develop a process to help the group reach a consensus on the assignment of alternatives progressively. On the one hand, to maintain consistency at the individual level, any possible inconsistency in the assignment examples is detected and solved by constructing linear programs based on the principle of the minimum sum of shifts. On the other hand, the possible assignment of each non-reference alternative is computed based on the consistent assignment examples, and an index is defined to measure the consensus level of the group. If the DMs are not satisfied with the consensus level, possible adjustment solutions are explored and presented to the DMs and they could choose among these solutions to improve the consensus level. When the consensus level is satisfactory, we build a linear program to determine the collective assignment of alternatives. Note that we assume that all members in the group are sufficiently cooperative to follow this procedure.

In such a case, we could help the DM to find the assignment examples which cause the inconsistency and then to adjust them to make the constraint set

                        . Constraint (3.12) ensures that each alternative is assigned to a single category. Constraints (3.14)–(3.16) indicate the assignment interval of a* after adjustment. Constraints (3.17) and (3.18) specify the shift of the minimum assignment, while constraints (3.19) and (3.20) measure the shift of the maximum assignment.

The optimal solution of LP2 shows one possible solution with the minimum sum of shifts. In some cases, there are multiple possible solutions corresponding to the minimum sum of shifts. We can search for more solutions by solving LP2 with additional constraints and then present these solutions to the DM and ask him/her to choose one. See Appendix B for more details about this issue.

                         could be more precise. This means that if the DM specifies an imprecise assignment example, some categories from this range may not be feasible.

The group consensus is an important issue for finding the collective solution of a group decision-making problem. In this section, we will propose a new method to measure the consensus degree for the MCS problem in the context of group decision-making.

The consensus measure of a single alternative is constructed at three levels: the pairwise comparison level, the individual level and the group level. With the possible assignment of alternative, the measures at the above three levels can be defined as follows.

The average consensus degree of all alternatives can serve as an index to measure the consensus level of the group's opinions and be used to monitor the process of consensus reaching.

                            is bound within the interval [0,1].

                            is small and the DMs are not satisfied with the consensus level, the way to improve consensus level should be explored to help the DMs to revise their preference information. In this paper we propose a simple method which is implemented as follows.

Note that in this method we need to enumerate all possible adjustment solutions and then verify the improvement of consensus level and it seems time-consuming. Nevertheless, we should remember that decision analysis problems often deal with relatively small data sets (Corrente, Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, 2013) and the enumeration can be implemented with a modern computer in acceptable time.

Through several rounds of consensus-reaching, the consensus level will improve and the average consensus degree

                         and the group may not wish to continue. In this section we provide a method to determine the collective assignment of alternatives when the DMs are satisfied with the consensus level and decide to terminate the consensus-reaching process.

In order to determine the collective assignment of alternatives, we need to consider the assignment of all the DMs comprehensively. Due to the difference of the DMs’ preference information, the assignment of the DMs may be inconsistent. Thus we follow the idea of the proportion of DMs accepting each possible assignment in Damart et al. (2007) and propose a measure to indicate the supporting degree for each possible assignment when the DMs have different priorities.

In this definition, Eq
                           (a) is the sum of the equal allocation of DMs’ weights to their assignment intervals. The definition of supq
                           (a) means that Eq
                           (a) of category Cq
                            is compared with E
                           
                              q'(a) of lower categories C
                           
                              q' (i.e., q' < q) and E
                           
                              q''(a) of upper categories C
                           
                              q'' (i.e., q'' > q). If Eq
                           (a) is greater than the minimum of E
                           
                              q'(a) and E
                           
                              q''(a), supq
                           (a) will be equal to Eq
                           (a); otherwise, supq
                           (a) will be equal to the minimum of E
                           
                              q'(a) and E
                           
                              q''(a). This reinforces the supporting degree of assigning α to a middle category for the purpose of consensus-reaching.

Remark that for q, q', q'' ∈ {1, 2, ..., Q}, if q < q'' < q', supq
                           (a) > 0 and sup
                           
                              q'(a) > 0, we have sup
                           
                              q''(a) > 0. Definition 9 ensures the continuity of supporting degrees. The property is illustrated by the following example.

                           . In this case, we observe that the opinions of the DMs are divided into two sub-groups, with e
                           1 and e
                           3 intending to assign α to lower categories C
                           1 and C
                           2 but e
                           2 and e
                           4 deciding to assign α to upper categories C
                           4 and C
                           5. When we seek for consensus assignment, it is highlighted that assigning α to C
                           3 should be considered. Although no DM assigns α to C
                           3, we can consider C
                           3 as a trade-off for consensus reaching.

We propose a linear program to determine the collective assignment of alternatives. The linear program has two objectives, with the first one being to maximize the sum of supporting degrees of all alternatives and the second one to maximize the sum of margins between the utilities of alternatives and the category thresholds.

In this section, the proposed approach is applied to a customer satisfaction analysis for the demonstration of its detailed implementation process and potential applications in the MCS problem with uncertainty.

The MCS problem in question is related to a software corporation in China that provides 20 software services for enterprise applications, such as OA, ERP, SCM, and CRM. The corporation has a large customer population in the nation. The corporation is planning to measure and analyze customer satisfaction with its software services based on seven evaluation criteria identified by the corporation: g
                        1 = “Core functions (CF)”, g
                        2 = “Extended functions (EF)”, g
                        3 = “Validity of solution (VS)”, g
                        4 = “Implementation experience (IE)”, g
                        5 = “Technical support level (TSL)”, g
                        6 = “Value for money regarding software expense (VMSE)”, and g
                        7 = “Value for money regarding consultation expense (VMCE)”. The following general grade set is defined to evaluate the services:

The ER algorithm is used to aggregate the belief structures on multiple criteria into the combined belief degrees and the outcomes are presented in Table 2. All the DMs analyze the combined belief degrees and then provide assignment examples based on their knowledge and experiences. Their assignment examples are listed in Table 3(a). The reference sets of the DMs are

The linear program LP1 is built to check the consistency of the assignment examples at the individual level. IBM ILOG CPLEX® is used to solve LP1. The assignment examples provided by the DM e
                           1 are found to be inconsistent, while those provided by the DMs e
                           2, e
                           3 and e
                           4 are consistent. To make the assignment examples consistent, the linear program LP2 is solved to help the DM e
                           1 to adjust his assignment examples. In the LP2 model, ε and M are set to be 10−5 and 6, respectively. We obtain three possible solutions as follows: (1) {a
                           3 → [C
                           3, C
                           5], a
                           4 → [C
                           1, C
                           3], a
                           6 → [C
                           2, C
                           3]}; (2) {a
                           3 → [C
                           2, C
                           5], a
                           4 → [C
                           1, C
                           3]}; (3) {a
                           3 → [C
                           2, C
                           5], a
                           8 → [C
                           2, C
                           3]}. All these solutions correspond to the minimum sum of shifts of four. Suppose the DM e
                           1 chooses the solution {a
                           3 → [C
                           2, C
                           5], a
                           4 → [C
                           1, C
                           3]} to adjust his assignment examples. Thus, the adjusted assignment examples of the DM e
                           1 are a
                           1 → [C

                           3 → [C
                           2, C
                           5], a
                           4 → [C
                           1, C
                           3], a
                           6 → C
                           2, and a
                           8 → C
                           3. The assignment examples after adjustment are presented in Table 3(b).

Based on the consistent assignment examples, we can compute possible assignment of services a ∈ A for each DM et

                           , and the results are presented in Table 4. We observe that the possible assignment of some reference alternatives differs from the range desired by some DMs. For example, the possible assignment of service a
                           1 for the DM e
                           1 is C
                           3, which is more precise than the assignment example [C

                           3] specified by him.


                           Table 4 shows that the services a

                           9 has the minimum consensus degree of 0.22916. The average consensus degree

Since only e

                           4 and the results are presented in Table 6. We observe that the services a
                           12 and a
                           15 still have the maximum consensus degrees of 0.78333 and the service a
                           5 has the minimum consensus degree of 0.23166. The average consensus degree

For the compactness of presentation, we shall not present more details of the following rounds of consensus-reaching. Table 8 presents the selected adjustment solutions from Round 3 to Round 11. Fig. 4
                            depicts the improvement of average consensus degree

                            during the whole process.

After the adjustment in Round 11, the group finds that the

                            is greater than 0.8 and they are satisfied with the consensus level. Moreover, they consider that it may need more rounds to arrive at

                           . Hence they decide to terminate the process and determine the collective assignment of services.

The possible assignment at the end of Round 11 is presented in Table 9. Based on the possible assignment, we obtain the supporting degrees of assigning services to each category which is listed in Table 10.

Then we employ the linear program LP4 to determine the collective assignment of services. In the LP4 model, ε and ρ are set to be 10−5 and 3 × 106, respectively. With the optimal solution of LP4, the collective assignment of each service is obtained as: a
                           8, a
                           12, a
                           15 and a
                           20 are assigned to the category C

                           19 are assigned to the category C

We observe that for any service a ∈ A, it is collectively assigned to the corresponding category with the maximum supporting degree. When there are multiple categories corresponding to the maximum supporting degree, the second goal of LP4 is used to determine the collective assignment of α by maximizing the margins between its utility and the category thresholds. For example, for the service a
                           5, we have the maximum supporting degrees of assigning a
                           5 to the categories a

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we presented a group decision support approach for the MCS problem with uncertainty. The belief structure and the ER approach are employed to represent and aggregate uncertain information. To specify the sorting model, each DM is asked to provide individual assignment examples (the desired assignment for specific reference alternatives) that yield a set of compatible utility functions. Taking into account the set of assignment examples as preference information, the approach provides a possible assignment interval for each alternative at the individual level. A consensus degree is defined to measure the agreement among the DMs’ opinions. When the DMs are not satisfied with the consensus degree, possible solutions are explored to help them adjust assignment examples in order to improve the consensus level. If the consensus degree arrives at a satisfactory level, a linear program is built to determine the collective assignment of alternatives.

Note that the consensus-reaching process developed in this paper can be applied to other sorting models for dealing with the case of group decision-making in a straightforward way. In this study, we focus on the design of the consensus-reaching process for MCS and thus assume that all the DMs share the same belief structure and the same criteria weights. When the DMs use different belief structures to express their uncertain judgments or the weights of criteria could be different for the DMs, it will be challenging but interesting to solve such problems, which requires further research.

However, we should acknowledge that the consensus-reaching process may require many rounds to reach a satisfactory consensus level, especially when there is a large divergence among the opinions of the DMs. In such a case, the DMs may feel that the tedious process is boring and may not have confidence in participating in the consensus-reaching process. This is due to the fact that only one DM is asked to revise a single assignment example at each round and thus the improvement of consensus level is not significant. In future research, more efficient adjustment solutions should be explored to accelerate the consensus-reaching process.

                        L2(a*) is equal to 1, the minimum assignment of the reference alternative a* will change. In constraints (

                        R2(a*) is equal to 1, the maximum assignment of the reference alternative a* will change. Constraint (
B.5
) ensures that at least one reference alternative will be adjusted to a different interval of categories and thus another adjustment solution will be generated. Such additional constraints are added to LP2 and they will forbid finding again the same solution. We continue solving LP2 with the extended constraint set until the optimum of the objective function is greater than
