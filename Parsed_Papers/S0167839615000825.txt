                  A new equivalence notion between non-stationary subdivision schemes, termed asymptotic similarity, which is weaker than asymptotic equivalence, is introduced and studied. It is known that asymptotic equivalence between a non-stationary subdivision scheme and a convergent stationary scheme guarantees the convergence of the non-stationary scheme. We show that for non-stationary schemes reproducing constants, the condition of asymptotic equivalence can be relaxed to asymptotic similarity. This result applies to a wide class of non-stationary schemes.

                     . The main result of the present work is that for convergence analysis of non-stationary schemes reproducing constants, asymptotic equivalence can be replaced by the weaker notion of asymptotic similarity. We say that two schemes are asymptotically similar when

                      The class of subdivision schemes to which our result applies is wide and important from the application point of view. For instance, this class contains all uniform subdivision schemes generating spaces of exponential polynomials with one exponent equal to zero, and in particular all subdivision schemes for uniform splines in such spaces (Conti and Romani, 2011; Dyn et al., 2003). Besides their classical interest in geometric modeling and approximation theory, uniform exponential B-splines are very useful in Signal Processing (Conti et al., 2015; Unser and Blu, 2005) and in Isogeometric Analysis (Manni et al., 2011, 2014). In the latter context, exponential B-splines based subdivision schemes permit to successfully address the difficult evaluation of these splines.

The article is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 the analysis leading to the main result of this paper is presented. In Section 2 we derive a sufficient condition for the convergence of non-stationary schemes reproducing constants, in terms of difference schemes. This condition replaces the well-known necessary and sufficient condition for convergence in the stationary case. In Section 3 we introduce the asymptotic similarity relation (2) and develop some useful consequences for the analysis of non-stationary subdivision schemes. In particular, we show that, if two subdivision schemes reproduce constants, and if one of them satisfies the above-mentioned sufficient condition, so does the other. This fact is important for the proof of the convergence of non-stationary schemes reproducing constants by comparison (in the sense of (2)) with convergent stationary ones. Finally, in Section 4 we illustrate our result with non-stationary versions of the de Rham algorithm and of the four-point scheme.

As is well known, reproduction of constants is necessary for convergence of stationary subdivision schemes. Let us recall also the following major convergence result about the stationary case (see e.g. 
                     Dyn, 2002).

                           be a stationary subdivision scheme reproducing constants, with difference scheme 
                           
                              {

A similar necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of non-stationary subdivision schemes is not known. Nevertheless, a non-stationary version of the sufficient condition is given in Theorem 3 below.

                        The factorization (7) is valid for the difference of any two subdivision schemes reproducing constants since their symbols take the same value at −1 and 1, see (3). The rest of the claim readily follows from (7).  □

                        Remark 6
                        Different proofs of the fact that Condition A is sufficient for convergence already exist in the wider context of non-regular (i.e., non-uniform, non-stationary) schemes, using non-regular grids, either nested (Maxim and Mazure, 2004) or non-nested (Mazure, 2005, 2006). Nevertheless, we did consider it useful to give a simplified proof in the context of uniform schemes and regular grids. Indeed, in that case the proof is made significantly more accessible by the use of the corresponding classical tools.

By the locality of the two schemes, proving their asymptotic similarity simply consists in checking that

                        Remark 10
                        We would like to draw the reader's attention to the fact that we have not proved that, when two bounded non-stationary subdivision schemes reproducing constants are asymptotically similar, convergence of one of them implies convergence of the other. Convergence of the second scheme is obtained only when convergence of the first one results from Condition A. This follows from Proposition 9 and Theorem 3. This is actually sufficient to prove Theorem 11 below, which is the main application of all previous results.

We conclude this work with two examples illustrating the convergence claim in Theorem 11, and with an example showing the necessity of reproduction of constants in this theorem. In what follows we only write the non-zero elements of the masks.

The oldest instances of subdivision schemes are certainly the de Rham schemes (de Rham, 1956). Given a positive parameter γ, the associated de Rham scheme consists in placing on each segment of the polygonal line of any given level k, exactly two consecutive points of the next level, so that they divide this segment with ratios

Here too a very natural approach consists in trying not to keep the same parameter w at each level. This idea already appeared in Conti and Romani (2010), Levin (1999), Marinov et al. (2005), where even non-uniform versions of the four-point scheme were addressed. Let us limit ourselves to a uniform non-stationary four-point scheme, associated with a sequence of parameters

Non-stationary subdivision schemes are harder to analyze than their stationary counterparts. Analyzing them by comparison with a simpler scheme is quite a natural idea. Up to now, the main tool for such a comparison was the asymptotic equivalence, as developed in Dyn and Levin (1995), see also Dyn et al. (2007). In the present article, we have replaced it by asymptotic similarity, a simpler and weaker equivalence relation between non-stationary schemes. Our work presents a twofold interest. It was clearly important on the theoretical side to point out that asymptotic equivalence may be a too demanding requirement. Indeed, provided that it reproduces constants, a non-stationary scheme which is asymptotically similar to a convergent stationary one is convergent. Certainly, many among the known converging non-stationary schemes are asymptotically equivalent to stationary analogues. Still, we have presented two simple examples which show that asymptotic similarity can also be useful in the design of new converging non-stationary schemes.

To enhance the significance of asymptotic similarity, we would like to mention that this notion was first introduced for non-regular (non-uniform, non-stationary) schemes in Mazure (in press) (simply named there equivalence). However, the non-uniformity made it necessary to define it locally. In this non-regular framework, it proved to be a forceful tool to analyze not only the convergence of a subdivision scheme but also the regularity of the limit functions it produces. As pointed out by D. Levin, in the uniform setting, smoothness of the generated limits can be proved by combining asymptotic similarity with the notion of smoothing factors introduced in Dyn and Levin (1995).

Further results concerning asymptotic similarity for uniform non-stationary schemes can be found in Charina et al. (2015) along with several important extensions of this notion.
