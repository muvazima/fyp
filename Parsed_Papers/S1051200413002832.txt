                  The accuracy of pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs) suffers from various errors, such as the geometric error, numerical integration error, and discretization error. Moreover, the high order moments are vulnerable to numerical instability. In this paper, we present a method for the accurate calculation of PZMs which not only removes the geometric error and numerical integration error, but also provides numerical stability to PZMs of high orders. The geometric error is removed by taking the square-grids and arc-grids, the ensembles of which maps exactly the circular domain of PZMs calculation. The Gaussian numerical integration is used to eliminate the numerical integration error. The recursive methods for the calculation of pseudo-Zernike polynomials not only reduce the computation complexity, but also provide numerical stability to high order moments. A simple computational framework to implement the proposed approach is also discussed. Detailed experimental results are presented which prove the accuracy and numerical stability of PZMs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Zernike moments (ZMs) and pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs) belong to the class of circularly orthogonal moments based on Zernike polynomials (ZPs) and pseudo-Zernike polynomials (PZPs), respectively, defined on unit disk [1]. These moments have similar characteristics and both are widely used and studied in literature because of their minimum information redundancy and immunity to noise. Since ZMs are more numerically stable than PZMs and the computation cost of PZMs is more than ZMs for the same order, the latter is less discussed in literature. On the other hand, PZMs are observed to be more robust to image noise than ZMs 
                     [2], in addition to providing twice the number of moments as provided by ZMs for the same moment order. There are

                     , PZMs have more low-order moments than ZMs, therefore, PZMs are less sensitive to image noise than ZMs. Because of these attractive features of PZMs over ZMs, PZMs have been used in numerous image processing and pattern recognition applications such as optical character recognition [3], pattern classification [4,5], face recognition [6–9], content based image retrieval [10], image watermarking [11–13], audio watermarking [14], map matching [15], palmprint verification [16], edge detection [17], image reconstruction [18,19], etc.


                     PZMs suffer from various errors and high computation cost. There are four types of errors that affect the accuracy of PZPs. These are the geometric error, numerical integration error, finite precision error and discretization error. The geometric error occurs when a square image is mapped into a circular region and all pixels do not fall inside the circular region. The circular boundary is approximated by the square-grids. This results in a zig-zag pattern of the circular boundary, which is more discernible in small size images. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 1
                     , where Fig. 1(a) represents the original image grid and Fig. 1(b) is the approximation of the circular boundary of the image. A better approximation is given in Fig. 1(c), where all pixel grids that intersect with the circle and lie inside the circle are considered for the circular disk. This results in the exact mapping of the image that lies inside the circle. However, we have now two types of grids – the square-grids and the grids whose one of the boundaries is an arc of the circle, referred to as arc-grid throughout the paper. The ensembles of square-grids and arc-grids remove the geometric error completely. However, due to the complexity introduced by the arc-grids, only the configuration with square-grids as given in Fig. 1(b) is used for the computation of PZMs in the conventional method. The numerical integration error is caused when the two dimensional integration in moment calculation is approximated by the zeroth order summation. Liao and Pawlak [20] have analyzed these errors in detail for ZMs and an approach for the removal of numerical integration error using Simpson's method is also proposed. Another approach for the elimination of these errors for ZMs has also been proposed by Xin et al. [21] where ZMs are calculated in polar coordinates. Their approach, however, requires the interpolation of image pixels at the center of the circular grids. Another approach used by Wee and Paramesran [22] uses an outer circle, shown in Fig. 1(d), which completely encloses the square image for the removal of geometric error. Numerical integration error is removed by using the relationship of geometric moments and Zernike moments after calculating geometric moments accurately for the ensembles of the square-grids. The discretization and finite precision arithmetic error are generic to the discrete nature of the image function and the finite precision used by digital computers to represent a number with non-zero decimal part. While the discretization error can be reduced by resorting to various interpolation methods to represent the discrete image function in continuous form, the finite precision error is constrained by the provision to handle the real numbers with maximum value of precision available in programming language compilers. We emphasize this fact because it is recently observed by Singh et al. [23,24] that the direct calculation of ZMs is numerically unstable for high orders of moments, even for moment order greater than 45. On the other hand, they observed that the recursive methods are numerically stable for high orders of ZMs in addition to reducing the time complexity. There is no such analysis performed for PZMs. It is observed that in the case of PZMs the numerical instability starts occurring for moment order more than 22. Therefore, one requires the numerical stability analysis to be performed for PZMs also.

The higher order moments are required for better representation of an image and for its accurate reconstruction. In image watermarking, it is shown that moment order up to 26 is required for embedding one bit each in every moment if we want to embed at least 256 bits. However, moments with order higher than 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              max
                           
                        
                        =
                        22
                      cannot be calculated accurately [11]. It is known that low order moments contain less information about image detail, while high order moments are vulnerable to numerical instability and image noise. Therefore, accurate calculation of PZMs and numerical stability are very essential for numerous image processing applications.

It has been taken for granted in the literature that the computational aspects and characteristics of PZMs are similar to those of ZMs 
                     [24]. Recently, while using PZMs for some applications, we observed that this notion is not correct. While reconstructing the image using PZMs, we observed a major difference in the vicinity of the image center. One of the major differences in the characteristics of ZMs and PZMs is the nature of radial polynomials. The magnitude of the radial polynomials of the Zernike functions are bounded by one [24], while the radial polynomials of the pseudo-Zernike functions assume the value 
                        
                           
                              (
                              −
                              1
                              )
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                        (
                        p
                        +
                        1
                        )
                     , where p is the degree of the polynomial, as 
                        r
                        →
                        0
                     , i.e., in the vicinity of the center of the unit disk. This makes the PZMs numerically unstable for high order of moments. This is reflected in the abnormality of the reconstructed image in the neighborhood of the center of the disk for high orders of moments. No such abnormality is observed in the reconstructed images using ZMs 
                     [24]. Thus, the characteristics of the high order PZMs differ significantly from that of the ZMs. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the behaviors of PZMs with respect to geometric error and numerical integration error and their effects on their accuracy, numerical stability, rotation and scale invariance. It is the objective of the paper to analyze the geometric and numerical integration error and suggest ways to reduce them. We shall also analyze their relative contributions towards image reconstruction. The numerical instability and its causes are also discussed and analyzed.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the conventional approach of the computation of PZMs. Section 3 discusses the fast algorithms for the computation of radial polynomial and lays the foundation for the numerical stability and accurate calculation of the high order moments. The proposed approaches for the reduction of geometric and numerical integration errors are given in Section 4. Detailed experimental analysis is carried out in Section 5. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

                     [25,27] which is very high. Moreover, the computation of factorial terms, powers of r and trigonometric functions contribute significantly towards the slow speed. There are many approaches to enhance the speed [26]. Among them, the recursive methods are particularly much more useful than the other speed enhancement techniques. There are two categories of the recursive methods. The first category targets the fast computation of the factorial terms involved in Eq. (9). However, it still has the time complexity of the order

                        )
                     . The second category of recursive methods reduces the computation complexity of the radial polynomials to the order 
                        O
                        (

                        )
                     . Thus, the second category is more efficient. We present two techniques under this category. Both techniques provide equal time complexity when moments of all orders and repetitions up to a given order

                              max
                           
                        
                      are required to be computed. The first method, called q-recursive method [26] is, particularly, more efficient when moments of a given order but all repetitions are required. The second method, called p-recursive method [26,27], is useful when moments of a fixed repetition and different orders are required. Since we compute all moments up to the order 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              max
                           
                        
                     , we choose one of these methods (q-recursive) and in the rest of the paper, we refer this method as the recursive method. However, we present both methods as follows.

It is mentioned here that the p-recursive and q-recursive methods are the direct extension of the fast recursive methods developed by Chong et al. [28] for ZMs. The direct computation of PZMs of high orders is numerically unstable. It is observed that when

                        , the quality of reconstructed image becomes poor. The main cause of numerical instability in the direct calculation of PZMs is due to the presence of factorial terms in the calculation of radial polynomials. The recursive methods, on the other hand, provide better quality of reconstructed images indicating that they provide more stable results. Thus, all computations in this paper are performed through recursive method, except for the direct calculation of PZMs. The speed can further be enhanced by using 8-way symmetry for

Notwithstanding the improvement in the image reconstruction using recurrence relation, the abnormality observed in the vicinity of the center of the unit disk is a cause of concern on the accuracy of PZMs of high orders. We believe that the abnormality arises due to the numerical integration error caused by the zeroth order approximation. We reduce the numerical integration error by computing PZMs through numerical integration. The selection of a numerical integration method is very important from the angle of the number of sampling points required by the method, because the method which needs a small number of sampling points for a desired accuracy would be very useful as it will determine the overall speed of PZMs calculation. Gaussian integration is one of the best methods which requires approximately one fourth sampling points than Simpson's rule to achieve the same accuracy for two dimensional integration [29]. We rewrite Eq. (1) for the purpose of numerical integration in the following form

We propose to reduce the geometric error by considering both the square-grids which lie completely inside the circle, and the arc-grids which are generated due to the intersection of a square-grid with the circle, as shown in Fig. 2
                        . Thus, the ensembles of square-grids and arc-grids perfectly map the image into circular disk. Of course, the part of the square image that lies outside the circle will be left out in moment calculation.

Effect of numerical integration error and geometric error on the accuracy of PZMs computation and their relative contributions.

In all computations of PZMs, it is assumed that the image function 
                        f
                        (

                              i
                           
                        
                        ,

                      is a constant over the grid (
                        i
                        ,
                        k
                     ). The PZMs computed by 
                        5

                      Gaussian numerical integration with circular disk consisting of both the square-grids and arc-grids are referred to as exact PZMs.

The experiments are conducted on

                         Lena image which has high contrast of gray values. Fig. 3

                         represents the reconstructed images using various methods and different moment orders

                        . Column 2 of Fig. 4 depicts the reconstructed images when we apply Eq. (4) for the zeroth order approximation for computing PZMs by evaluating

                         using the radial polynomials in Eq. (3). This method is referred to as direct method. This shows that the direct method of the computation of PZMs is highly unstable and it is observed that for

                         the magnitude of PZMs assume high values. The reconstructed images shown in column 3, obtained by using the recursive method for the computation of PZPs through Eqs. (13), (14) and (15), are numerically stable except in the vicinity of the center of the circle. The instability is reflected through white spots around the center of the circle and it increases with the increase of the moment order 
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 max
                              
                           
                        . The results shown in columns 4 and 5 depict the relative contribution of the geometric error and numerical integration error towards image reconstruction, respectively. It is seen that there is very little improvement due to the removal of geometric error when we compare the reconstructed images of columns 3 and 4. On the other hand, the quality of reconstructed images shown in column 5 is far better than that of columns 3 and 4. There is no white spot in the vicinity of the center of the circle. This establishes that the major cause of error in the calculation of PZMs is the numerical integration error. This is further elaborated when we compare the reconstructed images of column 5 and column 6. The reconstructed images in column 5 are free from numerical integration error but contain geometric error, while those in column 6 are plotted after removing both errors. There is not much difference between these two sets of images. Table 1

                         for various methods reveal that the effect of numerical integration error is much stronger than the geometric error, and the recursive method provides numerical stability even for very high orders of moment. In order to represent the overall error, we use twelve benchmark gray scale images of size 
                           256
                           ×

                         pixels plotted in Fig. 5
                        , normally used in image processing applications [22]. These images are resized to

                        . It is seen that ε decreases consistently for the case when numerical integration error is reduced. The effect of geometric error is somewhat noticeable only for moment orders

The effect of the order of numerical integration on the performance of reconstructed image quality through average reconstruction error, ε, is depicted in Fig. 8
                        . Theoretically, the higher is the order of numerical integration, the more accuracy in the computation of PZMs is expected. However, it is seen from the figure that the Gaussian numerical integration of the order 
                           5
                           ×
                           5
                         is sufficient to provide accurate results. The higher order integration sometimes does not perform well. We observe that when

                         is between 30 and 50, a 
                           5
                           ×
                           5
                        –numerical integration yields less value of ε than that obtained by a 
                           6
                           ×
                           6
                        –numerical integration. The reason for inaccuracy for higher order of integration is due to the involvement of more number of sampling points and hence more computation. There are 36 sampling points for a 
                           6
                           ×

                        -numerical integration, whereas for a

                           ×
                           5
                        -numerical integration only 25 points are involved. Since the computation of PZMs involves a lot of arithmetic operations, higher number of sampling points generates more amount of numerical error due to finite precision arithmetic than reducing the amount of numerical integration error. As a result, one can confidently use 
                           5

                        , i.e., moment orders up to 50, a good tradeoff between the computation complexity and accuracy would be a

                        -numerical integration which requires the calculation of PZPs only at 9 sampling points in comparison to 25 sampling points required by 
                           5
                           ×
                           5
                        -numerical integration. If we further reduce the order of numerical integration to 
                           2
                           ×
                           2
                        , then the accuracy of PZMs is affected significantly even for

                           30
                        . The recursive algorithms are not only helpful for reducing the time complexity, they provide numerical stability as well.

One of the major advantages of using numerical integration is its ability to reduce geometric error without considering the arc-grids. This is explained as follows.

The values in column 7 are obtained when only the numerical integration error is removed while the values in column 8 are obtained after removing both errors. Thus, it is observed that even without using arc-grids the moments can be calculated with very high accuracy using

(24) subject to the inequality (25) which are in a form similar to the direct form given in Eq. (4). The extra computational overheads are compensated by using recursive form for the computation of

                         which is the minimum among all other methods. Referring to Fig. 9 and Fig. 6, when we want to have a good tradeoff between the accuracy of PZMs and time complexity, it is observed that the recursive method with zeroth order approximation can be used when moment orders up to

An important property of PZMs is their magnitude invariance to image rotation. However, due to the presence of the geometric error and numerical integration error, this property is affected. In order to analyze the effects of these errors on rotation invariance, we conduct experiments on two sets of images, one for 
                              64
                              ×
                              64
                            pixels and the second for 
                              256
                              ×
                              256
                            pixels. For this purpose, all twelve benchmark images are resized to 
                              64
                              ×
                              64
                            pixels. The effect of moment orders is also studied by taking 
                              
                                 
                                    p

                           , 20, 30 and 40. These images are rotated with an interval of 10°, starting from 0° to 90°. Rotations beyond 90° are not needed because they provide symmetrical patterns about x- or y-axis, and hence their results are identical.

In order to evaluate quantitatively the effect of rotation, we define mean square error, MSE, of PZMs magnitudes as

Hence, the curves showing these values overlap. At higher orders, the direct method is numerically unstable, hence we do not show it in Figs. 10(c), 10(d), 11(c), and 11(d). We observe the following phenomena.

At low order of moments, the geometric error plays a major role than the numerical integration error in affecting the rotation invariance property. The trend is reversed for high orders of moment.

                                    , the value of average MSE is much less which lies between 0.05 and 0.06 for the accurate method. In fact, even in the presence of these errors, the maximum value of MSE also drops significantly, which shows that the effect of geometric error and numerical integration error reduces with the increase in image size.

It is thus clear from the above observations that the proposed accurate solution for PZMs provides significant improvement in the rotation invariance property, and that the effect of geometric error is much more than the numerical integration error at low orders of moment. This trend is reversed for high orders of moment. Further, as the image size is increased, the accurate PZMs exhibit better rotation invariance.

Scale invariance is another important characteristic of PZMs. Since PZMs are computed on a unit disk after mapping a digital image of a given size, it is expected that the magnitude of moments must be scale invariant. However, due to various errors and discrete nature of the image function the scale invariance is affected. The twelve benchmark images of the size

Like rotation, the average MSE values for the zeroth order using direct and recursive methods are approximately the same for low orders and hence they are represented by the same curve. At higher orders, the MSE values for the direct method are numerically unstable, therefore, these values are not shown in Figs. 12(c) and 12(d). It is shown that the scale invariance of PZMs for scaling factor less than 1.0 is poor as compared to the higher scales. This trend is due to the fact that at lower image resolution, the number of sampling points is much less than that at the higher resolution. The radial kernel function has

                            is not adequately represented by the sampling points at low resolution. As the resolution increases, the high variation in function values is well taken care of by the large number of sampling points. Again, the accurate method for PZMs calculation provides much better results than the zeroth order approximation. As in the case of rotation, the effect of geometric error in scaling is also much less than numerical integration error. This trend is clear from these figures by comparing average MSE. The average MSE for the case when only geometric error is removed is much more than the average MSE when numerical integration error is removed. The effect of geometric error is more pronounced at scaling factor less than one. It is also clear form these figures that the higher is the order of moment, the more is the difference between average MSE values of these two cases. It is worth mentioning here that the above scale invariance results are presented for uniform scaling. For non-uniform scaling, the original square image will turn into a rectangular image, for which a different kind of mapping will be needed. We shall analyze this issue in our future work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The PZMs are effective region based shape descriptors. They are derived from a set of orthogonal and complete basis functions. The magnitudes of PZMs are invariant to image rotation and with some transformation, they can be made translation and scale invariant. The PZMs are more robust to image noise than other orthogonal rotation invariant moments. However, their properties are compromised due to various errors, such as the geometric error, numerical integration error and discretization error. Moreover, they are vulnerable to numerical instability at high orders of moment. In addition, computation of PZMs is very slow. It is shown in this paper that the accuracy of PZMs is severely affected by the presence of these errors which is reflected in poor quality of reconstructed images and rotation invariance property of PZMs magnitude. We reduce these errors and provide numerically stable moments for high orders. The numerical integration error is removed by using Gaussian numerical integration. The geometric error is removed by considering the arc-grids on the circular boundary and the numerical stability to high order moments is achieved by using recursive algorithms which also reduce computation complexity. Relative contributions of geometric error and numerical integration error on the accuracy of PZMs are also analyzed. It is shown that the numerical integration error plays a major role towards the overall error present in the computation of PZMs. Geometric error is crucial only in small size images, that is images with size less than

                      pixels. Extensive experimental results prove that the proposed method provides very accurate PZMs which results in the improved quality of reconstructed images and the rotation invariance property of PZMs magnitude. A simple form of computational framework for the proposed method is also discussed which turns out to be as simple as the conventional form of PZMs calculation.
