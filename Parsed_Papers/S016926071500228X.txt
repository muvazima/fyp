                  An innovative computer-assisted diagnosis system for chronic heart failure (CHF) was proposed in this study, based on cardiac reserve (CR) indexes extraction, heart sound hybrid characteristics extraction and intelligent diagnosis model definition. Firstly, the modified wavelet packet-based denoising method was applied to data pre-processing. Then, the CR indexes such as the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration (D/S) and the amplitude ratio of the first to second heart sound (S1/S2) were extracted. The feature set consisting of the heart sound characteristics such as multifractal spectrum parameters, the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak of the normalized PSD curve (f
                     
                        PSDmax) and adaptive sub-band energy fraction (sub
                     _
                     EF) were calculated based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), maximum entropy spectra estimation (MESE) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Statistical methods such as t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to analyze the difference of each parameter between the healthy and CHF patients. Finally, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) was employed for the implementation of intelligent diagnosis. The result indicates the achieved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system are 95.39%, 96.59% and 93.75% for the detection of CHF, respectively. The selected cutoff values of the diagnosis features are D/S
                     =1.59, S1/S2=1.31, Δα
                     =1.34 and f
                     
                        PSDmax
                     =22.49, determined by ROC curve analysis. This study suggests the proposed methodology could provide a technical clue for the CHF point-of-care system design and be a supplement for CHF diagnosis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Chronic heart failure (CHF) occurs in the situation that heart loses the ability to pump adequate oxygen-rich blood to meet the need of peripheral tissues and organs of the body. This may cause some symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, irregular heartbeats, etc. Compared to the expensive imageological diagnosis and biochemical analysis, it is of great significance to develop a non-invasive, low-cost and convenient detection method for CHF diagnosis.

Many researchers have devoted themselves to the studies on computer-assisted diagnosis for CHF based on the detection and analysis of Electrocardiograph (ECG). Ivanov et al. [1,2] and Dutta [3] have found there are both a loss of multifractality in heartbeat sequences and ECG of the patients with CHF. The prolongation duration of QRS or wide QRS/T angles could be a predictive indicator of CHF [4,5]. Skrabal et al. [6] used ECG detection combined with bio-impedance measurement technique to diagnose CHF. However, ECG can only detect the cardiac chronotropic and dromotropic action instead of the cardiac inotropic action that is reduced significantly in CHF patients [7], so it can be seen that single ECG detection for the diagnosis of CHF is insufficient.

Heart sound is very important as it directly reflects the mechanical properties of heart activity [8,9]. The studies on the relationship between heart sound and cardiac contractility indicate that the amplitude of the first heart sound (S1) is positively correlated with the maximum rise rate of left ventricular pressure (r
                     =0.9551, p
                     <0.001) and the amplitude of S1 is also closely related to the strength of cardiac contractility [10,11]. This has suggested that the amplitude of S1 can reflect the level of cardiac contractility. The most important aspect of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure is not the depressed cardiac performance observed at basal resting state but rather the loss of cardiac reserve (CR) [12,13], which is manifested in the decrease of cardiac contractility, so the detection and analysis of heart sound and the measurement of CR could provide important clues for the diagnosis of CHF. Based on the relationship between heart sound and cardiac contractility, an noninvasive and quantitative method for the assessment of CR has been proposed by our group [14,15]. Some diagnostic techniques such as real-time transmission of the phonocardiogram (PCG) through the Internet and computer-assisted auscultation were developed [16,17]. The application of CR indexes in monitoring and evaluating heart function for gestational woman was implemented [18]. However, until now, the studies about the application of CR in the diagnosis of CHF have not been reported, and the utilizations of heart sound characteristics for the diagnosis of CHF are few, except that an appearance of the third heart sound is regard as a highly specific and none sensitive marker for the diagnosis of CHF [19,20].

In this paper, an intelligent diagnosis system for CHF diagnosis was proposed, the schematic of which is shown in Fig. 1
                     . It consists of acquisition system (hardware) and decision support system (software). The acquisition system includes sensor, acquisition circuit and computer device shown in Fig. 2
                     . The decision support system is embedded in the computer. This paper emphatically introduces the decision support system that includes the following parts. The preprocessing is implemented based on amplitude normalization and modified wavelet packet denoising methods. The CR indexes such as the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration (D/S) and the amplitude ratio of the first to second heart sound (S1/S2) combined with three heart sound characteristics such as the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak of the normalized PSD curve (f
                     
                        PSDmax), adaptive sub-band energy fraction (sub
                     _
                     EF) and multifractal spectrum parameter were proposed to structure a diagnostic feature set. The self-developed cardiac reserve monitor software (CRM version1.0, Chongqing University and Bo-Jing Medical Informatics Institute, China) was used to measure the CR indexes, and the heart sound characteristics were extracted based on maximum entropy spectra estimation (MESE), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) methods which are good at the analysis of non-stationary and non-linear physiological signal [21–23]. The LS-SVM was determined as the classifier of proposed system by the comparison of performances with back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and hidden markov model (HMM). A dataset collected from the healthy volunteers and CHF patients was used to verify the proposed system. In addition, statistical analysis methods such as t-test and ROC curve were conducted to suggest the diagnosis thresholds. The purpose of our study is to explore a new effective computer-assisted diagnosis technique for the diagnosis of CHF.

The outline of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the detail of proposed diagnostic system including the methodologies of preprocessing, feature extraction and identification. Section 3 represents the statistical result of CR indexes and heart sound characteristics and the comparison of diagnostic performance among LS-SVM, BP-ANN and HMM. Section 4 discusses the differences of diagnostic indexes and characteristics between the healthy and CHF patients as well as the advantage and limitation of the proposed system. Section 5 gives the conclusion and future work of the study. The methodology framework of this paper is shown in Fig. 3

The subjects consist of 88 healthy volunteers (college students and teachers) as controls and 64 CHF patients, who knew and signed the informed consent forms. The patients with CHF include the patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which are confirmed by the experienced cardiologists. The CHF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than 50% are considered as the patients with HFpEF, and the others are considered as the patients with HFrEF [24], shown in Table 1
                        . LVEF was calculated by the modified Simpson's rule through echocardiography examine using a color Doppler Ultrasound medical machine (Vivid-7, GE company, USA). One minute heart sound was recorded from the apex position of each subject in rest state by employing the self-developed cardiac reserve monitor (11,025Hz sampling frequency and 8-bit resolution) shown in Fig. 2. The normal and pathological heart sound samples were gathered at Chongqing University and the First and the Second Affiliated Hospitals of Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, respectively.

The CR indexes such as S1/S2 and D/S were employed to evaluate cardiac function noninvasively [14], which denote the amplitude ratio of the first to the second heart sound (S2) and the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration in a cardiac cycle, illustrated in Fig. 4
                        . The S1/S2 and D/S indexes are relative indicators used to evaluate the cardiac contractility reserve which can reflect the relationship between left ventricular systolic function and peripheral circulation and appraise whether cardiac blood perfusion time is sufficient or not during diastole, respectively [15]. The CR indexes were measured by CRM software shown in Fig. 5
                        .

Normalization is necessary to eliminate the amplitude differences of heart sound signals caused by the different chest wall thickness of subjects. It aims to maintain the amplitudes of the normalized heart sound signals from −1 to 1, and is operated as:

It is necessary to reduce the disturbance in heart sound singals that could cause great influence on the diagnosis performance [25]. Wavelet packet-based noise reduction has been proven effective to remove the disturbance introduced during the data gathering process such as the interferences of the background-noise, power and respiratory sounds [26]. In this study, we proposed a modified wavelet packet-based denoising method where the threshold estimation and calculation have been improved. Both the low and high frequency components of heart sound signal were decomposed to obtain the relevant approximate coefficients and detail coefficients by a Daubechies-10 wavelet at 8th level, and then the improved soft threshold model was employed to alter the detail coefficients of each decomposition level, according to following principle:

Because of the superiority that differentiates between multifractal properties of the heart rate in the healthy people and patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction [27], MF-DFA method, which implements an overall (localized or integral) multi-scale detection of multifractal behavior, proposed by Kantelhard et al. [28], was utilized to calculate the multifractal spectrum of heart sound correspondingly. Firstly, the sum of squares of deviations of x(i) is computed as:

EMD technique developed by Huang et al. [31] is an adaptive method that can break down any nonlinear or nonstationary time series such as biomedical signals into a number of amplitude and frequency modulated components each called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Unlike Fourier and wavelet-based analysis methods, EMD does not require any a priori known basis function and is widely used to analyze biomedical signals. The signal can be expressed using IMFs as follows:

                           . The aim of EMD is to decompose a signal into a sum of adaptive bandwidth IMFs based on the adaptively defined basis functions with well-defined frequency localization levels. Then, we obtain the correlation between each IMF and the original signal x(i) by computing the Pearson's correlation coefficient as follows:

LS-SVM method firstly proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle [33] is an effective approch especially to solve the problems of prediction and classification on artificial intelligence. It solves a set of linear equations so as to avoid solving high-computational-cost quadratic programming problem [34]. By using an appropriate kernel function (KF), LS-SVM maps the input data into a high dimensional state space where an optimal separating hyperplane can separate the different classes linearly.

                        .

The statistical results of heart sound characteristics and CR indexes were expressed as mean±standard deviation. Student's t-test was implemented to analyze whether statistical differences of those exist between the control and CHF groups. A value of p less than 0.05 was considered as a statistical difference. ROC curve analysis was used to select the diagnosis thresholds for distinguishing the control from CHF groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was employed as a performance measurement for the supervised classification in this study. The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software (version 18.0) [36].

@&#RESULTS@&#

LVEF is a worldwide acknowledged index to reflect the differences of heart pump function between the healthy and people with CHF [37]. It was just used to verify the diagnosis of CHF in this study. CR indexes extracted from the healthy volunteers and CHF patients are listed in Table 3
                        . The D/S and S1/S2 values of control group are higher than those of CHF group, while the HR values of the control group are lower.


                        Table 4
                         presents the calculated results of multifractal spectrum parameters. The width of multifractal spectrum Δα, which is related to the degree of multifractality [3], is obtained by calculating the distance between the α values in the starting and ending points of the curve shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the CHF group, the heart sounds from the control group with a larger Δα have a stronger degree of multifractality.

                         shows the normalized PSD curves of heart sounds for a healthy subject (left panel) and CHF patient (right panel). It is found that the normalized PSDs of both groups are distributed concentratedly on the low frequency range of less than 150Hz. The calculated results of f
                        
                           PSDmax and sub

                        . For the control group, the average f
                        
                           PSDmax is 30.82±3.23Hz, which is higher than that of the CHF group. It is also found that the distributions of the adaptive sub
                        _
                        EFs of the heart sounds from the two groups are similar and the biggest sub

                        EF appear in the IMF2 for the control and CHF groups.

A dataset consisting of 152 heart sound samples was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the proposed technique, and it is divided equally into the training and testing sets. The average classification accuracy obtained from the double-fold cross validation was taken as the diagnostic accuracy. The feature vector set consisting of the CR indexes and heart sound characteristics described in Table 6
                         was used as the input of LS-SVM for the intelligent diagnosis. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, the diagnostic performance of the LS-SVM-based proposed system has been compared with that of BP-ANN and HMM -based methods. The selected structures for HMM, BP-ANN and LS-SVM are shown in Table 2. The performance comparison of the systems with different classifier is represented in Table 7
                        . It is noted that the proposed system achieves 95.39% diagnostic accuracy, 96.59% sensitivity and 93.75% specificity which are 11.18%, 11.36% and 10.94% higher than BP-ANN-based system and 13.80%, 13.64% and 14.07% higher than HMM-based system.

The t-test result of CR indexes, cardiac function indexes and heart sound characteristics are vividly described by histogram in Fig. 9
                        , which are statistically significant (p
                        <0.05). ROC curves analysis provides selected cutoff values for each significant feature parameter such as D/S, S1/S2, Δα and f
                        
                           PSDmax, which could be employed as reference diagnosis threshold for the cardiologists to verify the automatic diagnosis result. It is shown in Fig. 10
                         that the selected cutoff values with the best sensitivity and specificity for the identification of CHF were determined by Youden index (

                        . AUC as a common indicator of quality measures the degree of accuracy in the ROC curve analysis. The p value shows the ability of each feature parameter to discriminate the control from CHF groups. The smaller the p value is, the better the performance of ROC curve is.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Cardiac reserve is regarded as an important physiological function base of the fitness and exercise performance of human beings [38]. This paper has investigated the differences of CR indexes between the healthy and CHF patients. D/S value is the time index of heart perfusion reserve, and it emphasizes the significance of the appropriate ratio of diastole to systole duration to maintain the healthy function of heart pump [15]. Because the most part of coronary blood flow occurs during the diastole of each cardiac cycle [39], higher D/S denotes a healthy myocardial perfusion status. However, CHF could result in either the left ventricular diastolic or systolic dysfunction so that the left ventricular filling is insufficient and myocardial blood flow perfusion reduces, thus the CHF group has a lower D/S values than control group in the rest state. S1/S2 reflects cardiac contractility reserve. It has been proven that the amplitudes of S1 and S2 are closely related to cardiac contractility and the peripheral resistance, respectively [11,40]. In the condition of CHF, the heart with a malfunction of pump function cannot transport abundant rich-oxygen blood to ensure the need of peripheral tissues, and it manifests a reduction of cardiac contractility during systole of each cardiac cycle. The blood stroke with a smaller kinetic energy could suffer from a greater peripheral resistance compared to the healthy condition. As a result, the S1/S2 values of the CHF group are decreased compared to control group. Furthermore, the decreased S1/S2 is also observed in the patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction [41]. This report can support the result we obtained.

To our knowledge, this paper is the first report on multifractal analysis of heart sounds collected from the healthy people and CHF patients. Furthermore, the multifractal nature of heart sound has only been utilized to distinguish prolapsed mitral valve from healthy heart [42], and few studies on multifractal analysis of heart sound have been reported so far. The existence of multifractal spectrum demonstrates the evidence of multifractality in the heart sounds from healthy people and CHF patients. According to the relationship between Δα and the degree of multifractality [3], we have discovered that the multifractal nature has a loss in the heart sounds of CHF patients, and the same loss can be found in ECG and heartbeat interval series of the CHF patient [1,3]. It is because that the changes of myocardial mechanical properties caused by CHF could influence cardiac electrophysiology directly by the process of mechano-electric feedback [43].

The shapes of normalized PSD curves and f
                        
                           PSDmax values of the CHF and control groups are discrepant due to the different cardiac hemodynamic process. The sub
                        _
                        EFs show that the energy distribution of heart sound concentrates mainly on the low frequency component, which is be similar to the spectral distribution that main frequency range of heart sound focus on S1 and S2 [44,45]. Although the biggest sub
                        _
                        EF appears in the IMF2 for the control and CHF groups, the sub
                        _
                        EFs of the control group in IMF1 and IMF2 are higher while in IMF3, IMF4 and IMF5 they are lower, compared to those of the CHF group. This indicates the signal energy distribution of heart sounds from the CHF patients mainly concentrates IMF2, IMF3 and IMF4 while that of the control group just concentrates IMF2 and IMF3. The reason could be that the reduced intensity of S1 caused by depressed cardiac contractility leads to the decreased percentage of S1 energy fraction.

The advantages of our system are found in two aspects such as the choices of diagnosis characteristics and classifier. Firstly, the diagnosis features consist of CR indexes and heart sound characteristics, which can not only contain the physiological and pathological information in cardiac activity but also reflect the differences of heart sound signals in morphology, time-frequency domain and energy. This is different from the reports referring to heart sound feature extraction [22,46,47]. Secondly, the selected LS-SVM classifier is superior to BP-ANN and HMM in this study. It is mainly shown in the following aspects: the LS-SVM costs a shorter training time for reaching an optimum structure [48]. The LS-SVM was trained based on a convex optimization problem so as to be estimated a global solution, but the BP-ANN cannot reach one global solution due to the initial weights are randomly selected [49,50]. The LS-SVM also can avoid suffering from local minimum mistakes and the overfitting more successfully than BP-ANN and HMM [51]. Finally, the result of contrast experiment shown in Table 7 indicates the performance of LS-SVM is better than that of BP-ANN and HMM. As a result, our proposed system with LS-SVM classifier has the advantage of simple structure, global optimum and strong generalization ability. In this study, we did not consider the subjects with heart murmurs, so if a heart sound sample with murmurs was input the system, the methodology would report misclassification. However, the shortcoming will be solved by training the classifier with the corresponding dataset. In the future, different categories of sample examples will be used to train the classifier so as to improve the diagnosis performance. The proposed intelligent diagnosis system applied to the diagnosis of multiple diseases is an important and worthwhile research subject, and large sample data need to be collected to train the diagnosis model. This is also the main research direction in our future work in spite of challengeable work.

                        PSDmax and adaptive sub
                     _
                     EF are constituted diagnosis features as the input of classifier. A dataset collected from the healthy volunteers and CHF patients was used to verify the proposed system. The LS-SVM classifier with satisfactory accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was selected through the comparison with BP-ANN and HMM. In addition, student's t-test was performed to examine the difference of each diagnosis feature between the two groups. The ROC curve analysis was used to determine the selected cutoff values for CHF identification, which suggests the CR indexes and heart sound characteristics as auxiliary diagnostic indicators could be supplement for CHF diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is also the first study on the analysis of the heart sounds applied to the diagnosis of CHF.

In the future, the planning work should involve the following aspects. More samples should be investigated to establish a diagnosis model for CHF. The physiological significance corresponding to the changes of indexes should be explored in great depth. The ultimate purpose is to popularize the useful indexes in clinical application. This study suggests that heart sound could provide effective clues for the diagnosis of CHF.
