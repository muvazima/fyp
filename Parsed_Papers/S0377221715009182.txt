                  Usually, in order to summarize various opinions about a particular situation (mainly product or service valuation on Internet) a process called aggregation is used. This process basically consists of determining the appropriate value to represent the majority's opinion and many strategies and operators can be used for this purpose. Simple arithmetic mean is widely used to resume several opinions in a single value, but this value is generally not representative or it is affected by the extreme values. An alternative to aggregate opinions are the Ordered Weighting Averaging (OWA) operators. Nevertheless, they have distribution problems when applied to aggregates with cardinalities. These problems may be solved by using Majority Additive OWA (MA-OWA) operator, a sort of arithmetic mean of arithmetic means. MA-OWA operator works adequately but, in some cases, discards the minority's opinion, specifically when it does not coincide with the largest cardinality value. In order to generalize the usage of MA-OWA operator, the rest of opinions are taken into account using a Cardinality Relevance Factor. This paper introduces a Selective Majority Additive OWA (SMA-OWA) which manages the significance of all opinions varying the Cardinality Relevance Factor. Mathematical extension of SMA-OWA, its properties and some illustrative examples are presented in this article.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many situations of e-commerce, such as buying a book, selecting a video camera, booking a hotel room, etc., imply decisions based on information provided by other customers. Similarly, selecting candidates for a senior position, voting a law, rating a news item in a newspaper (with the reader's point of view), measuring popularity, deciding on the restructuring of local government, etc., are activities that make it desirable to have a consensus value from everyone's opinion. In general aggregation process, finding a suitable value to represent the majority's opinion is not an easy task. Frequently, individual opinions are summarized in a single value by using an arithmetic mean. Although for many cases this mechanism allows to obtain a good idea of quality or adequateness of certain product or measure the representativeness of different candidates, there are others whose aggregated values are not representative of the majority's opinion.

Aggregation appears in many applications related to the development of intelligent systems, such as multi-criteria decision making, fuzzy group decision making (Yan & Ma, 2015), fuzzy logic controllers or fuzzy systems modeling (Fodor & Roubens, 1994; Yager & Filev, 1994).

This reduction of individual values into a representative value or a consensual judgment or the majority's opinion (Pasi & Yager, 2003) is not trivial. In order to face the mentioned problem several operators such as weighted means, quasi-weighted means (Xu & Da, 2004), ordered weighted averaging (OWA) (Yager, 1988) and their families (Yager, 1993) have been proposed. However, OWA operators for generalizing majorities are conditioned to the use of α-cuts of dual strictly monotonic OWA operators (Llamazares, 2004).

Specifically, in multi-agent decision making it is often necessary to count on an overall opinion which synthesizes that of the majority of the decision makers. In the fuzzy approaches to multi-agent decision making, the concepts of consensus and majority are modeled using computing with words (Herrera, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Peláez & Doña, 2003a), i.e., by means of linguistic quantifiers, linguistic terms (Massanet, Riera, Torrens, & Herrera-Viedma, 2014) and linguistic preferences (Alonso, Pérez, Cabrerizo, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013) fuzzy concepts referred to the quantity of elements of given reference sets (Kacprzyk, Nurmi, & Fedrizzi, 1997) operators that introduce individual and group quantification strategies (Peláez & Doña, 2006; Yager, 1996) and models for heterogeneous group decision making problems guided by the heterogeneity criterion (Pérez, Cabrerizo, Alonso, & Herrera-Viedma, 2014) and granulation of the linguistic terms (Cabrerizo, Herrera-Viedma, & Pedrycz, 2013).

Although OWA operators are widely used for aggregation, some of their analysis for modeling the majority concept show that usual definition of OWA operators based on linguistic quantifiers does not capture the semantics of a consensus (Peláez, Doña, & Gómez-Ruiz, 2007). To summarize the majority's opinion, several approaches have been proposed (Pasi & Yager, 2003; Peláez, 2001). For example, Yager and Filev (Yager & Filev, 1999) define the induced ordering weighted averaging (IOWA) operators, which obtain a scalar value for a majority's opinion, and Pasi and Yager (2003) use the vague concept of majority's opinion (fuzzy majority) as a fuzzy subset. Also, in Bustince, Jurio, Pradera, Mesiar, and Beliakov (2013) a generalization of the weighted voting method used in the exploitation phase of decision making problems with preference relations has been recently proposed.

Summarizing, the direct use of conventional OWA operators, repeating the elements with cardinality larger than unity, does not always produce reasonable results, and distribution problems, such as cake-cutting problems may appear (Peláez & Doña, 2003b). In fact, most common aggregation operators overemphasize the opinion of the minority at the expense of that of the majority. To solve this problem, Majority Additive OWA (MA-OWA) operators have been introduced (Peláez & Doña, 2003b). These operators use a weight vector which depends on the cardinalities of the aggregates, and can be interpreted as an arithmetic mean of arithmetic means. A linguistic aggregation extension of these operators has also been introduced in (Peláez & Doña, 2003a).

Even though MA-OWA operator obtains more accurate results than other operators, they present quick convergence to the value with the largest cardinality (Peláez & Doña, 2003b). I.e., when the cardinality of an element from the rest excessively grows, its weight tends to one and the other weights tend to zero. In order to face this issue, this paper introduces and describes the Selective Majority Additive OWA (SMA-OWA), which allows choosing the importance given to the largest cardinality. Section 2 briefly reviews the class of OWA and MA-OWA operators, stating the notation used for the rest of this manuscript. In Section 3, the formulation and some illustrative examples of SMA-OWA proposed operator are presented. In addition, two alternatives to determine the value of the Cardinality Relevance Factor are proposed. In Section 4, the use of SMA-OWA operator is validated by using: (a) the usual properties required for an aggregation operator, (b) the weights decomposition process used to explain the way they increase or decrease their values and (c) an exhaustive analysis over a real study case. Finally, conclusions and future works are summarized in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.

Aggregation operators are special real functions with inputs from a subdomain 
                        I
                      of the real line. The basic feature of all aggregation functions is their non-decreasing, monotonicity and boundary conditions. The increase of input values cannot decrease the output values and they are aggregated in the same scale of input values, respectively.

                         In fact, OWA operators have been characterized by the operators which satisfy the properties of commutativity, monotonicity, stability for the same positive linear transformations and ordered linkage. The definition of the last two properties, another characterization, and the corresponding proofs can be found in (Fodor, Marichal, & Roubens, 1995), being omitted here for brevity.

An OWA operator is neat if its value does not depend on the ordering of the aggregates, i.e.,

It can be easily shown that the properties of idempotency, commutativity and max–min boundedness, also hold for weight-dependent OWA operators. However, the monotonicity property is generally lost.


                        Peláez and Doña (2003b) have introduced a new neat weight-dependent OWA operator, referred to as the majority additive OWA (MA-OWA) operator, which generalizes the arithmetic mean when the items to aggregate have cardinalities larger than one. The MA-OWA operator is a kind of arithmetic mean of arithmetic means. The idea behind MA-OWA operators is the repetition of the following procedure until a fixed point is found: given the set of values with corresponding cardinalities a new set is obtained from them, in which the aggregate (using the arithmetic mean) of the values is included with cardinality equal to one, and simultaneously the cardinalities of the rest of the values are reduced by one. By construction, this procedure always finishes resulting in a set with only one element.

Note that k factor represents the current cardinality considered at the moment of aggregation process. For example, for 
                           
                              k

                              2
                           
                         aggregates with cardinality equal to or greater than 2 are considered. The current arithmetic mean is calculated using these aggregates and the arithmetic mean calculated in the previous step.

                        . Obviously, the maxness and dispersion of MA-OWA operators can be arbitrary, depending on the cardinalities of the aggregates.

It can be easily shown that the properties of idempotency, commutativity and max-min boundedness, also hold for MA-OWA operators. However, the monotonicity property is preserved only if the cardinality vector is exactly the same in both aggregate sets, i.e.,

                        Examples 2 and 3 show more accurate results than arithmetic mean if cardinalities are considered using MA-OWA operator.

MA-OWA operators represent the most typical opinion with larger aggregated cardinality instead of the majority's opinion, as claimed in Peláez and Doña (2003b). The minority's opinion must be partially taken into account by the majority's opinion, but MA-OWA aggregators eliminate it completely if the cardinality of the most typical opinion is larger than that of the rest.

Also Yager (1988) defined two important measures associated with an OWA operator. The maxness measure can be calculated with the following formula:

                         is calculated by using the notation introduced in the new definition of the SMA-OWA operators. In Table 2
                        , the upper row shows the values to be aggregated, the second row shows the cardinalities, the subsequent matrix represents the values of γ
                        
                           j, k
                        , and the last column shows the values uk
                         in Eqs. (26), (27), (28), (29) and (30).

The cardinal-dependent weights are calculated using the recursive form as follows:

SMA-OWA introduces a new issue about majority: the importance assigned to different opinions. In this way, situations where all opinions must be considered can be modeled more accurately.

The correct determination of the CRF is a primary aspect to be considered when using SMA-OWA operator. For Example 2, the obtaining results are shown in Table 3
                         (varying the CRF from 0.7 to 1.0).

In both examples, the proximity of values of FSMA
                         to the majority's opinion can be observed (Tables 3 and 4
                        ), when δ → 1. For Example 2, in this set of aggregates the largest cardinality value is 0.7 and, clearly, the obtained results differ when δ decreases. The same behavior is observed for Example 3.
                     

For Example 4 the obtained results are shown in Table 5
                        . Here, the obtained weight for value 0.9 is equal to 0 when 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         and its influence over result of aggregation is null. To see the evolution of aggregation process, a complete variation of δ is proposed. Results are summarized in Table 6
                         and Fig. 1.
                     

In this case, cardinality of value 0.05 is 70 and cardinality of value 0.9 is 30. Given the proportionality of the increments (and decrements) of importance of each value, simulation results indicate a lineal variation for this case.

When 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         the obtained result is 0.05 (only the majority's opinion is taken into account), while it is 0.9 when 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              0
                           
                         (only the minority's opinion is taken into account). For 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         the result is the arithmetic mean of two values.


                        Fig. 2 shows that the variation of FSMA
                        values is not lineal (as ocurring in Example 4). Evidently, this behavior is due to quantity of values in the set of aggregates and their cardinalities. In Fig. 2 it can be clearly observed that the variation of CRF is a good mechanism to assign importance to all opinions.

In Table 7 it can be observed that all weights are 0 (except for the corresponding to the largest cardinality value). Although for Example 5 (Table 8) the same results are observed for 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         and 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                        , when 
                           
                              δ
                              =
                              0
                           
                         the value of the largest cardinality (0.55) is discarded and the result is the arithmetic mean of the rest of the values (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2). This situation occurs because the cardinality for three values is equal (45) and, once discarded the largest cardinality value, the aggregation process provides the arithmetic mean of these values.

Considering the arithmetic mean of aggregates, a score of 0.2657 was obtained. This value is very close to 0.25, which is the arithmetic mean if all values have the same cardinality. It seems reasonable that the CRF should be considered in the range between 0.6 and 0.7.

In
                        
                        
                         order to calculate the adequate value of δ, the cardinalities should be analyzed. In this way, if the cardinalities are similar, δ should tend to 0.5 (i.e. the aggregate value should tend to arithmetic mean) and if they are dissimilar, δ should tend to 1 (i.e. the aggregate value should tend to the majority's opinion).

Clearly, to determine the CRF is not a trivial task. A viable option is to analyze the dispersion of the cardinality values.

Low dispersion of cardinalities indicates that their values are close to each other (and are, therefore, close to the arithmetic mean). On the other hand, high dispersion indicates an existent disparity of opinions and, consequently there is a majority's opinion. For that, the variance of cardinalities can be used to determine the adequate value of δ. To do this, the following alternative is proposed:

                                    δ

                        where:


                        s
                        2(m
                        
                           σ(i)) is the variance of cadinality values.

In Eq. (36) it can be observed that for high values of s
                        2(m
                        
                           σ(i)) δ tends to 1. Opposingly, if the cardinality dispersion is low, δ tends to 0.5. Evidently, this strategy is adequate to consider the majority's opinion based on the cardinality values though it is not the only one. Another option is to use the parameterized logistic function:

                        where:


                        d(m
                        
                           σ(i)) is a dispersion measure of cardinality values and y
                        0, x
                        0, a and b values guide the displacement and function characteristics.

In this case, for values of d(m
                        
                           σ(i)) closest to 0 (low dispersion), δ tends to 0.5 and for high values of d(m
                        
                           σ(i)), δ tends to 1. The advantage of logistic function over the first alternative is that it can be parameterized in order to increase or decrease the variation velocity of δ.

Undoubtedly, there are more options to determine the δ value but, beyond this, the outcome of SMA-OWA operator will be more accurate than WAM when the cardinalities are different (there exists majority's opinion) and, also, it will be more accurate than MA-OWA operator because they prevent this mentioned majority's opinion from fast convergence.

In order to validate the SMA-OWA proposed operator, three different aspects were considered: (a) the properties required from an aggregation operator (Grabisch et al., 2011) and (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007); (b) the weights decomposition, used as proof that the aggregate values of SMA-OWA operator are between the arithmetic mean and MA-OWA ones; and (c) the average Manhattan distance between the individual opinions and the aggregate value returned by the SMA-OWA, WAM and MA-OWA operators, used to compare the aggregation results.

In this section, some properties of SMA-OWA operator are checked. Similarly to MA-OWA operators, it can be shown that the properties of idempotency, commutativity and max–min boundedness, also hold for SMA-OWA operator.

The main goal of this section is to explain the advantages of the results obtained by using SMA-OWA operator. For that, some issues about the use of weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) and MA-OWA operators are used. Owing to the clear validity of their outcomes, both of the operators mentioned are widely used. Given the set of aggregates:

By using the WAM, the weights calculation is very simple: the individual cardinalities m
                        
                           σ(i) are divided by the sum of all cardinalities (even). I.e. for the WAM, the individual weights are calculated as:

                                                   j
                                                   )
                                                
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

In Eq. (40) it can be observed that the weights are proportional to the individual cardinalities because the calculation process is the normalization of m
                        
                           σ(i). Clearly, the WAM assigns the same importance to all v
                        
                           σ(i) and the majority's opinion is considered in the same way as the minority's opinion.

On the other hand, MA-OWA operator strongly prioritizes the majority's opinion using a recursive process (explained in Section 2.2) in order to obtain the weight of each value v
                        
                           σ(i). By using Eqs. (19), (20), (21) and (22), it can be observed that the weight of each v
                        
                           σ(i) grows if its cardinality is high. This occurs because the γ
                        
                           i, k
                         is equal to 1 only for the terms whose cardinality (m
                        
                           σ(i)) is greater or equal to k and the rest is equal to 0.

At this point, it can be observed that WAM and MA-OWA represent the extreme points in the aggregation process. Taking these two operators as a reference, the behavior of SMA-OWA operator is analyzed.

The recursive process for obtaining weights used by the MA-OWA operator is equal to that used by SMA-OWA operator, only changing the γ
                        
                           i, k
                         term by introducing the CRF (Eq. 30). While this recursive process is effective, it is quite complex to understand. Therefore, it is desirable to transform this recursive process into an iterative one. By using Eqs. (27)–(30), the weight decomposition based on cardinality values is:

Using this form, every wi
                         has the same terms quantity and γ
                        
                           i, k
                         is equal to δ only for the terms whose cardinality (m
                        
                           σ(i)) is greater or equal to k. Notice that the first terms of decomposition (41) are greater than the last ones. For this reason, values with high cardinality are more important than values with low cardinality. In this way, the SMA-OWA weight decomposition can be written as:

                         this prevents the value of maximum cardinality from fast convergence of the aggregation. Evidently, if δ is equal to 0 the majority's opinion is discarded. An interesting case is δ equal to 0.5 because all terms

                         and all weights are 1/n. In this case the SMA-OWA returns the arithmetic mean of all values. In this way, to represent the majority's opinion, the value of δ should be 0.5 < δ ≤ 1. It can be seen that by properly varying the CRF, SAM-OWA operator returns more accurate values than WAM and MA-OWA operators.

In order to verify that this iterative weight decomposition process produces the same results as the recursive one, the weights of Example 2 are recomputed. Then, the cardinal-dependent weights are calculated using the iterative form as follows:

It can be observed that the obtained results are the same if the recursive process is used (Section 3.2).

In many universities, surveys are often developed in order to assess the performance of the subjects taught in different degree programs. In the case of the example, twenty two questions were considered. Students were inquired in order to have different valuations concerning a subject in an engineering career. Different topics, such as attendance, punctuality, planning, content specifications, motivation, etc. were taken into account. Nineteen students were surveyed following the list shown in Table 9
                        
                        
                        . For all cases, five values were considered: 0 to 4 indicating “very poor”, “poor”, “normal”, “good” and “very good”. The aggregated values were calculated using the arithmetic mean.

The answers of each item may be represented as a bag of aggregates 
                           
                              a
                              =

                                    v
                                    i

                         where 0 ≤ vi
                         ≤ 4 and mi
                         indicates the cardinality of vi
                        . In this way, valuation of each question is represented by:

                        ” and “AMDSMA
                        ” columns (note that the best results of distance, which have been highlighted, are the lowest).

If the cardinalities distribution for each question in Table 9 is analyzed, it can be observed that the opinions are coincident. This indicates high level of consensus for each question, except for question S
                        21. It can be seen that the aggregate values returned by SMA-OWA operator are between the WAM and MA-OWA ones (Fig. 3); consequently, the average Manhattan distances for SMA-OWA operator are between the average distances for WAM and MA-OWA operators.

Except for question S
                        21, MA-OWA operator returns the best average distance and, for the configuration of these opinions, it is the most adequate operator for aggregation process. Similarly, it is seen that WAM operator is the worst option to be used as aggregation operator in this case. In general, for high level of consensus, MA-OWA returns better aggregate values while for more similar cardinality values, the WAM operator is more adequate.

Now, although the SMA-OWA operator returns the best aggregate value fewer times than the rest, this aggregate value is always between the arithmetic mean and the MA-OWA aggregate values. This suggests that SMA-OWA operator returns the best average distance values for situations in which high level of consensus and similarity of cardinalities coexist. To test if this assumption is correct, the same study case is used (for 5 values). However, the average Manhattan distance for each operator and for all possible cardinalities configurations considering from 10 to 100 opinions was calculated (Table 10).

In Table 10, the row “Opinions Quantity” contains the total number of opinions (varying from 10 to 100), “Cases Quantity” row shows the possible cardinalities configurations for the survey values (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), and “AMDWAM
                        ”, “AMDMA

                        ” rows contain the average Manhattan distance between all opinions and the aggregate value returned by every operator (using Eq. (43)).

In Table 10 it can be observed that for low cardinalities MA-OWA operator has the best average distances, and consequently for these cases it is the most adequate aggregation operator.

For 18 or more opinions, SMA-OWA operator returns the best aggregate values and obtains the best average distances (with 18 opinions

                         0.9928). This indicates that SMA-OWA operator returns the most adequate aggregate value for mixed configurations (high consensus cases and similar cardinalities cases). This occurs because the SMA-OWA aggregate value is the closest to the individual opinions considering all opinions configurations. In Table 10 it can be also seen that the worst aggregation operator is the WAM, which is currently used in most web pages to valuate products and services.

The obtained results show that the variance of cardinalities is an adequate strategy to determine the CRF value automatically. Beyond this, choosing the strategy to determine the CRF value (even by using a fix value) depends on the problem domain and the user's requirements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper the new SMA-OWA operator was presented in order to manage different levels of importance over a set of opinions. Its use provides an efficient method to aggregate opinions based on their cardinalities.

The SMA-OWA operator is a generalization of well-known MA-OWA operator. It extends its use to problems where the aggregation process is fast influenced by the majority's opinion. The mathematical formulation for the SMA-OWA operator is presented, allowing easy calculation, proof of theoretical properties and the generalization of the previously published MA-OWA operator.

The SMA-OWA operator considers the importance of all opinions introducing the Cardinality Relevance Factor. This factor allows distributing the significance of each group of opinions. Furthermore, it can be used to discard the majority's opinion, the minority's opinion or to obtain a mixed result. This flexibility is very desirable for service evaluation processes where users judge a specific service (using stars, for example).

Based on the operator's properties, the behavior description, the iterative process of the weights decomposition and the use of the average Manhattan distance between the individual opinions and the aggregate value returned, it can be appreciated that the use of SMA-OWA operator is totally valid for the aggregation process respect to the majority's opinion.

Simulations show that the aggregate values of the SMA-OWA operator are, on average, closer to individual opinions than the values returned by the WAM and MA-OWA operators. In addition, simulations show that cardinality dispersion is an adequate value to compute the CRF. Consequently, by using this strategy, the obtained aggregate values are more accurate. Also, it is worth mentioning that the SMA-OWA operator can be used for dynamic domains implementing this kind of adaptive CRF based on cardinality changes.

Using the SMA-OWA operator, more accurate valuations taking the majority's opinion into account can be obtained for numerous web products and services (as valuation of hotels, cars, trip services, music and video, news services and so on). Also, satisfaction questionnaires (with multiple choice options) and political surveys can be processed by using the proposed SMA-OWA. The flexibility of SMA-OWA usage shows that it is possible to apply it in many commercial, academic and social issues.

@&#FUTURE WORK@&#

Given that SMA-OWA operator obtains more accurate results, it can be combined with other Decision Making strategies in order to obtain better aggregate values. Currently, this proposed operator is being tested in combination with a coalition criteria model (Bernal, Karanik, & Peláez, 2015) in order to model the criteria interaction based on the majority's opinion.
