                  In this paper we focus on finding high quality solutions for the problem of maximum partitioning of graphs with supply and demand (MPGSD). There is a growing interest for the MPGSD due to its close connection to problems appearing in the field of electrical distribution systems, especially for the optimization of self-adequacy of interconnected microgrids. We propose an ant colony optimization algorithm for the problem. With the goal of further improving the algorithm we combine it with a previously developed correction procedure. In our computational experiments we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on trees, 3-connected graphs, seriesâ€“parallel graphs and general graphs. The tests show that the method manages to find optimal solutions for more than 50% of the problem instances, and has an average relative error of less than 0.5% when compared to known optimal solutions.
