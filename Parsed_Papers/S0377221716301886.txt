                  We devote this paper to study a class of interval valued multiobjective programming problems. For this we consider two order relations LU and LS on the set of all closed intervals and propose many concepts of Pareto optimal solutions. Based on convexity concepts (viz. LU and LS-convexity) and generalized differentiability (viz. gH-differentiability) of interval valued functions, the KKT optimality conditions for aforesaid problems are obtained. In addition, we compare our results with the results given in Wu (2009) and we show some advantages of our results. The theoretical development is illustrated by suitable examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Theory and mathematical modeling (programming) are important components of optimization problems. In practice, it is usually difficult to determine the coefficients of objective function as a real number, since a number of real world problems often involve uncertain or imprecise data due to measurement errors or some unexpected factors. There are two deterministic optimization models to deal with uncertain data viz. robust optimization (Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009) and interval valued optimization (Ben-Israel & Robers, 1970). Many approaches have been developed to deal with these problems. Birg and Luoveaux (1997), Vajda (1972), Stancu-Minasian (1984), Prekopa (1995) have provided various techniques for solving stochastic optimization problems. The collection of papers on fuzzy optimization edited by Slowinski (1998) and Delgado, Kacprzyk, Verdegay, and Vila (1994) gave the main stream to the topic. Lai and Hwang (1992,1994) also gave useful survey. Inuiguchi and Ramik (2000) gave a review of fuzzy optimization and a comparison with stochastic optimization in portfolio selection problems. Slowinski and Teghem (1990) have provided comparison between two types of the optimization problems for multiobjective programming problems. Stancu-Minasian and Tigan (1990) obtained solutions for interval valued optimization problems.

The interval valued optimization problems are closely related with the inexact linear programming problems. Charnes, Granot, and Phillips (1977) considered the linear programming problems in which the right-hand sides of linear inequality constraints were taken as closed intervals. Steuer (1981) proposed three algorithms called the F-cone algorithm, E-cone algorithm and all emanating algorithm to solve the linear programming problems with interval objective functions. Ishibuchi and Tanaka (1990) proposed the ordering relation between two closed intervals by considering the maximization and minimization problems separately. Mraz (1998) proved algorithms to compute the exact upper bound and lower bound for linear programming problems with interval coefficients. Chanas and Kuchta (1996) presented an approach to unify the solution methods proposed in Ishibuchi and Tanaka (1990) and Rommelfanger, Hanuscheck, and Wolf (1989). Oliveria and Antunes (2007) provided an overview of multiobjective linear programming problems with interval coefficients by illustrating many numerical examples. Lai and Hwang (1992) proposed an interval parameter fuzzy nonlinear optimization model for stream water quality management under uncertainty.

The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions play an important role in area of optimization theory and have been studied for over a century. Wu (2007,2008,2009) have studied KKT optimality conditions for interval valued optimization problems. Singh, Dar, and Goyal (2014) have derived KKT optimality conditions for optimization problem in which both objective and constraints are assumed to be interval valued functions. Also Chalco-Cano, Lodwick, and Rufian-Lizana (2013) have studied the KKT optimality conditions of interval valued optimization problem via generalized derivative. Moreover Zhang, Liu, Li, and Feng (2012) derived the KKT optimal conditions for non-convex programming problems with interval valued objective functions. However optimality conditions for invex interval valued nonlinear programming problems via gH-derivative are discussed in Ahmad, Singh, and Ahmad (2014). Also Ahmad, Jayswal, and Banerjee, (2013); Jayswal, Stancu-Minasian, and Ahmad, (2011); Jayswal, Stancu-Minasian, Banerjee, and Stancu, (2015); Zhang, (2013) extended the concept of duality to interval valued optimization problems, involving non-convex functions.

This paper develops a theoretical and practical solution method for multiobjective programming problems with interval valued objective functions considering order relationship between two closed intervals in 
                        R
                     . In particular we consider order relations following from Wu (2007) and Chalco-Cano et al. (2013). For this problem we obtain KKT conditions by using gH-derivative of interval valued functions. The theoretical concepts are illustrated with adequate number of examples.

A straight forward concept of differentiability of interval valued functions was introduced in Wu (2007) and is defined as follows.

                           Definition 2.1
                           (Wu, 2007) Let f be an interval valued function defined on 
                                 
                                    X
                                    ⊂
                                    
                                       R
                                       n
                                    
                                 
                              . We say that f is weakly continuously differentiable at x
                              * ∈ X if the real valued functions fL
                               and fU
                               are continuously differentiable at x
                              * (i.e., all partial derivatives of fL
                               and fU
                               exist in some neighborhood of x
                              * and are continuous at x
                              *).

Next the Hukuhara differentiability (H-differentiability in short) for interval valued functions, introduced initially by Hukuhara (1967), is based on H-difference of intervals. Later Wu (2007, 2009) used this differentiability to study KKT conditions of programming problems with interval valued objective functions. However this definition of differentiability is restrictive e.g., consider a simple interval valued function

It is clear from Definition 2.1 that the weakly continuously differentiability of f is established with relation to the differentiability of the lower and upper (end point) functions. Therefore we do not know about the derivative of f. e.g., consider a simple interval valued function 
                           
                              f

                              x
                              )
                              =
                              [
                              −
                              |

                              x

                        . Then f is not weakly continuously differentiable at

                        . However f is continuously gH-differentiable at 
                           
                              x

                      are interval valued functions and the feasible set X is assumed to be a convex subset of 
                        
                           R

                     . Since each fk
                      is a closed interval in 
                        
                           R

                      we follow the similar solution concept as it was proposed in Wu (2007). In Wu (2007) a partial ordering “⪯
                        LU
                     ” was invoked between two closed intervals as follows.

                      then we write A⪯
                        LU
                     
                     B if and only if aL

Since F is continuously gH-differentiable and the conditions of Theorem 4.2 are satisfied at 0. Therefore

                      for problem (8) (Fig. 11
                     ). But F is not weakly continuously differentiable at 0, therefore Theorem 4.2 of Wu (2009) cannot be used.

By using Theorem 4.1, we see that x
                           * is an optimal solution of the real valued objective function

                            subjected to same constraints of (MIP2). Now by using similar arguments as in the Theorem 4.2 we can show that

                            and so there is no gradient of f. Thus the gradient of f using H-derivative is restrictive. Further if we consider that f as weakly continuously differentiable, then clearly we cannot talk about gradient as we cannot define partial derivative of f. Therefore the gradient of f using gH-derivative is more general and it is more robust for optimization as we show.

Note that the Theorem 4.9 of Wu (2009) can not be used in problem (15) since the (interval) multiobjective function F is not H-differentiable at (0, 0). Therefore Theorem 4.6 is more general than Theorem 4.9 of Wu (2009).

                           * if and only if fL
                            is strictly convex (resp. convex) at x
                           *. We can similarly define strictly U-convex (resp. U-convex) and strictly S-convex (resp. S-convex) by considering fU

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have considered two order relations on interval space, viz. LU and LS relations, which incorporates quantitative properties of width (noise, risk, etc.). Also by using gH-derivative for interval valued functions we have obtained KKT conditions for multiobjective programming problems with interval valued objective functions considering LU and LS order relations. For the case of order relation LU the results obtained are more general then those results obtained in Wu (2009) and for the order relation LS, the results obtained are novel. Moreover, we have considered the gradient for interval valued functions using gH-derivative and have used this to obtain KKT optimality conditions. These results are more general than other similar results obtained using H-derivative and consequently, gradient of interval valued function is more general using gH-derivative.

Although the equality constraints are not considered in this paper we can use similar methodology proposed in this paper to handle equality constraints. The constraint functions in this paper are still real valued, in future research, we may extend the constraint functions as the interval valued functions.
