                  In this paper, in order to optimize neural network architecture and generalization, after analyzing the reasons of overfitting and poor generalization of the neural networks, we presented a class of constructive decay RBF neural networks to repair the singular value of a continuous function with finite number of jumping discontinuity points. We proved that a function with m jumping discontinuity points can be approximated by a simplest neural network and a decay RBF neural network in

                           (
                           ℝ
                           )
                        
                      by each ɛ error, and a function with m jumping discontinuity point

                      can be constructively approximated by a decay RBF neural network in 
                        
                           
                              L
                              2
                           
                           (
                           
                              ℝ
                              d
                           
                           )

                      error. Then the whole networks will have less hidden neurons and well generalization in the same of the first part. A real world problem about stock closing price with jumping discontinuity have been presented and verified the correctness of the theory.
