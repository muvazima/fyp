Distributionally robust bounds

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  In this paper, we review recent advances in the distributional analysis of mixed integer linear programs with random objective coefficients. Suppose that the probability distribution of the objective coefficients is incompletely specified and characterized through partial moment information. Conic programming methods have been recently used to find distributionally robust bounds for the expected optimal value of mixed integer linear programs over the set of all distributions with the given moment information. These methods also provide additional information on the probability that a binary variable attains a value of 1 in the optimal solution for 0–1 integer linear programs. This probability is defined as the persistency of a binary variable. In this paper, we provide an overview of the complexity results for these models, conic programming formulations that are readily implementable with standard solvers and important applications of persistency models. The main message that we hope to convey through this review is that tools of conic programming provide important insights in the probabilistic analysis of discrete optimization problems. These tools lead to distributionally robust bounds with applications in activity networks, vertex packing, discrete choice models, random walks and sequencing problems, and newsvendor problems.

The class of mixed 0–1 linear programs has been used extensively in business, engineering, and economic applications, to model diverse types of problems arising from production planning, logistics deployment, scheduling of jobs and machines, among others. However, in practice, the input parameters (i.e. 
                        c
                     , 
                        a

                        j
                     ) are often not known with certainty, and need to be estimated in the modeling process. Since the optimal solution is sometimes very sensitive to the input parameters, one needs to be careful in modeling the uncertainty in these problems. In this review, we focus ourselves on the uncertainty inside the objective coefficient vector, 
                        c

Clearly, computing MEAN is at least as hard as solving the deterministic mixed 0–1 linear program. MEAN is computable in time polynomial in the size of the instance

                           Here, the “instance” refers to the problem input string that encodes all the necessary parameters of the optimization problem, Z(
                                 c
                              ), and all the support points of 
                                 c

                         when the deterministic problem is solvable in polynomial time and θ is a discrete distribution with a polynomial number of support points. However, for general distributions, the computation of MEAN is significantly more challenging than solving the deterministic problem. An example is the problem of finding the longest path on a directed acyclic graph. The deterministic version of this problem is to find a longest path between a source node s and a sink node t in a directed acyclic graph

Roughly speaking, the difficulty stems from the observation that an exponential number of support points for the multivariate independent discrete distribution can be supported by an exponential number of optimal solutions. The difficulty of this problem has led to the development of methods such as Monte Carlo simulations (Bowman, 1995; Van Slyke, 1963), PERT approximations (Malcolm, Roseboom, Clark, & Fazar, 1959), exact methods in special instances such as series–parallel graphs (Möhring, 2001) and upper and lower bounds on the expected longest path (Dodin, 1985; Fulkerson, 1962; Kleindorfer, 1971).

Explicit formulas for the expected optimal value have been developed in the asymptotic analysis of random combinatorial optimization problems. This area has its roots in the pioneering work of Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley (1959) who characterized the asymptotic behavior of a traveling salesperson tour length for points randomly generated on the Euclidean plane. The book by Steele (1997) provides an introduction to the asymptotic analysis of combinatorial optimization problems under the Euclidean model. More closely related to the theme of this paper is the probabilistic analysis of combinatorial optimization problems under the mean field model. In the mean field model, the nodes of a graph are assumed to be fixed while the arc lengths are independently chosen from a probability distribution. The arc lengths need not satisfy the triangle inequality. The origins of this model lies in an early paper of Karp (1979) who analyzed the asymmetric traveling salesperson problem and its linear assignment relaxation for distances drawn independently from an uniform distribution in [0,1]. The linear assignment problem (LAP) is formulated as

                        Explicit asymptotic expressions for the expected value of the assignment problem under random costs have been developed for uniform and exponential distributions by several authors (see Krokhmal and Pardalos (2009) for a review on this topic). Aldous (2001) in 2001 rigorously proved the following result which was initially conjectured by Mézard and Parisi (1985) in 1985 using ideas in statistical physics.

Asymptotic expressions for the expected value of other combinatorial optimization problems have since been developed under the mean-field model (see Aldous & Steele (2003)). However, explicit formulas for finite size instances of combinatorial optimization problems are much more difficult to obtain. One such formula that was conjectured by Parisi in 1998 (Parisi, 1998) and recently proved by two sets of authors is provided next.

While this result is elegant and surprising, the techniques in its proof is typically difficult to use for the analysis of general discrete optimization problems with non-identical, or non-independently distributed uncertainties. In this paper, we review an alternate approach for the probabilistic analysis of discrete optimization problems that relaxes the assumption of independence. Instead of fixing the joint distribution of the random parameters, we allow for the joint distribution to be incompletely specified by the partial moment information. Surprisingly, the probabilistic analysis of the problem becomes tractable for a wide class of mixed integer linear programs, under appropriate assumptions of the input distributions. The moment information can be viewed as imposing boundary conditions on the way the scenarios of the extremal distribution are generated so as to guard against extremely unrealistic distributions.

In Section 2, the central problem of finding the tight bound on the expected optimal value of a mixed 0–1 linear program is introduced. The formal characterization of the set of probability distributions using the theory of moments is provided in this section. The notion of persistency – the probability that a binary variable attains a value of 1 in the optimal solution is also discussed in this section. In Section 3, conic programming methods to compute the bounds and estimate persistency are reviewed. Polynomial time computable bounds and bounds that are 
                           
                              NP
                           
                        -hard to compute are identified in this section. In Section 4, we review applications of this approach in activity networks, vertex packing discrete choice models, random walk and sequencing problems, and newsvendor problems. We conclude in Section 5.

We discuss a few important aspects of this problem next:
                        
                           (a)
                           The most commonly used model in the probabilistic analysis of optimization problems is the independent distribution model. However, modeling data as independent random variables is sometimes unrealistic. For example, in supply chain networks one often needs to deal with correlated demands, and in activity networks one needs to deal with correlated activity durations due to resource dependencies. By dropping the explicit assumption of independence in the description of Θ, it is possible to capture the effect of dependencies.

The upper bound of interest is valid across all distributions in the set Θ and is as tight as possible. Tightness implies that either there exists a feasible distribution that attains the upper bound exactly or there exists a sequence of distributions that attains the bound and is feasible in a limiting sense. Hence, this bound is termed as a distributionally robust bound. For the longest path problem on directed acyclic graphs with random arc lengths as arising in activity networks, the upper bound corresponds to a worst-case expected project completion time. For the maximum flow problem with random arc capacities, the upper bound corresponds to the worst-case expected maximum flow that is supported by the network. While MEAN-UB deals with upper bounds for maximization problems, by simply replacing 
                                 c
                               with −
                                 c
                               transforms the bounds to lower bounds on minimization problems.

Under reasonable assumptions on the set of distributions Θ, the tight bound turns out to be efficiently computable with convex conic programming. In instances where the tight bound is not efficiently computable, conic programming relaxations provide weaker upper bounds. An example of a bound on the expected optimal value of a discrete optimization problem through convex quadratic programming is the following elegant result of Lyons, Pemantle, and Peres (1999) and Lovász (2001).

The bound in Theorem 4(a) is the optimal value to a separable convex quadratic minimization problem over 0–1 polytopes and efficiently computable. This result implies that for independent exponentially distributed random edge lengths in an undirected graph, the expected length of the shortest path between any two nodes is bounded from below by the resistance between the nodes, where the resistance of an edge is defined as the expectation of its length. While the lower bound in Theorem 4(a) is not tight in general (see Example 5, p. 372 in Lovász (2001) for a counterexample), Theorem 4(b) identifies a particular instance where the bound is tight. The models discussed in Section 3 provide tight bounds for general mixed integer linear programs using conic optimization. A formal description of the set of distributions Θ based on the theory of moments is provided next.

                        For an in-depth discussion of the moment problem, the reader is referred to the classic book of Karlin and Studden (1966). A more recent algorithmic exposition on the moment problem using conic programming is found in the book of Lasserre (2009). We review the results from this theory of moments that are particularly relevant to this paper.

The moment feasibility problem characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions that the moments must satisfy so that the set of distributions Θ as defined in (3) is nonempty. Towards this, define the moment cone of order 2 supported on

                         is equivalent to verifying if a matrix is copositive. For a detailed introduction to completely positive matrices, the reader is referred to the book of Berman and Shaked-Monderer (2003). Three recent surveys on completely positive and copositive matrices with emphasis on optimization are found in Bomze (2012), Dür (2010) and Hiriart-Urruty and Seeger (2010). Unlike the positive semidefinite cone, testing feasibility in the completely positive and copositive cones are known to be difficult. For instance, Murty and Kabadi (1987) showed that the problem of verifying if a given matrix is copositive is co-

A popular relaxation to the completely positive cone is the doubly nonnegative cone which is defined as the intersection of the positive semidefinite and the nonnegative cone. The following well-known relationship holds among these cones,

                        ⩽4 from a result of Diananda (1962). To obtain better approximations to the completely positive and copositive cones, hierarchies of convex cones based on positive semidefinite and nonnegative cones have been developed by several researchers (see Parillo (2000), Lasserre (2001), Bomze & de Klerk (2002), Laurent (2003), & Zuluaga & Pena (2005) for details on these hierarchies). While these hierarchies of cones converge to the completely positive and copositive cones asymptotically, the size of the formulations grow so rapidly that the higher order approximations are intractable from a computational viewpoint. The conic representations in Theorem 6 are extendable to arbitrary sets

                         could be one or many depending on the uniqueness of the optimal solution. For continuous distributions such as the multivariate normal distribution with a positive definite covariance matrix, the probability measure of the support over which there are multiple optimal solutions is zero. This however need not be the case for discrete distributions. For a random vector 
                           c
                        , any optimal solution

For activity networks, “persistency” is equivalent to the concept of the “criticality index” of an activity. A criticality index of an activity measures the probability that an activity is on the longest path in an activity network. A higher criticality index roughly indicates higher importance of that activity in the successful completion of the project on time. Criticality indices have been previously estimated using simulations (Bowman, 1995; Van Slyke, 1963) and approximations (Dodin & Elmaghraby, 1985). The conic optimization methods discussed in the next section provide an alternate method to estimate the persistency of a binary variable.

It is important to point out that an alternate definition of “persistency” for deterministic 0–1 optimization problems has been previously proposed. Adams, Lassiter, and Sherali (1998) and Hammer, Hansen, and Simeone (1984) define an optimal solution to the continuous relaxation of a mixed 0–1 linear program to be persistent if the set of 0–1 variables realizing binary values in the continuous relaxation retain those same binary values in at least one integer optimum. A mixed 0–1 linear program possesses the persistency property if every optimal solution to the continuous relaxation is a persistent solution. Weighted vertex packing is the first example of a combinatorial optimization problem that is shown to possess the persistency property (see Nemhauser & Trotter (1975)). The persistency property has also been identified in unconstrained quadratic 0–1 optimization by Hammer et al. (1984), unconstrained polynomial 0–1 optimization by Lu and Williams (1987), and integer programs with at most two variables per inequality by Hochbaum, Megiddo, Naor, and Tamir (1993). The motivation of identifying the persistency property in this line of research is to reduce the computational time to solve deterministic mixed 0–1 linear programs. This is done through a preprocessing step that solves the continuous relaxation first and fixes the persistent variables to their respective binary values. The reduction in the search space then provides computational benefits in the second step where either the optimal solution or near-optimal solution is found through exact methods or heuristics. Definition 1 of persistency has a similar motivation of helping identify variables that often take a value of 1 in the optimal solution. The main distinction is that while Definition 1 is for the stochastic 0–1 optimization problem, the earlier definition was for the deterministic 0–1 optimization problem.

There is a vast literature on moment bounds in areas such as inventory control (Scarf, 1958), queueing systems (Whitt, 1984), finance (Bertsimas & Popescu, 2002; Boyle & Lin, 1997), decision theory (Smith, 1995), activity networks (Birge & Maddox, 1995) and probability and statistics (Lasserre, 2002; Marshall & Olkin, 1960; Vandenberghe, Boyd, & Comanor, 2007). In this section, we review conic optimization based methods to compute MEAN-UB and the corresponding complexity of obtaining the bounds. The following generic “primal” proof technique is adopted in developing the conic programs to compute MEAN-UB:
                        
                           (a)
                           Define the “appropriate” decision variables using moments of the objective coefficient vector 
                                 c
                               and the optimal solution vector 
                                 x
                              (
                                 c
                              ).

Identify necessary constraints that these variables must satisfy for all distributions in Θ. Express the objective function in terms of the decision variables and find a upper bound on the expected value of Z(
                                 c
                              ) using conic optimization.

Show that the constraints are sufficient by constructing a distribution (or a sequence of distributions) in Θ that attains the upper bound (in a limiting sense). We outline steps (a) and (b) in this section to provide a flavor of the proof technique. The tightness argument of step (c) is found in the specific references. It is also possible to derive these results through an alternative dual approach (see (Bertsimas & Popescu, 2002; Karlin & Studden, 1966; Marshall & Olkin, 1960)).

To develop the conic programs to compute MEAN-UB, we make use of three different moment representations for the set of distributions Θ:
                        
                           (a)
                           
                              Cross moments: Given cross moment information that includes the means and covariances, we show that the distributionally robust bound is 
                                 
                                    NP
                                 
                              -hard in general. We provide two different conic programming approaches in Section 3.1. The first approach uses a complete enumeration of the extreme points to construct the SDP formulation, whereas the second approach uses the constraint formulation to derive a completely positive conic program for this problem. Both approaches are exact as there are extremal distributions that match the bound.


                              Marginal moments: Given univariate marginal moment information that includes the means and variances, we show that the distributionally robust bound is computationally tractable if the deterministic 0–1 linear program is solvable in polynomial time. In this moment representation, no assumption on the dependency among the random variables is made. We describe the convex formulation for these models in Section 3.2.


                              Nonoverlapping multivariate marginal moments: We conclude by discussing a hybrid approach in Section 3.3, that uses nonoverlapping marginal multivariate information to compute the distributionally robust bound. In this hybrid approach, the random objective coefficients are partitioned into several subsets, and cross moment information for each of the subsets is assumed to be known. However, the dependence structure across different subsets is unknown. A natural application of this approach is in activity networks.

                        -hard. Then from the equivalence of separation and optimization (see Grötschel, Lovász, & Schrijver (1988)), Theorem 7 follows. The separation version of the dual problem is:

                            with the number of vertices K polynomially bounded in n, MEAN-UB is computable in polynomial time by solving the semidefinite program in Theorem 8. This problem was first studied by Boyle and Lin (1997) for an option pricing problem with Z(
                              c
                           )=(max
                              i

                           k)+ where k is the strike price and the option payoff is determined by the maximum of asset prices. Delage and Ye (2010) extended this result by relaxing the assumption on the exact knowledge of the two moments and incorporating additional support information. In their model, the set of distributions is defined with a compact convex support Ω, mean 
                              μ
                            and second moment matrix bounded from above in the positive semidefinite order by Π, i.e.,

                           Theorem 8 is useful when the number of vertices K of the feasible region is not too large. However, K is often exponential in the size of the problem. The next theorem provides a completely positive program to compute MEAN-UB for mixed 0–1 linear programs using a constraint based representation. In this part, we work on the original constraint based formulation of Z(
                              c
                           ) as defined in (1) and (2). The constraint based formulation is derived using an interesting result of Burer (2009) who showed that any mixed 0–1 linear program with a mixture of binary and continuous variables can be formulated as a completely positive program. Natarajan, Teo, and Zheng (2011) extended this result to mixed 0–1 linear programs under objective uncertainty by formulating a completely positive cross moment model (CPCMM).

                           By allowing for higher order moments, Lasserre (2010) has generalized the approach to the class of parametric polynomial optimization problems which includes mixed 0–1 linear programs as a special case. Note that binary variables can be modeled in polynomial optimization problems with constraints of the form

                           (·), Lasserre proposed a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations that is based on the theory of moments. The optimal objective value to the sequence of semidefinite relaxations converges in the limit to E
                           
                              θ
                           (Z(
                              ξ
                           )). The attractiveness of this technique is that it is general purpose since it can handle uncertainty in the objective and constraints and is applicable to the class of polynomial optimization problems. However the size of the semidefinite relaxation grows rapidly which makes solving the higher order semidefinite relaxations numerically challenging. In the remaining part of this section, we review sets of distributions Θ where the distributionally robust bound can be found in polynomial time using conic optimization.

                        Moment feasibility in this instance is equivalent to the feasibility of univariate moment sequences. This condition is obviously necessary. Sufficiency follows by constructing a feasible joint measure using the independent distribution. Testing moment feasibility is thus easy for the marginal moment model for both

Finding a bound on a function of multiple random variables given only the probability measures of the individual random variables has its origins in the Monge (1781) and Kantorovich (1958) formulation for mass transportation problems. The reader is referred to the book of Rachev and Rüschendorf (1998) for a historical account of this problem. The upper bound on the expected optimal value with given marginal distributions is formulated as

                           Meilijson and Nadas (1979) solved this problem in a combinatorial optimization setting by estimating an upper bound on the expected longest path in a directed acyclic graph given marginal distributions of the arc lengths. Their motivation was to find the worst case expected project completion time in an activity network across all joint distributions of activity durations that are consistent with the marginal distributions. This bound is thus robust against dependence. Weiss (1986) generalized this bound to combinatorial optimization problems such as the maximum flow, shortest route and reliability problems. The formulation in Meilijson and Nadas (1979) and Weiss (1986) is derived from a dual convex minimization formulation.

As highlighted by these examples, the extremal distributions under the marginal distribution model provide new and non-trivial limits on the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems. It is interesting to compare the proof technique for the marginal distribution model with that of the independence model. The proof of the former model is based on convex optimization, while for the later model, the proof is based on sophisticated probabilistic techniques (see Aldous, 2001).


                        Doan and Natarajan (2011) recently developed the bound MEAN-UB for a set of distributions Θ that lies between the two extremes of the cross moment and marginal moment information. In this distribution model, the random objective coefficients are assumed to be partitioned into subsets with information on the moments of the random parameters in each subset. The dependence structure between any random parameters for different subsets is assumed to be unknown. To describe the formulation, we use the example of activity networks. In the directed acyclic graph representation of an activity network, a natural partition is formed by the set of arcs (activities) entering each node.

For example, in projects where different teams are responsible for the set of activities entering different nodes, it is reasonable to assume that each team is knowledgeable about the joint distribution of the activities for which they are responsible. The project manager is interested in evaluating the worst-case expected project completion time that is compatible with these factors.

The conic programming method provides a flexible and simple way to analyze mixed integer linear programs with random objective. Since there is a huge number of problems under the umbrella of mixed integer LP, we review only a few applications of the approach.

The activity network example in Fig. 1
                         is inspired from Van Slyke (1963) and discussed in more details in Bertsimas et al. (2006). This example serves as a benchmark for comparison of the conic programs with alternative methods for estimating the project completion time and the criticality indices of activities under random activity durations.

The deterministic critical path method (CPM) uses the expected value of the activity durations to compute the critical path. The deterministic critical path approach identifies activities (1,2) and (2,4) as being critical with expected project duration of 20.1 irrespective of the number of parallel arcs between nodes 3 and 4. Simulation is a popular approach to analyze activity networks under uncertainty. By simulating durations from a joint probability distribution, it is possible to analyze the project by solving a longest path problem for each sample. However, this comes at the cost of computational expense for large projects comprising of several thousand activities. For this project, we use the multivariate normal distribution to simulate activity durations. Table 2
                         provides a comparison of CPM and the simulation method with the SDP and SOCP methods discussed in Section 3.

The simulation results in Table 2 are obtained with independent activity durations. It is clear from the table that the deterministic critical path method severely underestimates the expected project duration. Furthermore it fails to identify activity (1,3) as being the most important especially when the number of parallel arcs between nodes 3 and 4 increases. The criticality index of activity (1,3) is clearly larger than the criticality index of activity (1,2) for n
                        >1 based on the simulation results. This is due to the simple observation that it is very likely that any one of the upper paths will be critical in comparison to the lower path due to the presence of parallel independent arcs. Using a deterministic approach would imply that the project manager focuses on the wrong activity (1,2). For the cross moment and nonoverlapping multivariate marginal moments, SDP is used while for univariate marginal moments, SOCP is used to compute the worst case expected project completion time. All three methods help identify the importance of activity (1,3) under distributional uncertainty. As should be expected, the worst case expected project duration for the cross moment model is lesser than that of the nonoverlapping marginal moment model which in turn is lesser than marginal moment model.

In Table 3
                        , the effect of partial correlations is tested on the project performance. Three multivariate normal distributions are simulated. The correlations between all activities are set to zero except for the correlation between activity (1,2) and (1,3), which takes values of −0.9, 0 and 0.9. From Table 3, it is clear that actual criticality index is sensitive to the correlation structure as expected. In fact, as the degree of dependence among activity durations increases, the variation in the criticality indices potentially become significant. Although SOCP based marginal moment model still identifies activity (1,3) as the most critical activity, it does not capture explicit dependence information. In contrast, the more computationally intensive SDP models help provide closer fits to the exact simulation values.

In this example, we compare the persistency obtained from the SOCP in formulation (17) with known persistency results for deterministic combinatorial optimization problems. The deterministic weighted vertex packing problem is: Given an undirected graph

                         is obtained by using the optimal solution to the second-order cone program. However, for the vertex packing problem, the convex hull of feasible region is not easily characterizable. In this case, it is appealing to use linear programming relaxation to approximate

                        =(2,1,1,1,1,1) for which the deterministic problem has the unique optimal solution (1,0,0,1,0,1). The second column corresponds to mean

The results described earlier indicate that random discrete optimization problem with a polynomial number of extreme points can be analyzed using compact convex programs. One important example is the class of discrete choice models. These models predict the probability that customers choose an item from a finite set of alternatives. Consider a set of alternatives

                        However, this approach has some drawbacks. For example, the formula implies the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property wherein the relative ratio of the choice probabilities for two alternatives is independent of the remaining alternatives. This property is not always observed in practice where the entire choice set helps in determining the relative probabilities. The probit model, another classical choice prediction model, using correlated normal distributions, can overcome this shortcoming, but at the added cost of finding choice probabilities through extensive simulation. In this case, no simple closed-form solution exists.

An alternative approach to find probabilities in discrete choice models is through conic optimization methods we reviewed in the previous section. Suppose that the n dimensional vector of random errors 
                           ∊
                         is characterized by marginal moments, i.e., the mean vector 0 and the second moment matrix Π
                        ≻0. The tight upper bound on the expected random utility is found by solving the following moments problem,

                         is the choice probability that alternative k is selected by the customer under the extremal distribution. Natarajan et al. (2009) and Mishra et al. (2012) provide detailed numerical comparisons of these conic optimization based choice models with classical discrete choice models such as logit and multinomial probit models.

In this section, we discuss the sequencing problem with random costs, which is a notoriously difficult problem. To illustrate the viability of the moment based approach, we compare the persistency values obtained from the SDP models for a simple random walk with the values that are exactly known. This example demonstrates that the distributionally robust assumption in the models are sufficient to obtain near exact approximations to the actual persistency values.

These techniques can be used to investigate complex sequencing problems. Consider an oil field exploration problem, where the objective is to determine the optimal sequence to explore a set of n oil fields. The valuation of oil field i is random and denoted by v
                        
                           i
                        . For ease of exposition, assume that the cost to explore each oil field is μ
                        
                           i

                        It follows simply that the optimal sequence π in formulation (31) is obtained by the smallest variance first rule. I.e., explore the oil fields starting from the smallest to the largest variance. However, this sequencing rule is not optimal in general, when the distributions are explicitly given, or even when the cross moments are known. It remains an open problem to find the optimal sequencing rule in these cases. For other applications of the persistency model in appointment scheduling, we refer the readers to Kong, Lee, Teo, and Zheng (2013).

Consider a newsvendor planning problem where the seller needs to determine the order quantity q of an item that maximizes her expected profit under random demand 
                           D
                        . The unit cost of the item is c and the selling price is p, with p
                        >
                        c. As the items are perishable, any unsold item will be deemed wasted. It is well known that the optimal ordering quantity q
                        ∗ satisfies the critical fractile rule: P(
                           D
                        
                        ⩽
                        q
                        ∗)=(p
                        −
                        c)/p. Scarf (1958) analyzed a maximin newsvendor problem who finds the optimal ordering quantity only based on the mean μ and variance σ
                        2 of the demand. In the maximin approach, the newsvendor chooses the order quantity that maximizes the minimum expected profit over all possible demand distributions Θ with the given mean and variance, i.e.,

                        The inner semidefinite program in (33) decomposes the demand into two events: Event 1 when D
                        <
                        q, and Event 2 when D
                        ⩾
                        q. By taking the dual of the inner SDP, the single item minimax newsvendor problem is formulated as a SDP which can be solved analytically as in Scarf (1958). For other results in this area, the reader is referred to the works of Popescu (2007), Chen, Sim, Sun, and Teo (2010), Goh and Sim (2010), Delage and Ye (2010), Doan and Natarajan (2011) and Zymler, Kuhn, and Rustem (2013).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we review some of the recent advances on the distributional robust analysis of mixed integer linear programs using conic programming techniques. Evaluating bounds on the expected optimal value is a classical problem that has been well studied over several decades. However, it is only more recently that conic programming methods have been used in the probabilistic analysis of discrete optimization problems. The strong connection between the theory of moments and conic programming provides an important analytical tool for this class of problems. Besides bounds, these methods also aid in estimating parameters of interest such as the persistency of a binary variable. This review paper also discusses the complexity results for this class of problems, and a few of the important applications in areas such as activity networks, discrete choice models, random walks, and newsvendor problems.
