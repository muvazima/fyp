                  Product family design is generally characterized by two types of approaches: module-based and scale-based. While the former aims to enable product variety based on module configuration, the latter is to variegate product design by scaling up or down certain design parameters. The prevailing practice is to treat module configuration and scaling design as separate decisions or aggregate two design problems as a single-level, all-in-one optimization problem. In practice, optimization of scaling variables is always enacted within a specific modular platform; and meanwhile an optimal module configuration depends on how design parameters are to be scaled. The key challenge is how to deal with explicitly the coupling of these two design optimization problems.
                  This paper formulates a Stackelberg game theoretic model for joint optimization of product family configuration and scaling design, in which a bilevel decision structure reveals coupled decision making between module configuration and parameter scaling. A bilevel mixed 0–1 non-linear programming model is developed and solved, comprising an upper-level optimization problem and a lower-level optimization problem. The upper level seeks for an optimal configuration of modules and module attributes by maximizing the shared surplus of an entire product family. The lower level entails parametric optimization of attribute values for optimal technical performance of each individual module. A case study of electric motors demonstrates that the bilevel joint optimization model excels in leveraging optimal scaling in conjunction with optimal module configuration, which is advantageous over the existing paradigm of product family scaling design that cannot change the product family configuration.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Developing multiple product variants based on product families sharing common platforms has been well recognized as an effective means to cater for product variety while maintaining mass production efficiencies (Simpson, Siddique, & Jiao, 2005). It provides an important input for increasing the sustainability of value creation along the entire enterprise value chain (Tseng & Piller, 2003). A sizeable body of research on product family design has been reported over the last decade (Jiao, Simpson, & Siddique, 2007). Generally there are two types of approaches to product family design. One is called scalable product family design, whereby scaling variables are used to “stretch” or “shrink” the product platform in one or more dimensions to satisfy a variety of customer needs (Simpson, 2004). The other is referred to as module-based or configurational product family design, which aims to develop a modular product platform, from which product variants are derived by configuring various modules (Ulrich, 1995).

Product family scaling design first needs to select platform variables, viz., to determine which design parameters that take common values (Simpson, 2004). While many existing methods assume that the platform architecture is known a priori (Fujita, Sakaguchi, & Akagi, 1999), some approaches attempt to determine platform variables along with scalable variables during optimization (Akundi, Simpson, & Reed, 2005). The subsequent task is to determine the optimal values of common and distinctive variables with the objective of satisfying performance and economic requirements. Most approaches consider only a single product platform, where each platform variable is shared across the entire product family. This strategy excels in computational simplicity; but may lead to a situation that some low-end products may be over-designed and certain high-end products may be under-designed (Dai & Scott, 2004). The other strategy is to consider multiple product platforms in product family scaling design, such that design variables can be shared by any subset of product variants within the product family (de Weck, Suh, & Chang, 2003) Multiple-platform design enhances exploration of the solution space, whereas sacrificing computational efficiency (Seepersad, Mistree, & Allen, 2002).

In practice, optimization of scaling parameters is always enacted within one common product architecture (Fujimoto, 1999), in which a specific configuration of modules is pre-determined and all the modules and attribute structures are kept intact per se. In this sense, product family scaling design essentially addresses parametric optimization of a specific modular structure resulted from product family configuration design. On the other hand, product family configuration design copes with the selection and combination of existing modules and their associated attributes. However the attribute levels of each module are all pre-defined as options. As a result, a specific module configuration may not be optimal in terms of parametric design (Yu & Huang, 2010). Obviously, an optimal module configuration should depend on how module attributes/parameters are to be scaled; and vice versa (Lamothe, Hadj-Hamou, & Aldanondo, 2006). This suggests that module configuration and parameter scaling are coupled in nature during product family design. It is imperative to deal with joint optimization of these two design problems explicitly. In this regard, this paper proposes a Stackelberg game theoretic model for joint optimization of product family configuration and scaling design, in which a bilevel decision structure reveals coupled decision making between module configuration and parameter scaling.

The prevailing practice is to treat module configuration and scaling design as separate decisions or aggregate two design problems as a single-level optimization problem. For example, Fujita and Yoshida (2004) emphasize the importance of simultaneous optimization of module configuration and attribute values by combining two design optimization problems as a single-level optimization model. Typical implementation of decision-based design is based on a profit-driven approach (Lewis, Chen, & Schmidt, 2006), whereby enterprise-level planning and engineering-level design decisions are integrated as a single-level optimization problem, like an all-in-one solution (Kumar, Chen, & Kim, 2006). In most cases, multiple design criteria are aggregated as a single-level objective function, usually in the form of expected utility on profit, revenue, etc. (Hazelrigg, 1988). While such multi-objective optimization approaches well address a standalone design problem, product family design decisions are related to the coupling of module configuration and parameter scaling, necessitating a joint effort of two design optimization problems. The all-in-one approach is often practically infeasible in such situations due to computational and problem complexities (Kumar et al., 2006). Product family module configuration and parameter scaling essentially belong to two different levels of decision making, not only due to the precedence of these two design tasks but also because of their involving different goals and constraints. Product family configuration is more about enterprise planning at a macrolevel, focusing on optimal performance of the entire product family. More about engineering decisions at a micro-level, product family scaling design is geared towards the optimization of technical performance of each individual module in terms of attribute/parameter values. Micro-level scaling design must conform to the objectives of the entire product family at the macrolevel, whilst influencing and constraining module configuration at the macrolevel. The inherent decision structure entails a de facto leader–follower model, rather than a single-level, all-in-one optimization problem. Deb and Sinha (2010) posit that a bilevel model is the fundamental decision making infrastructure underlying those joint optimization problems, whereby different systems usually have certain degrees of autonomy and may involve conflicting decisions.

The basic form of bilevel optimization formulation originates from the Stackelberg games (von Stackelberg, 1952). Bilevel optimization deals with the interplay of two self-interested decision makers who decide sequentially, implicating a mathematical program that contains a sub-optimization problem as its constraints (Bracken, Falk, & McGill, 1974). In the general case, the objective values mutually depend on the choices of the other party. Technically, the follower’s role can be seen as solving a parametric optimization problem, whose parameters are determined by the leader. Bilevel problems are complex optimization problems, often belonging to a higher complexity class than their corresponding single-level relaxations (Kovács & Kis, 2011). For example, Jeroslow (1985) shows that even a linear bilevel programming problem is NP-hard. It is also challenging that the feasible region may become discontinuous when upper-level constraints contain the optimal solution of the lower-level problem (Du & Wang, 2009). Most bilevel models have focused on those simple problems that are assumed to possess nice properties such as deterministic parameters, linear, quadratic or convex objectives and constraint functions (e.g., Wen & Hsu, 1991). Bilevel programming is more complicated also due to difficulties in solving the problems (Christiansen, Patriksson, & Wynter, 2001). Traditional solution approaches include vertex enumeration algorithms and approaches that are based on Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions or penalty functions. These are not only technically inefficient, but also lead to a paradox that the follower’s decision power dominates the leader’s (Lai, 1996). Fliege and Vicente (2006) study the relationship between bilevel optimization and multicriteria optimization, and introduce an order relation such that the optimal solutions of the bilevel problem are the nondominated points with respect to the order relation, when the lower-level problem is convex and continuously differentiable with respect to the lower-level variables. Colson, Marcotte, and Savard (2005) consider the approximation of non-linear bilevel mathematical programs by solvable programs of the same type, i.e., bilevel programs involving linear approximations of the upper-level objective and all constraint-defining functions, as well as a quadratic approximation of the lower-level objective.

Recent applications of bilevel programming in engineering design have indicated the potential of bilevel decision models. For instance, Shabde and Hoo (2008) employ bilevel programming for finding optimal process and controller designs together within a hierarchical decision making framework. Hernandez, Seepersad, and Mistree (2002) formulate a leader–follower game-theoretic model for collaborative product design and maintenance management. It should be noted that multi-disciplinary optimization has been widely applied to design of complex engineered systems, in particular aerospace and aeronautic applications (Roy, Hinduja, & Teti, 2008), for which a number of solution algorithms have been developed based on the idea of problem decomposition (Browning, 2001). For example, Kroo, Altus, Braun, Gage, and Sobieski (1994) exploit the concept of system decomposition using compatibility constraints to simplify the analysis structure and enable coarse-grained parallelism. They develop the collaborative optimization (CO) architecture for decomposition of the optimization process, so as to permit parallel design and to simplify interdisciplinary communication requirements. Gu and Renaud (2000) formulate decision-based design procedures according to the CO framework. Kokkolaras, Fellini, Kim, Michelena, and Papalambros (2002) develop an analytic task cascading (ATC) methodology to enable top-level design targets to be cascaded down to the lowest-level of the modeling hierarchy. Similar to the CO concept, ATC assumes that, if targets are cascaded in a coordinated fashion and decomposed systems can achieve the targets, then embodiment design follows to find a final system design. However, such variants of decomposition to a master problem along with sub-problems basically resemble the (logic-based) Benders decomposition approach that essentially deals with single-level problems (Hooker & Ottosson, 2003). A substantial difference is that in the single-level Benders case one is free to choose the separation of the master and the sub-problems as it is the most efficient computationally, whereas in the bilevel case the separation comes from the problem definition, i.e., the domain problem itself. This implies that for bilevel problems it can be rather challenging to feedback strong cuts (or constraints) from the sub-problems to the master problem (Wynter, 2001).

A product family contains multiple product variants. Each product variant is configured from existing modules. As shown in Fig. 1
                     , each module is described by some attributes; and each attribute assumes certain values. Common platform modules are shared among all product variants with fixed attribute levels. Other modules assume difference attribute levels for different product variants. Therefore module configuration enables product differentiation by providing options of attribute levels.

Assume the total number of optional attributes for module configuration is K. Among them, the set of attributes possessed by all the products is 
                        K
                     
                     +, and the rest set, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       K
                                    
                                    
                                       +
                                    
                                 
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                     , are those modules that may not appear in every product variant. An attribute is denoted as ak
                     , k
                     =1,…,
                     K, and is associated with a number of Lk
                      attribute levels. Attribute levels are usually set at high, medium and low. If an attribute is quantitative and assumes a continuous value, the attribute levels can be defined by individual intervals. For example, the kth attribute may possess an lth attribute levels,

For typical configuration design, like a Dell PC, product modules (e.g., hard disk) are relatively independent from one another, once a configuration topology is determined (e.g., a solid state or SATA hard disk). In this case, module attribute levels,

                     , are all pre-defined with a few optional values (e.g., 2terabytes, 1terabytes, or 500gigabytes), and their values will not change during product configuration. The optimality of these attribute levels are determined independently from how their associated modules are to be configured. However, for many engineering products, like a transformer module in a power supply product, the setting of attribute levels for a module is pending upon the specific technical performance of this module in the overall product configuration. This means that it is necessary to determine

                      through parametric optimization with respect to various instances of module configuration. Such parametric optimization not only involves domain-specific measures of technical performance (e.g., output power) and structural models regarding the related modules, but also is subject to domain-specific technical constraints, as well as couplings with settings of other attribute levels. This paper focuses on such joint decisions of module configuration and parametric optimization. Those applications with pre-defined fixed attribute levels can be regarded as a special case of general

Suppose a firm may obtain a module either from in-house fabrication or through outsourcing. Each product variant Pj
                      is associated with certain engineering cost, denoted as Cj
                     . Assume a product family serves a number of I market segments, each of which is of size Qi
                     , i
                     =1,…,
                     I, indicating the total product demand from customer group Si
                      in segment i, which includes the demand for the same product of the competitors as well.

Customers choose a product based on the surplus buyer rule (Kaul & Rao, 1995). They have the option of not buying any product (if none produces a positive surplus) or buying competitors’ products. A consumer surplus is measured by the amount that customers benefit by being able to purchase a product for a price that is less than they would be willing to pay. In a competitive market, the consumer surplus is closely related to customer-perceived utility of a product, which is originated from product attributes and the price. In marketing research literature, product price is typically interpreted as one of the product attributes, not only due to its important role in differentiating customer preference, but also because the firms can exploit it as an instrument to hedge again market competition. In addition, customers are assumed to be able to assess complete product option and price information.


                     Fig. 1 also illustrates that the coupling between product family configuration and scaling designs lies in how to set appropriate attribute levels while leveraging objectives and constrains of optimization at two different levels. In accordance with bilevel decision making, a joint optimization system model is shown in Fig. 2
                     . Module configuration plays a leader’s role and aims at the performance of the entire product family, which generally involves enterprise-wide competitive measures such as customer satisfaction and profitability. Parameter scaling acts as followers that respond to the leader’s decisions regarding module combination and attribute selection. The goal of lower-level problems is to optimize the technical performance of each individual module selected from the upper-level. Lower-level decisions regarding parametric optimization provide feedbacks and confine the upper-level module configuration decisions as well. Overall the coupling is enacted between one leader and multiple followers, such that each follower corresponds to parameter optimization of one specific module. Joint optimization starts with a given product architecture with identified modules and associated attributes/parameters, along with configuration logics. The output is an optimal product family design consisting of an optimal number of product variants that exhibit optimal settings of module combinations and attribute levels. During formulation of the upper- and lower-level problems, considerations about market competition, customer demand, engineering capabilities and technical requirements need to be incorporated properly.

The decision makers (i.e., players) of a Stackelberg game include one leader and multiple followers. Each of them adopts its own strategy to optimize its own payoff. Different from non-cooperative games, a Stackelberg game assumes certain decision power for both the leader and followers, with the leader possessing a higher priority. The followers have to make their decisions subject to the leader’s strategy. All strategies of the followers form a rational response set (RRS), based on which the leader optimizes its payoff in conjunction with the leader’s strategy set.

For product family design, the Stackelberg game players can be the designers or design teams or any virtual decision makers. Decision makers of module configuration design are regarded as the leader, denoted as L. The followers are fulfilled by parameter scaling decisions, denoted as F

                     , for a number of K attributes and a number of J product variants. Then L and Fjk
                      comprise design vectors X and Zjk
                      for the leader and followers, respectively. The leader has a priority to determine its design vector X according to its own objective and constraints; and announce this strategy to the followers Fjk
                     . In lieu of X decisions, the followers Fjk
                      decide design vector Zjk
                      based on their own objectives fjk
                      and constraints. All the followers’ design vectors form the RRS of Fjk
                     , that is,

Based on the Stackelberg game decision model in Eq. (3), a bilevel optimization model can be developed to reveal coupled decision making inherent in product family configuration and scaling design. A bilevel mixed 0–1 non-linear programming model is formulated in the form of upper-level configuration design optimization and lower-level parametric optimization. Identification of shared design variables and setup of feedback mechanisms will be elaborated below.

The upper level deals with module configuration by selecting appropriate modules from a number of J combinations of various attribute levels for all (a number of K) the attribute parameters, including “Null” attribute levels. Introduce a binary variable yj
                        , j
                        =1,…,
                        J, indicating the choice decision for the jth product configuration Pj
                        , such that yj
                        
                        =1 means that Pj
                         is selected and yj
                        
                        =0 indicates that Pj
                         is not selected. Then Y
                        =(y
                        1,…,
                        yJ
                        ) represents a vector of choice decisions for product configuration. Also

                         represents the choice decision vector for the kth attribute of product Pj
                        . Let X

                        XJ

The upper-level objective function should be consistent with the evaluation criteria of configuration design. Among many possible measures, the ultimate goal is to maximize customer satisfaction while leveraging enterprise profitability (Kaul & Rao, 1995). Customer satisfaction is derived from customer-perceived utility of product offerings. Assume Uij

                         is an error term for each segment-product pair. There are a number of methods available to estimate regression utility weights and the constant, given a set of observed choice data, such as full-profile conjoint analysis, adaptive conjoint analysis, and experimental choice analysis (Lewis et al., 2006).

Enterprise profitability is basically related to engineering cost. Jiao and Tseng (2004) propose to model the cost consequences of providing variety based on variation of process capabilities. A process capability index thus lends itself to an instrument for handling the sunk costs related to product families and shared resources. The cost function Cj
                         corresponding to product Pj
                         can be formulated based on the respective process capability index PCIj

                         is a vector depicting the optimum function of the lower-level problem; and pij
                         is the choice probability of product Pj
                         to be selected by customer Si
                        . The choice behavior pij
                         can be determined using discrete choice models, such as a conditional multinomial logit choice rule (Ben-Akiva, 1985).

The upper-level constraints are mainly related to product family configuration design, such as choice compatibility and configuration constraints. Other constraints may be introduced as well. For example, a capacity condition constraint limits the maximal number of products that can be chosen by each segment.

For each individual module resulted from upper-level configuration, the lower level optimization deals with parameter scaling for the associated attribute levels. The objective is to maximize the technical performance of each module and correspondingly find the optimal design parameters. Let zjkm
                         denote the mth design variable (i.e., design parameter) for the kth attribute of product j, where j

                         represents the decision vector of the jkth technical model at the lower level. In other words, Zjk
                         is correlated with Xjk
                         in that Xjk
                         indicates the choice of a specific attribute level for the kth attribute of product j, whilst Zjk
                         represents the relevant design variables (i.e., independent variables) that produce this specific attribute level (i.e., dependent variable). Most design variables are related to geometry and kinetics in typical engineering applications such as dimension and rotation speed. When interpreting utility of price as one attribute at the upper level, the related design variable at the lower level is product pricing. Let Zj
                        
                        =(Zj
                        
                        1,…,
                        ZjK
                        ) represent the design vector of product j for a total number of K attributes. Then Z
                        =(Z
                        1,…,
                        ZJ
                        ) describes the entire decision vector of the lower level.

The lower-level objective function is defined for each relevant attribute (variable) selected through the upper-level configuration, whose value is to be optimized. General types of attributes include (Jin & Danesh, 2006): functionality-related attributes (e.g., rigidity, accuracy, etc.), physical attributes (e.g., weight, shape, etc.), ergonomics- or environmental-related attributes (e.g., comfortableness, radiation, etc.), and economic-related attributes (e.g., price, utility, sales, profit, etc.). Each lower-level objective function defines Zjk
                         as independent variables and (Y, X) as parametric variables. The result after optimization is an optimum function,

Lower-level constraints involve two aspects. One is about the technical requirements of a specific domain related to that attribute. For example, constraints in the mechanical domain may be related to geometry, tolerance, kinetics and mechanics. Other technical domains may involve electronics or materials, as well as market competition, costing, and price fluctuation. Also the constraints may be in an inequality or an equality form. Since most constraints are of engineering characteristics, it is often necessary to turn to numerical or simulation methods, such as finite element methods and response surface methods. The other type of constraints come from the requirements of the upper-level problem, including the value range or option set of an attribute determined through module configuration, as well as tradeoffs among various attributes of a product configuration.

                        K bilevel non-linear mixed integer programming problem. In the above decision model, J
                        + denotes the upper bound of the number of product variants contained in the product family. The technical requirements of product j for the kth attribute domain are described as Eqs. (8.8) and (8.9). Constraint Eq. (8.10) refers to the interval of the attribute level for the kth attribute of product j. Constraint Eq. (8.11) confines the value of the kth attribute in product j. Eq. (8.1) is a conjoint analysis constraint defined to ensure that the composite utility of a segment for a product can be constructed from part-worth utilities of individual attribute levels. Exclusiveness condition constraints (Eqs. (8.2) and (8.3)) enforce that exactly one and only one level of each attribute can be chosen for each product. Likewise a divergence condition constraint Eq. (8.4) requires that several products to be offered must pairwise differ in at least one attribute level.

The upper level control the lower level through (Y, X), indicating a priority for determining product family configuration. The lower level entails a parametric programming problem, in which (Y, X) are parametric variables, suggesting that parametric optimization must be compitable with module configuration. The lower level returns an optimum function

                         are given (e.g., pre-defined), the decision model of Eq. (8) can be regarded as a pure product family configuration design problem. On the other hand, when the upper-level attribute levels are decided, that is, (Y, X) are given, the decision model of Eq. (8) becomes a pure parameter optimization problem. In this regard, traditional module-based or scale-based product family design is a single-level optimization problem that can be regarded as a special case of the joint bilevel model.

Solution of Eq. (8) depends on the complexity of the model, which is related to the scale of the model as well as complication of constituent functions; for example, how many attributes and their levels are involved; if there is any commonly shared design variable/parameter; if the attribute optimization model belongs to a convex programming problem? Bilevel solutions are generally categorized as direct and indirect methods: to directly solve the original bilevel problem or to convert the bilevel problem to a single-level problem.

Direct methods follow the bilevel decision mechanism. It starts with the upper-level optimization problem and finds one (intermediate) solution first. Then the lower level uses the corresponding upper-level variables in this intermediate solution as parametric variables to solve the lower-level problem. If the lower-level solution is identical to the upper-level solution, then this solution is regarded as the optimum of the entire model. Otherwise iterate this procedure, incorporating certain heuristics, until a satisfactory result is reached. For example, Lai (1996) develops a satisfactory solution procedure adopting a heuristic rule that the leader first sets memberships of optimality of its possible objective values and decisions; and asks followers for their optima calculated in isolation under given constraints. Then the followers’ decisions are submitted to and modified by the leader until a best preferred solution is reached. Emam (2006) proposes to establish tolerance membership functions for both the upper-level and lower-level problems; and then construct a separate single-level optimization model, based on which to modify the membership functions through iterative solution. Since the upper level of Eq. (8) involves 0–1 variables, it is possible to enforce lower-level constraints through implicit enumeration (Li & Sun, 2006). Of course when the number of attributes levels is small, direct solutions can be fulfilled by enumeration.

Indirect solutions are supposed to identify certain conditions, so as to convert the bilevel model to an equivalent single-level problem. As a result, bilevel solutions are obtained by solving this single-level problem. When every lower-level problem exhibits a convex programming problem, the lower-level problems can be replaced with KKT conditions (Fortuny-Amat & McCarl, 1981). Thus Eq. (8) can be converted to a single-level mixed integer non-linear programming problem. When the constituent functions at the lower level are of simple forms, for example, when only range-related constraints are involved, it is possible to employ numerical methods like response surface methods to approximate

However, a complex case is that the lower level contains certain design variables that are commonly shared among various attributes. This means that design vectors Zj
                     
                     1,…,
                     ZjK
                      for the attributes of product Pj
                      contain certain variables that appear repeatedly, that is, ∀Zjk
                      and

                     . A general approach to this case is to make proper transformation to eliminate the shared design variables and to see if it can be further converted to a single-level program. Then there are two possible scenarios. One is that every attribute can decide its design variables on its own, although the choice of this attribute is subject to decisions of other attributes. Then it can be regarded as a number of J Nash equilibrium problems involving K players, which can be formulated as an equilibrium programming problem and needs to find equilibrium solutions for the lower level (Zangwill & Garcia, 1981). The other scenario is to consolidate all the constraints of different products and their attributes into a common set of constraints. Then the original bilevel problem can be converted to a number of J multi-objective programming problems, each of which involves a number of K objectives. If not possible to consolidate constraints, then an extra coordination level can be added based on the CO approach (Kroo et al., 1994) to excrete the shared design variables. In practical applications, it is important to by all means simplify computational burden by analyzing the domain problems. For example, the initial problem size may be large. But after analysis and reformulation, the size could be reduced, and thus direct methods like enumeration or implicit enumeration can be used to find solutions.

Owing to the capability to function on both direct current and alternating current, universal electric motors are widely used for household appliances. A universal electric motor consists of a number of modules. Main design parameters include number of wire turns on the armature Nc
                        , number of wire turns on each field pole Ns
                        , cross-sectional area of armature wire Awa
                         (square millimeter), cross-sectional area of field wire Awf
                         (square millimeter), radius of the motor r
                        0 (centimeter), thickness of the stator t (centimeter), current drawn by the motor I (ampere), and stack length of the motor L (centimeter). Consider a universal electric motor product family, whose design ranges are specified as: 100⩽
                        Nc
                        
                        ⩽1500; 1⩽
                        Ns
                        
                        ⩽500; 0.01⩽
                        Awa
                        , Awf
                        
                        ⩽1square millimeter; 1⩽
                        r
                        0
                        ⩽10centimeter; 0.05⩽
                        t
                        ⩽1centimeter; 0.1⩽
                        I
                        ⩽6ampere; and 0.057⩽
                        L
                        ⩽5.18centimeter. Let R denote the set of design variables that meet these range constraints. Performance of universal electric motors is mainly characterized by efficiency (η), output power (P), torque (T), and mass (M). For detailed domain models of these attributes, the readers may refer to the equations relating the motor design variables to the system performances, which are summarized by Simpson, Maier, and Mistree (2001) based on analyses from Chapman (1991) and Cogdell (1990).

Five attributes are relevant to module configuration, including efficiency, torque, overload protection, frame size, and enclosure. Among them, efficiency and torque should be assumed by all product variants, whereas overload protection, frame size and enclosure are optional features and may not appear in all product variants. Considering modularization, the efficiency attribute assumes 2 attribute levels: [60%,70%] and [70%,80%]. Torque possesses 3 attribute levels: [0.1,0.3]newton per meter, [0.3,0.5]newton per meter, and [0.5,0.7]newton per meter. Overload protection offers attribute levels at low, medium, and high, corresponding to manual reset, locked rotor only, and automatic reset, respectively. Its 4th attribute level is “Null”, meaning that the overload protection feature is not equipped. Attribute frame size contains 3 attribute levels: 24″, 36″, and 48″. An extra attribute level can be defined as “Null”, indicating no frame module is offered. The enclosure module has 4 options: open drip proof (ODP), semi-enclosure (SE), total enclosure with fan cooling (TEFC), and “Null” (meaning not available). Overall, this implies a total number of J
                        =384 possible product configurations. Based on market research and engineering costing, the company has decided to target no more than J
                        +
                        =4 product variants in the product family to be designed. The problem is how to design an optimal universal electric motor product family considering both module configuration and parametric optimization.

Elaborate Eq. (8) according to technical information of universal electric motor design. Both the upper- and lower-level models are tailored to the domain models.

                           . Conjoint analysis starts with the construction of product profiles. Given a total number of J
                           =384 possible combinations, using the Taguchi Orthogonal Array Selector provided in SPSS software (www.spss.com), a total number of 20 orthogonal product profiles are generated, as shown in Table 1
                           . With these profiles, a fractional factorial experiment is designed for exploring customer preferences, for which 40 customers are invited as the respondents. The results of conjoint analysis are given in Table 2
                           . Table 2 also shows the part-worth standard times for all attribute levels. The part-worth standard time of each attribute level is established based on work and time studies of the related assembly and testing operations. Based on empirical studies, costing parameters are specified as LSLT
                           
                           =500 (second) and β

While utilities of specific attribute levels, uikl
                           , are relatively stable during configuration design, composite utilities at the product-level,

The lower level contains three parametric optimization models for the efficiency, torque and overload protection attributes, respectively. Each model deals with the technical requirements and range constraints for each individual attribute. Frame size and enclosure are optional attributes for module configuration, and thus no need to engage them in lower-level optimization.

The efficiency attribute is of maximization type, whose constraints involve the technical requirements of the output power and torque attributes. The parametric optimization model for η is given as the following:

The torque attribute should maximize its performance within a certain range. Since the output power is related to torque and rotation speed, and the speed is relevant to the windings on both the field and the armature, the torque is constrained by the mass. Therefore, the parametric optimization model for T is given as the following:

Initial analysis of model complexity suggests that the number of variables and constraints are large. Eqs. (9)–(11) indicate that there exist commonly shared design variables. Therefore it is necessary to transform the model before adopting the right solution strategy.

All three lower-level parametric optimization models contain shared design variables and involve joint decisions regarding η, T, and O. It is possible to consolidate the constraints associated with these attributes and to transform these three individual optimization models to a 3-objective mathematical programming problem.

The above transformed model contains no more shared design variable; but the lower level is not a convex programming problem, nor is the model able to be transformed to a single-level program. It is also difficult to adopt satisfactory methods, as formulation of satisfactory membership functions tends to be complex when involving both the upper- and lower-level problems. Note that the upper-level model aims at summation over all the product variants, while the lower-level constraints differ only in settings of attribute levels regardless of identities of product variants. This suggests that diverse X instances are only different in terms of the sequence of notation. It is thus reasonable to fix a certain X (for example, any product profile in Table 1) as the baseline model and consider joint optimization of Y and lower-level 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       a
                                    
                                    
                                       j

                           . As a result, the number of variables in the model can be reduced dramatically. It is also meaningful to limit the values of certain design variables as constants to further simplify the model. For example, Simpson et al. (2001) suggest a common practice of dimensioning: Awa
                           
                           =0.241square millimeter; Awf
                           
                           =0.376square millimeter; and t
                           =0.666centimeter. After such simplification, implicit enumeration can be applied to solve the model. Fig. 3
                            shows the interactions when solving the upper- and lower-level problems.

Finally computational solutions are obtained using software Lingo and Matlab. Normalized results are shown in Fig. 4
                           . Fig. 4(a) illustrates how the optimal levels of product attributes responds to product configuration. It clearly shows that the optimal attribute values vary with respect to the product choice decisions, indicating that product family module configuration should be coupled with parametric product family optimization. Fig. 4(b) shows product family performance corresponding to settings of product attribute levels, indicating overall product family design yields a leverage of maximizing shared surplus with optimal settings of attribute values.

The final optimal solution (Y

                           ∗, Z
                           ∗) is summarized in Table 3
                           . Product choice vector Y
                           ∗
                           =(0,…,0,1,0,…,0,1,0,…,0,1,0,…,0,1,0,…,0) contains 384 dimensions, in which the 184th, 360th, 372th and 376th dimensions assume a value of 1, indicating that the corresponding 4 product variants are selected to comprise an optimal product family. Vector X
                           ∗ represents the optimal module configuration design with optimal settings of attribute levels for each product variant. Vector Z
                           ∗ depicts the results of parametric optimization, bearing the optimal values of related design parameters for each optimal attribute level. Performance of the optimal product family design is determined as (F
                           ∗, A
                           ∗), where F
                           ∗=1.206958 is the maximal shared surplus expected for optimal product family attribute settings A
                           ∗.

                        Table 3 shows that an optimal product family design is resulted from joint optimization of module configuration and parameter scaling. The optimal configuration design suggests 4 product variants, each of which consists of optimal configuration of modules and attribute levels. For each module, parametric optimization yields the optimal values of related design parameters (I, L, r
                        0, Nc
                        , and Ns
                        ) in order to achieve the expected performance of the module (efficiency, torque, overload protection, frame size, and enclosure). Correspondence between Z
                        ∗ and A
                        ∗ indicates that optimal product configuration and optimal parametric design are generated simultaneously from the bilevel optimization model. While products X
                        184, X
                        360 and X
                        376 all include a frame module, product X
                        372 instantiates no frame option. This indicates that the product architecture is allowed to be configurable during parameter scaling design. To the contrary, traditional scale-based product family design must conform to a given product architecture, where only parametric changes are allowed within a fixed module structure.


                        Fig. 5
                         compares 12 alternatives of product configuration by their normalized performance measures in terms of utility, cost and the shared surplus. The top 4 products (#1, #2, #3 and #4) lend themselves to be the optimal solution in response to a threshold of J
                        +
                        =4. It is interesting to observe that the peak of utility (product #6) does not contribute to the best shared surplus as its cost is estimated to be high. Also minimum cost (product #9) does not mean optimal performance in terms of shared surplus measure as its utility performance is low as well. It is reasonable to define product family-level performance (shared surplus) as a leading design problem, while performances of individual modules are defined to be the following design problems. Such a leader–follower bilevel decision structure reveals the inherent hierarchical decision making between module-based and scale-based product family designs.


                        Simpson et al. (2001) develop a scale-based product family design case study based on universal electric motors. The original study is about single-level goal programming that adopts two objectives (i.e., mass and efficiency). It is basically a pure parametric optimization problem and does not deal with module configuration. This research extends the original case study to consider joint optimization of both parameter scaling and module configuration. In addition to lower-level engineering objectives related to parametric optimization, we further incorporate higher-level objectives pertaining to module configuration and enterprise-level perspectives to the product family.

Product family design has traditionally addressed module configuration and scaling design as separate decisions or aggregate two design problems as a single-level, all-in-one optimization problem. This paper emphasizes the coupling between module-based and scale-based product family designs and integrates product family configuration and scaling design into a coherent joint optimization framework. Product configuration and parameter optimization are not only coupled in decision making, but also entail a leader–follower hierarchical decision structure. Module configuration plays a leader’s role and aims at the performance of the entire product family. Parameter scaling acts as followers that respond to the leader’s decisions regarding module combination and attribute selection. Focusing on parametric optimization of each individual module, the followers provide feedbacks to confine the leader’s configuration decisions.

The proposed Stackelberg game model reveals a bilevel decision structure inherent in joint optimization of module configuration and parameter scaling. A bilevel optimization model comprises an upper-level optimization problem and a lower-level optimization problem. The upper level seeks for an optimal configuration of modules and module attributes by maximizing the shared surplus of the product family. The lower level looks for optimal design parameters of each module to achieve the configured attribute levels by the upper level. The bilevel joint optimization model excels in leveraging optimal scaling in conjunction with optimal module configuration.

The bilevel optimization model may be extended to deal with many other decision scenarios of product family design. For example, common product platform design can act as the leader and custom design can be the followers. It is also possible to treat modular product platforming as the leader and modeling life-cycle modularity as the followers. Solution of bilevel optimization is an important avenue for future research. In particular most engineering problems are associated with commonly shared decision variables or non-structured function relationships. It is necessary to incorporate bilevel programming theories with numerical and simulation-based solutions that are widely applied in practical applications.
