                  Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) are the most popular systems of the modern era due to their abilities to disseminate the safety related information to the moving vehicles on time. For efficient data dissemination, vehicles form a cluster with other vehicles in VCPS environment. But, due to high velocity and constant topological changes, cluster maintenance is one of the most difficult tasks to be performed in this environment. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Learning Automata (LA)-based hybrid clustering scheme for vehicles in VCPS environment. We have improved our existing solution Energy Efficient Predictive Clustering (EEPC) approach, by incorporating the future mobility prediction computed by LA stationed on the vehicles. For this purpose, a Predictive Clustering Algorithm using Learning Automata (PCALA) is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme with respect to various metrics. Results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the existing EEPC scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The latest advancements in wireless communication technologies are the key enabler for making the life of people easier and comfortable. In the modern era, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), a large collection of objects/devices are interconnected with one another for data sharing, and information dissemination. In IoT, vehicles can be viewed as intelligent objects which are capable of taking intelligent decisions. The existing wireless technology integrated with vehicular environment improve user safety, driving conditions, and comfort of the end users. Wireless networks integrated with vehicular environment are characterized by highly dynamic nature that affects the performance of various routing and data dissemination solutions in VCPS environment. The unknown time varying characteristics impact signal strength, spectrum allocation, and the movement patterns of vehicles. The variations in these parameters generate the need to design efficient protocols for clustering and data dissemination in VCPS environment.

Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have several characteristics such as mobile nature of vehicles, unlimited battery power and storage, delay in transmitting messages and predictable movement of vehicles that differentiate them from contemporary ad hoc networks. Vehicles communicate with neighboring vehicles for information exchange in a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) manner. Also, when vehicles communicate through a fixed equipment next to road called as Road Side Unit (RSU), then it is called as Vehicle-to-Roadside unit (V2R) communication [1]. Apart from this, On Board Unit (OBU) is also included in vehicles which is a device mounted on-board vehicle and is used for exchanging information with RSU’s.

Communication between vehicles allows sharing of different types of information for applications related to safety, user convenience, entertainment, and multimedia sharing. However, safety and passenger convenience are the two most important VANET applications [2,3]. In some cases, communication in vehicular environment tends to slow down due to congestion which temporarily disrupts the network efficiency as a large number of vehicles generate data and share it with other vehicles. To minimize this problem that mainly occurs due to flooding and causes inefficient message broadcast, several clustering algorithms for VANETs environment have been designed in literature. Vehicles form clusters among themselves for information sharing and data dissemination. Each cluster in the network has at least one Cluster Head (CH) selected by other Cluster Nodes (CN’s). The clustering algorithms provide improvements in VANETs characteristics such as efficiency, stability, reducing transmission overhead, simplified routing and efficient usage of the network resources.

The cluster formation process in VANETs specifically addresses the requirement of creating a hierarchical structure that improves network efficiency. Although VANETs can function without a cluster also, but the use of clustering provides an efficient usage of network resources and it increases data dissemination efficiency. Current solutions to this problem are primarily based on vehicles characteristics and network performance parameters such as vehicle speed, density and distance to the final destination. But, these existing solutions fail to predict the future mobility of the vehicles which can be used to improve the overall performance of any solution designed for VCPS environment. The main contribution of this work is to present a Learning Automata (LA)-based solution to the clustering problem for creating clusters based on prediction of future positions of vehicles to improve cluster stability which in turn, provides an efficient vehicular environment.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

To improve road safety and user convenience, a number of solutions using vehicular technology have been proposed in the literature. But, these solutions are not sufficient to get real-time interaction with the environment for achieving satisfactory data dissemination. In this direction, clustering of vehicles has received a lot of attention with an aim to obtain optimal performance of the network with respect to parameters such as high throughput, and reduced delay. However, constrained mobility patterns, high density along with high speed make clustering a challenging task. Hence, there is a requirement of prediction of the position of vehicles by estimating their future mobility. Accurate prediction also assists in making clusters more stable which ultimately improves the network performance. Thus, there is a need of a clustering scheme based on accurate future mobility prediction. Moreover, LA have been used in wide range of application to get a real-time interaction with the environment using which efficient algorithms for monitoring the states of vehicles can be designed. We have also motivated by our previous solutions [5–7,16–20], where we have applied LA in various engineering applications. The performance of these solutions are found satisfactory in comparison to the other existing solutions in the literature. Thus, motivated from these factors, we propose a clustering scheme which improves the prediction accuracy of existing EEPC clustering scheme [4]. Distributed LA are used in the proposed scheme for improving the performance of the VCPS.

In this paper, the results of Predictive Clustering Algorithm [4] are extended by observing the inherent shortcoming of current scheme. Specifically, we emphasize on efficiency and stability of clustering schemes by predicting the future positions of vehicles. Furthermore whereas, existing schemes for clustering in VANETs were focused on divergent vehicular characteristics for cluster formation, we propose an enhanced predictive clustering scheme. The main contributions of this work are as follows.

                           
                              •
                              A new LA-based CH election method is proposed to handle a wide range of vehicular movements which provides stability to different clusters.

A new LA-based prediction technique is introduced for improving the efficiency of message dissemination and overall network performance.

A centralized cloud-based backbone selection method is incorporated into the vehicular network to optimize the cluster stability.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the literature on clustering algorithms in VANETs and Learning Automata. Section 3 describes the system design and different steps of proposed Predictive Clustering Algorithm using Learning Automata (PCALA). In Section 4, we provide a detailed description of our proposed predictive clustering scheme. The performance of proposed PCALA is evaluated using extensive simulations in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This section is subdivided in two parts-clustering-based VANETs, and LA-based proposals. The key proposals relevant to each subsection are discussed in the following sections.

Bali et al. [8] reviewed different clustering schemes and introduced a taxanomy for the existing clustering schemes. Open issues and various challenges while performing clustering are also discussed in this paper. Daenabi et al. [9] proposed an efficient clustering algorithm based on weighted clustering. In addition, authors have also proposed algorithms for allocation of transmission range that guarantees connectivity and data transmission among vehicles and monitors the behavior of the vehicles. Dror et al. [10] proposed fast hierarchical clustering algorithm (HCA). Their goal was to create one hop cluster-based network without the use of global positioning system for transmission of safety messages.

Kakkasageri et al. [11] proposed a multi-agent driven dynamic clustering of vehicles for VANETs based upon direction of mobility pattern of vehicle speed and degree of connectivity to another vehicles. In their scheme, CH is selected based upon the stability matrix which is calculated from speed of the vehicle, time-to-live and degree of connectivity. Su et al. [12] proposed a cluster-based multi-channel communication scheme that integrates clustering with MAC protocols. The focus was to improve the performance of MAC layer by creating vehicle clusters and allowing the designated CH to coordinate the access to shared medium by all nodes. Paridel et al. [13] proposed context-based grouping for efficient collaboration in VANETs. Luo et al. [14] designed a new routing protocol for VANETs based on cluster-based routing. Song et al. [15] proposed a cluster-based directional routing protocol in VANETs.

Learning Automata (LA) are codes which can be executed in a particular environment to perform their tasks. This subsection reviews some of the most important applications where LA have been used and provide significant results. Kumar et al. [5–7,16–20] have used LA in various applications where LA are assumed as the players in the game. Authors have exploited various aspects of real-time applications using the concept of LA and adaptive learning in these proposals. Kumar et al. [5–7] also incorporated Cyber-Physical System for data dissemination and Smart Grids. Mostafaei and Meybodi [21] proposed energy-efficient barrier coverage algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in which automaton located at each sensor node help to select the node which guarantees strong barrier coverage at any interval of time. Torkestani [22] proposed LA-based adaptive polling scheme for clustered wireless ad hoc networks which enhances channel utilization by assigning each host a portion of bandwidth according to its need. Each CH takes advantage of LA and learns the traffic parameters of its own cluster members.

Misra et al. [23] proposed LA-based wireless channel reservation as a new medium access scheme which helps in decreasing the unnecessary delays during channel access leading to better channel utilization. LA approach was used to implement the reservation for accessing the channel for single hop wireless network. Kumar et al. [24] proposed LA-based Opportunity Data Aggregation and Forwarding scheme for alert generation in VANETs. LA deployed at RSUs collect and forwards the data from regions along with alert generation. LA then predicts the vehicles mobility and aggregates the data. A newly defined metric called opportunity aggregation and forwarding help LA to select the destination and path for data transfer. Torkestani and Meybodi [25] proposed link stability based multicast routing protocol for wireless network in which LA help in finding multi cast route which is stable against host mobility. The multicast route having maximum expected duration of time is considered as the most stable. The route with expected duration of time is rewarded and other is penalized and then the most stable multicast route was found using LA.

LA operate by selecting an action at instant t. Let α(t) be the selected action from the set of actions A. Generally, this action is selected based on a probability updating algorithm or a reinforcement scheme. This action is then provided as input to stochastic environment which respond with a reaction β(t). Then an automation computes 
                           
                              α

                         by using the probability updating scheme. This cycle is then repeated for subsequent iterations. The key objective of LA-based scheme is to identify an action that provides optimum reward for the proposed clustering scheme. The objective function for the proposed scheme is stated as follows.

In the proposed clustering scheme, the future predicted position which is a measure of prediction accuracy for vehicles is improved using LA. Every periodic prediction is controlled and monitored by an auotmaton that takes the decision regarding the final predicted position of vehicles based on current traffic conditions and relative positions of vehicles within the cluster. Initially, each vehicle computes its future position using the approach proposed in [4]. This predicted position along with the current prediction accuracy is then used by on board LA to further improve the prediction accuracy of vehicles. We have used the LRI
                         based approach in the proposed scheme. In this scheme, after selection of an action ai
                         at time instant t, the reinforcement scheme is applied. The updating rules for the LRI
                         scheme are defined as follows.

                         < 1). Typically, λr
                         is close to unity. An automaton also considers the density and current relative speed by taking into account the acceleration and deceleration of a vehicle with respect to it’s neighboring vehicles to take the decision regarding its future positions. Following steps describe the working of the proposed PCALA approach.


                        Step 1: Initialize the value of decision variables for representing the prediction accuracy and the future predicted position of the vehicles.

                         is selected by the jth
                         vehicle at time t.


                        Step 4: Generate the set of possible actions using the value of respective probability distribution and selects some actions randomly based on the value of P
                        
                           m, d(t).


                        Step 5: Use the value of thresh(t) to determine the next state and response of the automation using the prediction based probability distribution accuracy vector.


                        Step 6: Update the probability distribution vector by increasing the probability if the new prediction values result in more accurate predictions. However, if the new predictions are inferior, then the probability is not modified since the LA is based on LRI
                         scheme. Hence, following holds.

                           Theorem 1
                           
                              The predicted future positions of the vehicle and its actual value is bounded by an upper bound,
                           

Consider the process of vehicle prediction by using the Markov decision process for vehicular movements. We can formulate the vehicular position estimation as follows.

                               indicates the state at time t. at
                               is the action taken from finite set of actions A at stage i and ut
                               is a random adjustment value at ith

The value of ut
                               is dependent on the reinforcement scheme Q and it represents the uncertainty in the system and is independent of the other vehicular parameters. So, we have the following condition.

                              The automoton samples the actions with respect to the current probability distribution and the value of V
                              * at every iteration.

If a given action a(t) is sampled then its count variable N
                              
                                 a(t)(d
                              0) is also incremented. So, the environment response is obtained as follows.

                              The above process is repeated until we do not obtain feasible values of prediction. Since each computation of Δi
                               helps in improving the overall prediction accuracy. So, we conclude that the proposed scheme converges to an optimal value after finite number of iterations. Let K be the maximum number of stages after which the scheme converges to an optimal value. Therefore, we say that the complexity of the proposed scheme is bounded by the number of stages K.

The proposed PCALA scheme considers the predicted positions of a vehicle and takes into account the restricted mobility patterns of vehicles. By forming a cluster based on a vehicles future positions on the road, PCALA results in an efficient usage of network resources. Following sections describe the proposed scheme in detail.

In PCALA, every vehicle first estimates its future position by considering its present position and the average velocity. Unlike most of the existing schemes where periodic beacon messages are required to be transmitted, PCALA utilizes the computing capability of each vehicle to generate its own future position. Since a vehicle only computes its own predicted position, message overheads are reduced. The prediction is performed after fixed periodic intervals denoted by t. The predicted position is also determined based on computation procedure used in [4],

                        After computing its future position, an on board distributed automaton further optimizes the prediction value. The vehicular density and average relative speed of the vehicles are used by an automaton to improve the accuracy of predicted values. The main objective of the automaton is to minimize the difference between the predicted position and it’s obtained actual position, i.e.,

The final predicted position of vehicles is determined by considering the accumulated past prediction accuracy and the difference of actual and predicted positions of that vehicle during the previous iteration. The predicted values of vehicles are then used to generate its position which becomes the input to LA. Algorithm 1
                         describes the procedure to compute the predicted estimated position.

The proposed LA based clustering scheme is described in Algorithms 2
                        , and 3
                        . The vehicles first initialize the prediction accuracy vector based on the threshold value of the prediction accuracies. Then, they compute their prediction accuracy and an automaton modifies these values based on it’s current actions. By repeating the above process for k iterations till required accuracy below the threshold level is not achieved, an automaton helps to achieve relatively high value of accuracy in prediction.

We have used the a prediction accuracy vector 
                           
                              P
                              →
                           
                         to represent the prediction probability of action at a particular instant of time. Here, 
                           
                              P
                              →
                           
                         consists of three parameters Eit, Uit
                         
                        and 
                        Rit
                         that denote three possible variations by LA. These variations are based on the difference between the predicted, and actual position of vehicles.

As shown in Fig. 3
                        , the value of prediction accuracy can be enhanced (Eit
                        ), kept unchanged (Uit
                        ), or reduced (Rit
                        ) which then affects the prediction accuracy for the vehicle. Fig. 3 classifies a vehicle into three states named as Naive or Beginner, Learner or Average and Learned or Expert prediction state. Based upon its prediction accuracy, a vehicle can belong to any of these three states at the start and then depending upon its current prediction, the vehicle moves from one state to another.

The procedure for modifying the prediction accuracy starts with the value of the vector initialized to a random value which is assumed to be in the currently feasible range. Then, the network initiates the learning phase where, LRI
                         based strategy is used for identifying more suitable values by increasing or decreasing the prediction accuracy. To achieve this objective, an automaton raises or lowers the current action probability vector associated with each vehicle. The associated probability vector for this assignment is then modified to yield the updated solution and the new probability vector. Following scenarios are considered for updating the value of probability vectors.


                        Scenario I: This is the scenario when the prediction accuracy index of the node is at the lowest possible value, called the ‘naive’ state. In such a case, following holds.

The final solution vector comprises of prediction accuracies that exhibits Sit
                         probability values which are closest to the converging value unity. The closer this value is to unity, higher the level of accuracy in the predicted position of each vehicle. Using this method, Algorithm 2 describes the initial configuration as well as updating strategies for the proposed prediction scheme.

Once each vehicle has determined its future position, the decision about the next CH to be selected is done using a centralized computing environment such as-RSU and vehicular clouds. The nodes elect the CH by transmitting their predicted position to the cloud-based repository. However, instead of using traditional graph-based metrics, the proposed scheme uses a cluster formation parameter (σ) for creating the dominating set. The number of neighboring nodes is computed based on the transmission range of the vehicles. All the vehicles within the transmission range are assumed to be the neighbors of the other vehicle. The value of σ is based on the number of neighboring nodes. Initially, the node with higher σ values are elected as Dominating nodes or CHs and the nodes in their one-hop neighborhood then assume the role of Dominatee nodes. Algorithm 4
                         describes the key steps performed in the selection of CH using Connected Dominating Sets.The proposed algorithm performs both probability updating and action selection in a small interval of time irrespective of the number of actions.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, ns-2 simulator was used. Vehicular mobility traces were generated using SUMO traffic simulator. The network scenario used in the simulation consists of vehicles moving in urban scenario with the road map based on Chandigarh city as shown in Fig. 4
                     . The map consists of bidirectional lanes where the number of lanes in each direction varies between 1 and 3.

The parameters considered for evaluation are delay, throughput, overhead, and packet loss. All simulations were done with different set of vehicles which enter the Chandigarh city from different entry points and the vehicles meet at traffic light junctions and roundabouts. The values of main parameters used in the simulation are summarized in Table 1
                     .

We have evaluated and compared the PCALA approach with our previous existing clustering scheme, the Energy Efficient Predictive Clustering (EEPC) [4]. To evaluate the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm, following performance metrics were used.

                        
                           •
                           
                              Prediction Variance: It is defined as the difference between the predicted position of a vehicle and subsequent actual position that the vehicle reaches at any instant.


                              Prediction Variance per Second: It is defined as the prediction accuracy of a node in predicting its position for every unit time interval.


                              Average Prediction Accuracy: It is defined as the prediction accuracy of the vehicle over a n number of consecutive prediction.


                              End-to-End Message Latency: It is defined as the total time taken by a packet to reach to its destination using the elected CHs.


                              Average Cluster Head lifetime: It is defined as the average time period for which a node acts as a CH with respect to the number of CH nodes.


                              Percentage of CHs or CH density: It is defined as the ratio of number of CHs to the total number of nodes at discrete time interval.


                              Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): It is defined as the number of successful packets received to the total number of packets transmitted in a unit interval of time.


                     Fig. 5
                      presents the variation in prediction variance as a function of the prediction interval. The results obtained indicate that the difference in the value of the prediction variance increases as we increase the prediction interval for both the schemes. This may be attributed to the fact that the higher prediction interval increases the prediction variation due to the vehicular traffic conditions. However, the use of LA appreciably decreases this variation, especially when the prediction interval increases.


                     Fig. 6
                      describes the comparative relationship between the average prediction accuracy and the prediction interval for the predictive clustering schemes. The results obtained show that the prediction accuracy ranges between a small value for both the clustering schemes. The value of prediction accuracy reaches its optimum level at 70 s. The results also show that the value of prediction accuracy for PCALA is better than the existing scheme.


                     Fig. 7
                      describes the variation between the average prediction accuracy in terms of number of vehicles. The results are plotted for a prediction interval of 70 s as it results in optimum values of prediction accuracy for both PCALA and EEPC. The PCALA approach achieves a superior value of prediction accuracy as compared to the traditional predictive clustering scheme based on distance. The average prediction accuracy for PCALA shows a minor variation in the interval of approximately 37–43 m with the number of vehicles whereas for EEPC, this variation is between 90 and 130 m for the same number of vehicles. This is due to the incorporation of LA into the prediction schemes which results in better and stable prediction.


                     Fig. 8
                      compares the average prediction accuracy and prediction intervals for PCALA and existing prediction scheme. Fig. 8 shows that the variation in average prediction accuracy for PCALA is better as compared to EEPC. This is attributed by the fact that PCALA considers the existing vehicular conditions for generating a real-time prediction. LA continuously learn from its environment and take their action accordingly. This helps in achieving better prediction accuracy.


                     Fig. 9
                      describes the relationship between average CH duration and vehicle speed. The proposed PCALA algorithm gives better value than the conventional predictive algorithm. However, the value of average CH lifetime decreases with an increase in maximum lane speed for both PCALA and EEPC. This is because at high speed, the CH remains in the cluster for a lesser amount of time. As the traffic density increases, average CH lifetime decreases for both the techniques. This is due to the fact that in more dense traffic scenarios, a CH comes in the transmission range of comparatively more CHs. This results in higher number of cluster formation. The average CH duration in PCALA is approximately between 35 and 54 s whereas, it varies approximately between 19 and 34 s in the case of EEPC. Thus, PCALA provides higher cluster stability due to the superior value of CH duration.

As shown in Fig. 10
                     , the percentage number of CHs increases with an increase in vehicle speed. The number of CHs increase as the speed of vehicle increases for both PCALA and EEPC. This pattern occurs because at high speed, the existing clusters break down into small clusters frequently and new clusters are built. However, cluster-density is higher in the low traffic scenario than in high traffic environment and it increases on faster lanes. This occur because less clusters in the low traffic scenario may deteriorate communication between vehicles. The PCALA clustering mechanism avoids such situation by increasing the number of clusters as compared to EEPC and provides better network connectivity to vehicles.

In Fig. 11
                     , variation in end-to-end latency is compared against the prediction intervals for different number of nodes. The results obtained show that the latency increases linearly with an increase in prediction interval and LA help to achieve lower latency. Although the end-to-end latency increases with prediction interval for both PCALA and EEPC, but PCALA has marginally lower latency for all the prediction intervals. The value of latency also increases as the number of nodes are increased. Since the packet overheads are reduced in PCALA due to comparatively less beacon messages transmitted which reduces the latency. The EEPC scheme requires periodic transmission of beacon messages for updating the prediction accuracy parameters. However in PCALA, every node performs the prediction based on its own vehicular dynamics. This helps in reducing the latency in PCALA.


                     Fig. 12
                      describes the variation of PDR in terms of prediction interval. The increased prediction interval causes higher message overhead which decrease the value of PDR as the prediction interval increases. The PDR for both EEPC and PCALA decreases as the prediction accuracy increases. This is due to the fact that increased network traffic is observed as the prediction intervals increases. PDR values also decrease when the number of nodes increase from 100 to 300 for both the schemes. However, the PDR of PCALA is higher and ranges approximately from 91% to 96% as compared to 93% to 88% for EEPC. This is because the reduced packet overhead results in better packet delivery in PCALA as compared to EEPC.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents LA-based hybrid predictive clustering scheme to increase the reliability of the message delivery. The proposed scheme uses connected dominating set for cluster head selection. The proposed predictive clustering scheme is compared with the other existing scheme with respect to various parameters. The prediction variance with the average prediction accuracy are computed and compared with the existing scheme in literature. Also, end-to-end delay and PDR are computed by varying the prediction interval. With respect to these parameter, the proposed scheme performs better than the other existing scheme in literature. Specifically, the PDR of the proposed scheme increases to 95% as compared to the existing scheme.

In the future, we will explore the security features of the proposed scheme.
