Longest-edge bisection

                  Longest-edge refinement algorithms were designed to iteratively refine the mesh for finite-element applications by maintaining mesh quality (assuring a bound on the smallest angle). In this paper we improve geometrical results on longest-edge refinement algorithms and provide precise bounds on the refinement propagation. We prove that the iterative application of the algorithm gradually reduces the average extent of the propagation per target triangle, tending to affect only two triangles. We also include empirical results which are in complete agreement with the theory.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Mesh generation and refinement techniques are widely used in applications that require a decomposition of geometric objects for processing. The domain is typically discretized into a mesh composed of triangles. For most applications, the time required to process a geometric object depends on the size and quality of the decomposition. Thus, provably good mesh generation algorithms are desirable.

We consider a conforming 2-dimensional triangulation 
                        τ
                     , where pairs of neighbor triangles have either a common vertex or a common edge. We also assume a quality triangulation in the sense that the minimum angle is greater than or equal to an angle parameter 
                        θ
                     . For a triangle set 
                        S
                        ⊂
                        τ
                     , the triangle-set refinement problem needs to produce a conforming refined triangulation 
                        
                           
                              τ
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                      of quality analogous to 
                        τ
                     , and where every triangle 
                        t
                        ∈
                        S
                      has been refined. Note that for finite element applications, triangle-set 
                        S
                      corresponds to the triangles in 
                        τ
                      with unacceptable finite element error.

Longest-edge refinement algorithms were designed to deal with the iterative triangle-set refinement problem. These algorithms perform local refinement based on the bisection of triangles by their longest edge, and produce conforming triangulations that maintain the quality of the input mesh. The local refinement implies the refinement of the triangles in the current triangle set and some of their neighbor triangles due to refinement propagation.

In this paper we focus on the study of refinement propagation. We show that the iterative application of the algorithm asymptotically reduces the propagation to a constant value (less than three triangles in practice). We prove that the overall quality of the triangulation improves, increasing the area covered by quasi-equilateral triangles and isolating the triangles with the smallest angles.

Given a triangle 
                        t
                        
                           (
                           A
                           B
                           C
                           )
                        
                      of vertices 
                        A
                     , 
                        B
                     , 
                        C
                     , and edges 
                        A
                        B
                        ≥
                        B
                        C
                        ≥
                        C
                        A
                      (Fig. 1
                     (a)), the longest-edge bisection of 
                        t
                      is performed by joining the midpoint 
                        M
                      of 
                        A
                        B
                      with the opposite vertex.

We call any triangle 
                        t
                      that behaves like an equilateral triangle with respect to its iterative longest-edge bisection (Fig. 2
                     ), a quasi-equilateral triangle. For quasi-equilateral triangle 
                        t
                        
                           (
                           A
                           B
                           C
                           )
                        
                     , the longest-edge bisection of its descendants, triangles 
                        A
                        M
                        C
                      and 
                        M
                        N
                        C
                     , is respectively performed by the edges 
                        A
                        C
                      and 
                        M
                        C
                     . Note that these bisections only produce edges parallel to the edges of initial triangle 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     . This implies that at most four similarly distinct triangles are produced: 
                        A
                        B
                        C
                     , 
                        M
                        B
                        C
                     , 
                        A
                        M
                        C
                      and 
                        M
                        N
                        C
                     . Therefore, further longest-edge bisections of 
                        t
                      and its descendants will only produce triangles similar to one of these four triangles.

The mathematical properties of the iterative longest-edge bisection of triangles were studied by Rosenberg and Stenger  [1], Stynes  [2], and Adler  [3]. These can be summarized as follows: (a) for any triangle 
                        t
                      of smallest angle 
                        α
                     , the iterative longest-edge bisection of 
                        t
                      and its descendants produce triangles 
                        
                           
                              t
                           
                           
                              ′
                           
                        
                      whose smallest interior angles are always greater than or equal to 
                        α
                        /
                        2
                      (Fig. 1(b)); (b) every triangle generated is similar to one of a finite number of associated non-similar triangles; (c) the global iterative bisection (the bisection of all the triangles in the preceding level) covers, in a monotonically increasing form, the area of 
                        t
                      with quasi-equilateral triangles.

More recently, Gutierrez et al.  [4] studied the complexity of the iterative bisection of a triangle, introducing a taxonomy of triangles based both on the evolution and the number of non-similar triangles produced. They defined six classes of triangles, considering the geometric position where vertex 
                        C
                      of a triangle 
                        t
                        
                           (
                           A
                           B
                           C
                           )
                        
                      lies, considering that 
                        A
                        B
                        ≥
                        B
                        C
                        ≥
                        C
                        A
                      (Fig. 3
                     (a)). Note that the half-circle of center 
                        M
                      and radius 
                        A
                        M
                      correspond to right-angled triangles. Triangles from Regions I and VI correspond to quasi-equilateral triangles. In  [4] it was proved that the generation of new triangles stops when a quasi-equilateral triangle is obtained, which happens in 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 1
                              
                              
                                 α
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      steps, with 
                        α
                      the smallest angle of 
                        t
                     . This behavior is summarized in Fig. 3(b). The graph shows the path between regions in the generation of new non-similar triangles by longest-edge bisection, as well as the convergence to quasi-equilateral triangles.

The following lemmas summarize these results.


                     
                        Lemma 2.1
                        
                           The iterative bisection of a triangle 
                           
                              t
                              
                                 (
                                 A
                                 B
                                 C
                                 )
                              
                            
                           generates a finite number of non-similar triangles that move throughout the six regions of   
                              Fig.  3
                           (a). Furthermore, Region I or VI triangles generate at most four non-similar triangles.
                        


                     
                        Lemma 2.2
                        
                           The iterative bisection of triangles from Regions  II  to  V  produce a sequence of new non-similar triangles until triangles of Region  I  or  VI  are obtained.
                        

Longest-edge refinement algorithms  [5,6] were designed to deal with the local iterative refinement of triangulations as needed for finite element method applications. In order to refine a set of triangles 
                        S
                      of a triangulation 
                        τ
                     , these algorithms perform the longest-edge bisection of the triangles in 
                        S
                      (and some of their neighbors and descendants) to produce a conforming triangulation, where pairs of neighbor triangles have either a common vertex or a common edge. Fig. 4
                      shows the use of the algorithm to refine the triangle 
                        t
                        
                           (
                           A
                           B
                           C
                           )
                        
                      and how the refinement is propagated in order to obtain a valid (conforming) triangulation.

Longest-edge bisection refinement algorithms inherit the properties discussed in Section  2. In particular it is guaranteed that every refined triangulation has smallest angle 
                        ≥
                        θ
                        /
                        2
                     , where 
                        θ
                      is the smallest angle in the initial triangulation.

The Lepp-bisection algorithm  [6,7] is an efficient formulation of pure longest-edge bisection algorithms  [5], that maintains a conforming triangulation throughout the refinement process. This algorithm is based on the concepts of terminal edges and longest edge propagating path.

An edge 
                        E
                      is called a terminal edge in triangulation 
                        τ
                      if it is the longest edge of every triangle that shares

                        E
                      is an interior edge; if

                        E
                      is a boundary edge.

Firstly, note that independent of the triangle shape, a fixed number of bisections is needed to eliminate non-conforming midpoints situated over either the longest edge, or the second longest edge of

Bedregal and Rivara  [8] showed that working with acceptable quality triangulations the Lepp-bisection algorithm  performs a constant number of bisections per triangle. They extended the classification of Gutierrez et al.  [4] to eliminate non-conforming points. (See Fig. 5
                        .) They proved that any triangle in regions I, V and VI requires at most two bisections to be successfully refined; region II triangles require at most four bisections, while region IV.a triangles require only three. The worst case scenario occurs for triangles in regions III and IV.b, where the number of bisections is bounded by 
                           O

                                    log

                         the triangle’s smallest angle. Since these poor quality triangles tend to insert multiple non-conforming points over their edges (which then propagate to neighboring triangles), they generalize this bound to

                              The average number of longest-edge bisections performed by the Lepp-bisection algorithm to maintain a triangle conforming is constant. Furthermore, this constant is less than  5  for triangles from regions  I, II, IV.a, V  and  VI; for region  III  and  IV.b  triangles, it is bounded by

Here we analyze the evolution of 
                           
                              Lepp
                           
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                         throughout the refinement process. Consider that, (1) whenever a triangle is bisected by the midpoint of its longest edge, a propagated refinement occurs to maintain the mesh valid, and (2) the propagation is finite since the refinement always propagates to bigger triangles.

To refine an individual triangle, the size of the propagation depends on the distribution of terminal triangles in the triangulation since they represent the end of a Lepp. Therefore, the more frequent the terminal triangles are, the shorter the average propagation of the refinement is. In the rest of this section we are interested in measuring the proportion of terminal triangles in a triangulation.

Also, the size of the propagation is directly affected by the presence of terminal triangles in the triangulation since they represent the end of a Lepp. Therefore, the more frequent the terminal triangles are, the shorter the average propagation of the refinement is. We are interested in measuring the proportion of terminal triangles in a triangulation.

In what follows, we show that the percentage of terminal triangles increases as the refinement proceeds. To this end we will take advantage of a result on the 4-Triangles refinement algorithm (a special longest-edge algorithm  [9]) by Suarez et al.  [10]. They showed that the iterative application of the 4-Triangles refinement algorithm on a triangulation 
                           τ
                         increases the proportion

                         is the number of pairs of terminal triangles in the mesh 
                           τ
                        , and 
                           N
                           
                              (
                              τ
                              )
                           
                         is the total number of triangles; tending to cover 
                           τ
                         with terminal triangles, and reducing the average length of propagation to five triangles.

Note that one 4-Triangles partition of a triangle is equivalent to two steps of longest-edge bisections of a quasi-equilateral triangle. This, along with Lemma 2.2, allows us to extend these results to the longest-edge bisection algorithm.


                        
                           Proposition 4.2
                           
                              For any triangulation 
                              
                                 τ
                              
                              , the global iterative use of the Lepp-bisection of triangles generates triangulation covered by terminal triangles.
                           


                        
                           Proof
                           The iterative longest-edge bisection of triangles generates triangles from Regions I and VI (Lemma 2.2). Furthermore, the iterative longest-edge bisection of these triangles presents the same bisection pattern as the 4-Triangles partition. Therefore, the theoretical results on the propagation problem for the 4-Triangles algorithm hold for the Lepp-bisection algorithm. □

                        Fig. 7 shows the transition among regions during the iterative longest-edge bisection of triangles until obtaining quasi-equilateral triangles. Fig. 7(a) shows how quasi-equilateral triangles only generate other quasi-equilateral triangles. Fig. 7(b) shows the transition tree of Region II, IV.a and V triangles (the green triangle represents the refinement tree of a Region I triangle tree). Fig. 7(c) shows the transition behavior of Region III, IV.b and V triangles (the white triangle represents the refinement tree of a Region I, II or III triangle). The generation of new subtrees in Fig. 7(c) halts within a finite number of steps with the appearance of a Region I or II triangle (Lemma 2.1).


                        
                           Corollary 4.4
                           
                              The iterative application of the Lepp-bisection algorithm gradually reduces the average extent of the propagation, tending to  2  triangles.
                           


                        
                           Proof
                           The proof follows from the direct application of Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 4.2.

Note that Region I and VI triangles are regarded as good quality triangles, mostly having a smallest angle 
                           α
                           ≥
                           
                              
                                 π

                        . Therefore, the Lepp-bisection algorithm not only reduces the work of refinement in repetitive applications, but improves the overall quality of the triangulation.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Here we study the evolution of the quality of the triangulation throughout the iterative application of the Lepp-bisection algorithm. We compute the Lepp-size and the percentage of terminal triangles and quasi-equilateral triangles in the refined triangulations.

We tested the performance of the algorithm using two Delaunay triangulations of the Lake Superior geometry: Superior-good, a good quality triangulation with smallest angle

                        ≥
                        3
                        
                           
                              0

                      (Fig. 8
                     (c)); and Superior-bad, a poor quality triangulation with smallest angle

                      (Fig. 8(a)). Although longest-edge bisection algorithms are used in practice over triangulations of acceptable quality, in order to provide a stronger empirical validation of Corollary 4.4, we also tested the algorithm’s behavior over Delaunay triangulations of randomly generated points over a quadrilateral region. We generated 10 meshes of 1000, 5000 and 10,000 points (D1k, D5k and D10k respectively).


                     Table 1
                      shows the initial statistics of all the evaluated meshes. The second column refers to the number of triangles in the triangulation. The third column refers to the average smallest angle 
                        α
                      of the triangles. The fourth column, Avg. Lepp-set(), refers to the average number of triangles locally refined due to propagation. The fifth column refers to the proportion of terminal triangles in the mesh, while the sixth column refers to the proportion of quasi-equilateral triangles (regions I and VI).

It must be noted that even when the average 
                        α
                      shown in Table 1 is good for the triangulations of randomly generated points, these triangulations contain a small number of initial triangles with minimum angle 
                        α
                      close to 
                        
                           
                              0
                           
                           
                              ∘
                           
                        
                     . The triangulation of Superior-bad also contains some initial poor quality triangles (with 
                        α
                      close to 
                        
                           
                              2
                           
                           
                              ∘
                           
                        
                     ).

Starting with input triangulations of Table 1, we iteratively and globally applied the algorithm to refine every triangle of the preceding triangulation, until obtaining one million triangles. Fig. 9
                         shows the evolution of four statistics over the refined triangulations during this process. Since all the meshes of random points show analogous behavior we only include triangulation nD1k.


                        Fig. 9(a) and (b) show that both the percentage of terminal triangles and the percentage of quasi-equilateral triangles in the mesh monotonically increases as the refinement proceeds, even for those regarded as bad quality initial triangulations.


                        Fig. 9(c) shows that the average smallest angle approaches about 
                           4
                           
                              
                                 0
                              
                              
                                 ∘
                              
                           
                        . In this sense the triangulation is populated by good-quality triangles that are also easy to process even if they are affected by the propagation (recall Lemma 4.1). The results shown in Fig. 9(d) validate the reduction of the propagation length during iterative refinement since the Lepp-size quickly converges to an average of two triangles (pairs of terminal triangles).

Here, at each step we iteratively applied the algorithm to refine one random triangle of the current triangulation for the triangulations of Table 1. Since the randomly selected triangle could have been previously refined, we randomly refine a number of triangles equal to the size of the initial triangulation to increase the probability of refining every initial triangle at least once. Table 2
                         presents the same statistics as Table 1 for the final refined triangulations. The initial comparison of both tables shows the increasing of good quality and terminal triangles, as well as the reduction of the Lepp-size to an average of three triangles. Note that for quality-acceptable triangulations, even when local refinement is applied, the overall quality of the refined (also quality-acceptable triangulations) is still improved: the average 
                           α
                         increases to around 
                           4
                           
                              
                                 0
                              
                              
                                 ∘
                              
                           
                        .

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we presented a complete study on refinement propagation for the Lepp-bisection algorithm, proving that size-optimal meshes are obtained. Our experiments show that both the number of triangles generated inside propagating triangles, and the size of the propagation remain constant. The Lepp-bisection algorithm produces more quasi-equilateral triangles in each iteration. Thus, better quality triangles tend to cover the propagation path, so future iterations are processed faster with shorter longest-edge propagating paths, while the triangles with the smallest angles are isolated. In practice, longest edge algorithms are efficient techniques for fast and robust refinement of good quality triangulations.
