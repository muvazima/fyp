Stochastic cooperative game

                  We study stochastic linear programming games: a class of stochastic cooperative games whose payoffs under any realization of uncertainty are determined by a specially structured linear program. These games can model a variety of settings, including inventory centralization and cooperative network fortification. We focus on the core of these games under an allocation scheme that determines how payoffs are distributed before the uncertainty is realized, and allows for arbitrarily different distributions for each realization of the uncertainty. Assuming that each player’s preferences over random payoffs are represented by a concave monetary utility functional, we prove that these games have a nonempty core. Furthermore, by establishing a connection between stochastic linear programming games, linear programming games and linear semi-infinite programming games, we show that an allocation in the core can be computed efficiently under some circumstances.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Consider a situation in which a set of players can cooperatively participate in a joint venture. For example, a group of retailers may decide to share the cost of jointly managing their inventory and demand, and take advantage of any economies of scale. In order for such a collaboration to be successful, the participants must agree on how to share any joint payoffs that result from cooperation. Cooperative game theory provides a mathematical framework for modeling how these payoffs of cooperation should be shared.

Cooperative game theory has been applied to a multitude of payoff-sharing problems that arise in operations research. A short and necessarily incomplete list of examples includes transportation (e.g. Potters, Curiel, and Tijs, 1991; Göthe-Lundgren, Jörnsten, and Värbrand, 1996; Toriello and Uhan, 2013; Rosenthal, 2013), scheduling (e.g. Curiel, Pederzoli, and Tijs, 1989; Schulz and Uhan, 2010), and inventory management (e.g. Hartman, Dror, and Shaked, 2000; Chen and Zhang, 2006; van den Heuvel, Borm, and Hamers, 2007; Gopaladesikan, Uhan, and Zou, 2012; Özen, Erkip, and Slikker, 2012; Timmer, Chessa, and Boucherie, 2013). In the vast majority of this past work, the payoffs of cooperation are deterministic. Even when the payoffs arise from a stochastic setting, it has been almost always assumed that players are only concerned with expected payoffs, and that players are risk-neutral. While in some circumstances these may be reasonable assumptions, often they are not.

The stochastic cooperative game framework of Suijs, Borm, De Waegenare, and Tijs (1999) offers another way to approach payoff sharing under uncertainty. In these games, the payoffs of cooperation are represented by random variables, and players’ attitudes toward risk are explicitly modeled. In this work, we study a fairly general class of stochastic cooperative games in which the payoffs under any realization of uncertainty are represented by linear programs. This class encompasses the stochastic counterparts of various classic deterministic cooperative games, such as some of the ones mentioned above.

As mentioned above, cooperative games with deterministic payoffs arising from operations research problems have been widely studied. Of particular note here are those with payoffs represented by specially-structured mathematical programs. Perhaps the most prominent example is the class of linear programming games introduced by Owen (1975), who showed that allocations in the core of these games can be computed using optimal dual multipliers of the underlying linear program. These dual-based core allocations have been widely used and studied (e.g. Perea, Puerto, and Fernández, 2012). Several authors have shown that a variety of cooperative games can be seen as linear programming games; examples include assignment games (Shapley and Shubik, 1971), maximum flow games (Kalai and Zemel, 1982), and network synthesis games (Tamir, 1991), which include minimum cost spanning tree games (Granot and Huberman, 1981) as a special case. Other games arising from specially-structured mathematical programs include packing and covering games (Deng, Ibaraki, and Nagamochi, 1999) and integer minimization games (Caprara and Letchford, 2010).

Deterministic cooperative game theory has also been used to allocate the expected payoffs of cooperation arising from a stochastic setting. For instance, a variety of authors have studied several types of inventory centralization games—deterministic cooperative games in which payoffs correspond to the optimal expected cost of managing inventory and transportation in order to meet stochastic demand (Chen and Zhang, 2009; Hartman et al., 2000; Müller, Scarsini, and Shaked, 2002; Özen, Fransoo, Norde, and Slikker, 2008; Slikker, Fransoo, and Wouters, 2005). Özen, Slikker, and Norde (2009) proposed and studied a general class of deterministic cooperative games in which the optimal expected value of a stochastic optimization problem is allocated among players. As mentioned above, this approach to payoff sharing in stochastic settings can be problematic, especially when the players have different attitudes toward risk.

Researchers have proposed several cooperative game-theoretic frameworks that deal directly with uncertain payoffs (e.g. Charnes and Granot, 1973; Suijs et al., 1999; Branzei, Dimitrov, and Tijs, 2003; Monroy, Hinojosa, Mármol, and Fernández, 2013). Stochastic cooperative games, introduced by Suijs et al. (1999), are particularly attractive because as mentioned earlier, they model payoffs as random variables and explicitly model different players’ attitudes toward risk. Suijs et al. (1999), Suijs and Borm (1999), and Suijs (2000a) extended various notions from deterministic cooperative game theory, such as the core, the nucleolus, balancedness, superadditivity and convexity, to stochastic cooperative games. There has been a smattering of research on applying the stochastic cooperative game framework to specific collaborative decision-making problems; the most related here is the work on stochastic linear production games by Suijs (2000b).

In this work, we study stochastic linear programming games. In these games, the payoff under any realization of uncertainty is represented by a specially structured linear program. These games are quite general, and include the games studied by Owen (1975) and Suijs (2000b) as special cases. We illustrate this generality by giving some examples. For instance, we show that the inventory centralization cost sharing situations studied by Özen et al. (2008) and Chen and Zhang (2009) can be modeled as stochastic linear programming games. We also describe examples arising from joint portfolio management and cooperative network fortification.

We focus on the core of stochastic linear programming games: roughly speaking, the set of payoff allocations that are resistant to coalitional defections. We consider allocations that must be determined before the uncertainty is realized, and—departing from the existing literature—are allowed to have an arbitrary dependence on the realized uncertainty. Working under the assumption that each player’s preferences over random payoffs can be represented by a monetary utility functional (i.e. the negative of a risk measure; Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath, 1999), we establish a connection between the core under this allocation scheme and the core of an auxiliary deterministic cooperative game, following the work of Suijs and Borm (1999).

Using this connection, we show that when players’ preferences are represented by concave monetary utility functionals (i.e. convex risk measures; e.g. Föllmer and Schied, 2002a), the core of a stochastic linear programming game is always nonempty, and that the auxiliary deterministic cooperative game is a linear semi-infinite programming game. Furthermore, for certain classes of concave monetary utility functionals, which include the well-studied conditional value-at-risk (Acerbi and Tasche, 2002; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2000) and the simple worst-case-scenario monetary utility functional, we show that the auxiliary deterministic cooperative game is in fact a linear programming game. As a result, an allocation in the core in these cases can be computed in time polynomial in the number of players.

In the stochastic cooperative game framework of Suijs et al. (1999), the actions available to each coalition are explicitly modeled, and the worth of a coalition is modeled as a random variable that depends on the action that the coalition takes. The stochastic cooperative game framework also explicitly models each player’s preferences over random payoffs, allowing the players to have different attitudes toward risk.

                        ∖{∅} is a coalition; the set of all players N is the grand coalition.

In this work, we make a few assumptions and definitions that depart from much of the existing literature on stochastic cooperative games. First, we assume that the uncertainty is finite: that is, Ω is finite and 
                           
                              F
                              =
                              
                                 2
                                 Ω
                              
                           
                        . We let v(S, a, ω) denote the worth of coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} with action a ∈ AS
                         in scenario ω ∈ Ω. Second, we consider allocations that can depend arbitrarily on the realized scenario: an allocation for a coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} in Γ is a pair

                        In other words, (x, a) represents an allocation of payoffs for every scenario: before the uncertainty is realized, the players in S choose an action a ∈ AS
                        , and each player i ∈ S is promised an allocation of xi
                        (ω) if scenario ω ∈ Ω is realized. The relationship between allocations in different scenarios is arbitrary: that is, for every player i ∈ N, there are no constraints on how xi
                        (ω) and xi
                        (ω′) are related, for any pair of scenarios ω, ω′ ∈ Ω. In addition, in every scenario, the total amount allocated to the coalition S cannot exceed the worth of the coalition. We denote the set of allocations for coalition S by ZS
                        , and the allocation of player i in (x, a) by (x, a)
                           i
                         = (xi
                        (ω))
                           ω ∈ Ω
                        . We assume that ZS
                         is nonempty for every coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅}.

                        As with the core of a deterministic cooperative game, the idea behind the core of a stochastic cooperative game is to allocate payoffs to all the players so that no coalition of players has incentive to defect. Also like deterministic cooperative games, a stochastic cooperative game with a nonempty core is said to be balanced.

Each coalition of a stochastic cooperative game induces a subgame in the following way. For each coalition R ∈ 2

                         is a subgame of Γ for every R ∈ 2

                        ∖{∅}. A stochastic cooperative game Γ is said to be totally balanced if the core of subgame ΓR
                         is nonempty for all R ∈ 2

The definition of an allocation above is broader than the definitions that have been typically studied in the stochastic cooperative game literature, which focus on allocating fixed proportions of a coalition’s random worth to the players. For example, Suijs and Borm (1999) considered allocations (x, a) for coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} with the following form:

In other words, the values (di
                        )
                           i ∈ S
                         represent deterministic transfer payments between the players in S, and the values (ri
                        )
                           i ∈ S
                         represent the proportions of the random worth v(S, a, ω) allocated to each player in S, which are the same in every scenario ω ∈ Ω. Note that in contrast, our definition of an allocation allows for different proportions of the random worth to be allocated in different scenarios. As a result of this additional flexibility, there are stochastic cooperative games that are balanced under our definition of an allocation, but not balanced under the definition of an allocation described in (2.2). We give a simple example later in Example 2.3.

Note that ϕ is a monetary utility functional if and only if − ϕ is a risk measure 
                        (Artzner et al., 1999). A monetary utility functional ϕ can be interpreted as the deterministic equivalent of a random payoff: that is, one is indifferent between receiving the amount ϕ(X) with certainty and receiving the random payoff X. Under this interpretation, the two conditions above are clear. Condition (M1) says that if one random payoff weakly dominates another in all scenarios, then the monetary utility of the former is at least that of the latter. Condition (M2) states that if a random payoff is augmented by some deterministic amount d, then its monetary utility is also augmented by d.

The monetary utility functional ϕ is concave if it satisfies:

                           
                              1.
                              Concavity: ϕ(λX + (1 − λ)Y) ≥ λϕ(X) + (1 − λ)ϕ(Y) for all 
                                    
                                       X
                                       ,
                                       Y
                                       ∈
                                       X
                                    
                                  and λ ∈ [0, 1].

Condition (M3) is rather natural from an economic perspective: diversification never decreases the desirability of a random payoff. In this case, − ϕ is known as a convex risk measure 
                        (Föllmer and Schied, 2002a). Furthermore, a concave monetary utility functional ϕ is coherent if it satisfies:

                           
                              1.
                              Positive homogeneity: ϕ(λX) = λϕ(X) for all 
                                    
                                       X
                                       ∈
                                       X
                                    
                                  and λ ≥ 0.

Condition (M4) requires that the monetary utility functional scales linearly. Under these conditions, − ϕ is a coherent risk measure 
                        (Artzner et al., 1999).

One important property of concave and coherent monetary utility functionals is that they admit a robust representation in the following sense. Let 
                           
                              M

                         and let

Roughly speaking, when ϕ is concave, ϕ(X) can be interpreted as the worst-case expected value of X over all probability measures, weighted by the penalty function α. When ϕ is coherent, ϕ(X) can be interpreted as the worst-case expected value of X over a collection 
                           Q
                         of possible probability measures. In this work, we refer to the set 
                           Q
                         in (2.4) as the family of generating measures of ϕ.

When the family of generating measures 
                           Q
                         of a coherent monetary utility functional ϕ is finite, we say that ϕ is finitely generated. In this case, under our assumption that the set of scenarios Ω is finite, ϕ can be equivalently generated by a polytope: the convex hull of 
                           Q
                        . Conversely, any coherent monetary utility functional ϕ generated by a polytope of measures 
                           Q
                         is finitely generated by the extreme points of 
                           Q
                        .

There are several important examples of finitely generated coherent monetary utility functionals. One simple example is the worst-case monetary utility functional

We call such a functional a certainty equivalent for ≿. If the underlying monetary utility functional is concave, we say that the certainty equivalent and the associated preferences are concave. We define certainty equivalents and preferences that are coherent and finitely generated in a similar fashion. Condition (M5) states that one random payoff is weakly preferred to another if and only if the certainty equivalent of the former is at least the certainty equivalent of the latter. Note that (M1) and (M5) together imply the natural condition that

Researchers in the operations research community have used monetary utility functionals or risk measures to capture a decision-maker’s attitude toward risk in the objective function of a variety of stochastic optimization problems. Their focus has typically been on coherent risk measures, since their supporting axioms are arguably reasonable from an economic perspective, and their convexity and robust representation yield nice structural and computational properties. Some have focused on specific measures, such as the worst-case risk measure and conditional value-at-risk described above (e.g. Yu, 1998; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2000; Gotoh and Tanako, 2007; Wu, Zhu, and Teunter, 2013; Chan, Mahmoudzadeh, and Purdie, 2014). Others have focused on more general classes of coherent risk measures (e.g. Ahmed, Cakmak, and Shapiro, 2007; Choi, Ruszczyński, and Zhao, 2011).

Using monetary utility functionals to represent a decision-maker’s preferences over stochastic payoffs is an alternative to the traditional expected utility approach (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944). For example, while the expected utility approach evaluates a stochastic payoff as the expected value of a nonlinear transformation of the payoff under a given probability distribution, the coherent monetary utility functional evaluates a stochastic payoff as the worst-case expected payoff over the decision-maker’s collection of possible probabilistic views. These are not entirely distinct approaches, however: under the theory of expected utility, any preference relation consistent with an exponential utility function has a concave monetary utility functional as a certainty equivalent (e.g. Fritelli and Scandolo, 2005).

There are even stronger ties between other well-studied theories of choice and the monetary utility functionals studied in this work. In the dual theory of choice (Yaari, 1987), stochastic payoffs are evaluated by the expected value of the payoff under a nonlinear transformation of the probability distribution. It turns out that any preference relation consistent with the dual theory of choice has a coherent monetary utility functional as a certainty equivalent (Denneberg, 1990; Wang, Young, and Panjer, 1997). In the theory of generalized expected utility (Quiggin, 1993; Schmeidler, 1986), stochastic payoffs are also evaluated by an expected value, this time of a nonlinear transformation of the payoff under a nonlinear transformation of the probability distribution. Any preference relation consistent with this theory of choice has a concave monetary utility functional as a certainty equivalent (Föllmer and Schied, 2002b). For further details on the connection between monetary utility functionals and theories of choice, we refer the reader to Tsanakas and Desli (2003) and Denuit, Dhaene, Goovaerts, Kaas, and Laeven (2006).

Suppose that each player’s preference relation can be represented by a certainty equivalent. In particular, for each player i ∈ N, the preference relation ≿
                           i
                         can represented by a certainty equivalent ϕi
                        . The certainty equivalent game of Γ is a deterministic cooperative game (N, vΓ
                        ) with

                           N

A variant of Proposition 2.2 was proven by Suijs and Borm (1999) for the definition of an allocation described in (2.2). One can prove this proposition using techniques similar to theirs. For the sake of completeness, we provide a proof in Appendix A.

Using Proposition 2.2, we give an example of a stochastic cooperative game whose core is nonempty under our definition of an allocation, but is empty under the definition of Suijs and Borm (1999) described in (2.2).

Intuitively, the players’ preferences will always result in a “lucky” and an “unlucky” player, depending on the realized scenario. The flexibility of an allocation under our definition can accommodate for both the “lucky” and the “unlucky” players, but this is not possible under the definition of Suijs and Borm (1999).

We study the following generalization of the stochastic linear production games introduced by Suijs (2000b), which we call stochastic linear programming games. A stochastic linear programming game is a stochastic cooperative game

This setting is similar to the classic two-stage stochastic linear program with recourse. In the first stage, before the uncertainty is realized, a coalition S ∈ 2
                        N
                     ∖{∅} chooses an action a ∈ AS
                     , which is not scenario-dependent. In the second stage, after the uncertainty is realized, the coalition S takes a corrective or recourse action b(ω) to maximize its objective function, depending on which scenario ω ∈ Ω has been realized. Note that the action taken in the first stage can directly affect which recourse actions are possible in the second stage.

We assume that the objective function vectors, constraint matrices, and constraint vectors are given so that v(S, a, ω) is finite for all S ∈ 2
                        N
                     ∖{∅}, a ∈ AS
                     , and ω ∈ Ω. Note that the constraints (3.1) can contain constraints of the form

These games are a generalization of the stochastic linear production games of Suijs (2000b). Unlike those games, the stochastic linear programming games described here allow us to differentiate between an action taken by players in the first stage and a recourse action in the second stage. In addition, stochastic linear programming games do not assume that the objective function vectors or constraint vectors are necessarily nonnegative. Finally, these games allow for uncertainty in the constraints in addition to the objective function.

Consider the following variant of a simple investment game described by Suijs et al. (1999). In this game, there is a set of investors N and a set of assets F. Each investor i ∈ N has an initial endowment mi
                         of money, and each asset j ∈ F has a stochastic return dj
                        (ω) in scenario ω ∈ Ω. The investors in coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} distribute their collective endowment ∑
                           i ∈ S
                        
                        mi
                         among the assets in F in the first stage, before the returns are realized.

By rewriting equalities as two inequalities, it is straightforward to see that this is in fact a stochastic linear programming game. In addition, note that the maximization in (3.3) is trivial, since the second-stage decision variables (bj
                        (ω))
                           j ∈ F
                         are in fact fixed for any given action (aj
                        )
                           j ∈ F
                        . In this way, we can model settings in which a coalition’s action in the first stage directly results in uncertain payoffs.


                        Özen et al. (2008) and Chen and Zhang (2009) studied a deterministic cooperative game in which the cost associated with each coalition is the minimum expected inventory and transportation cost required to meet the coalition’s demand. The stochastic cooperative game analogue, described below, is a stochastic linear programming game.

There is a supplier of a single product, a set of warehouses W, and a set of retailers N. Retailer i ∈ N faces a random demand di
                        (ω) for this product in scenario ω ∈ Ω. Each retailer i ∈ N can operate warehouses in Wi
                        ⊆W. Any retailer in a coalition of retailers S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} is allowed to use any warehouse in WS
                         = ∪
                           i ∈ S
                        
                        Wi
                        .

In the first stage, before the demands are realized, the retailers in coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} order yj
                         units of the product from each warehouse j ∈ WS
                         under its control at a cost of cj
                         per unit. In the second stage, after the demands are realized, the product is sent from the warehouses to the retailers. In particular, xij
                         units are sent from warehouse j to retailer i at a cost of sij
                         per unit. Each retailer i ∈ S pays a holding cost hi
                         for every unit of product it receives in excess of its realized demand, and a penalty pi
                         for every unit of demand it does not satisfy. Note that this is a generalization of the classic newsvendor setting, in which the transportation costs sij
                         are zero.

We model this setting as a stochastic cooperative game Γ = (N, v, {AS
                        }
                           S⊆N

By reversing some of the inequalities and rewriting equalities as two inequalities, it is straightforward to see that (3.4) and (3.5) are of the same form as (3.1) and (3.2), respectively, and so this game is in fact a stochastic linear programming game.

Finally, we briefly sketch a generalization of the maximum flow game introduced by Kalai and Zemel (1982) that can be modeled as a stochastic linear programming game. There is a set of players N, each of whom controls an arc in a directed graph (V, N) with source node s and sink node t. The capacity of each arc is random, perhaps due to an impending attack or natural disaster: arc i ∈ N has capacity ui
                        (ω) in scenario ω ∈ Ω. Each player i ∈ N has an arc fortification budget of bi
                        .

In the first stage, before the capacities are realized, the players in coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} fortify the capacity of each arc i ∈ S by a deterministic amount yi
                        . That is, in scenario ω ∈ Ω, arc i will have capacity ui

                        . The total fortification for coalition S cannot exceed ∑
                           i ∈ S
                        
                        bi
                        . In the second stage, after the capacities are realized, the worth of coalition S is the maximum s-t flow in the induced subgraph (V, S).

By defining a stochastic cooperative game in which the actions correspond to the fortification options in the first stage, and the worth function gives the maximum flow in the fortified network in each scenario in the second stage, it is straightforward to see that this setting can be modeled as a stochastic linear programming game.

In this section, we show that the core of a stochastic linear programming game Γ is nonempty, assuming that each player’s preferences are concave. In particular, for every player i ∈ N, we assume that ϕi
                      is a concave certainty equivalent for ≿
                        i
                     .

The certainty equivalent game (N, vΓ
                     ) of Γ is given by the following: for every coalition S ∈ 2
                        N

Using the Bondareva–Shapley theorem (Bondareva, 1963; Shapley, 1967), we can show that the core of the certainty equivalent game (N, vΓ
                     ) is nonempty, and therefore by Proposition 2.2, the core of the stochastic linear programming game Γ is nonempty.

                        Theorem 4.1
                        
                           Suppose Γ is a stochastic linear programming game with concave preferences. Then Γ is totally balanced.

                     Theorem 4.1 establishes the existence of an allocation in the core of stochastic linear programming games under concave preferences. In this section, we connect the certainty equivalent game with linear semi-infinite programming games and linear programming games. This connection has implications on the structure and computability of such core allocations.

In the following lemma, we reformulate ( SP
                           S
                        ) as a linear semi-infinite program by exploiting the robust representation of concave certainty equivalents described in Theorem 2.1. This will allow us to use linear semi-infinite programming duality to construct allocations in the core under general concave preferences. In this section, we assume that for each player i ∈ N, ϕi
                         is a concave certainty equivalent for ≿
                           i
                         that has representation (2.3) with penalty function αi
                        .

In the proof of Theorem 5.2, we established that the certainty equivalent game is in fact a linear semi-infinite programming game: a deterministic cooperative game (N, u) in which the worth u(S) of coalition S ∈ 2
                           N
                        ∖{∅} is the optimal value of a linear semi-infinite program of the form (5.2). Note that our proof that the core of the certainty equivalent game is nonempty, which uses the techniques of Owen (1975), also shows that the core of any linear semi-infinite programming game is nonempty, as long as strong duality holds and a dual optimal solution exists. A variant of these games in which the underlying linear semi-infinite program has an infinite number of variables instead of an infinite number of constraints was studied by Fragnelli, Patrone, Sideri, and Tijs (1999).

In general, there are a variety of conditions that imply strong duality and the existence of a dual optimal solution for linear semi-infinite programs, as required in Theorem 5.2. We refer the reader to the monographs by Glashoff and Gustafson (1983) and Goberna and López (1998) for an in-depth treatment on the topic. Here, we give simple sufficient conditions so that

                               for all i ∈ N are continuous on T. Finally, by assumption (iii), a Slater point must exist because for any given solution (a, b), the values of x and z can always made sufficiently low so that (x, z, a, b) strictly satisfies (5.1b) and (5.1c).□

Using other constraint qualification conditions than those described in the proof of Corollary 5.3 (e.g. Goberna, Terlaky, and Todorov, 2010), we can make a similar statement if some of the constraints (5.1d) and (5.1e) are in fact equality constraints. In this case, we would need to change condition (iii) of the above corollary to require the existence of a solution that satisfies all equality constraints and strictly satisfies all inequality constraints. In addition, we would need to require that the left-hand side coefficient vectors of the equality constraints are linearly independent.

Next, we work under the assumption that each player’s preferences are not just concave, but coherent and finitely generated. In particular, for every player i ∈ N, we assume that ϕi
                         is a coherent certainty equivalent for ≿
                           i
                        , and that 
                           
                              Q
                              i
                           
                         is the family of generating measures for ϕi
                        .

Specifically, the families of generating measures for the players’ certainty equivalents are given as finite sets. Then Γ is totally balanced.

                               can be constructed as in (5.4). By translating the variable names of 
                                 
                                    (

                               from those in (5.2) to those in (5.1) and applying Proposition 2.2, it follows that an allocation in the core of ΓR
                               can be constructed as described in the corollary.□

As a consequence, an allocation in the core of a stochastic linear programming game in this case can be obtained in the same time it takes to compute an optimal solution and optimal dual multipliers for 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 SP
                                 N

                              )
                           
                        . This can be done in time polynomial in the number of players and scenarios, the input size of the objective function vectors, constraint matrices, and constraint vectors, and the input size of the families of generating measures given as finite sets. Note that this running time is not necessarily exponential in the number of players.

Depending on the data available or the nature of the players’ preferences, it may be the case that the families

                         are given as systems of linear inequalities. For instance, as we saw in Section 2.2, the monetary utility functional ϕ = − CVaR is easily described with such a system. When this is the case, we can use these systems to reformulate

As in the proof of Corollary 5.4, the fact that the certainty equivalent game reformulated in (5.7) is also a linear programming game, the result of Owen (1975) and Proposition 2.2 imply the following corollary.

                              Suppose Γ is a stochastic linear programming game with finitely generated coherent preferences. Specifically, the families of generating measures for the players’ certainty equivalents are given as polytopes of the form (

                              ). Then Γ is totally balanced.

In this case, an allocation in the core of a stochastic linear programming game can be obtained in the same time it takes to compute an optimal solution and optimal dual multipliers for (5.7). This can be performed in time polynomial in the number of players and scenarios, the input size of the objective function vectors, constraint matrices, constraint vectors defining the stochastic linear programming game, as well as the input size of the constraint matrices and vectors defining the families of generating measures for the players’ certainty equivalents. Again, note that this running time is not necessarily exponential in the number of players.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, we studied stochastic linear programming games, and demonstrated how these games can model a variety of settings, including inventory centralization, portfolio management, and network fortification. We examined the core of these games under an allocation scheme that determines how the payoffs are distributed before the uncertainty is realized, and—departing from the existing literature—allows for distributions to have an arbitrary dependence on the realized uncertainty. We proved that these games are totally balanced, assuming that each player’s preferences are concave. In addition, by establishing a connection between stochastic linear programming games, linear programming games and linear semi-infinite programming games, we showed that an allocation in the core can be computed in polynomial time for certain types of concave preferences.
