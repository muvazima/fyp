                  In this paper, the anchor points in DEA, as an important subset of the set of extreme efficient points of the production possibility set (PPS), are studied. A basic definition, utilizing the multiplier DEA models, is given. Then, two theorems are proved which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for characterization of these points. The main results of the paper lead to a new interesting connection between DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory. By utilizing the established theoretical results, a successful procedure for identification of the anchor points is presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nowadays, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is one of the most popular tools for efficiency analysis in multiple input-multiple output framework of the production theory (see Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007; Emrouznejad, Parker, & Tavares, 2008). As can be seen in the DEA literature, the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and applications. Thanassoulis and Allen (1998) used the concept of these points, at first, for the generation of unobserved DMUs and extending the DEA frontier. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) defined these points formally as production possibilities which give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the boundary of the production possibility set (PPS). Rouse (2004) utilized this notion for identifying prices for health care services. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) used the geometrical properties of the anchor points to design and test an algorithm for their identification under variable returns to scale (VRS) assumption of the production technology. In a recently published paper, Thanassoulis, Kortelainen, and Allen (2011) provided another method for identifying the anchor points based upon the radial efficiency scores and slack variables at the optimal solution of envelopment models. They have used this concept for improving envelopment under multiple inputs and outputs in a VRS technology. See also Bougnol (2001) and Allen and Thanassoulis (2004) for more details about the notion and applications of the anchor points.

Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme efficient points, the first step for obtaining the anchor points is obtaining the extreme efficient points. There are different algorithms to do this. See Charnes, Cooper, and Thrall (1991) and Dulá and López (2006) among others.

In this paper, a basic definition of anchor points, based upon the optimal solutions of the multiplier DEA models and the supporting hyperplanes of the PPS, is given. This definition is close to that given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009). Afterwards, it is proved that a DMU under consideration is an anchor point if and only if by increasing some input or decreasing some output the new unobserved point is located on the boundary of the production possibility set. Due to this result, we obtain a characterization of the anchor points using input-oriented and output-oriented models. Then, utilizing the established theoretical results, an approach for identification of the anchor points is introduced. The presented approach follows the problem from a different standpoint, and determines the anchor points using some sensitivity analysis techniques, while the existing methods do this by obtaining all extreme efficient points of some polyhedrals or by resolving LP problems. It is interesting from a theoretical point of view too, because it provides a new connection between the DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming.

The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 contains some preliminaries. In Section 3, some basic theoretical results are addressed. In Section 4, sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory is utilized to provide a new procedure for identification of the anchor points. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions; and the proofs of the main results are given in Appendix A of the paper. Appendix B provides two initial simplex tableaus for two studied LP problems.

As can be seen in the DEA literature (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2011), the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and application. These points delineate the Pareto-efficient frontier of the PPS 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 v
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      from the free-disposability portion of the boundary. The anchor points are usually production points with small or big size of input–output factors. These points are far from the central part of the efficiency frontier. As can be seen from Theorem 1 of the present paper and the results given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), the role of some input–output factors in efficiency situation of these units is not considerable.

Anchor points were first used by Thanassoulis and Allen (1998). More developments about the anchor points from both conceptual and applied points of view have been done by Bougnol (2001), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), and Thanassoulis et al. (2011). They used the properties of the anchor points to design and test some algorithms for their identification in

                     . In this section, we address some basic results for identifying the anchor points of

                     . The first method, which results from some notions and corollaries given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), works based upon the multiplier models.

But, it is worthwhile to note that when the optimal objective value corresponding to one of the above LP models becomes zero, then

In this section, we utilize the sensitivity analysis techniques in linear programming theory to identify the anchor points. It has advantages from an applied point of view. Furthermore, it is interesting theoretically, because provides a new link between linear programming theory and performance analysis (DEA).

The following theorem provides a characterization of anchor points based upon the weak-efficiency of

To sum up, in this section we provided a new method for checking that whether a DMU is anchor point or not. The presented procedure gives a new connection between the sensitivity analysis techniques in linear programming theory and DEA. It is interesting theoretically. From a computational point of view, in the method given in this section, we do not solve the DEA models for checking the efficiency position of

Anchor points build an important class of extreme efficient points in DEA. These points define the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the frontier of the PPS, as introduced by Bougnol and Dulá (2009). On the other hand, these points define the transmittance from the Pareto-efficiency to weak efficiency. The properties, applications, and identification of these points have been studied by some authors, including Bougnol (2001), Allen and Thanassoulis (2004), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), and Thanassoulis et al. (2011). In this paper, we dealt with these points from a different point of view, and provided some main theorems for characterization of these points. Utilizing these theoretical results, a procedure has been introduced for identification of the anchor points. In this method, solving the LP problems from scratch is not required and the sensitivity analysis tools from linear programming theory are utilized. In fact, it provides a new connection between the DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory.

Reduction in the computational requirements of the methods given for identification of the anchor points can be worth studying in future. Also, it seems that the connection between the anchor points and super-efficiency models (see Andersen & Petersen, 1993; Banker & Chang, 2000; Chen, 2005; Soleimani-damaneh, Jahanshahloo, & Foroughi, 2006; Tone, 2002) can be a worthwhile direction for future research.

                      variables are artificial variables which are required to obtain the initial BFS. Here we have used the Big-M method to find the initial BFS, and so in these tables M is a positive sufficiently large number (see Bazaraa, Jarvis, & Sherali, 1990; Soleimani-damaneh et al., 2006) (see Tables 1 and 2
