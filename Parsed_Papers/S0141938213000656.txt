                  The characteristics of MoO3/F8BT/ZnO inorganic/organic hybrid light emitting diodes (IO-HyLEDs) fabricated on ZnO/Ag/ZnO dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) and conventional ZnO/ITO were investigated. The DMD had a low sheet resistance of 9Ω/sq and a high transmittance of 90.7%. The device fabricated on DMD showed similar current density–voltage (J–V) and luminance–current density (L–J) characteristics to that on ZnO/ITO, indicating the possibility of DMD as a promising transparent conductive layer for IO-HyLEDs. The maximum luminous intensity of 237,000cd/m2 was demonstrated under pulsed condition for the DMD device. We also investigated the effect of the combination interlayer (CIL) at the F8BT/ZnO interface on the IO-HyLEDs. The CIL was composed of a Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O bilayer and a self-assembled dipole molecule (SADM) of BA-CH3. The devices with CIL exhibited an approximately threefold enhancement of the luminous intensity and efficiency in comparison with the devices without CIL. This improvement was considered to be brought about by the enhancement of the electron injection efficiency by CIL.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Light emitting devices in the visible range, such as inorganic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) composed of III–V compound semiconductors such as AlGaInN [1] and AlGaInP [2] and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been realized and are spreading as an alternative to light bulbs and fluorescent lamps. Inorganic semiconductors have excellent electrical conductivity, band engineering ability, environmental resistance and high thermal conductivity. Furthermore, blue and red (InGaN- or InGaP-based) LEDs have been realized to possess extremely high external quantum efficiency. However, the luminous efficiency from the green to yellow range is significantly low, so called “Green Gap Problem” [3], and inorganic LEDs are difficult to apply as a large area and flexible light source. On the other hand, organic semiconductors show excellent luminous efficiency despite their simple deposition process, such as vacuum evaporation or spin coating, and are suitable as a large area and flexible light source. However, organic semiconductors have disadvantages such as low electrical and thermal conductivities and low environmental resistance to moisture and oxygen. A progressive improvement of device performance can be expected by utilizing the advantages of both inorganic and organic semiconductors synergistically and also by compensating for each disadvantage. We call these attractive devices inorganic/organic hybrid LEDs (IO-HyLEDs).

In preliminary studies of IO-HyLEDs, the structure of MoO3/F8BT (poly(9,9-dioctyl fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole))/TiO2 
                     [4], MoO3/F8BT/ZnO [5], MoO3/F8BT/MgO [6], MoO3/F8BT/HfO2 
                     [6], ZnO/α-NPD(N,N′-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine) [7], α-NPD/n-GaN [8], Alq3 (Tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum)/p-GaN [9] has been reported. In many IO-HyLEDs, disproportionate charge injection balance as a consequence of low electron injection efficiency from the inorganic to the organic layer has been a serious problem, which limits the device performance. It is expected that if efficient charge transport and blocking technique, which improve the charge injection balance in the organic emission layer, are established, the device performance will improve markedly. In a typical IO-HyLED structure of MoO3/F8BT/ZnO, the conduction band of ZnO is lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) of F8BT; thereby, the electron injection barrier is formed at the interface. Until now, some studies on decreasing the barrier to increase the electron injection efficiency yielding improvement of the device performance by inserting a self-assembled dipole molecule (SADM) [10], Cs2CO3 
                     [11], or conjugated polyelectrolyte [12] have been reported. We have also reported the effect of the MgZnO layer and SADM in the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO IO-HyLEDs [13,14], and the AlGaN layer and SADM in the MoO3/F8BT/GaN IO-HyLEDs [15,16].

Although ITO has been widely utilized as a transparent conductive layer (TCL) for organic devices, the search for alternative transparent conductive materials is being intensely pursued because ITO has some serious problems such as resource depletion of In, degradation of device performance by In diffusion, low flexibility of ITO film and necessity of high-temperature process for low resistance. Metal thin films have excellent electrical conductivity owing to their high electron density; however, metal has high reflectance from visible light to infrared. By sandwiching the metal layer by dielectric films with appropriate thickness, it is possible to impart a high transmission for visible light owing to the effect of optical interference and reflecting infrared light or electromagnetic waves. This dielectric/metal/dielectric technique is called DMD and has been utilized in low-E glass [17]. The DMD film has a high electrical conductivity and an excellent transmittance in the visible range comparable to those of ITO; therefore, recently, there have been some reports on the utilization of the DMD film as a TCL of opto-electronic devices [18–23].

In this report, we introduce the DMD film consisting of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Ag into the IO-HyLED. The characteristics of devices using DMD and ZnO/ITO are investigated. We also investigated the effect of Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O step-like bilayer electron injection layer (EIL) to improve the electron injection efficiency of the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO IO-HyLED. Furthermore, we examined the synergistic effect by combining BA-CH3 (4-methyl benzoic acid) as SADM and the inorganic bilayer EIL.


                     Fig. 1
                      shows a typical schematic of the IO-HyLED used in this study. ZnO/Ag/ZnO DMD films were deposited on SiO2 substrates by ion beam sputtering (IBS) at room temperature. The ZnO layers were doped with Al by co-sputtering technique of ZnO and Al metal targets. Then, 10-nm-thick Mg
                        x
                     Zn1

                        x
                     O (x
                     =0.25, 0.52) layers were deposited on the DMD film by IBS with co-sputtering using ZnO and MgO targets. The MgZnO layers ware also doped with Al under the same condition as the Al-doped ZnO layers. After 10min of UV–ozone cleaning, a BA-CH3 layer was formed by spin-coating using an ethanol solution as a SADM layer; then, the sample was annealed for 3min at 100°C in air. Following these processes, an F8BT layer was formed by spin-coating using toluene solution (20mg/mL) as the green light-emitting polymer in air. An inorganic hole injection layer of MoO3 (20nm) and Au (70nm) were formed in circular p-electrode patterns with a 500μm diameter by resistance heating vacuum evaporation. Indium was used as an n-type electrode. For comparison, we also fabricated the IO-HyLED based on ZnO/ITO/glass, without a MgZnO layer and an SADM layer, and then compared their emission characteristics. The ZnO layer of the ZnO/ITO device was deposited by IBS in the same manner as mentioned above on a commercially available ITO-coated glass. The device characterization was carried out immediately after fabrication in air. The current density–voltage (J–V) and current density–luminance (L–J) characteristics of the IO-HyLED were measured simultaneously using a TOPCON BM-5A and a source measure unit GS-610 (YOKOGAWA Electric Corp.). The light output was measured through the DMD or ITO layer from the substrate side.

                        Fig. 2
                        (a) shows the simplified band lineup of the fabricated IO-HyLED device. The numerical values at the top of each layer are the conduction band minimum (CBM) or LUMO, and those at the bottom of each layer are the valence band maximum (VBM) or the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO). These values were cited from some literatures [10,24–27]. Holes can be injected with high efficiency to the HOMO of F8BT from the VBM of MoO3 
                        [24,25]. On the other hand, electrons are injected into the LUMO of F8BT from the CBM of ZnO, but the electron injection barrier of approximately 1.02eV is formed between the CBM of ZnO and the LUMO of F8BT. Therefore, we introduced Mg

                        Here, the bandgap energies of MgO (E
                        g,MgO), ZnO(E
                        g,
                        ZnO) and bowing parameter b are 7.8eV, 3.28eV, and 3.47eV, respectively. The ratio between conduction band and valence band offset (ΔE
                        c:ΔE
                        v) was fixed to be 7:3 [27]. The bandgap of MgZnO increases in proportion to the Mg composition, but the conductivity decreases. Therefore, the MgZnO layer thickness was set to be 10nm to minimize the increase in resistance. By introducing MgZnO with Mg compositions of 0.25 and 0.52, it is expected that the electron injection barrier at the F8BT interface will decrease to 0.68 and −0.02eV, respectively. However, we do not have a precise value of the electron injection barriers; therefore, it should be regarded as a relative value. We also proposed the introduction of the MgZnO bilayer with different Mg compositions for the step-like increase in the bandgap to reduce the notch at the CBM of the ZnO/MgZnO interface. Meanwhile, SADM has bias of positive and negative charges in a molecule, and it has a tendency to form a monolayer film by a self-organization process. In this study, we use the BA-CH3 as an SADM. When the BA-CH3 is aligned with its COOH group bound to the surface of MgZnO, positive and negative charges are arranged on the sides of MgZnO and F8BT, as shown in Fig. 2(b), and it promotes the reduction of the electron injection barrier. However, it is difficult to estimate the charge density of the dipole layer qualitatively because it strongly depends on the surface density and degree of orientation of the molecules.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the transmission spectrum in the visible range of Ag (9nm), ZnO (38nm)/Ag (9nm)/AZO (40nm) and ITO (155nm)/glass. And the inset shows photographs of the sample with DMD and Ag. Note that despite having the same thickness of the Ag layer, the DMD film shows high transparency in the entire visible range. The mechanism of DMD can be briefly explained as follows. The low transparency of Ag film is caused by reflection of high density free electrons. By sandwiching the Ag film with ZnO layers which acts as anti-reflection coating, the reflection is effectively suppressed, and consequently brings about high transparency. The sheet resistance and transmittance at 555nm, which is close to the emission spectrum peak of F8BT, of Ag are 8.3Ω/sq and 62.3%, those of ZnO (103nm)/ITO (140nm) are 14.2Ω/sq and 83.5%, and those of the ZnO (38nm)/Ag (9nm)/ZnO (40nm)-DMD layer are 9Ω/sq and 89.9%, respectively. From these measured values, it is confirmed that the DMD film has high transmittance and conductivity equal to or higher than those of the ITO film. In addition, the DMD film has good surface flatness, as shown in the AFM image of Fig. 4
                        ; the RMS surface roughness was 0.6nm.

First, we fabricated the device structures of MoO3/F8BT/ZnO/Ag/ZnO and MoO3/F8BT/ZnO/ITO, then compared their J–V characteristics (Fig. 5
                        (a)) and L–J characteristics (Fig. 5(b)). The measurements were carried out under the pulse condition (duty rate: 10%, pulse width: 1μs) at room temperature in air. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the characteristics of the two samples, which are almost the same. This is a reasonable result since both utilize the same electron injection layer of ZnO that has very low resistivity. Next, the device with the DMD layer was measured under high current density under the lower duty rate of 1% to avoid the thermal effect. For the devices operated at 1% duty cycle had smaller current injection area of 300μm in diameter. The J–V and L–J characteristics are plotted in Fig. 6
                        (a) and (b). Because of the high conductivity of the DMD film, uniform light emission was observed under high voltage and high current conditions. A relatively high luminous intensity of 237,000cd/m2 (averaged intensity of 2370cd/m2) was observed at 15V. These results indicate that the DMD film is an attractive inorganic TCL for IO-HyLEDs.

To investigate the effect of the electron injection layer (EIL) in the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO IO-HyLED on their emission characteristics, five device structures with different EILs (A–E) were fabricated. The EIL structures of each sample are as follows: A: No EIL, B: Mg0.25Zn0.75O (10nm), C: Mg0.52Zn0.48O (10nm), D: SADM and E: SADM/Mg0.52Zn0.48O (10nm)/Mg0.25Zn0.75O (10nm). Here, we named the combination of SADM and MgZnO layers as a combination interlayer (CIL). For all the samples, the thickness of the F8BT layer was fixed at 50nm and samples were fabricated on the ZnO/Ag/ZnO-DMD films. The L–J characteristics of devices A–E are plotted in Fig. 7
                        (a). Luminance intensity at 1000mA/cm2 was lowest for A and increased in the order of B, C, D and E. It can be considered that the device properties of A, B and C were improved with increasing Mg composition of MgZnO, which corresponds to the reduction of the electron injection barrier height in the order of 1.02, 0.68 and −0.02eV. The feature of the L–J curve of device D with SADM is slightly different from those of other samples but its luminous intensity was clearly improved compared with that of device A. The effect seems to be in the same range as that of the Mg0.25Zn0.75O EIL (device B). In the case of device E with the CIL, the effect of the MgZnO bilayer and SADM on the reduction of the electron injection barrier is synergistic, and the highest performance was obtained in the samples. Fig. 7(b) shows the J–V characteristics of devices A–E. The devices A (without EIL) and D (with SADM) showed almost similar characteristics. On the other hand, the current density was clearly reduced by MgZnO EIL at the same voltage. This result can be considered that insertion of widegap MgZnO layer enhanced hole blocking effect and/or increased series resistance. The increase of barrier height of MgZnO-VBM between F8BT-HOMO is estimated to be 0.14 and 0.44eV for the devices B and C, respectively. This enhanced hole blocking effect may contribute to the improvement of emission efficiency and reduction of leakage current. It was clearly deduced that this improvement in the luminous intensity was brought about by the introduction of the EIL, which enhanced the electron injection efficiency from ZnO to F8BT and improved the charge injection balance of holes and electrons in F8BT.

The emission characteristic of the device markedly depends on the thickness of the F8BT layer. The thickness of the F8BT layer was kept constant at 50nm to undertake a systematic investigation. However, it was expected that a higher device efficiency can be obtained with the use of a thicker F8BT. Next, three samples with an 85-nm-thick F8BT layer were fabricated and some of their characteristics were compared, namely, current density at 10cd/m2 (I
                        e), open-circuit voltage (V
                        OC) under low-intensity white LED light irradiation (∼20mW/cm2) and peak luminous efficiency (L
                        peak). These three samples were named devices F, G and H with structures of MoO3/F8BT/DMD, MoO3/F8BT/SADM/DMD, and MoO3/F8BT/SADM/Mg0.52Zn0.48O (10nm)/Mg0.25Zn0.75O (10nm)/DMD, respectively. The results are summarized in table 1
                        . The I
                        e decreased in the order of device F (356mA/cm2), G (219mA/cm2) and H (61mA/cm2). It was clearly indicated that the emission characteristics at lower current density were significantly improved by the introduction of the EIL. It has also been observed that the V
                        OC was increased by the insertion of SADM and the CIL. The V
                        OC of each device were 0.4V for F, 0.5V for E and1.05V for H, respectively. This is presumed to be a phenomenon caused by a change in the effective work function of the EIL adjacent to F8BT, which is the light absorption layer [28]. The luminous efficiency was improved in the order of device F (0.44cd/A), G (1.0cd/A) and H (1.42cd/A). Thereby, it was suggested that the charge injection balance of electrons and holes has improved owing to the improvement of the electron injection efficiency by the insertion of the EIL. It was confirmed that the CIL composed of SADM and a MgZnO bilayer was effective as the EIL for the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO based IO-HyLED. The CIL facilitates electron injection by reducing the electron injection barrier, which improves the electron–hole injection balance in the emission layer of F8BT. Our IO-HyLED is not optimized yet. There is room for further improvement in performance by optimizing the device structure such as the layer thickness, light extraction structure and device fabrication process.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We investigated the effects of the TCL and the EIL on the device characteristics of the IO-HyLED with the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO system utilizing a ZnO/Ag/ZnO-DMD transparent conductive film, a MgZnO electron injection bilayer and SADM. The IO-HyLED fabricated on the DMD film showed performance similar to that of the IO-HyLED fabricated on ZnO/ITO. The DMD-based device showed a relatively high luminous intensity of 237,000cd/m2 under the pulsed driving condition. It was showed that ZnO/Ag/ZnO-DMD is a promising TCL for IO-HyLEDs. The effects of EILs composed of Mg0.25Zn0.75O, Mg0.52Zn0.48O and BA-CH3 on the emission characteristics of the devices were examined. Systematic improvements of the luminous intensity of devices by various EIL structures were observed. In the device with an 85-nm-thick F8BT, the luminous efficiency of 0.44cd/A for the device without the EIL was improved about threefold to 1.42cd/A by the synergistic effect of the CIL of the Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O bilayer and SADM (BA-CH3).

The study of IO-HyLEDs is still in the early stage. It is expected that the development of a suitable combination of inorganic and organic semiconductors and device structures will bring about the superior device performance exceeding those of inorganic LEDs or OLEDs.
