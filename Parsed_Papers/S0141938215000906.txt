                  GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ with tetragonal phase has been successfully synthesized by employing efficient irradiations. The assembly of composites with fine grains based on acoustic energy and microwave radiation requires low temperature (90°C) and short reaction time (60min). All the compounds exhibited red emissions and they can be sensitized through the doped Bi3+ ions. The dependence of pH changes and doping concentration on the fluorescence features has been discussed. The photoluminescence measurements show that the optical properties achieved the best results at pH=9 for GdVO4:Eu3+(5mol%), Bi3+(1mol%) or pH=7 for GdVO4:Eu3+.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past few years, the lanthanide containing phosphors have attracted much attention on account of their unique luminescent properties which were derived from unique intra-4f transitions [1]. It has been found Ln3+ ions have very special characteristics of sharp optical emissions. They cover a wide spectrographic range and have long-lived lifetimes, which facilitate several applications including displays, phosphors, laser crystal and so on [2]. Among them, lanthanide doped vanadate has been extensively studied owing to the excellent luminescence efficiency, stable physical and chemical properties and the abundant luminous colors [3–5]. Especially gadolinium vanadate has been paid much attention based on better laser performance, higher thermal conductivity, a larger emission or adsorption cross-sections [6,7]. It is also known that the half-filled shell ground state of the gadolinium leads to the phosphors with lowest excited levels and relatively high energy [6,7]. The encapsulated Eu3+ ions with the parity forbidden characteristics usually exhibits strong red line emissions [7,8], The resultant composite has high color purity and can be used for the fabrication of red phosphors [9,10].

Recently, numerous methods have been used to achieve these materials, such as solid state reaction, thermal evaporation, hydrothermal, sol–gel and low-temperature synthesis. The supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method appears as a new preparation technology for solid state material, which is considered to be promising in industrial application due to simple synthetic process, less energy loss, and fast efficiency. In our work, the Eu3+, Bi3+ co-doped GdVO4 phosphors were synthesized using the supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method. The dependence of pH variation and doped Bi3+ on the photoluminescence properties has been explored.

Gd2O3, Eu2O3 and Bi2O3 powders were dissolved in nitric acid, to prepare Gd(NO3)3, Bi(NO3)3, Eu(NO3)3 powders. NH4VO3 was used as a starting material. GdVO4:Bi3+, Eu3+ were synthesized by the supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method. For the synthesis of GdVO4:Bi3+, Eu3+. Microwave power was set as 200W and reaction temperature was remained to be 90°C, Supersonic power was 200W with the reverse duty cycle 2s. All the operation time was fixed as 60min. The derived samples were cooled down to room temperature in air. Centrifugation was used to collect the precipitates. After washing twice with distilled water and absolute alcohol, the as-derived sample was dried at 70°C.

Other samples GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) and GdVO4:Bi3+(0.05), Eu3+(0.05) phosphors were prepared at pH=3, 7, 9 because the acidification of an aqueous system plays an important role in the formation of complex phosphors. Then the concentration of Bi3+ was controlled at 1–9mol% to explore the influence of Bi3+ concentration for forming phosphors, and pH was controlled at 9.

The formation of gadolinium vanadate powder was confirmed by XRD patterns and the measurement was investigated on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
                     =0.1541nm) in the range of 2θ
                     =10–80°. The morphological information and characteristics of the samples were studied by a JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi-2500 FL Spectrophotometer. Absolute quantum yields were detected at room temperature through an integrating sphere within an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Eu3+, Bi3+ co-doped GdVO4 phosphors are synthesized using a supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method. The rare earth vanadate has a tetragonal structure owing to the system which Gd and V atoms occupied the centers of oxygen tetrahedron. The surrounding oxygen atoms were adjacent to the vanadium. The doped Bi3+ and Eu3+ ions replace the site of the Gd3+ cation when they enter into the tetragonal structure. It is considered that the acidity of the solution will be closely related to the formation of crystal structure [11]. Accordingly, we study the effects of the pH value via the powder XRD pattern compared with JCPDS Card No. 72-0277. The Fig. 1(a)
                      displays powder XRD features of GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) at pH=3, 7 and 9. In this curve, we can find that the rare earth vanadate crystal structure can be perfectly formed at pH=7 because the sharp diffraction peaks match well with the standard pattern of GdVO4. To investigate the influence of doping Bi3+ ions on the information of the GdVO4 crystal structure, we compare the curves between GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) and GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+(0.05) at pH=9 via the Fig. 1(b)
                     . It is shown that the insertion of Bi3+ ions into the host will stimulate the crystal growth and demonstrate the production of tetragonal phase [12].

It has been reported that the pH value has a significant effect on the optical properties for most phosphors [13]. Therefore, we studied the fluorescence spectra at different pH values. The emission and excitation spectra of the GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) were monitored at room temperature and the results were given in Fig. 2
                     
                     . The excitation spectra had a broad band between 220 and 400nm and the peak maximum at pH=7 was situated at 290nm (Em=615nm). The emission spectra exhibited the narrow bands from 4f–4f transitions within Eu3+ ions in the region of 550–750nm (Ex=290nm). It can be observed that the most intensive red luminescence was achieved at pH=7. It has been well accepted that nonradiative processes will frequently compete with radiative transitions. Based on the collected results, it has been considered that acidic and basic synthetic conditions would lead to higher vibrational frequency of the surroundings (such as hydroxide ions) that may quench the europium (III) emissions effectively. The ground state properties of the vanadates groups in the presence of non-neutral environment were also different (distances to lanthanide ions and vibrational frequencies). In addition, phosphor prepared at pH=7.0 might have more rigid and stiff lattices than other samples [14]. In this way, its nonradiative transitions (pH at 7.0) could be suppressed.

It is accepted that Bi3+ can be used as an activator, as well as a sensitizer of luminescence. It might be interesting to study the luminescent properties and the energy transfer of the Bi3+ ions. We also focused on the influence of the Bi3+ ions for GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) phosphors. The curves in Fig. 3a and b
                     
                      showed excitation (Em=615nm) and the emission spectra (Ex=290nm) of both GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) and GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+(0.05) at pH=7. In Fig. 3(a), we could observe a broad band located at around 290nm in the sample of GdVO4:Eu3+ and it was assigned to be the charge transfer band from oxygen to vanadium atom within VO4
                     3− moiety. Interestingly, the peak intensity of the band was significantly enhanced due to the introduction of Bi3+, suggesting that the possible metal–metal interactions (Bi3+
                     →V5+) would facilitate the charge transfer transitions of the derived phosphor (GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+). Furthermore, the sharp excitation band at 396nm is related to the transition of the 7F0–5L6 within the 4f6 about Eu3+ ions. In the emission spectra, it is clearly seen that there were two major peaks at 595nm and 617nm. The narrow band at 617nm is the electric dipole transition with Eu3+ ions 5D0–7F2. The band at 595nm corresponds to the transition of Eu3+ ions 5D0–7F1 
                     [15–18]. The peaks at 540 and 700nm were corresponding to the transitions of Eu3+ ions 5D1–7F1 and 5D0–7F4. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity significantly increased with the introduction of Bi3+ ions, indicating that the incorporation of Bi3+ contributed to the charge transfer processes and more absorbed energy (by vanadate) has been migrated to Eu3+ ions [19].


                     Fig. 4
                      shows the emission spectra of the GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+(0.05) at different pH values (pH=3, 7 and 9). The excitation bands were located from 225nm to 400nm and pH=9 was proved to be the most suitable value (Fig. S1). The 7F0–5L6 transition within the 4f6 configuration of the Eu3+ ions leads to the sharp and small excitation band at 396nm. Fig. 4 shows the emission spectra of the GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ phosphors. The europium emissions were clearly observed by the peaks at 595nm, 617nm, 655nm and 705nm, which can be attributed to the electric transitions of the Eu3+ ion from the 5D0 to the 7F
                        J
                      (J
                     =1, 2, 3, 4) levels. When the pH value was changed to 9, the enhanced intensity is perceived. A much lower emission intensity was obtained at pH=3. The encapsulation of Bi3+ at different pH values would lead to distorted lattices. Because 5D0
                     →
                     7F2 transition is hypersensitive to the symmetry of crystal fields. When the symmetry remains to be low, this electric-dipole transition (5D0
                     →
                     7F2) would be dominant and intensive. The experimental results proved that the crystal lattices were more distorted at high pH value than the other samples. Additionally, these results were probably related the intermediate product BiONO3 
                     [20]. Bi(NO3)3 occurred hydrolysis reaction with water and formed BiONO3. It quickly reacted with VO3
                     − and BiVO4 was achieved. If the solution is in acidic conditions, the formation of the intermediate product (BiONO3) is largely prohibited because of the reverse reaction during the hydrolysis processes. Therefore, the higher pH environment may helpful for the formation of BiVO4 and the expected energy transfer can be realized.

For the sake of clarifying the effects of Bi3+ concentration on the emission features, a group of Eu3+, Bi3+co-doped GdVO4 phosphors were prepared under similar conditions. Fig. S2 and Fig. 5
                      shows the excitation and the emission spectra of the GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+ at pH=9 when Bi3+ concentration is controlled at 1%, 5% and 9%. Facts proved that lowest quantities of Bi3+ would lead to most intensive red emissions. We also measured the absolute quantum yields of bismuth incorporated gadolinium vanadates, the results supported that the concentration of 1% would be the most suitable parameter (Table S1). It was known that the color of any light source could be identified as (x,y) coordinates in the color space [21]. For the sample of the GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+(0.01) at pH=9, the chromaticity coordinates were determined to be (0.58, 0.33) as given in Fig. 6
                     .

The morphology of the Eu3+, Bi3+ co-doped GdVO4 phosphor was further examined by SEM. Fig. 7
                      gives the image of the sample prepared within only one hour at 90°C (pH=9). Obviously, the co-irradiations by supersonic and microwave had a significant effect on the morphology of the resultant phosphors. It formed a new and interesting ultrafine particle shape of GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05), Bi3+(0.05) with diameter of less than 100nm. The porous microstructure might be valuable for specific gas adsorption. However, the corresponding morphology changed completely at pH=3 (Fig. S3). The shape of particles varied from granules to micro-meter scale rods and many irregular aggregates with wide size distributions were formed. This drastic change of microstructures would be closely related to its emission reductions under acidic conditions as mentioned in the above section.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have successfully synthesized GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ red phosphors via a supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method at 90°C within 60min. The synthetic conditions including the pH values and the concentration of Bi3+ were investigated in detail. The results demonstrated that the phosphor gains the optimal photoluminescence at a condition of pH=9 and 1% Bi3+ co-doping. We considered that this mild and convenient SMC method would provide an alternative and efficient pathway for the preparation of novel vanadates.
