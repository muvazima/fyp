                  This paper examines location assignment for outbound containers in container terminals. It is an extension to the previous modeling work of Kim et al. (2000) and Zhang et al. (2010). The previous model was an “optimistic” handling way and gave a moderate punishment for placing a lighter container onto the top of a stack already loaded with heavier containers. Considering that the original model neglected the stack height and the state-changing magnitude information when interpreting the punishment parameter and hid too much information about the specific configurations for a given stack representation, we propose two new “conservative” allocation models in this paper. One considers the stack height and the state-changing magnitude information by reinterpreting the punishment parameter and the other further considers the specific configurations for a given stack representation. Solution qualities for the “optimistic” and the two “conservative” allocation models are compared on two performance indicators. The numerical experiments indicate that both the first and second “conservative” allocation models outperform the original model in terms of the two performance indicators. In addition, to overcome computational difficulties encountered by the dynamic programming algorithm for large-scale problems, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm is presented as well.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In container terminals, seeking a proper yard location for a newly arriving outbound container is an important issue. It is a common practice that the heavier containers are loaded earlier than the lighter ones during the loading operations. Therefore, a relocation movement generally occurs when a lighter container is stacked on the top of a heavier one. A proper location-assignment strategy or policy can avoid burying the heavier containers underneath and reduce relocation movements for the upcoming loading operations.

To place a newly arriving container onto a stack, the following three decisions at different levels need to be made: (1) allocating yard blocks or sub-blocks to the outbound containers destined for each arriving vessel; (2) allocating yard bays to the containers of the same group (i.e., the containers of the same length, destined for the same destination port and the same vessel); (3) assigning a yard location, within the range of a single yard bay, to each newly arriving container. This paper is concerned about the lowest-level decision. For the higher-level decisions, please refer to Kim and Park (2003), Zhang, Liu, Wan, Murty, and Linn (2003), Lee, Chew, Tan, and Han (2006), Han, Lee, Chew, and Tan (2008), Zhang, Zhang, Zheng, and Miao (2011), Jiang, Lee, and Chew (2012), Yu and Qi (2012) and the papers therein.


                     Kozan and Preston (2006) integrated container transfer model with container location model. In that paper, the models were evaluated by the transfer time between the storage location and the destined vessel. The related research can be found in Preston and Kozan (2001) and Kozan and Preston (1999). Dekker, Voogd, and Asperen (2006) used a simulation method to compare random stacking with category stacking by the number of relocation movements. Kang, Ryu, and Kim (2006) attempted to accommodate all realizations of container arrivals by a stacking strategy, which was also evaluated by the number of relocation movements via simulation. Chen and Lu (2012) proposed a hybrid sequence stacking algorithm and compared it with a random stacking algorithm and a vertical stacking algorithm. Jang, Kim, and Kim (2013) suggested a genetic algorithm to determine the storage location for each arriving container in order to minimize the expected number of relocation movements.

Similar to the above papers, Kim, Park, and Ryu (2000) and Zhang, Chen, Shi, and Zheng (2010) also used the number of relocation movements to evaluate the stacking strategy but the difference is that an analytical model rather than (meta-) heuristic algorithms were used to generate the feasible yard location (or the stacking priority sequence called in the referenced papers) for the newly arriving container. This paper is an extension to Kim et al. (2000) and Zhang et al. (2010). The difference between them is that a punishment coefficient, for placing a lighter container onto the top of a stack already loaded with heavier containers, was treated “optimistically” in the previous work while it is treated relatively “conservatively” in this study. In particular, considering that the original model neglected the stack height and the state-changing magnitude information when interpreting the punishment parameter, and hid too much information about the specific configurations for a given stack representation, we propose two new “conservative” allocation models in this paper. One considers the stack height and the state-changing magnitude information by reinterpreting the punishment parameter and the other further considers the specific configurations for a given stack representation. These two new allocation models may lead to better solutions. That is the motivation of this paper. In addition, to overcome computational difficulties encountered by the dynamic programming algorithm for large-scale problems, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm is also presented.

In addition, container pre-marshaling (reposition), which is closely pertaining to the location assignment for arriving containers, is another hot research topic. Given a yard layout and a sequence that containers are loaded onto a ship, Lee and Hsu (2007) formulated an integer programming model to reposition the containers to ensure that no extra relocations are needed during the loading operation. For the similar problem, Lee and Chao (2009) proposed a heuristic which consists of a neighborhood search process, an integer programming model and three minor subroutines; Kim and Hong (2006) proposed a branch-and-bound algorithm and a heuristic rule based on dynamic programming results; Caserta, VoB, and Sniedovich (2011) presented a corridor method inspired algorithm; Zhu, Qin, Lim, and Zhang (2012) investigated iterative deepening A* algorithms using new lower bound measures and heuristics; and Huang and Lin (2012) proposed two labeling algorithms for two relocation problems.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The original model is presented in Section 2; the two “conservative” allocation models are presented in Section 3, followed by an approximate dynamic programming algorithm in Section 4; the comparisons among models are presented in Section 5; and the conclusions are drawn in the last section.

The definitions related to the model are presented as follows:


                        Stage: the total number of empty slots in a yard bay under consideration. The example as shown in Fig. 1
                         is in stage 7, as its total number of empty slots is 7.


                        State: the state of a yard bay which consists of the combination of the number of empty slots in each stack and the combination of the representation of each stack. In particular, in the original model the representation of a stack is represented by the heaviest weight group of its loaded containers. When a stack is full, the stack is conventionally represented as “0” no matter what containers it contains. When a stack is totally empty, it is represented as “*”. Stacks are sorted in the decreasing order of the number of empty slots. When several stacks have the same number of empty slots, the one with the heavier weight group is placed in front of the others. For example, the yard bay as shown in Fig. 1, which has a bay pattern with 6 stacks, 4 tiers and 3 weight groups (heavy (H), medium (M) and light (L)), has a state represented as (221110 LLHHM0) according to the aforementioned rules.

The notations related to the model are presented as follows:
                           
                              
                                 s: the number of stacks in a yard bay.


                                 t: the number of tiers in a stack.


                                 N: the total number of stages (not including the stage with zero empty slot) which is equal to 
                                    
                                       s

The elements in G are indexed in the decreasing order of their weight groups.

                      for all stack components is within 1 for the original model, which means a moderate punishment is given to place a lighter container onto the top of a stack already loaded with the heavier containers. That is why we call the original model an “optimistic” allocation model. In the following, we will introduce two new “conservative” allocation models by reinterpreting

                         is set as 1. In fact, the lighter containers are desired to be placed as low as possible so that more upper locations can be reserved for the upcoming heavier containers. Secondly, the changing magnitude of the stack state had not been considered. That is, when a container of a heavier weight group

                         is placed onto the top of a lighter stack, no matter how much the weight state of the stack has increased,

                         is set as 0. In fact, the weight state of a stack is desired to be increased as little as possible, due to the fact that the relocation probability of a stack is increased when the weight state of the stack is increased.

To overcome the two shortcomings mentioned above, we need to propose a new model, for which the additional notations are given as follows:

                                 w: the heaviest weight group of a stack. When

                                  is set as 0, and when 
                                    
                                       e

                        , the dynamic programming model as shown in (1) is still valid. The computational processes are similar to those illustrated in Kim et al. (2000). The partial solutions of the P1 model for the bay pattern with

                        .

Another shortcoming of the original model is that too much information has been hidden in the original stack representation. For example, a “2,H” stack has 5 configurations as shown in Fig. 3
                           . When a newly arriving container with weight group “L” is placed onto the top of this stack,

                            is set 1 no matter which specific configuration is occurred. Maybe discriminating them can produce better solutions. That is the motivation of this section.

Enumerating all stack configurations is not viable due to a long computational time. Instead, this paper proposes a relatively simple state representation which still includes two parts. The first part is still the combination of the number of empty slots in each stack, while the original second part, which is the combination of the heaviest weight group in each stack, is replaced by the combination of the weight group components of each stack. The weight group components of a stack mean the specific number of each weight group in the stack. In order to make this specific number as easy as possible, the three weight groups (heavy, medium, light) are respectively represented as (100, 10, 1) instead of (H, M, L) as in the original representation. Fig. 4
                            shows how to represent a bay by using the new representations of weight groups. For example, (M H L) in stack 4 is represented as 10+100+1=111. When the stack is full, the stack is conventionally represented as “f”. Note that the new state representation is also sorted by the number of empty slots in the decreasing order. If a tie exists, the stack with a greater value of the stacking components is placed in front of the other. Note that in practice, t is normally less than 6. That is why we can represent the three weight groups (H, M, L) respectively as (100, 10, 1). Otherwise, ten “L” containers may be seen as an “M” container if t is allowed to be larger than or equal to 10.

                            in this section will be interpreted as “the number of containers which are heavier than the newly arriving one”. This number can be easily obtained by comparing the weight group of the newly arriving container and the value of the stacking components of the stack. For example, when a container of the lightest weight group (which is represented as 1) is going to be placed onto stack 4 in Fig. 4 (which is represented as 111), the corresponding punishment coefficient

That is to say, we give a heavier punishment for placing a lighter container onto the top of a stack already loaded with more heavier containers. Therefore, when compared to the original model, the P2 model is more likely to place a newly arriving container onto the top of a stack with equal or lighter weight groups.

From Theorems 1 and 2, we see that the computational complexities of the dynamic programming models increase exponentially with the parameter sizes. The preliminary experiments also show that solution results cannot be obtained for some test problems with a large size of bay patterns within a reasonable amount of time, not to mention using these results for yard allocation of containers. Therefore, we have to seek other methods to deal with such problems.

Rollout algorithm is a widely used approximate dynamic programming solution method which was proposed by Bertsekas, Tsitsiklis, and Wu (1997). Its main idea is to use simulation and function approximation to replace the cost-to-go function, i.e., replacing

                         values of the P1 (original) model. First, it is needed to calculate the number of elements included in a stacking priority sequence. For a stack with at least one empty slot, there exist at most

                         kinds of weight groups (states), and a stack has at most t empty slots. Therefore, the number of element included in a stacking priority sequence is

                         times of comparisons are needed to determine a stack for the newly arriving container by searching the stacking priority sequence. Assume that the comparison time is a constant and we are only concerned about the total number to execute these comparisons. Then, we have the following theorem.

                      times that of the original model. In this section, we will compare them further by counting their state sizes under different bay patterns. In addition, we also want to know how much benefit the “conservative” allocation models can bring when compared with the original model. In the following experiments, containers with different weight groups are assumed to have an equal arrival probability. All programs are coded in JAVA and run on a computer with a 3.16-GHz Intel Xeon processor and a 16GB RAM.

The numerical results related to state sizes are summarized in Table 5
                         where “R” column represents the ratio of the state sizes between the P2 and the original models. From Table 5, we see that the ratio of the state sizes increases with 
                           
                              s

                        . In addition, we also see that the computational time for the original model is within 35s, demonstrating its efficiency. However, solution results cannot be obtained for some bay patterns by the P2 model within 12h, and therefore their applications are limited by the size of bay patterns. Fortunately, the typical bay pattern for outbound containers is

                        . Locate each arriving container by repeatedly querying the dynamic programming results until a yard bay is fully stacked. Then, based on the full bay, we can compare these three different models. Therefore, the comparison flow chart applied in this paper is shown in Fig. 6
                        : (1) the first step is to calculate the dynamic programming results; (2) the second step is to generate the container-arriving sequence for comparisons; (3) the third step is to construct a full bay according to the dynamic programming results; (4) the fourth step is to evaluate the full bay just constructed according to some performance indicator.

In addition, we also compare these dynamic programming methods with a group-based stacking (GS) heuristic which is similar to the one employed in Chen and Lu (2012). GS means stacking containers onto the stack with the same weight group as much as possible. The specific procedure is shown below:
                           
                              
                                 Step 1: Stack the arriving container onto the stack with containers whose weight groups are all the same as that of the arriving container. If a tie exists, place it onto such a stack with the smallest number of containers. If there is no such a candidate stack but there is an empty stack available, place the arriving container onto the empty stack.


                                 Step 2: If Step 1 is not satisfied, place the arriving container onto the stack with the heaviest weight group that is the lightest among all. If a tie exists, place it onto such a stack with the smallest number of containers.


                                 Step 3: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for the next arriving container until the bay is fully stacked.

                        , and only two sets of arrival sequences are employed for comparison for each bay pattern.

As for the performance indicator, we suggest using two indicators: One is a static indicator and the other is a dynamic indicator (Chen & Lu, 2012).

The static indicator means “the sum of the tier-number difference between the lighter container and the heavier one stacked underneath”. This indicator counts the number of heavier containers stacked underneath and takes into account how deep they are buried underneath. Here we use Fig. 1 as an example to explain how to calculate it. For stacks 1 and 2 in Fig. 1, all containers are the same and therefore there are no heavier containers stacked underneath the lighter ones; the same situation happens to stack 3; for stack 4, container “H” is stacked underneath containers “M” and “L” whose tier numbers are respectively 2 and 1 higher than that of container “H”, and therefore the total tier-number difference of this stack is 2+1=3; for stack 5, container “M” is stacked underneath container “L” and the tier-number difference between them is 1; and for stack 6, there are no heavier containers stacked underneath the lighter ones. Therefore, the sum of the tier-number difference between the lighter containers and the heavier ones stacked underneath for this yard bay is 3+1=4.

The dynamic indicator means the number of relocation movements occurring during the whole loading process by simulation. The loading precedence follows the following three rules sequentially: (1) the heavier container is loaded before the lighter one; (2) the containers on the upper tier are loaded before those on the lower tier; and (3) the stack closer to the vehicle lane is loaded before those farther away. This loading precedence is close to the practice. As to the positioning for the relocated containers, we apply the rules which, proposed in Kim and Hong (2006), choose for the relocated container the stack with the minimally added number of relocation movements. For more details, please refer to Kim and Hong (2006).

Before comparing the three allocation models, the two parameters

                            used in (3) and (4) need to be given first. Normally, the first parameter is given a higher priority than the second one. Therefore, in the experiments,

The results of model comparisons are summarized in Tables 8–11

From the four tables we see that the average values of R1 and R2 for both performance indicators under two different container-arriving sequences are all less than 1, demonstrating that the “conservative” allocation models indeed improve the solution quality. From these tables, we also see that the time for constructing a yard bay by querying the dynamic programming results for a relatively large bay pattern with

In addition, we also notice that in Table 8 some bay patterns obtain the same results for the static performance indicator. For example, bay patterns {5,4,2}, {6,4,2} and {7,4,2} obtain the same values under each allocation model. The reason is that the number of the container-arriving sequences generated for comparisons, i.e.,

                            arriving sequences. Alternatively, we test it on a set of 1000 arriving sequences randomly generated according to their weight group probability information. The numerical results are shown in Table 12
                            where the entries in the “ave.” and “stdev.” columns respectively represent the n-run average and standard deviation of the performance indicators. From the table, we see that the performance of the rollout algorithm approximately improves incrementally with

                           , and it can be shown that there is no significant difference between the 10-run and 30-run results. Although the rollout algorithm does not outperform the original model, it is a reasonable choice as long as we can find a good base policy, especially when the dynamic programming results are unavailable or cost-consumable.

                      and a new bay representation are suggested. The original and the two new models are compared on two performance indicators. The numerical experiments indicate that both the first and second “conservative” allocation models outperform the original model in terms of the performance indicators. In addition, considering that solution results cannot be obtained for some test problems with a large size of bay patterns within a reasonable amount of time, we propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithm as well. In this paper, the yard bay allocation for the containers of the same group, and the location assignment for each newly arriving container are treated sequentially. Due to their tight connection, solving them together is an important topic for future study. In addition, the base policy of the rollout algorithm has a significant impact on the performance, and therefore seeking a better base policy is also promising for future study.
