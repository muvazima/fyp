               Abstract
               
                  Human emotional recognition using physiological signals is relatively recent. The interest to this field has been motivated by the robustness of physiological traits to avoid the artifacts created by human social masking. In this paper our attention is focus on two aims: the development of an anxiety recognition system using only one physiological signal “Blood volume pulse, BVP” and the creation of a reliable anxiety model using objective assessment. This assessment is done by using dynamics of selected features. The anxiety elicitation is based on exposure to virtual reality (EVR). The results of these investigations show that this assessment technique is effective for the construction of a reliable database and hence improves the recognition system rate.
