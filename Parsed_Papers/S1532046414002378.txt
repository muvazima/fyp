                  Background
                  Pharmacovigilance is the activity related to the collection, analysis and prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) induced by drugs or biologics. The detection of adverse drug reactions is performed using statistical algorithms and groupings of ADR terms from the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities) terminology. Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) are the groupings which become a standard for assisting the retrieval and evaluation of MedDRA-coded ADR reports worldwide. Currently 84 SMQs have been created, while several important safety topics are not yet covered. Creation of SMQs is a long and tedious process performed by the experts. It relies on manual analysis of MedDRA in order to find out all the relevant terms to be included in a SMQ. Our objective is to propose an automatic method for assisting the creation of SMQs using the clustering of terms which are semantically similar.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The experimental method relies on a specific semantic resource, and also on the semantic distance algorithms and clustering approaches. We perform several experiments in order to define the optimal parameters.
               
               
                  Results
                  Our results show that the proposed method can assist the creation of SMQs and make this process faster and systematic. The average performance of the method is precision 59% and recall 26%. The correlation of the results obtained is 0.72 against the medical doctors judgments and 0.78 against the medical coders judgments.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  These results and additional evaluation indicate that the generated clusters can be efficiently used for the detection of pharmacovigilance signals, as they provide better signal detection than the existing SMQs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During new drug development, clinical trials are performed in order to test them, to study the reaction of human subjects to them and to detect the most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and risks. However, the clinical trials involve several thousand patients at most. As a result, less common ADRs, although they may be severe, remain often undiscovered at the end of the clinical trials and when a drug is put on the market. Continuous surveillance of the safety topics (i.e., Haemorrhages, Anaphylactic shock, Rhabdomyolysis, Acute renal failure, Cardiac failure) and of the use of the drugs is then necessary. It is done through pharmacovigilance activity accomplished at regional, national and international levels. This activity relies on collection and analysis of spontaneous reports submitted by health professionals and, in some countries, by patients. Although the collection of spontaneous reports is not exhaustive [1,2], the resulting pharmacovigilance databases are very large. To facilitate pharmacovigilance data recording and analysis, the ADRs from the spontaneous reports are coded using a controlled vocabulary, usually MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities) [3]. Then, pharmacovigilance experts perform a manual review of these reports. More recently, in some countries, statistical data mining techniques are also applied [4,5]. However, it was observed that because pharmacovigilance terminologies are often fine-grained (i.e., MedDRA contains over 80,000 terms), the combination of multiple terms denoting similar notions (e.g., Hepatitis infectious, Hepatitis infectious mononucleosis, Hepatitis viral) is necessary during the signal detection
                        1
                        Pharmacovigilance signal is a new or unknown relation between a drug and an ADR.
                     
                     
                        1
                      
                     [6,7]. In this context, the groupings of semantically close ADR terms can be useful.

Our objective is to propose new and efficient methods for assisting signal detection and for grouping pharmacovigilance terms. This is a poorly investigated area. More precisely, we propose to rely on semantic distance and clustering methods, which we assume to be likely to produce relevant clusters because semantically close terms may be detected and grouped together with these methods. We chose the MedDRA terminology because it is used worldwide in the pharmacovigilance domain.

In the remainder of this article, we first present the related work. We then describe material and methods we propose for testing and evaluating our approach. In order to better assess the proposed method relevance, special attention is paid to the evaluation of the generated clusters. We finally discuss the obtained results and conclude with some perspectives.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The MedDRA terms are structured into five hierarchical levels (Table 1
                        ): System Organ Class (SOC), High Level Group Term (HLGT), High Level Term (HLT), Preferred Term (PT) and Low Level Term (LLT). The highest level SOC is related to human body organs (such as Cardiac disorders, Immune system disorders, Eye disorders or Psychiatric disorders), while other levels provide hierarchical subsumption of terms from the corresponding lower level. For instance, the PT Brachycardia term is subsumed by its HLT term Rate and rhythm disorders. The LLT terms have a special place [8]: they can be synonyms of their PTs or they can convey more specific notions (Bradycardiac tendency or Reflex bradycardia in Table 1).

In the existing studies, grouping of pharmacovigilance terms is based either on the MedDRA terminology structure or on the use of derived resources. The first type of approach for term grouping is based on the hierarchical structure of MedDRA, that is the HTL, HLGT or SOC levels [9,10]. It considers together terms which have common hierarchical parents or ancestors and which also share some common semantic features. However, it was observed that some safety topics are transverse to these hierarchical levels of MedDRA, which means that relevant terms can belong to different HLTs, HLGTs or SOCs. This fact led to the development of the Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) containing MedDRA terms in connection with a safety topic [11] and independently from the SOCs of these terms. For example, the Haemorrhages SMQ contains an aggregation of the MedDRA terms related to bleeding in all parts of the body, and thus in a broad set of SOCs (Vascular disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, Reproductive system and breast disorders, etc.). The SMQs are developed by international groups of experts looking manually through the MedDRA terminology in order to detect relevant terms to each SMQ.

A specific resource, called ontoEIM
                           2
                           ontoEIM stands for ontologie des Événements Iatrogènes Médicamenteux (ontology of drug-induced events).
                        
                        
                           2
                         
                        [12], has been created by projecting MedDRA and WHO-ART (WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology) terminologies on the SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms) terminology [13]. This projection was performed using the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) [14], which already merges and partially aligns these terminologies. ontoEIM was then used to perform hierarchical subsumption of terms and to group them together [12,15]. Precision observed was high while recall was extremely low, which may be explained by the fact that hierarchical subsumption seems to be irrelevant for the creation of groupings of pharmacovigilance terms. In other experiments, the ontoEIM resource has been exploited with a semantic distance approach and applied to a subset of MedDRA [16] and WHO-ART terms [17]. In the WHO-ART related experiment, the obtained groupings demonstrated interesting results, because several semantic relationships were indeed detected (synonyms, antonyms, physiological functions or abnormalities, associated symptoms, abnormal laboratory tests, pathologies and their causes, close anatomical localizations, degrees of severity, and heterogeneous groupings), although these groupings have not been compared with the SMQs. Therefore, we propose to further adapt and evaluate semantic distance measures for this task.

Semantic distance and similarity measures indicate the semantic relatedness between two words or expressions. In the following, we call them semantic distance measures. The advantage of these measures is that they quantify semantic relatedness and provide numerical values, which can feed other computational applications. Several approaches exist to compute them. Typically, these measures are distinguished according to whether they rely on corpora or on tree-structured resources (lexical networks, terminologies, ontologies, etc.) and/or whether they are path-based or node-based. In Table 2
                        , we indicate the most frequently used semantic distance measures. Measures from the first series [18–22] are path-based. The first and the simplest measure of the kind was proposed by Rada [18]: it relies on tree-structured resources and counts the edges between two entities. The measures from this set use only hierarchical is-a relations. As indicated in Table 2, path-based approaches may take into account other factors such as depth, nearest common parent or density.

The second set of measures [23–26] are node-based. They rely on corpora, used with [24] or without tree-structured resources. Semantic information content, which allows semantic relatedness to be computed between two nodes (terms or expressions), is then associated with the nodes. It can rely on features such as frequency observed in corpora, semantic specificity and depth in a tree-structured resource.

The common feature of the third series of measures [27–30] is that they use not only hierarchical relations, but also other types of relations (such as treatment of, causes, finding site of, and associated morphology of). Such relations are indeed available in some terminologies and ontologies, such as SNOMED CT [13], FMA (Foundational Model of Anatomy) [31] or WordNet [32]. For instance, in the SNOMED CT, the terms renal insufficiency and kidney belong respectively to Disorders and Body structure hierarchies and are connected by the finding site of relation: renal insufficiency is localized in kidney. Because the meaning of non-hierarchical relations may be very different, these relations have to be ranked and some paths (i.e., from non-hierarchical to hierarchical relations) may be forbidden.

Finally, it is important to note that the existing similarity measures, even if they have been designed in other contexts, may be adapted to biomedical data and terminologies, i.e., MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), SNOMED CT, GO (Gene Ontology) [33–36].

The objective of clustering methods is to organize similar objects (i.e., terms) within homogeneous groups, while dissimilar objects (or terms) will belong to different groups. We distinguish three categories of clustering algorithms, according to the types of generated clusters: (1) disjoint clusters (a given object may belong to one cluster only), (2) non disjoint clusters (a given object may belong to more than one cluster), and (3) hierarchical clusters considered as non disjoint when viewed through the dendrogram (smaller clusters are included into the larger clusters) or disjoint once the dendrogram is cut. We describe some of the algorithms in the following.

Disjoint clustering is performed with algorithms such as k-means 
                        [37], k-medoids and PAM 
                        [38]. They are adapted to large data processing. With these algorithms, it is necessary to indicate the number of clusters to be generated. Their specificity (number of clusters to be generated must be indicated and disjoint character of the clusters) is not suitable for our present study. Non disjoint clustering is performed with so-called, fuzzy or soft algorithms. Fuzzy algorithms (fuzzy c-means 
                        [39], fuzzy c-medoids 
                        [40] or axial k-means 
                        [41]) state the degree up to which an object belongs to each concerned cluster. The difficulty with these algorithms is that they require to set up thresholds, which may be a difficult step. The few existing soft clustering algorithms (i.e., PoBOC [42], OKM [43] and Radius 
                        [44]) also allow an intersection between generated clusters but without specifying the relevance degree of each entity to a given cluster. Finally, several hierarchical clustering algorithms have been proposed (AGNES [45,46], BIRCH [47], CURE [48] and DIANA [46]). With these algorithms, it is not necessary to set up the number of classes, which makes them easy to apply. We assume non disjoint soft clustering and hierarchical clustering may be suitable for our purpose, and therefore propose to apply and test them in our study.

Our material is specific to the pharmacovigilance area and consists of terms from the MedDRA terminology [3], the reference groupings of terms, and a pharmacovigilance database.

The MedDRA-derived ontoEIM resource [12] has been created using the UMLS (version 2010AB) in which some MedDRA (46%) and SNOMED CT terms are already aligned. This resource can be easily updated with new releases of the UMLS. ontoEIM improves MedDRA PT terms representation. The first advantage is that the MedDRA term structure becomes parallel to their structuring in SNOMED CT, which makes it more fine-grained: a SNOMED CT-derived hierarchy of the MedDRA terms contains terms and intermediate hierarchical levels absent in MedDRA. Thus, on the right graph of Fig. 1
                        , MedDRA terms are blue
                           3
                           For interpretation of color in Figs. 1 and 6, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.

                         nodes while all other terms (red nodes) are provided only by SNOMED CT. Another advantage is that ADR terms may be decomposed into semantic primitives. In our study, we decompose them into two primitives (Disorders and Body structure) from the SNOMED CT, as exemplified on Figs. 1 and 3: for instance, Gastric ulcer is decomposed into Ulcer and Stomach.

ontoEIM (MedDRA PT terms, their structure and semantic decomposition) is our main material for creating MedDRA ADR term groupings. We use PT terms because they are used for the coding of pharmacovigilance reports and also form the core part of the SMQs, which may be further extended with their LLT terms.

We use 84 existing SMQs (2011 version), which cover several safety topics such as Haemorrhages, Anaphylactic shock, Rhabdomyolysis, Acute renal failure, and Cardiac failure. SMQs contain terms which are distinguished according to whether they belong to the narrow or broad version of the SMQs. On the Acute renal failure SMQ example, the narrow version contains main terms which are strongly associated to this ADR (i.e., Renal failure, Dialysis, Renal impairment, Haemodialysis), while the broad version includes also secondary terms (i.e., Urine output decreased, Nephritis, Renal transplant, Renal tubular disorder) which become meaningful when they are combined between them or with main terms. SMQs are used as the gold standard to evaluate generated ADR term groupings.

@&#METHODS@&#

The proposed method is organized into three main steps (Fig. 2
                     ): (1) computing the semantic distance between the ADR terms, (2) clustering the ADR terms, and (3) evaluation of the obtained clusters. Implementation is done in Perl and R

                      languages. In previous work [49,44], we started to exploit such methods, while in the current experiments we further adapt them to the creation of groupings of the ADR terms and perform a detailed evaluation within direct (theoretical) and indirect (applicational) contexts.

Semantic distance is computed between the 7629 PT MedDRA terms present in the ontoEIM resource. We use only the PT terms because they constitute the SMQs and they are used for the coding of pharmacovigilance case reports worldwide. The computing of semantic distance is performed for every possible pair of terms to build the symmetric matrices 7629∗7629. During this step, we apply three measures to compute the semantic distance between two ADR terms t1 and t2. These measures have been chosen because they are suitable for tree-structured resources, like ontoEIM, and they involve different factors (the shortest path, the maximal depth and the nearest common parent):

                              the Rada approach [18] computes the distance and relies on the shortest path sp detection, which corresponds to the sum of this shortest path edges:

Semantic distance is computed between the ADR PT terms but also between their semantic primitives provided by the D (Disorders) and B (Body structure) axes. Semantic decomposition is exploited to make the ADR term representation fine-grained [50]. Fig. 3
                         illustrates how the shortest paths sp are computed between two ADR terms (Gastric ulcer and Pericarditis) and between their semantic primitives (axes D and B). The edge weight is set to 1 because all relations are of the same kind (hierarchical), and each shortest path value corresponds to the sum of its edge weights. For this pair of terms, we obtain the following values:

The semantic distance computing is then performed according to the three measures described above: Rada, LCH and Zhong. These semantic distances sd are then applied to compute the unique distance between the ADR terms:

                         are two ADR terms; W is the coefficient associated with each of the three terms; and sd is the semantic distance computed on a given axis and with a given semantic measure. Several experiments are performed:
                           
                              1.
                              Semantic decomposition:

                                  the semantic decomposition is taken into account and the semantic distance is computed on three axes (

                                 ), or

                                       )
                                    
                                  the semantic decomposition is not taken into account and the semantic distance is computed on the axis of ADRs only.

Coefficient W put on the ADR terms axis and on D and B axes are set either to 1 or to 2 and all the possible combinations are tested to assess the semantic decomposition impact.

Further to the application of this method, symmetric matrices 7629∗7629 are built. They contain semantic distances between ADR PT terms.

Once the distances are computed, we use them to generate clusters of terms. Because a given ADR term may appear in different SMQs (i.e., renal insufficiency occurs in 11 SMQs), we have to generate non disjoint clusters. Among the clustering methods presented in Section 3.3, we apply hierarchical classification HAC and non disjoint clustering with R Radius approach:
                           
                              •
                              the HAC hierarchical ascendant classification is performed using the R Project tools.

                                       http://www.r-project.org.
                                 
                                 
                                    6
                                  This method first chooses the best centers for clusters and then builds the term hierarchy by progressively merging smaller clusters to obtain only one big cluster. The final dendrogram is segmented into n clusters, in which n is tested within the interval [100;200;300;…,7000].

the R radius approach, with which every ADR term is considered as a possible center of a cluster and its closest terms within a given distance are clustered together with it. We test several semantic distance values within the following intervals: two singletons 2 and 3 for Rada, [0;5.059] for LCH and [0;0.49] for Zhong (the last two upper values are the maximal values obtained within the ontoEIM resource). Moreover, when terms of a small cluster are included in a bigger cluster, the small cluster is removed. In addition, when two clusters have at least 80% of common terms they are merged.

@&#EVALUATION@&#

We perform several kinds of evaluation, among which we distinguish direct and indirect evaluation, and also quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Quantitative evaluation is done against the gold standard and a baseline. It is usually measured with precision and recall values, while qualitative evaluation requires experts’ opinion. As for direct (or theoretical) evaluation, it assesses the correctness of term pairs provided by the semantic distance measures through their comparison with the similar data manually created by the experts, while indirect (or application-based) evaluation considers the same results, but through their relevance to the aimed applications. In our experiments, the applications are related to the creation of SMQs and to the signal detection.


                        Comparison of rating of term pairs with human judgment This evaluation objective is to analyze whether the measures (and the resource) can reproduce the expert opinion on the semantic relatedness between terms. In this evaluation, we rely on the reference data provided by a previous study [51]. These data contain 30 term pairs manually annotated by three medical doctors and nine medical coders. The annotators were asked to rate the term pairs on a scale [1–4], where 1 stands for semantically different terms and 4 for semantically identical terms. The correlation among the annotators is 0.68 for medical doctors and 0.78 for coders. Some of these 30 pairs could not be used in our study because:
                           
                              •
                              eleven terms from these pairs are not MedDRA terms (i.e., myocardium, calcification, lymphoid hyperplasia),

seven other terms do belong to MedDRA but are not aligned with SNOMED CT (i.e., hyperlipidemia, cholangiocarcinoma, infarctus or pulmonary fibrosis).

These two constraints reduce the number of term pairs to 14 (the first two columns in Table 4). Evaluation against the expert-rated pairs of terms is done following four steps:
                           
                              1.
                              We consider the computed similarity scores with each applied similarity measure.

We rate the term pairs according to their similarity scores.

In order to reduce the computed similarity scores to the manually applied scale [1–4] and to make this evaluation feasible, we apply the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient.

We compute the correlation between human and automatically computed scores. It is considered that the correlation 0–0.5 is very low, 0.5–0.7 low, 0.7–0.8 moderate, 0.8–0.9 high and 0.9–1 very high.


                        Comparison of clusters with the reference data (84 SMQs). Quantitative evaluation of the generated clusters is performed by comparing them with the 84 SMQs. Three classical measures are computed: precision P (number of relevant clustered terms divided by the total number of clustered terms), recall R (number of relevant clustered terms divided by the number of terms in the corresponding SMQ) and F-measure F (P and R harmonic mean). The association between the SMQs and the clusters relies on F-measure values. We evaluate the generated clusters against narrow (main ADR terms) and broad (all the terms) versions of the SMQs.


                        Comparison of clusters with the baseline (46 SMQs). For the baseline, we chose the most frequently used approach for MedDRA term grouping, which relies on the MedDRA hierarchical structure, that is hierarchical subsumption of PTs through the HLT MedDRA level [9,10,52]. Among the 1688 HLTs and 84 SMQs, 46 of them have direct (Thrombocytopenias (SMQ) and Thrombocytopenia (HLT)) or non ambiguous correspondences (Renal failure and impairment (SMQ) and Acute renal failure (HLT)). We use these 46 SMQs as our baseline reference. These 46 SMQs are a subset of the whole set of 84 SMQs. The evaluation measures are, as previously described: precision P, recall R and F-measure F.


                        Analysis of clusters with an expert. Qualitative evaluation of clusters is performed with a medical expert. The expert is asked to provide a judgment on the content of clusters and its relevance to a given safety topic. The objective of this evaluation is to propose failure analysis through the study of false positive and false negative terms.


                        Evaluation through signal detection. One last evaluation is performed with the freely available FDA AERS database in order to assess the suitability of the generated clusters for the signal detection. Several statistical tests exist
                           7
                           EBGM (Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean), IC (information component), PRR (proportional reporting ratio) and ROR (reporting odds ratio) are mathematical tools for identifying signals of disproportional reporting of suspected ADRs in association with particular drugs.

                        , i.e., EBGM applied by the FDA, IC by the World Health Organization, PRR by the UK Medicines Control Agency, ROR by the Netherlands authorities, etc. With these tests, a signal appears when the number of observed cases is higher than the number of expected cases.

                        ) imply all the drugs and all the ADRs in a pharmacovigilance database. We apply the EBGM test, used with the FDA database, to evaluate clusters generated with our methods. As an example, if EBGM=3.9 (i.e., with the pair {acetaminophen,
                        hepatic failure}), this means that this {drug,
                        ADR} pair occurs in the database 3.9 times more frequently than expected. We compute a 90% confidence interval. We use the EB05 criterion which had to be superior or equal to a threshold value of 2. The data-mining signal EB05⩾2 means that the pair {drug,
                        ADR} occurred at least twice as often as expected. Such threshold guarantees that potential signals are likely to be correct. For this evaluation, we randomly select 19 active ingredients (acetylsalicylic acid SRT, Eloxatin, Fentanyl citrate, Flovent, Humulin N, isosorbide mononitrate, Januvia, Leflunomide, Lisinopril, Lorazepam, Methadone HCl, Methotrexate sodium, Nevirapine, Pravachol, Soliris, Sutent, Torsemide, Vioxx, Zolpidem) and we compute the EB05 values for the generated clusters and the corresponding SMQs or HLTs. Then we analyze the variability values obtained between the clusters and SMQs/HLTs by computing the regression line by the method of least squares (linear equation

@&#RESULTS@&#

The 7629 ADR PT terms from ontoEIM have been processed with the three semantic measures and the two clustering algorithms outlined in previous section. For semantic measures, the best thresholds are: 2 for Rada, 4.10 for LCH and 0.20 for Zhong. With higher thresholds, the generated clusters are too large and become meaningless. The Rada measure outperforms the other two measures. With the HAC algorithm, the best results are obtained with 300 classes. In addition, we obtain better results when semantic decomposition is not applied (ADR terms only). The results we present and discuss in the following are obtained with our optimal parameters: the Rada semantic measure, no semantic decomposition, and the Radius clustering algorithm with a threshold set to 2. We then obtain 2931 clusters. The number of terms per cluster varies between 2 and 546 (mean=17). The evaluation against term pairs manually rated by several experts indicates our methods provide results very close to human judgment. The evaluation with a signal detection protocol, although we did not generate the exact content of the SMQs, indicates that the clusters seem to be suitable for the signal detection task. The manual evaluation of the clusters by a medical expert shows that relevant terms may be missing in the SMQs 
                     [9,10], some of which can be found with our methods. We detail these results in the following section.

Among all the generated pairs with the 7629 MedDRA terms, we evaluated 14 term pairs through the comparison of the computed similarity scores with those provided by human experts in a previous study [51]. Scores obtained with the three similarity measures (Rada, LCH and Zhong) for each term pair are provided in Table 4
                        . Term pairs are sorted according to their Rada similarity scores: at the top of the table, term pairs have a strong semantic association (e.g., {Renal failure, Kidney failure}, {Abortion, Miscarriage}), while at the bottom of the table, terms are judged to be semantically dissimilar (e.g., {Depression, Cellulitis}, {Peptic ulcer disease, Myopia}). In Table 5
                        , we indicate the correlations between the scores obtained with our methods and those provided by the experts in [51]. According to the grid mentioned in the Methods section, the correlation we obtain with LCH and Rada measures is moderate and close to high: 0.72 against medical doctors judgments and 0.78 against medical coders judgments. With the Zhong measure, this correlation is very low (0.46) and low (0.59). On the whole, we obtain better correlations than those reported in previous study: 0.35 and 0.50, respectively [51]. This means that the similarity scores computed with the ontoEIM resource and the applied method are quite close to human judgment, especially to the judgment of medical coders. We assume, this result may also have a positive impact on other evaluations.

The generated clusters have been evaluated against the 84 SMQs. As indicated on Fig. 4
                        , the applied method provides a good precision for several SMQs, but the recall remains low because the generated clusters are smaller than the corresponding SMQs: they usually correspond to different facets of the SMQs. The average performance is: P
                        =52, R
                        =25, F
                        =31, although there is great variability between the clusters. Some of the clusters are distinguished by their high precision (i.e., Haemorrhages, Cardiac arrhythmias, Hypertension) or high recall (i.e., Periorbital and eyelid disorders, Taste and smell disorders), others by their low precision (i.e., Taste and smell disorders, Hyponatraemia) or low recall (i.e., Anaphylactic reaction, Agranulocytosis).

In Table 6
                        , we present in detail the content of the cluster which corresponds to the SMQ Anaphylactic shock. In the first column, we indicate the MedDRA terms, in the second we specify whether these terms belong or not to the SMQ (if they do, we indicate the version, broad or narrow, of the SMQ), we then mention whether the terms are aligned with the corresponding SNOMED CT terms and whether they are included in the generated cluster. The SMQ and the cluster have 7 common terms, while 15 more terms from the cluster are not included in the SMQ. We further analyze these data below.

The comparison of the results generated by our method and the baseline are presented in Fig. 5
                        . The average performance of the proposed method is P
                        =59, R
                        =26, F
                        =33, while the baseline average performance is P
                        =60, R
                        =9, F
                        =15. With the proposed method, F-measure and recall are better than those obtained with the baseline: we gain respectively 18 and 17 points. Only precision loses one point (60 with the baseline, 59 with our method). Here again, we can observe that the performance variability across the SMQs is high. The general observation here is that, from the point of view of reproducing the SMQs, the proposed method reaches this objective better than the baseline subsumption approach usually used in the field.

Several clusters have been analyzed with an expert. We here summarize the analysis for six randomly selected SMQs (Angioedema, Anaphylactic shock, Embolic and thrombotic events arterial, Peripheral neuropathy, Haemodynamic oedema, effusions and fluid overload, and Periorbital and eyelid disorders). Table 7
                         contains information on the number of terms in these SMQs and in the corresponding clusters clu, as well as the number of common terms com between them. It then indicates the performance (precision P, recall R and F-measure F) when computed against the reference SMQs Reference and also after the analysis performed by the expert Expert.

We can observe similar situations across the generated clusters:
                           
                              •
                              they contain terms included in the SMQs, such as Anaphylactic transfusion reaction, Acute respiratory failure, Neonatal respiratory failure or Anuria for the SMQ Anaphylactic shock. These terms define the precision which is shown in Table 7, columns Reference;

they may contain terms which are not included in the SMQs. These may be true false positives (such as Solar urticaria, Urticaria thermal, Urticaria contact for the SMQ Angioedema, or Acute pulmonary oedema, Polyuria, Pulmonary renal syndrome for the SMQ Anaphylactic shock), but some of these terms could also be considered for inclusion in the SMQs: for instance, Injection site urticaria and Injection site swelling could be included in the SMQ Angioedema, while Allergic transfusion reaction, Cardiac respiratory arrest and Neonatal respiratory arrest in the SMQ Anaphylactic shock;

they may also miss relevant terms which either are not part of the ontoEIM resource, like Anaphylactic shock or Circulatory collapse (because these MedDRA terms are not aligned with SNOMED CT), or are too distant with other relevant terms within ontoEIM, such as Anaphylactoid reaction or Hepatic congestion for the SMQ Anaphylactic shock.

In other words, manual analysis of the clusters detected some terms which could be considered for inclusion in the SMQs. If we take them into account, the corrected performance of our method, indicated in the Expert columns in Table 7, is usually improved.

Thanks to this last evaluation, we analyze the impact of the generated clusters on signal detection. In Fig. 6
                        , we present the results obtained with the EBGM method for the safety topics Anaphylactic shock with the corresponding HLT term Anaphylactic responses, the SMQ and the generated cluster. On the left handside, we indicate the 19 drugs tested and the signal detection results. The main content of this figure is represented with red, yellow and green arrows: red arrows indicate that the signal is not detected, yellow arrows indicate when the signal is correctly but feebly detected, while green arrows indicate the detection of a strong signal. For each arrow the numerical value of the signal strength is also provided. On the right handside, we can see the graphical representation of the same information. Globally, four signals (both feeble and strong) are detected with the HLT, five with the reference SMQ and nine with the generated cluster: the cluster appears to be more sensitive and efficient in this context. Fig. 7
                         shows the correlation between the reference SMQ and the cluster-generated signals. The results are quite similar: the correlation is very high and close to 0.9. The small difference between them leads to a better signal detection with the generated clusters. If we look for detailed information with the cluster, we obtain two strong signals (Methotrexate sodium and Zolpidem) and seven feeble signals (e.g., Eloxatin, Flovent, Neviparine, Sutent, Torsemide). Several of these signals are not detected with the SMQ or the HLT (Eloxatin, Flovent, Nevirapine, Sutent, Torsemide). Our cluster fails to return one strong (Januvia) and two feeble (acetylsalicylic acid SRT and Torsemide) signals. Although the evaluation of clusters against the SMQs shows that our methods generate smaller sets of ADR terms (the generated clusters display an important precision but a rather feeble recall), we can now observe that the signal detection may be well managed with these clusters. A more complete evaluation with other safety topics is ongoing.

Several tests introduced in the methods make it possible to detect factors which have an impact on the results:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Semantic distances. Among the three semantic distances applied in this study (Rada, LCH and Zhong), it is surprising to observe that the simplest measure Rada, which only relies on the counting of edges, appears to be the most efficient. It is also interesting to note that the LCH algorithm provides results that are very close to those of the Rada algorithm. As for the Zhong approach, its specificity (absolute depth of terms) does not seem to be relevant for the clustering of pharmacovigilance terms. Indeed, in our task, it may be important to cluster terms from low and high hierarchical levels, while the Zhong algorithm favors hierarchically low terms.


                                 Semantic decomposition. An important difference is observed in relation to the semantic decomposition: performance is better when we only use the ADR terms, without their semantic decomposition. We assume this situation is due to the incompleteness of the currently available semantic primitives: when the semantic decomposition is not complete (only one primitive is available), the semantic distance measure is biased and leads to a distorted semantic representation and to a wrong clustering.


                                 Axes coefficients. With semantic decomposition, we tested several coefficients of axes and observed that the Disorders axis D is to be favored because it provides important indicators for several safety topics. In other words, the following coefficients suit our purpose best:

                                             ADR

                                 Clustering methods. Among the two clustering methods tested (Radius and HAC), the Radius approach generally appears to provide better results. We assume this is due to the fact that the Radius approach generates non disjoint clusters.

The use of narrow or broad versions of the SMQs has shown but a very small difference. This is a surprising result because we expected that the narrow version of the SMQs would be easier to generate.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Some of the results have been discussed in the previous section. The present discussion is dedicated to the strength and limitations of the proposed method and the obtained results, as well as their relation to existing work.

First, it should be noted that the proposed research is done within a field which is currently underexplored from the point of view of computational methods: manual and expert approaches are traditionally used there. The main input of computational methods comes from statistical tools (i.e., data mining disproportionality methods), but little or no semantic methods and resources are proposed and exploited. Such deficiency makes it difficult for us to fill in the gap completely, but we hope that our study provides a good contribution to this topic. Also noteworthy is that the pharmacovigilance area is very demanding because it is closely related to the legal and industrial frameworks. Automatic methods and tools must prove to be highly reliable and efficient before they are used by the pharmacovigilance area experts.

General positive aspects of our study include the proposal and adaptation of a new semantic method to group the ADR terms which relies on an original exploitation of the semantic distance algorithms, as well as the important effort made for the evaluation of the generated results. Table 8
                         summarizes other positive aspects of the proposed approach. These points have different integration levels within the pharmacovigilance area: from the creation and rating of simple ADR term pairs, through creation of clusters with these terms and up to the impact of these clusters on the signal detection.


                        Correlation between the rating of the generated term pairs and human judgment. The semantic similarity between terms computed with the proposed semantic similarity approaches (Rada 
                        [18], LCH 
                        [24], and Zhong 
                        [20]) and the semantic resource ontoEIM [12] appears to be very close to human judgment: its correlation is 0.72 with medical doctors and 0.78 with medical coders. We assume that the medical coders, who are more used to manipulating and working with medical terms, and obtain a better correlation among them (0.78), also propose more correct reference annotations. The fact that we obtain up to 0.78 correlation with this evaluation set is a very good result achieved by our method. Moreover, the values of semantic distance automatically computed with our method and resource also outperform the results reported on in previous study [51]: where previous studies show 0.35 and 0.50 correlations, our approach is better by 0.37 and 0.28 against the reference annotations provided by medical doctors and coders respectively. This is also a very positive result, which may indicate that the semantic distance computed for term pairs from our term set may provide a good and precise basis for the creation of clusters of the ADR terms.


                        Comparison of the generated clusters with the baseline and the reference SMQs. Other comparative elements come from the difference we can observe on the same test set between the results provided by our method and by the baseline: our method outperforms the baseline F-measure by 18 points (we gain 17% on the baseline recall but lose 1% on precision). This indicates that our method is efficient in the pharmacovigilance context related to the creation and reproduction of SMQs. As explained above, we have chosen the baseline which is the most frequently used approach for the grouping of MedDRA terms: hierarchical subsumption of PTs through the HLT MedDRA level [9,10,52]. Hence, the baseline is an authoritative approach used for this task before the SMQs have been created and used. Up to now, some experiments address the assessment and comparison between SMQs, HLTs and simple PTs for the detection of pharmacovigilance signals [9,10,52], in which the SMQs are not always the most efficient tool (they are often judged as too permissive). More generally, the average evaluation values of the generated clusters against the whole set of reference SMQs (84) are close to those obtained with the reduced set of SMQs (46): P
                        =52, R
                        =25, F
                        =31. In both cases, the generated clusters often present a good precision while being limited by their recall. As observed above, the clusters usually correspond to different facets of the existing SMQs: we assume that several clusters should be considered together to guarantee a better recall for a given SMQ. This point has been partially studied up to now. Beyond the detection of semantic relations between terms (i.e., with semantic distance algorithms), the proposed method also attempts to detect medical relations between these terms and to select those which are closely related to a given safety topic. We can observe that in this context our method is quite efficient, although the research problem addressed remains difficult.


                        Evaluation through signal detection. Evaluation of the generated clusters through detection of pharmacovigilance signals gives yet another indication on the suitability of the proposed method within this applied context. This evaluation is done with the FDA AERS pharmacovigilance database. Here, the assessment of the number of detected signals clearly indicates that the generated clusters allow to detect the highest number of signals (both strong and weak) by comparison with the signals detected with more traditional approaches: HTLs (our baseline) and SMQs. This is also a very positive and encouraging result.

Our main limitation is related to the ontoEIM resource, which suffers from the partial alignment rate with SNOMED CT: only 46% of the MedDRA PT terms are aligned through the UMLS. This means that terms which are not aligned cannot be used for the creation of clusters nor for the signal detection. To remedy this situation, we are working on the MedDRA terminology alignment: we process terms with lexical mapping and semantic categorization methods [53] and we also rely on existing work on the MedDRA terms alignment [54,55]. With such improvements, we also hope to significantly improve the clustering results in the future.

Another limitation is due to the fact that only one expert was involved in manual analysis of the generated clusters, while ideally two or more experts should be involved. Although we believe that several kinds of the evaluation performed here allow to moderate this limitation, we plan to recruit more experts for this manual evaluation phase. In the same way, evaluation through signal detection has been performed up to now with only one safety topic Anaphylactic shock. A more systematic evaluation is also ongoing.

Finally, the applied clustering algorithms should also evolve. The Radius algorithm is a rather simple approach. We plan to test other algorithms which generate non disjoint clusters, such as those mentioned in the state-of-the-art review [40,42,43]. Additionally, hierarchical clustering, which appears to be quite competitive, can be used in a better way. For instance, we started experiments on the generation of hierarchically structured SMQs and the results proved to be encouraging [44]. We therefore plan to test whether we can generate hierarchies of clusters, for which the hierarchical clustering should be particularly suitable.

There is little existing work on the automatic creation of groupings of ADR terms. In addition to the MedDRA hierarchical subsumption, which we take as baseline and discussed earlier in this section, we will now try to compare our study with other usages of the ontoEIM resource. In fact, ontoEIM rather corresponds to a method than to a given resource: within the pharmacovigilance area, this method can be applied to different ADR terminologies, MedDRA and WHO-ART, and also to different versions of these terminologies and of SNOMED CT, according to the UMLS used version. The WHO-ART-derived resources can show up to 85.9% alignment rate with the SNOMED CT terms. Previous exploitations of this family of resources are the following:
                           
                              •
                              semantic similarity within a MedDRA-derived resource subset [16]: no comparison is done with the SMQs;

semantic similarity within a WHO-ART-derived resource subset [17]: no comparison is done with the SMQs, but the authors provide a manual analysis and description of semantic relations within generated clusters (such as synonyms, antonyms, associated symptoms, etc. mentioned in the Related work section);

hierarchical subsumption within a WHO-ART-derived resource [12]: a general method for the automatic creation of this kind of resources is presented and no comparison is done with the SMQs;

hierarchical subsumption and terminological reasoning within a WHO-ART-derived resource [15]: a comparison with 24 SMQs is done, which shows an average sensitivity of 0.82, within the interval [0.45;1], while the specificity is not evaluated;

finally, a more recent study proposed to enrich a MedDRA terminology subset using a MedDRA-derived ontoEIM resource and to apply an important manual expertise [56] to reach 34,994 concepts and 157,572 definitional axioms. The resulting resource is adapted to the creation of 13 safety topics, such as Acute renal failure, Agranulocytosis, Gastrointestinal haemorrhages, Peripheral neuropathy or Rhabdomyolysis. Specific OWL queries have been applied and show the following average performance: P
                                 =51.1, R
                                 =63.4, F
                                 =54.

Only the last study cited above provides complete evaluation results, although these are provided for 13 safety topics to which this resource has been specifically adapted. With such extensive manual work, precision values remain comparable (51.1 against 52 obtained with our method), while recall is significantly improved thanks to the manual enrichment of the resource (63.4 against 25 obtained with our method). It is important to note that our method cannot be applied to this resource because its hierarchical structure is very poor: four MedDRA hierarchical levels (to reach the PT terms) against 14 hierarchical levels within the used version of ontoEIM. Other cited experiments cannot be compared with our study because of the different resources used or because of the lack of any evaluation. We beleive that the advantages of our method are the following: 
                           
                              (
                              1
                              )
                           
                         it does not require a dedicated semantic resource as the publicly available alignments within the UMLS can be used; 
                           
                              (
                              2
                              )
                           
                         its building is easy and rapid; 
                           
                              (
                              3
                              )
                           
                         the proposed approach is not specific to the pharmacovigilance context and can be used in other medical contexts and applications whenever the semantic relations between terms are required (information retrieval and extraction, terminology structuring, facet terminologies creation, etc.).

The proposed method applies the semantic distance and clustering algorithms for generating clusters of the ADR MedDRA terms. Several experiments have been performed for testing different factors which may influence the method performance. Among the tested semantic distance algorithms, the Rada approach is the most efficient. Semantic decomposition has a negative impact. The Radius clustering approach, which generates non disjoint clusters, is more suitable for the aimed task because terms may belong to several clusters. Evaluation against the term pairs manually rated by several experts indicates that our method provides results very close to human judgment. Evaluation related to the pharmacovigilance area shows that, although we do not generate exact content of the SMQs, the clusters seem to be suitable for the signal detection task. Additionally, manual evaluation by an expert indicates that the generated clusters contain relevant terms which may be missing in the SMQs.

The research topic addressed in our study is underexplored, which leaves room for several perspectives. For instance, current performance varies according to SMQs and it appears that different strategies should be used for different safety topics, while currently the same parameters of the method is applied to all safety topics. We also plan to prepare a set of filters for performing the post-processing of the generated clusters. The proposed methods can be applied to other terminologies: we have indeed started to test their portability [57]. Testing of other clustering algorithms is also ongoing, as well as better exploitation of the hierarchical classification. Moreover, the spectral clustering [58] may be used for optimization of matrices and creation of non-disjoint clusters. We also started to apply and combine these results with those provided by Natural Language Processing: the first experiments are encouraging and we plan to strengthen this perspective [59]. Finally, we hope to have an opportunity to test the proposed clusters with the experts involved in the creation of SMQs.
