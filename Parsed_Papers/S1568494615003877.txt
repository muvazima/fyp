                  This paper proposes an optimal design method for passive power filters (PPFs) in order to suppress critical harmonics and improve power factor. The characteristics of common passive filters, such as single-tuned, second-order, third-order, and C-type damped filters are introduced. In addition, several objective functions and constraints for PPF design problems are constructed. A new multi-objective optimization based on the modified bat algorithm and Pareto front is developed for solving PPF design problems. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method.
