                  The voting system of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco) is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, although without any representative within Legco, the Hong Kong government has certain degree of legislative power – as if there is a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government within the Legco. By introducing such a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government, we show that Legco is a three-dimensional voting system. We also calculate two power indices of the Hong Kong government through this virtual representative and consider the C-dimension and the W-dimension of Legco. Finally, some implications of this Legco model to the current constitutional reform in Hong Kong will be given.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The voting system used in the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco) is unique within the current, global range of electoral systems because it is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Because of this special feature, it would be interesting to study this voting system from the mathematical point of view. In this article, we shall construct a mathematical model of this voting system and conduct a detailed mathematical analysis of it. For example, we shall measure the complexity of the voting mechanism of Legco by computing its dimension.

It was proposed in Taylor (1995) that different voting systems can be classified by their dimensions. We shall state the precise definition of the dimension of a voting system in the next section but it is easier to grasp the idea by considering some examples. The usual unicameral system in which the bills will be passed by a simple majority vote of the members is a one dimensional voting system. Bicameral legislatures require a concurrent majority to pass legislation are two dimensional voting systems. In 1995, Alan D. Taylor mentioned in Taylor (1995) that he did not know any real-world voting system of dimension 3 or higher and this point was reiterated in page 255 of the second edition of Taylor (1995). Such a real-world voting system of dimension 3 was first provided by Josep Freixas in 2004. He showed in Freixas (2004) that the dimension of the European Union Council under the Nice rules (since 2000) is 3. In this article, we shall show that the voting system of Legco (since 1998) is also of dimension 3. So we have two very different real voting systems of dimension 3.

By 2014, Legco consists of two groups of legislators: one group comprising 35 members selected in the functional constituencies and the other group comprising the remaining 35 members elected by universal suffrage in the geographical constituencies. About half of the 35 functional constituencies seats go to business sectors, about one-third belongs to sectors for professionals and the rest are for representatives of social organizations or district councils. For a detailed analysis of the functional constituencies, see Loh and Civic Exchange (2006) and Ma (2009).

Since the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, in order to strengthen the executive dominance over the legislature, the Basic Law (the constitutional document for the HKSAR) requires the passage of motions, bill or amendments to government bills introduced by legislators to pass by the concurrent majorities of two groups. On the other hand, motions, amendments to motions, bills and amendments to bill raised by the Hong Kong government only need a simple majority vote of the members present to pass.

Therefore, Legco is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government. This unique feature of Legco makes the computation of the dimension of it a non-trivial task. For example, given a coalition of 35 members from the geographical constituencies and 2 members from the functional constituencies, there is no way to tell if it is a winning coalition or a losing coalition (unless you know if the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government). To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government, which will vote for a bill if it is proposed by the government but against a bill otherwise. To be more precise, the 35 members from geographical constituencies are numbered

                     , the 35 members from functional constituencies are numbered

With this mathematical model of Legco, the voting system of Legco becomes a simple game (see the definition in the next section) and it is now possible to compute the dimension of Legco which will turn out to be 3 (see Section 3).

Although there is no representative of the government of HKSAR in Legco, this voting system has given the Hong Kong government a certain degree of legislative power. With the introduction of member 71, the virtual representative of the government, we can then calculate various power indices of the Hong Kong government within Legco and compare its power with that of any individual Legco member. This will be done in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we shall discuss some implications of our mathematical analysis of Legco to the current constitutional reform in Hong Kong.

Every weighted majority game is obviously a (monotonic) simple game. However, the converse is in general not true and we shall see in the next section that the voting system of Legco is not a weighted majority game. To show that certain voting system cannot be realized as a weighted majority game, it would be useful to know that any weighted majority game must be swap robust, namely, for any two winning coalitions S and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      in a weighted voting system, if we make a one-for-one exchange of players, then at least one of the two resulting coalitions must still be a winning coalition (see Taylor (1995)). Here one of the players in the swap must belong to S but not 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     , and the other must belong to 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      but not S.

Even though not any simple game is a weighted majority game, it was proved in Taylor (1995) that every simple game can be realized as a weighted m-majority game. The smallest such possible m is called the dimension of the game.

The computation of the dimension of a simple game has been proved to be a hard computational problem (see Deineko & Woeginger (2006)), thus our calculation is a complex task which will be done by combinatorial arguments for the particular voting system at hand. The dimension of other complex voting systems using combinatorial arguments were studied quite recently in Freixas and Puente (2008).

However, even if two games are of the same dimension, they may not be equivalent. In the literature, different types of dimensions have been introduced (see Freixas & Marciniak (2009)). Before giving their definitions, we need to introduce two orderings related to the power of individual members in a game (see Carreras & Freixas (2008)).

                      is total.

Every simple game can be realized as an interaction of a finite number of complete games, the smallest possible number is called the C-dimension of the game. Likewise, every simple game can be realized as an interaction of a finite number of weakly complete games, the smallest possible number is called the W-dimension of the game. For a detailed analysis of various types of dimensions, we refer the readers to Freixas and Marciniak (2009).

Every weighted game is complete and every complete game is weakly complete (see Carreras & Freixas (2008)). Hence,
                        
                           1.
                           
                              W-dimension (v) 
                                 
                                    ⩽
                                 
                               
                              C-dimension (v) 
                                 
                                    ⩽
                                 
                               dimension (v) for all simple game v;

if the simple game v is weighted, then dimension (v) is 1 and hence both W-dimension (v) and C-dimension (v) are equal to 1;

if the simple game v is complete, then C-dimension (v) is equal to 1 and therefore W-dimension (v) is also equal to 1.

Recall that the Legco members are divided into two groups: half of the members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, and the other half by functional constituencies. On the writing of this article, there are 70 members in the current fifth term Legco (2012–2016). The composition of Legco beyond the third term is not specified in the Basic Law (the constitutional document for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region). However, article 68 of the Basic Law requires that
                        “The method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.”
                     
                  

While the Basic Law now no longer expressly dictates the formation of the fifth term Legco of HKSAR in the year 2012, in December 2007, the Standing Committee of National People’s Congress (SCNPC) decided that
                        “The ratio of functional constituency members to geographical constituency members shall not be changed and the procedures for voting on bills and motions in the Legislative Council shall remain unchanged.”
                     
                  

The details of the decisions of SCNPC in December 2007 can be found in http://www.legco.hk (the official website of Hong Kong Legislative Council).

In view of the above constraints on the pace of constitutional reform in Hong Kong, it makes sense to assume that Legco has 
                        
                           2
                           n
                        
                      legislative members, say represented by 
                        
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           2
                           n
                        
                     , with n an arbitrary positive integer. We further assume that among the 
                        
                           2
                           n
                        
                      Legco members, the first n members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, while the remaining n members are returned by functional constituencies.

We also assume that a bill will be passed if
                        
                           (a)
                           the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government and it is supported by a simple majority in Legco; or

the bill is proposed by a Legco member and it is supported by a simple majority in each of the two groups.

Finally, we again introduce a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government (denoted by 
                        
                           2

                     ), which will vote for a bill if it is proposed by the government but against a bill otherwise. Now we can reformulate Legco as a simple game of size

                           We will show that the winning coalitions of the game realized by A are exactly the winning coalitions of Legco. Hence A realizes Legco and the dimension of Legco is less than or equal to 3.

By Theorems 1 and 2.1 of Freixas (2004), both Lego and European Union Council under the Nice rules (since 2000) are of dimension 3. However, they are very different voting systems. For example, the voting system of the European Union Council has a huge number of voters and the system itself is sophistically described with a great number of different equi-desirability classes, while the Legco voting system has just three types of voters. On the other hand, the European voting system is a complete (or swap robust) simple game while the Legco voting system is not by Proposition 1. Moreover, it was pointed out by the referee of this paper that the voting system of the European Union Council has dimension 3 but C-dimension 1 (which implies that it also has W-dimension 1) and suggested to find out the C-dimension and the W-dimension of Legco.

Thus our system cannot be of C-dimension 2 and therefore has C-dimension 3.

In this section, we will try to quantify the power of the Hong Kong government within Legco. Indeed, we are more interested in the ratio of the power of the Hong Kong government to the power of an elected member of Legco. We will consider the two most common power indices, namely, the Shapley–Shubik Index (see Shapley & Shubik (1954)) and the Bahzhaf Index (see Banzhaf (1965)).

These two power indices are ordinally equivalent, and therefore rank players equally, for weakly complete games and also for larger classes of cooperative games like semi-coherent and coherent games (see Freixas (2010)). However, when these two power indices are compared, in the class of weakly complete games, with other well-known power indices, then the equivalent ranking provided by Shapley–Shubik and Banzhaf indices do not necessarily coincide with the rankings of some others well-known power indices such as the Johnston index (see Freixas, Marciniak, & Pons (2012)).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The pace of constitutional reform in Hong Kong is a central issue during the five-month public consultation exercise for the “Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016 Public Consultation”. The mathematical model of Legco introduced in Section 3 allows one to quantify the pace of constitutional reform of Legco from the point of view of its complexity. In fact, abolishing the difference between a bill proposed by the government and a Legco member, while keeping the functional constituencies and the split-voting mechanism will make Legco a bicameral system and its dimension will be reduced from three to two. If one further abolishes the split-voting mechanism, the dimension will then be reduced from two to one (even one keeps the functional constituencies). This shows that it is the role of the government and the presence of the split-voting mechanism that determine the dimension of Legco, not the existence of functional constituencies. In addition, we would also like to point out that if one only broadens the electorate base of the functional constituencies and implement the so-called “one person two votes” (i.e., each voter has one vote in the direct geographical election and has one vote in one of the functional constituencies), the dimension of Legco will still be three and therefore, there is no change in the complexity of the voting system of Legco.

Another possible approach to the constitutional reform in Hong Kong is to increase the number of the members of both the geographical constituencies and the functional constituencies (i.e., to increase n in Legco) while keeping the split-voting mechanism. In Section 4, by computing two common power indices, we find out that the relative power of the Hong Kong government to any member of Legco increases as odd n increases or even n increases. So according to our model, the Hong Kong government can actually gain more power (compared with any individual member) if the size of Legco is increased from 70 to
