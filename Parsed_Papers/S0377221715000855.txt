                  We consider a decentralized supply chain comprised of one manufacturer and one retailer where the manufacturer has random yield, and the retailer faces uncertain demand. To guarantee product availability, the retailer requires a service level of the product supply from the manufacturer. However, we determine that the high service level indeed benefits the retailer whereas causes the manufacturer’s profit loss. Therefore, to promote the high-service-level cooperation, the retailer has to provide incentives for the manufacturer, such as bonuses. We consider two common bonus contracts: unit bonus and flat (or lump-sum) bonus. The primary question we address is whether the service-level based bonus contracts can achieve the two firms’ Pareto-improving for both service level and profits, which is a prerequisite for the retailer to carry out them with the manufacturer. The results show that both bonus contracts can achieve Pareto-improving. While it is simpler for the retailer to carry out the unit bonus contract, the retailer can achieve a higher service level and higher profits under the flat bonus contract.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Given the increasingly intense global market competition, improving service level has become one of the “top two goals” for supply chain management (Chen and Shen, 2012; Gyorey, Jochim, and Norton, 2010). High customer service level plays an important role in enhancing competitiveness and continuous development for the entire supply chain. Fortunately, firms gradually identify this key point. According to the description of KPMG (2010), in the food, drink, and consumer goods (FDCG) industry, retailers often enter into a service-level agreement with their FDCG manufacturers. Additionally, in the automotive industry, many original equipment manufacturers cooperate with their first-tier suppliers under service-level contracts (Stratmann, 2006).

However, high degree supply chain risk, including supply and demand uncertainty, hinders the achievement of a high service level. A survey by McKinsey finds that 82 percent of the respondents in developed Asian countries claim that the supply chain risk will continue to increase in the next five years (Gyorey et al., 2010). Therefore, product availability, which is critical in keeping customers satisfied in the uncertain operations environment, is emphasized in service-level based contracts between supply chain parties. Based on these contracts, the upstream suppliers must achieve an ample supply with a certain probability (Chen and Shen, 2012; KPMG, 2010; Stratmann, 2006).

Although the high service level benefits the entire supply chain with respect to customer satisfaction, it may cause ineffective operations for the upstream parties. This problem is highly serious when the product has a short life cycle and random yield. Therefore, the service-level contracts between the supply chain parties should emphasize not only achieving a high service level but also providing the incentives (such as bonuses) for the contractors to improve performances (Tarakci, Tang, Moskowitz, and Plante, 2006). This observation stems from the business practice of the leisure food chain store companies in China, such as LPPZ Foods. LPPZ Foods is an emerging and rapidly developing chain store company that purchases products from a large number of food manufacturers, including some seasonal perishable products with short life cycles such as green bean cake, zongzi, and mooncake. To guarantee product availability, LPPZ Foods measures the service level of the manufacturers and provides bonuses for the manufacturers with relatively high service levels.

                        1
                        We observe this phenomenon through the field survey and interview in a cooperation project with LPPZ Foods. Visit the website to learn more about LPPZ: http://www.517lppz.com
/.
                      However, the lack of quantitative decision analysis hinders retailers such as LPPZ Foods from taking full advantage of service-level based bonus contracts to improve the performance of the entire supply chain.

The above discussion gives rise to three new quantitative research questions. Specifically, we elaborate them as follows. First, facing the supply and demand uncertainty, how does the retailer use the two common bonus regimes (i.e., unit bonus and flat or lump-sum bonus) to motivate the manufacturer to improve the service level? Second, can service-level based bonus contracts achieve the two parties’ Pareto-improving? Third, what are the differences between the flat bonus contract and the unit bonus contract?

To address the above issues, we construct a decentralized supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and a retailer. The retailer faces a single-period uncertain demand for a short life-cycle product and places an order with the manufacturer. The manufacturer is responsible for the production of the product, wherein the production process contains the random yield problem. To guarantee product availability, the retailer cooperates with the manufacturer under a service-level based bonus contract. The retailer requires the manufacturer’s product supply to reach a service level, defined as the probability of meeting the order quantity. Once the order is met, the manufacturer can receive a bonus payment from the retailer. There exist two bonus contracts for the retailer to use: a unit bonus contract and a flat bonus contract. A unit bonus contract means the manufacturer receives a unit bonus for every leftover product exceeding the retailer’s order quantity, whereas with a flat bonus contract, the manufacturer acquires a fixed bonus when the order quantity is met.

                        2
                        In the random yield supply chain, the definition of the unit bonus contract between the manufacturer and the retailer is similar to the over-production risk sharing contract, which is investigated by Inderfurth Clemens (2014) and He Zhang (2008). It is also similar to the additional marginal payment, which is considered by Sohoni, Chopra, Mohan, and Sendil (2011).
                     
                  

By analyzing the equilibrium strategies of the two parties, we find some interesting results that contribute to the extant literature in the following ways. First, our model involves both the supply and demand uncertainties, which are major issues of concern in recent literature. However, our investigation is from a new perspective that highlights the impacts of service level on the two firms’ performances. It is useful for the entire supply chain to maintain a high competitive advantage under these two common risks. Second, we analyze the influence of a bonus on the two firms’ cooperation with a service-level requirement. The results show that the bonus plays the role of an incentive for the random yield manufacturer to improve the level of service. More importantly, under certain business conditions, bonus contracts can help the two firms achieve Pareto-improving for service level and profits. Third, our paper compares two potential bonus contracts, the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract, thus providing managerial insights for the retailer to choose an appropriate contract under different operation situations.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature. In Section 3, we describe the problem’s formulation and notations. The basic model without a bonus is analyzed in Section 4. Section 5 and Section 6 discuss the unit bonus contract and flat bonus contract with a service-level requirement, respectively. Section 7 illustrates comparisons between the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract. We present this paper’s conclusions in Section 8. All mathematical proofs are provided in the online Appendix.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our paper is closely related to the stream of literature on random yield effect in two-level decentralized supply chains with short life-cycle products. There exist two possible categories in this research. One category focuses on the ex ante contract design, order and production decisions of the supply chain to mitigate the random yield risk. For example, Keren (2009) and Li, Li, Cai (2012) consider the order and production decisions in a random yield supply chain with known demand. The difference is that Li et al. (2012) study a more generalized distribution of yield randomness. Wang (2009) compares the role of traditional and vendor-managed-inventory arrangements between a manufacturer and a distributor in mitigating the random yield risk. Li, Li, Cai (2013) explore the double marginalization effects in a random yield decentralized supply chain and design coordination contracts to improve the supply chain performance. Arifoğlu, Deo, and Iravani (2012) study an influenza vaccine supply chain that faces yield uncertainty and self-interested consumers. They find that more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms can improve supply chain efficiency. Tang Kouvelis (2014) design a pay-back-revenue-sharing contract to coordinate a supply chain with random yield.

The other category studies the replenishment policy to respond to the realized random yield risk. He Zhang (2008) and Xu (2010) explore how emergency production for the random yield supply chain replenishes the shortage of products. He Zhang (2010), Kazaz Webster (2011) and Ma, Yin, Guan (2013) consider the replenishment from the open market (e.g., spot market and secondary market) for the supply chain parties to mitigate the yield risk. In addition, Inderfurth Clemens (2014) and Cho and Tang (2013) simultaneously consider the situation with and without replenishment when the random yields are realized. While Inderfurth Clemens (2014) focus on the deterministic demand problem with the risk sharing contracts, Cho and Tang (2013) study the advance selling strategy under uncertain demand.

Our research falls within the first category. Different from the aforementioned papers, we consider the service-level requirement between a manufacturer and a retailer, which consists of an agreement for the supply chain to improve product availability and to keep customers satisfied. However, the manufacturer may have to sacrifice the optimal decision under the constraint of the service level, which makes achieving a high level of service extremely difficult. Therefore, the second difference is that we focus on the possibility of whether the retailer can use the bonus contracts to motivate the manufacturer to improve the level of service and to achieve Pareto-improving of the two firms’ profits.

Our work is also related to the stream of literature on service-level requirements in supply chain management. There exists extensive literature on the service-level agreement in a two-echelon inventory system under periodic review (Bollapragada, Rao, and Zhang, 2004; Katok, Thomas, and Davis, 2008; Lejeune, 2013; Liang Atkins, 2013; Sieke, Seifert, and Thonemann, 2012). For the single-period problem which is more strongly related to our research, Sethi, Yan, Zhang, and Zhou (2007) consider a supply chain wherein the buyer has two procurement opportunities under a service-level constraint and information update. They show that the buyer’s critical market signal, optimal first-stage order quantity, and the optimal expected profit all have a monotone relationship with the service-level target. Without any information update, Chen and Shen (2012) analyze the influence of an option contract on a two-party supply chain with a service requirement and show that the option contract benefits both the retailer and the supplier. Li, Huang, Cheng, Zheng, and Ji (2014) consider a decentralized supply chain wherein the retailer commits a service level for the after-sales service to consumers and study the impacts of the make-or-buy service capacity decision. All the three studies consider a reliable supply process; therefore, the service-level requirement comes from the customers. However, as we consider a random yield manufacturer, the service-level requirement is established between the retailer and the manufacturer. Thus, we focus on whether the two parties can achieve Pareto-improving for both service level and profits under the impacts of supply uncertainty. Only Wang, Xiao, Yang (2014) consider an unreliable supply process and the downstream manufacturers’ incentives to improve the upstream supplier’s service level, which is more related to our study. However, the difference is that they focus on two manufacturer’s horizontal competition, while we study the cooperation between the upstream party and the downstream party in the supply chain. Using the case without a service-level requirement as a benchmark, we study whether the two parties can achieve Pareto-improving under a service-level requirement. This problem is critical for the two parties to reach an agreement regarding the service level but is not considered in their research.

Finally, our article contributes to the research on bonus contracts in supply chain management. Katok et al. (2008), Ebrahim-Khanjari, Hopp, Iravani (2012) and Liang Atkins (2013) study the impact of bonus contracts on a supply chain based on multi-period models. There is also some research that focuses on single-period problems. For instance, Tarakci et al. (2006) investigate how a manufacturer uses a unit bonus based incentive contract with a contractor to improve process performance. Sohoni et al. (2011) compare the impact of an additional marginal payment and a lump-sum bonus payment on the observed sales variability. Dong, Xu, Evers (2012) study transshipment incentive contracts in a multi-level supply chain that involves a fixed bonus. Chu, Lai (2013) consider a sales-quota-based bonus contract in a salesforce contracting supply chain under demand censorship. However, these papers do not consider supply risk. One critical difference between our work and theirs is that we treat bonus contracts as strategies to motivate the random yield manufacturer to improve the service level of product availability because under a higher service level of product supply, the retailer can better serve the market.

We consider a one-period decentralized supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and a retailer. The retailer serves an uncertain market demand D for a single product at a unit price r, with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) G( · ) and probability distribution function (PDF) g( · ). The product is produced by the manufacturer under a unit cost c and the retailer is charged a wholesale price w for a unit available product. The retailer may not acquire all the ordered q units of product because of the random yield phenomenon in the manufacturer’s factory. Accordingly, when the planned production quantity is Q, the actual available quantity is ΦQ, where Φ is a random variable within the range [0, 1] with CDF F( · ), PDF f( · ) and the expected value μ. At the end of the selling season, leftover products are salvaged at a unit salvage price s
                     1 for the manufacturer and are salvaged at a unit salvage price s
                     2 for the retailer.

To guarantee product availability, the retailer cooperates with the manufacturer under a service-level based bonus contract. The retailer places an order for q units of products with the manufacturer, and the manufacturer decides the production quantity Q. According to the contract, the manufacturer’s production quantity Q is required to achieve a service level α, which means the manufacturer must choose a sufficient production quantity such that the probability of meeting the retailer’s order is not less than α, i.e., Pr(ΦQ ≥ q) ≥ α (see Chen and Shen, 2012; Sethi et al., 2007, for a similar definition of the service-level requirement). When the retailer’s order quantity q is met, the manufacturer can receive a bonus payment.

Thus, the manufacturer’s profit consists of a normal profit and a bonus under a bonus contract. The retailer can adopt two bonus regimes: a unit bonus contract (see Liang Atkins, 2013; Ebrahim-Khanjari et al., 2012; Sohoni et al., 2011; Tarakci et al., 2006) and a flat bonus contract (see Chu et al., 2013; Liang Atkins, 2013; Dong et al., 2012; Sohoni et al., 2011; Katok et al., 2008) . According to the unit bonus contract, the manufacturer is paid a unit price b for each leftover unit that exceeds the order quantity q, while under the flat bonus contract, the manufacturer acquires a constant revenue B if the retailer’s order q is met.

                     2 to assure the profitability of each party from trading but not from salvaging. With respect to the unit bonus contract, we assume 
                        
                           b
                           <

                                 μ

                              μ
                           
                        
                      to prevent the manufacturer from receiving unlimited bonuses due to over-production. Similarly, for the flat bonus contract, we assume that the flat bonus B is not large enough to result in a negative normal profit ΠN
                      for the manufacturer. We will show in Lemma 3 that there exists a threshold B
                     0 such that the assumption holds when B < B
                     0. In fact, a huge production quantity Q results in a great probability for the manufacturer to acquire the flat bonus B. Thus, it is unnecessary for the retailer to set such a great B that leads to the manufacturer’s over-production.

We first provide the analytical results of the model without a service-level requirement, which is the lower bound for the Pareto-improving study. The objective of the two firms is to maximize their own profit through the decentralized decisions of the production and order quantity. Given the order quantity q, the manufacturer can only get the normal profit that can be expressed as

                     Wang (2009) studies a quite similar model that can be straightforward converted to this basic model. Thus, the concavity of Eqs. (1) and (2) and the two firms’ optimal decisions can be straightforward obtained by using the same method as in Wang (2009). He Zhang (2008) and He Zhang (2010) study a similar model with replenishment, which covers the basic results. The manufacturer’s optimal decision is to inflate the retailer’s order quantity q by a factor

                     Based on the benchmark model, in the following sections, we analyze the decentralized two-partner supply chain wherein the two members cooperate under a service-level requirement. We also explore how the service-level requirement affects the two firms’ performances.

The results can help us to understand the influence of the service-level requirement on the two firms’ performances. Given the retailer’s order quantity q and the service-level requirement α , the manufacturer’s decision problem is

                     From Proposition 1, we can find that the manufacturer’s decision relies on the service level α; therefore, the retailer’s decision should be analyzed according to the value of α. Thus, we present the following proposition.

The additional restrictions on f( · ) in Lemma 1 are also used by Konishi (2005) and de Frutos Fabra (2011). They imply that xf(x) is non-decreasing and f( · ) does not decrease too fast (Konishi, 2005). Accordingly, in our setting, the restriction that f( · ) does not decrease too fast suggests that the probability that the manufacturer achieves a high yield is not too small. In reality, the retailer may not desire to cooperate with a manufacturer that can achieve a high yield with an extremely low probability. It can be easily examined that the uniform distribution which is commonly used to simulate random yield satisfies these restrictions (Cho and Tang, 2013; He Zhang, 2010; Xu Lu, 2013). According to de Frutos Fabra (2011), all convex distribution functions satisfy these restrictions, and some concave distribution functions also satisfy these restrictions, such as the power

                        Remark 1
                        The additional restrictions on f( · ) in Lemma 1 guarantee that the relationship between 
                              
                                 q

                            and α can be analytically proved. Actually, even for the probability density f( · ) that does not satisfy these restrictions, the result in Lemma 1 still holds. We present a numerical example in Fig. 1
                           .


                     Fig. 1 (a) shows that when f( · ) follows the normal distribution N(0.5, 0.2),

                              )
                           
                        
                      is not greater than 
                        
                           −
                           1
                        
                      for any 
                        
                           x
                           ∈
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           1

                     . However, from Fig. 1(b), we can find that the retailer’s optimal order quantity is still non-increasing in the service-level requirement α.

The results in Lemma 1 and Remark 1 are intuitive. Without random yield, the retailer’s problem is a basic newsvendor setting, wherein the unique optimal order quantity is

                      and the deviation of this quantity causes the decrease of the profit. Therefore, under the influence of random yield, by using the same method as in Wang (2009), it can be easily proved that the retailer places an order quantity that is greater than

This is because the service-level requirement can be automatically achieved in this situation, and both firms adopt the same decisions as in the situation without a service-level requirement according to Propositions 1 and 2.

                     . In this situation, the retailer achieves more profit whereas the profit of the manufacturer decreases to reach the service-level requirement.

Thus, we can find that the high service level cannot simultaneously benefit the two firms. It is difficult for the two firms to reach a higher service-level negotiation in the current cooperation mode. As the retailer has more incentive to improve the service level, it is feasible for the retailer to motivate the manufacturer to increase the service level through a bonus contract. Therefore, in the following sections, we study the two firms’ decisions under two different bonus contracts. More importantly, we explore whether the two firms’ profits can simultaneously increase under a higher service-level requirement.

In this section, we analyze the case that the retailer provides a unit bonus contract for the manufacturer to reach a service-level requirement. We first study the equilibrium decisions of the two firms, and then explore the impact of the unit bonus contract.

Under the unit bonus contract, the manufacturer receives a bonus b for per unit of product that exceeds the retailer’s order quantity. Therefore, the manufacturer can receive an expected bonus

                              is non-increasing in the service-level requirement α.
                           

The additional restrictions on f( · ) in Lemma 2 guarantee that the relationship between 
                                 
                                    q

                               and α can be analytically proved. Actually, even for the probability density that does not satisfy these restrictions, the result in Lemma 2 still holds. We present a numerical example in Fig. 3
                              .

Under the unit bonus contract, it is still not necessary for the retailer to increase the order quantity under a higher service level α. Fig. 3 illustrates a similar numerical example mentioned in Remark 1, which reflects that the retailer’s optimal order quantity 
                           
                              q

                              *
                           
                         is still non-increasing in the service-level requirement α when the random yield’s PDF does not satisfy the additional restrictions in Lemma 2. Based on Lemma 2, we now analyze the impacts of α on the two firms’ profits. Propositions 4 and 5 lead to the two firms’ optimal expected profits with different service-level requirements.

We now investigate how the unit bonus contract affects the two firms’ decisions and performances. In particular, it is still important to study the impacts of the service-level requirement on the two firms’ performances under the unit bonus contract. We are interested in examining whether there exist different conclusions from the basic model without a bonus in Section 4. We define a unit threshold bonus b

With the increasing of b, the retailer chooses less quantity to reduce the expected bonus payment.

                         the retailer cannot benefit more with a further increasing of the service level. Thus, unlike the basic model without a bonus in Section 4, the retailer cannot achieve continuous profit increasing with the increasing of the service level under the unit bonus contract. This phenomenon is a result of the negative incentive of the unit bonus. The higher service level implies that the manufacturer must expand the production quantity and the retailer must pay a higher expected bonus. When the bonus payment is large enough, the retailer’s profit decreases. Therefore, there exists an optimal service level

                         are the highest service levels that the two firms can achieve in situations without and with the unit bonus contract, respectively. The manufacturer must lose some profit to achieve a higher service level. Compared with the case without a bonus,

                         in Proposition 6(i) implies that the unit bonus motivates the two firms to cooperate under a higher service level and simultaneously achieve the manufacturer’s maximum profit. The higher product supply level undoubtedly helps the supply chain improve the market satisfaction rate, which is quite important in the current increasingly intense market competition. Using the situation without a service-level requirement as a benchmark, it is more important to explore whether the two firms’ profits can achieve Pareto-improving under the higher service level. The following proposition characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the two firm’s Pareto-improving for service level and profits.

                         can lead to the two firm’s Pareto-improving, but it is not the unique condition. Even if the profit cannot be improved in such situation, the Pareto-improving can also be achieved if the retailer’s maximum profit, that is acquired when

                         and under the assumption that both the random yield rate Φ and the market demand D follow uniform distributions where Φ ∼ U[0, 1] and D ∼ U[0, 12]. From the numerical example, we note that a higher wholesale price or a higher unit bonus can achieve Pareto-improving under a higher service level, which suggests that the high wholesale price and the high bonus can strengthen the incentive role of the unit bonus contract. However, when the wholesale price and the unit bonus are sufficiently high, as shown in Fig. 5(d), the Pareto-improving cannot be achieved due to the significant decrease in the retailer’s profit.

In this section, we study the case of the flat bonus contract. We first analyze the equilibrium strategies of the two firms, and then explore the impact of the flat bonus contract.

Different from the unit bonus contract, the manufacturer acquires a fixed bonus B if the final available quantity of the product can satisfy the retailer’s order quantity q. This means that in addition to the normal profit ΠN
                        (Q|q), as defined in Definition 1, the manufacturer can receive an expected bonus

The concavity of the manufacturer’s profit function cannot be guaranteed except under the assumption that the random yield rate’s distribution has an increasing generalized failure rate (IGFR). This means that the generalized failure rate

Because it is not necessary for the retailer to choose a high B to motivate the manufacturer to choose a hugely high production quantity, which causes the non-positive normal profit, based on Lemma 3, we limit our research to the situation where 0 < B < B
                        0 in the following research. Lemma 3 then shows that it is not optimal for the manufacturer to choose a production quantity that is less than

                         Different from the unit bonus contract, the inflation factor is also affected by the order quantity q as well as the flat bonus B. With the increasing of q, the manufacturer reduces the inflation factor to avoid overstocking. However, with the increasing of B, the manufacturer chooses a greater inflation factor

Based on the manufacturer’s reflection, the retailer has two decision choices: a high order quantity (
                           
                              q
                              ≥
                              
                                 q
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        ) and a low order quantity (
                           
                              0
                              ≤
                              q
                              ≤
                              
                                 q
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        ). The threshold 
                           
                              q
                              ¯
                           
                         divides the retailer’s high and low order decisions, whose value is affected by the service-level requirement α and the flat bonus B. It is easily examined that 
                           
                              q
                              ¯
                           
                         is decreasing in α while increasing in B. Therefore, from Eq. (29), we know that under a low service level and a large bonus, the retailer is more willing to choose a low order quantity. However, when the service level is high and the bonus is small, the retailer must consider whether the higher order quantity plays a better role in avoiding the product shortage risk.

Given the service-level requirement α, if the retailer chooses a high order decision, the manufacturer must inflate the order quantity by a factor 
                           
                              1
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                    
                                       −
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    1
                                    −
                                    α
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         to reach the service level. In this case, according to Proposition 9(ii), the concavity of the retailer’s expected profit function guarantees that we can easily determine the unique optimal solution. However, if the retailer chooses a low order decision, the manufacturer can easily achieve the service level by adopting an inflating factor 
                           
                              1
                              
                                 δ
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                                 *
                              
                           
                        . Because the expected profit function’s concavity cannot be guaranteed, according to Proposition 9(i), the optimal order quantity must be selected from among the extreme points within the finite interval 
                           
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              
                                 q
                                 ¯
                              
                              ]
                           
                         and the boundary point 
                           
                              q
                              ¯
                           
                        .

Therefore, comparing to the unit bonus contract, it requires higher computational effort for the retailer to search the optimal decisions under the flat bonus contract. From the difference between the manufacturer’s decisions under the two bonus contracts, we can find the reason that causes the complexity of the retailer’s order problem. Under different bonus contracts, the manufacturer chooses different inflation factors to inflate the retailer’s order quantity.

                         is dependent on the retailer’s order quantity, which causes that the retailer’s profit function is not unimodal. Thus, we cannot get the closed form of the optimal order quantity and further cannot analytically express the Pareto-improving region for the two firms. Liang Atkins (2013) state that the flat bonus makes the cost function not unimodal and thus cannot derive the optimal solution, which is a similar difficulty to ours. Therefore, following Katok et al. (2008) and Liang Atkins (2013), we limit our analysis on the flat bonus contract in the following to numerical studies.

We conduct a numerical experiment to demonstrate the influence of a service-level based flat bonus on the two firms’ performances. By simultaneously taking the two firms’ profits without a service-level requirement as benchmarks, we explore whether a Pareto-improving region exists. We study the impacts of the varying of the service-level requirement on the two firms’ profits under different wholesale prices and different flat bonuses. The parameters are set as

                         and both the random yield rate Φ and the market demand D follow uniform distributions where Φ ∼ U[0, 1] and D ∼ U[0, 12]. The results are presented in Fig. 6
                        .

From Fig. 6, we find that under the flat bonus contract, the manufacturer’s profit is non-increasing in the service-level requirement, while the retailer’s profit is non-decreasing in the service-level requirement. This observation suggests that the flat bonus contract retains the property of Proposition 3 in the basic model without a bonus. This result is different from the unit bonus contract. From Proposition 6(ii), we can find that, under the unit bonus contract, only the manufacturer’s profit retains the non-increasing property, while for the retailer, the expected profit function is strictly decreasing in the service level when the service level is sufficiently high. The property that the retailer can achieve continuous profit increasing under the flat bonus contract results from the different incentive mechanism of this contract. Specifically, according to the flat bonus contract, the retailer only pays a fixed bonus and need not provide added bonus when the manufacturer hugely expands the production quantity. The only benefit from the production expansion for the manufacturer is the greater probability of obtaining the bonus B, whereas the production expansion is beneficial for the retailer to achieve more profits due to the more stable product supply.

Additionally, we find that the two firms can also achieve Pareto-improving for service level and profits under the flat bonus contract, as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c). With a higher wholesale price or a higher flat bonus, Fig. 6(b) and (c) shows that the two firms can achieve profits’ Pareto-improving under a higher service level. However, similar to the unit bonus contract, the two firms cannot achieve Pareto-improving when the wholesale price and the flat bonus is sufficiently high, as shown in Fig. 6(d).

In this section, we compare the results associated with the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract. We first compare the manufacturer’s inflation decisions under the two bonus contracts. Then, we study which bonus contract can achieve a higher service level and more profits for the retailer.

Recall that under the impact of random yield, the manufacturer’s optimal production decision is to inflate the retailer’s order quantity by an inflation factor. Propositions 6 and 8 show that the use of a bonus contract has the incentive role for the manufacturer to expand the inflation factor, compared with the basic model without a bonus. Here, we compare the incentive roles of the unit and the flat bonus contracts.

                         presents a numerical example of Proposition 10. From Proposition 10, we can find that for a flat bonus B and an order quantity q, the flat bonus contract motivates the manufacturer to inflate the order quantity by a greater inflation factor

                         when the unit bonus b is less than a threshold. In contrast, when the unit bonus b is sufficiently large, the unit bonus contract would drive the manufacturer to expand the inflation factor more. Thus, the value of the unit bonus b reflects the incentive role of the unit bonus contract. Next, we study how the retailer should choose between the two contracts when the retailer can endogenously decide the optimal bonus values.

The study on the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract shows that both the two contracts can yield Pareto-improving regions wherein the manufacturer’s profit, the retailer’s profit and the service level can be simultaneously improved. The existence of Pareto-improving can promote the two firms’ cooperation better. Here, we conduct a numerical experiment to compare the two bonus contracts when the retailer’s objective is to maximize the service level.

In the analysis so far, the bonus values b and B were exogenously given. However, it is almost impossible to guarantee the fairness if we compare the two bonus contracts under two arbitrary bonus values. For a fair comparison, we consider that the retailer adopts the optimal bonus values under both the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract. In this situation, the retailer can utilize the Pareto-improving regions to set optimal bonus values to maximize the service level. Based on the above analytical results for given bonus values, we can use numerical approaches to search optimal bonus values to maximize the service level in two finite intervals (i.e., 
                           
                              b
                              ∈
                              (
                              0
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                    −
                                    μ
                                    
                                       s
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 μ
                              
                              )
                           
                         and B ∈ (0, B
                        0)). Our numerical results show that to achieve maximum service levels under the two bonus contracts, the optimal bonus values should be set to make the two firms’ profits just equal to the basic model without a bonus. Fig. 8
                         presents the experiment results on service-level comparisons.


                        Fig. 8 compares the highest service level that the retailer can achieve under the flat bonus contract, under the unit bonus contract, and in the basic model. It also explores the impacts of the wholesale price, the volatility of random yield, and the volatility of demand. Compared with the basic model, the results show that both the unit and the flat bonus contract can significantly improve the service level. When we focus on the comparison between the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract, we find that the flat bonus contract outperforms the unit bonus contract in all situations. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that under the unit bonus contract, the retailer cannot achieve continuous profit increasing with the increasing service-level requirement. In addition, we can find that the role of the flat bonus contract is more significant than the unit bonus contract when the wholesale price is high, when the random yield is more stable, or when the market demand is more variable.

Though the flat bonus contract can achieve the highest service level, it consumes larger computational effort to find the optimal solutions. In fact, Fig. 8 demonstrates that the curves’ gap between the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract is quite small. Specifically, in Fig. 8(a)–(c), the highest service level is only improved by 4.20 percent, 3.53 percent, and 2.30 percent in average when using the flat bonus contract instead of using the unit bonus contract, respectively. Therefore, from the perspective of practice, it is not always necessary for the retailer to consume large computational effort to use the flat bonus contract. Maybe the unit bonus contract is more practical. Only when the wholesale price is large, the volatility of random yield is small, or the volatility of market demand is large, the additional benefit from using the flat bonus contract is more significant.

We next examine the two bonus contract’s performances on improving the retailer’s profit. We carry out a fair comparison by considering that the retailer adopts the optimal bonus values under both the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract. In this situation, the retailer can use the Pareto-improving regions to maximize the profit by choosing optimal bonus values. Based on the above analytical results for given bonus values, we use a numerical approach to search optimal bonus values in two finite intervals (i.e., 
                           
                              b
                              ∈
                              (
                              0
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                    −
                                    μ
                                    
                                       s
                                       1
                                    
                                 
                                 μ
                              
                              )
                           
                         and B ∈ (0, B
                        0)). The numerical results show that to achieve maximum profits for the retailer under the two bonus contracts, the optimal bonus values should be set to make the manufacturer’s profit equal to the case without a bonus. Simultaneously, the service level also improves under the optimal bonus values. We illustrate the numerical comparison results on service levels and the retailer’s profits in Fig. 9
                        .

Under the varying of wholesale price, the varying of the volatility of random yield, and the varying of the volatility of demand, Fig. 9 compares the retailer’s highest profit and the service level under the flat bonus contract, the unit bonus contract, and the basic model. We find that when the retailer’s objective is to maximize the profit, the use of the two bonus contracts not only significantly achieve higher profits, but also significantly improve the service level. Comparing the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract, we find that the flat bonus contract outperforms for both profit and service level. This phenomenon is caused by the negative incentive role of the unit bonus contract. When the manufacturer expands the production quantity to achieve a higher service level, the retailer must pay added bonus according to the unit bonus contract. A sufficiently high added payment would cause the profit’s decline; therefore, the unit bonus contract hinders the two firm’s cooperation under a higher service level and hinders the retailer’s continuous profit increasing. However, under the flat bonus contract, the retailer need not provide added bonus when the manufacturer expands the production quantity. Thus, the only benefit from the production expansion for the manufacturer is the greater probability of obtaining the bonus B, and simultaneously, the retailer can achieve continuous profit increasing due to the more stable product supply.


                        Fig. 9 also shows that similar to the experiment on the highest service level above, the curves’ gap between the unit bonus contract and the flat bonus contract is quite small. In Fig. 9(a), (c), and (e), the service level is only improved by 2.83 percent, 3.36 percent, and 2.28 percent in average when using the flat bonus contract instead of using the unit bonus contract, respectively. In addition, in Fig. 9(b), (d), and (f), the retailer’s highest profit can only increase by 0.40 percent, 0.37 percent, and 0.37 percent in average when using the flat bonus contract instead of using the unit bonus contract, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We consider a decentralized supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer is responsible for the production of a short life-cycle product, whereas there exists a random yield in the production process. The retailer faces an uncertain demand for the product and places a procurement order with the manufacturer. To improve the service level of the product supply, the retailer cooperates with the manufacturer under a service-level based bonus contract. This means that the retailer requires the manufacturer’s supply to reach a service level, and the manufacturer can receive a bonus payment when the product supply meets the retailer’s order quantity. We compare the incentive role of two common bonus contracts: unit bonus and flat bonus. The results show that both bonus contracts can achieve the Pareto-improving on the two firms’ service level and profits. However, there are differences in the computational complexity and the ability in mitigating the adverse influence caused by the changing business conditions, e.g., wholesale price, supply risk and demand uncertainty. The unit bonus contract is implemented more simply. However, the flat bonus contract can help the retailer achieve higher service level and higher profit, and the advantage of the flat bonus contract is more significant when the wholesale price is large, the yield is more stable, or the market demand is more variable.

There are three directions of extensions that can be studied based on our research. First, we only consider the bonus incentives to improve the service level. Other ways, however, can also be explored, such as penalty (Liang Atkins, 2013; Sieke et al., 2012) and supplier diversification (Hu, Gurnani, Wang, 2013). It would be interesting to compare the role of these different incentive measures. Furthermore, we assume that the random yield manufacturer’s supply information (e.g., production cost and yield distribution) is common knowledge to the retailer. A possible extension could be conducted regarding the case of private information for the manufacturer, such as the asymmetric cost information research by Dong et al. (2012). In this case, the retailer could offer a menu of incentive contracts for the manufacturer. Finally, the random yield in our paper is defined as stochastically proportional to the manufacturer’s initial production quantity. However, there are several other types of yield variability, such as all-or-nothing, guaranteed-minimum-yield, binomial and additive form, etc. (Inderfurth and Vogelgesang, 2013; Li et al., 2013; Tang, Gurnani, and Gupta, 2014) . Therefore, it is interesting to study whether our main results still hold under different ways of modeling yield variability.
