                  Pesticides are widely used by crop producers in developed countries to combat risk associated with pests and diseases. However, their indiscriminate use can lead to various environmental spillovers that may alter the agricultural production environment thus contributing to production risk. This study utilises a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to measure performance of arable farms, incorporating pesticides’ environmental spillovers and output variance as undesirable outputs in the efficiency analysis and taking explicitly into account the effect of pesticides and other inputs on production risk. The application focuses on panel data from Dutch arable farms over the period 2003–2007. A moment approach is used to compute output variance, providing empirical representations of the risk-increasing or -decreasing nature of the used inputs. Finally, shadow values of risk-adjusted inputs are computed. We find that pesticides are overused in Dutch arable farming and there is a considerable evidence of the need for decreasing pesticides’ environmental spillovers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Risk constitutes an integral part of the agricultural production environment, playing an important role in farm-level production decision-making. Production risk arises from unpredictable weather events or sudden increase in destructiveness or population numbers of a pest species in a given area, affecting both the quantity and quality of production and the efficiency in using inputs. Several risk management tools are available to producers in developed countries to manage risk, notably market or financial insurance, future price contracts, pesticides, fertilizers, crop rotation, anti-hail protection equipment, and genetically modified crops.

Pesticides feature prominently in farmers’ arsenal to reduce risk related to pests and diseases. As pest arrival is an uncertain event and pesticide productivity varies across time and space, there is an uncertainty at the time of application. This uncertainty can lead to overuse of pesticides relative to the private or social optimum. In an effort to avoid crop losses, risk averse farmers apply pesticides at an early stage when the pest population may not be at its peak. This action can lead to higher costs as additional pesticide doses are applied. On the other hand, waiting and monitoring the pest population and applying pesticide when full information is available may increase the crop loss during the monitoring stages. Norgaard (1976) states that the major motivation for pesticide application is the provision of “insurance” against damage. While uncertainty in the pest-pesticide system leads to a higher and more frequent use of pesticides, applying pesticides before the pest population is at its peak does not necessarily imply that farmers are risk averse. Doing so may be a profit-maximising strategy.


                     Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1994) support the conventional view that when there is uncertainty due to pest damage, pesticides are likely to be risk-reducing inputs. However, the literature reports mixed findings on the role of risk aversion with some studies finding that pesticides are risk-reducing (Griffiths & Anderson, 1982; Saha, Shumway, & Talpaz, 1994; Smith & Goodwin, 1996) and others finding them to be risk-increasing inputs (Gotsch & Regev, 1996; Horowitz & Lichtenberg, 1993; Pannell, 1995; Saha, Shumway, & Havenner, 1997). When both pest populations are high and growth conditions are favourable, pesticides will be risk-increasing as they increase the variability of harvests. Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993) have shown that pesticides may be risk-increasing inputs even if the public sector offers crop insurance that acts as a substitute for additional pesticide applications.

Pesticide effectiveness can be influenced by fluctuations in weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Changes in weather conditions can impact both pest populations and the effectiveness of pesticides as each chemical product has different durability. The relationship between pesticide use and production risk may also be shaped by pesticides’ environmental spillovers. Farmland biodiversity can benefit farm productivity (Di Falco & Chavas, 2006; Omer, Pascual, & Russell, 2007; Tilman, Polasky, & Lehman, 2005), reduce environmental risk and yield variability, improve pest control by impeding the evolution of pest populations and consequently reducing pest damages (Heisey, Smale, Byerlee, & Souza, 1997; Priestley & Bayles, 1980). Therefore, indirect effects of pesticides on biodiversity may increase production risk through a decrease in beneficial natural predators (Pimentel et al., 1992). Sustainable agricultural systems focus on the optimal use of environmental resources and services, such as farmland biodiversity services, without damaging these assets (Tilman, Cassman, Matson, Naylor, & Polasky, 2002). In an era of increasing awareness of the indirect effects of pesticides on the environment, the future European Union (EU) policy schemes aim at the sustainable use of pesticides in agriculture (COM, 2006). Sustainable use of pesticides could decrease pesticides’ adverse impacts on the environment and mitigate production risk by protecting farmland biodiversity that is related to a wide variety of ecosystem services (e.g., control of pests by their natural enemies).

Modelling firms’ production risk is well developed (Antle, 1987; Just & Pope, 1978). The Just and Pope (1978) approach to modelling production processes in the face of production risk is used widely in applied analysis, with the variation in production being influenced by the input levels; some inputs may be variation-increasing, while others are variation-decreasing, where risk is defined as the variance of output. An important question is whether variance is a good measure of risk. The widely adopted mean–variance approach uses variance as a measure of risk (Coyle, 1992, 1999) and various risk-adjusted efficiency studies in the banking sector incorporate risk in the production technology using a mean–variance criterion (e.g., Settlage, Preckel, & Settlage, 2009). Increasing attention has been given in recent years to risk in agricultural decisions and ways to mitigate it. Just and Pope (1978) define risk as output variability and we expand their concept by defining risk as a category of outputs such as output variance and pesticide effects on biodiversity. Output variance and pesticides’ environmental spillovers may be considered among the outputs of agricultural production to be minimised (i.e., undesirable outputs). Farmers are trying to prevent output variability through the use of pesticides, decreasing pesticide effects on farmland organisms can benefit farms through services such as soil nutrient enhancement and pollination (Pimentel et al., 1992). Several attempts using data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods have been made in the literature to measure efficiency in the presence of undesirable outputs (Ball, Lovell, Nehring, & Somwaru, 1994; Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, & Pasurka, 1989; Färe, Grosskopf, & Tyteca, 1996; Oude Lansink & Silva, 2003; Reinhard, Knox Lovell, & Thijssen, 2000; Sarkis & Cordeiro, 2012; Skevas, Oude Lansink, & Stefanou, 2012; Yang & Pollitt, 2009). An approach allowing for an asymmetric treatment of desirable and undesirable outputs was proposed by Färe et al. (1989), where undesirable outputs are treated as weakly disposable while desirable outputs are strongly disposable. Weak disposability (WD) means that reducing undesirable outputs is not a costless procedure; i.e., firms can discard an unwanted commodity at a positive private cost (Färe, Grosskopf, & Lovell, 1994). On this basis, a number of studies have proposed the use of directional distance functions as a tool for modelling production in the presence of undesirables (Ball, Fare, Grosskopf, & Nehring, 2001; Chung, Färe, & Grosskopf, 1997). A directional distance function allows for a simultaneous expansion of desirable outputs and contraction of inputs and/or undesirable outputs (Chung et al., 1997). The employment of directional distance functions to measure both technical and environmental efficiency of firms producing both desirable and undesirable outputs is widespread (Färe, Grosskopf, Noh, & Weber, 2005; Kjærsgaard, Vestergaard, & Kerstens, 2009; Murty, Kumar, & Dhavala, 2007; Skevas et al., 2012).

Various attempts have been made to incorporate risk in DEA efficiency analysis with the vast majority being in the banking sector. Some studies focus on cost efficiency measures with incomplete price information (Camanho & Dyson, 2005; Schaffnit, Rosen, & Paradi, 1997) and risk-adjusted profit efficiency using a mean–variance criterion (Settlage et al., 2009).

                        Others include risk as an input in the production process of a bank (Berg, Førsund, & Jansen, 1992) or as an undesirable output (Chang, 1999; Park & Weber, 2006).
                     
                     
                        1
                      Others are treating risk as an external factor and employ the methods described in Fried, Lovell, Schmidt, and Yaisawarng (2002) to adjust efficiency measures for risk (Chang, 1999; Chen, Yu, Chang, & Hsu, 2007).

Production risk can impact farmers’ production decisions and consequently their efficiency in using inputs and producing outputs. Therefore, production risk should be incorporated in modelling frameworks evaluating farmers’ performance. Chambers, Hailu, and Quiggin (2011) employ a DEA model incorporating climatic variables to account for the stochastic nature of agricultural production in the evaluation of farmers’ performance, finding that efficiency results change dramatically when acknowledging stochastic elements. Skevas et al. (2012) use a DEA production technology representation that considers both pesticides’ dynamic impacts and variability in climatic conditions in their effort to investigate the performance of Dutch arable farms, noting that ignoring the effects of variability in production conditions may lead to an overestimation of farmers’ inefficiency. The studies of Chambers et al. (2011) and Skevas et al. (2012) adjust efficiency modelling to reflect the effects of variability in production conditions on farmers’ production environment. However, they do not explicitly account for the risk-increasing or decreasing nature of agricultural inputs. Unlike previous studies that account for the production environment (Chambers et al., 2011; Skevas et al., 2012), this study models the effects on farmers’ production environment from an endogenous point of view by using output variance as a measure of risk and considering as inputs the producer’s decisions on risk. More specifically, this study investigates the performance of Dutch arable farms by using a risk-adjusted efficiency measure to: (a) identify technical inefficiency, risk-adjusted input inefficiency and undesirable output inefficiency, (b) incorporate output variance as undesirable outputs in the efficiency analysis, and (c) take explicitly into account the extent to which agricultural inputs increase or decrease production risk.

This paper continues in Section 2 with the presentation of the methodology, while Section 3 describes the definition and sources of the data used. In Section 4, the empirical results from the analysis are presented and discussed, and Section 5 concludes.

The inefficiency model is based on a set of observations of farms in a sample that use a vector of variable inputs (x), fixed inputs (q), and risk-adjusted inputs (z) to produce a desirable output (y) and undesirable outputs (r). The directional technology distance function (Do
                        ) in presence of undesirable outputs, seeks to increase the desirable output while simultaneously reducing the undesirable outputs, variable inputs, fixed inputs, and risk-adjusted inputs:

                         implying desirable output is increased and undesirable outputs, variable inputs, and risk-adjusted inputs are decreased. The model in (1) is similar to the model used in Skevas et al. (2012) in that it employs undesirable outputs and seeks the maximum attainable expansion of desirable outputs and the largest feasible contraction of undesirable outputs and variable inputs. However, it differs from Skevas et al.’s (2012) model in that it accounts for risk by employing undesirable outputs and considering as inputs the producer’s decisions on risk adjustment. The production technology assumes weak disposability of undesirable outputs, and fixed inputs and strong disposability of desirable output, variable inputs, and risk adjusted inputs. Fixed inputs are specified as weakly disposable (in the short run) as changes in land or capital are processes that involve high costs. The indirect effects of pesticides on biodiversity characterised as undesirable outputs and also considered weakly disposable as considerable reductions in environmental spillovers may require significant changes in the type and cost of pesticide products used (e.g., environmental friendly products may be more expensive than high toxicity products). Moreover, the indirect effects of pesticides may reduce the production possibility set for other farms, resulting in governmental regulations. Therefore, disposing of this undesirable output is not a costless activity. Yield variance is also not freely disposable as it is related to weather conditions and changes in pest populations, i.e., variables beyond the control of farmers. On the other hand, risk-adjusted inputs are considered strongly or freely disposable; i.e., changing the levels of these inputs does not involve costs for farms. It is important to notice that in a technical efficiency analysis there is no behavioural component. This study uses a primal modelling approach, and thus, there is no need to make any behavioural assumption other than risk adversity.

                        4 are the technical inefficiency scores for the ith farm of desirable output, risk-adjusted inputs, undesirable outputs, and variable inputs, respectively. Each computed value of β provides the maximum expansion of desirable outputs and contraction of undesirable outputs, risk-adjusted inputs, and variable inputs if a firm has to operate efficiently given the directional vector g. Desirable output is represented by y, z are the risk-adjusted inputs (i.e., fertilizer, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and, other pesticides), q are the fixed inputs (i.e., capital, labour, land), r represents undesirable outputs (i.e., output variance, and pesticide effects on biodiversity), x are the variable inputs (i.e., other inputs), and λ are the firm weights (intensity variables). Let m, l, c, k, and s denote the index set for desirable outputs, risk-adjusted inputs, fixed inputs, undesirable outputs, and variable inputs, respectively. Although output variance does not play a role in the characterisation of the production technology at first glance, it is an integral part of farmers’ stochastic production environment as they use pesticides not only to decrease pest damage but also to prevent output variability (through both preventive and curative applications).
                           2
                           The production technology employed in this model is developed with the idea that there is production risk (e.g., weather and pests can have adverse effects on production). We assume that decision makers are risk averse and implement management strategies that reduce their exposure to risk (e.g., as measured by output variance).
                        
                        
                           2
                         Therefore, the variance of output is a relevant variable in the assessment of technical inefficiency. Pesticide effects on biodiversity contribute to production risk as higher pressure on farmland organisms can deprive farms from services such as soil nutrient enhancement and cause crop losses through decrease in beneficial natural predators (Pimentel et al., 1992). The vector of directions in which outputs and inputs can be scaled is represented by g. Model (2) seeks the maximum attainable expansion of desirable outputs in the gy
                         direction and the largest feasible contraction of risk-adjusted inputs, undesirable outputs, and variable inputs in −gz
                        , −gr
                         and −gx
                         directions, respectively (Chung et al., 1997). The latter are negative because undesirable outputs and inputs are being reduced. The vector of directions reflected by the g values for respective inputs and outputs is driven and justified by the production technology under investigation. Producers aim at obtaining as much output as possible with the minimum use of inputs while simultaneously reducing undesirable outputs. Undesirable outputs are being contracted since farmers aim in decreasing output variability by using pesticides and mitigate pesticide spillover effects since they may have a negative impact on output. Pesticide effects on biodiversity can result in crop losses through decreased pollination or biological control of pests. The scaling parameter φ
                        1 and φ
                        2 are selected to ensure a feasible solution of the DEA model with weakly disposable fixed inputs and undesirable outputs. WD of fixed inputs and undesirable outputs throughout the production process is imposed through constraints (iii) and (iv), respectively.

The specification of weak disposability of undesirables under constant returns to scale (CRS) assumes that all farms in the sample apply a uniform abatement factor (Kuosmanen & Podinovski, 2009). As the farms employed in this study are relatively homogenous, i.e., they are all arable farms, with potatoes being their main crop, we expect abatement costs related to pesticides’ indirect effects to be similar across the farms in the sample. Potato production requires preventive pesticide applications (i.e., to combat phytophthora) and farmers have few alternatives to prevent crop damage. If pesticides’ indirect effects are to be reduced by decreasing the activity level, it would be difficult to see differences in opportunity costs when farmers produce the same crops and operate in a relatively homogeneous production environment. When some of the observed activities use the same input vector then all the abatement factors in Kuosmanen’s (2005) formulation
                           3
                           
                              Kuosmanen (2005) argues that the conventional specification of WD used in Färe and Grosskopf (2003) assumes a uniform abatement across firms and proposes a specification using multiple abatement factors for modeling WD.
                        
                        
                           3
                         can be assumed equal (Kuosmanen & Podinovski, 2009).

After solving model (2), a set of dual variables for each observation is obtained, accounting for the effect on inefficiency of a change in each technological constraint. Utilising the procedure suggested by Ball et al. (1994, 2004), these dual variables can be used to generate the shadow values of each risk-adjusted input. The shadow value of each risk-adjusted input is:

                         are the shadow costs associated with constraints (i) and (ii) (i.e., on output y, and risk-adjusted inputs l, respectively) from model (2). The extent to which risk-adjusted inputs are over- or under-used is inferred from a comparison of the shadow values with the input prices. Input prices are greater (lower) than shadow values for inputs that are over-used (under-used).

The estimation procedure of output variance follows two steps. First, we estimate the first two moments of the output distribution following a sequential estimation procedure as described in Kim and Chavas (2003), which adapts the procedure in Antle (1987). In the first step output is regressed on the input variables as shown in the following model:

                        where μ
                        1 is the first moment of output. The parameter vectors γ and δ are the elasticities of the first two moments of output with respect to each production input and provide information on the responsiveness of the output produced by a change in each input. In general, it is expected that all inputs increase output, but for the second moment, inputs can be either risk-increasing or risk-decreasing.

The data are an unbalanced panel of Dutch arable farms, covering the period 2003–2007, obtained from the Agricultural Economics Research Institute. Farms remain in the panel for a maximum of five years. The data set used comprises 493 observations from 119 farms. Table 1
                      reports the dimensions, mean values, and standard deviations of the data.

One output, 7 inputs (fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, other pesticides, other variable inputs, labour, capital, and land), and two pesticide externalities (impacts on water and soil organisms) are distinguished. Output mainly consists of potatoes, sugar beets, and cereals (wheat, barley, corn) and is measured as total revenue from all products, deflated to 2005 values using a Tornqvist index for the disaggregated output components. The inputs are separated into fixed inputs including land, capital and labour, variable inputs consisting of other variable (or specific crop) inputs, and risk-adjusted inputs including fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and other pesticides.
                        4
                        Other pesticides include growth regulators, rodenticides, additives (i.e., mineral oil), ground disinfectants, detergents, sulfur, and, unclassified products.

                      Land represents the total area under crops and is measured in hectares, capital includes the replacement value of machinery, buildings and installations, deflated to 2005 using a Tornqvist index based on the respective price indices, and labour is measured in annual work units (AWU
                        5
                        One AWU is equivalent to one person working full-time on the holding (EC, 2001).

                     ). Fertilizers were measured as expenditures deflated to 2005 using a fertilizer price index. All pesticide categories are measured as expenditures deflated to 2005 using pesticide price indexes for each pesticide category from Eurostat. The “other inputs” variable includes expenditures on energy, seeds and other crop-specific costs, deflated to 2005 using a Tornqvist index for the disaggregated “other inputs” components.

The pesticide impact data are obtained from the Dutch Centre for Agriculture and Environment (CLM). There is an environmental indicator expressed in impact points for each pesticide farmers’ use, capturing its indirect effect on water and soil organisms.
                        6
                        Water and soil organisms include mainly aquatic and soil insects, respectively (CLM, 2010).
                     
                     
                        6
                      Pesticide toxicity and the amount of spray drift to watercourses (1% for arable farming) are taken into account in computing the impact points for water organisms. The impact points for soil organisms are computed based on the organic matter content (3–6% for the case study farms), pesticide characteristics (degradation rate, and mobility in soil) and pesticide toxicity. The organic matter content in conjunction with pesticide characteristics determine the amount of pesticides that remain in the soil over time. Originally, the environmental impact points (for both water and soil organisms) are expressed for an application of 1kilogram/hectare (standard application). The impact points under a standard application are multiplied by the actual applied quantity per hectare (CLM, 2010). The final farm-specific impact for water and soil organisms is computed by summing up the impact points of the individual pesticide applications.

The environmental impact points increase when pesticides have a greater impact on the environment. For soil organisms a score of 100 impact points is in line with the acceptable level (AL) set by the Dutch board for the authorisation of pesticides (CTB), which reflects the concentration that implicates minor risk for the environment. Since 1995, the AL for aquatic organisms is 10 impact points per application (CLM, 2010).

The results of the moment function estimation are summarised in Table 2
                         in terms of the elasticities of the first two moments of output with respect to each production input using a quadratic functional form specification (which includes inputs in original units, squared units, and interaction terms).
                           7
                           Most of the inputs in squares and cross variables of Eq. (4) were insignificant even at the 10% significance level and were excluded from the estimation. The only significant terms were the squared insecticide variable (parameter estimate: 0.01, p-value: 0.000) and the interaction term “fungicides*herbicides” (parameter estimate: −0.05, p-value: 0.000).
                        
                        
                           7
                         Concerning the first moment, all farmer choice factors have a positive and significant impact except for labour, which is also insignificant. This is quite close to our expectation that inputs in the first moment function estimation increase output. The significant elasticities of fertilizer and other inputs indicate that these inputs do play an important role in crop production. Land elasticity is higher in comparison to the rest of the productive inputs, implying that land is a scarce input that constrains the cash crop sector. All pesticide elasticities are significant, pointing to the importance of pesticides in reducing crop damage. Fungicide elasticity is higher in comparison to the rest of pesticide inputs. This is expected as one of the most important crops of the sampled farms is potatoes that require rigorous fungicide applications to combat oomycete Phytophthora infestants, considered the crops’ main enemy (Haverkort, Struik, Visser, & Jacobsen, 2009).

In the second stage estimation addressing the second moment, production inputs can be separated into marginal risk-reducing and marginal risk-increasing inputs. The marginal risk-reducing input category includes fertilizer, land, fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, but only fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides play a significant role in decreasing output variance. Fungicides are important in preventing crop damage in potato production that has a high share in the examined farmers’ crop basket. Insecticides and herbicides can reduce output variability by reducing the presence of pests, thus optimising the growth conditions of target plants. Griffiths and Anderson (1982), Saha et al. (1994) and Smith and Goodwin (1996) support the view that pesticides are risk-reducing inputs while Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993), Pannell (1995), Gotsch and Regev (1996), and Saha et al. (1997) suggest otherwise. When both pest populations are high and growth conditions are favourable, pesticides will be risk increasing as they increase the variability of harvests (i.e., increase output under good growth conditions). Among the marginal risk-increasing inputs are other inputs, labour, capital, and other pesticides. Labour and other pesticides are the only significant parameters at the 5% significance level. Assuming that pest damage is independent of other factors affecting output may lead to the conventional view that pesticides are risk-reducing inputs (Horowitz & Lichtenberg, 1994).

Following Antle (1987) who used the moment-based approach to estimate risk attitude parameters, it is very common in the literature to include output variance in econometric models (e.g., Kim & Chavas, 2003; Koundouri, Nauges, & Tzouvelekas, 2006). Alternatives available in the literature include the use of the concept of downside risk, prospect theory, and risk value model (Antle, 2010). The limitations of variance as a measure of risk have been discussed extensively in the literature, but it is noted that this approach can be used when the production data represent high production risks (Antle, 2010; Lence, 2009). Our study is an example of this type of risk since the results of the moment function estimation indicate that relationships between inputs and production risk are strong (i.e., most of the input elasticities are statistically significant at the 5% significance level).

Technical inefficiency scores for output (β
                        1), risk-adjusted inputs (β
                        2), undesirable outputs (β
                        3), and variable inputs (β
                        4) for the ith farm are obtained using the GAMS programming software (Rosenthal, 2012). Annual averages of technical inefficiency scores in the years 2003–2007 are found in Table 3
                        . Annual averages of output technical inefficiency of Dutch arable farmers range between 7% and 13%. The average technical inefficiency for risk-mitigating inputs (7%) is slightly lower than the average output technical inefficiency score (9%), whereas the average technical inefficiency for undesirable outputs (9%) is at a similar level. The annual average of variable inputs’ technical inefficiency is quite low, ranging between 3% and 4%. Undesirable outputs’ inefficiency can be interpreted as the level of farm production pressure on farmland biodiversity and farmers’ capacity in reducing output variability. In other words, this figure measures farmers’ performance in protecting the status of the environment and decreasing yield variability related to factors that are beyond the control of the producer (e.g., weather). Risk-mitigating inputs’ inefficiency indicates how efficient farmers are in using risk-mitigating inputs to manage production risk. The considerable level of undesirable outputs’ inefficiency presents a considerable range (9%) of potential improvement in decreasing the environmental impacts of pesticides. High pesticide environmental inefficiency reveals a considerable scope for decreasing pesticides’ environmental spillovers is also reported by Skevas et al. (2012) for Dutch arable farms over the period 2003–2007. The importance of decreasing the environmental impacts of pesticides stem from the fact that farmland organisms are associated with valuable ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes such as biological pest control and crop pollination that can mitigate the need for pesticides and have a beneficial impact on output realisation.


                        Table 4
                         presents the average shadow values of risk-adjusted inputs computed using an average output price index of 1.12. The average shadow price of fertilizer over the period 2003–2007 is 0.51. A comparison of this shadow price with its market price shows that fertilizers were overused.

                           A t-test has shown that the shadow value of fertilizers is significantly different from its market price.
                        
                        
                           8
                         This finding is consistent with results from Oude Lansink and Silva (2004), and Guan, Oude Lansink, Wossink, and Huirne (2005). A comparison of the average shadow values of fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and other pesticides with pesticide prices shows that all pesticides were overused. This finding shows that farmers could increase their profitability by decreasing the use of pesticides. The difference between the average shadow values and prices are highest for fungicides and herbicides. This indicates that a reduction of their use would generate the highest marginal benefit. The standard deviations of the average shadow values of all inputs indicate a large dispersion. The last column of Table 4 presents the percentage of the distribution of farms that overuse the chemical inputs. Approximately, two-thirds of farms are overusing fertilizers and insecticides, 86% of farms are overusing fungicides, and nearly all farms are overusing herbicides.

                         were (on average) under-utilised in their study of Dutch arable farms over the period 1989–1992. Underutilization of fungicides, herbicides and other pesticides is also reported by Oude Lansink and Carpentier (2001) for Dutch specialised arable farms over the same period. Guan et al. (2005) report a pesticide shadow value of 1.25 euros versus a price of 1.10 and conclude that pesticides were optimally used at the farm level but they add that this might lead to an overuse if the indirect effects of pesticides are taken into account. The large differences between the shadow values of pesticides obtained in this study versus those of other studies (Guan et al., 2005; Oude Lansink & Carpentier, 2001; Oude Lansink & Silva, 2004) can be attributed to differences in modelling frameworks (accounting for risk like in our study vs. ignoring risk in other studies), and failure of other studies to take into account the effects of pesticides on biodiversity.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study uses a DEA risk-adjusted inefficiency model of Dutch cash crop producers that explicitly accounts for the effect of production means on output variability in order to compute output, risk-adjusted inputs and undesirable outputs inefficiency. Farmers use risk-adjusted inputs to manage risk, with agricultural practices leading to the production of undesirable outputs, defined as the variance of output and pesticide effects on biodiversity. The first two moments of the output distribution are used to compute output variance, which is then incorporated into the efficiency modelling framework, thus accounting for the risk increasing or decreasing nature of the employed production inputs. The DEA literature in the context of agricultural production presents ways to model risk as an exogenous impact (e.g. by including weather variables in the modelling framework (Chambers et al., 2011; Skevas et al., 2012)). This study contributes to this literature by showing a way to model risk as an endogenous factor by using output variance as a measure of risk and considering the producers’ choices on risk-adjusted inputs. As in Skevas et al. (2012), this study uses a directional distance function with undesirable outputs to compute farmers’ technical inefficiency, the difference being that it incorporates risk by accounting for farmer’s decisions on risk mitigation and uses output variance as a measure of risk.

Results show that fungicides and herbicides are risk-reducing inputs while other pesticides and other inputs are risk-increasing inputs. Dutch cash crop farmers have considerable levels of undesirable outputs’ inefficiency (i.e., 9%) implying that policy makers can focus on reducing pesticides’ environmental spillovers. The considerable pesticide environmental inefficiency of Dutch arable farmers implies that a reduction of pesticides’ environmental spillovers can be achieved with the current technology (e.g., more precise pesticide applications). Fertilizer and all types of pesticides (i.e., fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and other pesticides) are overused by Dutch cash crop farmers. The considerable level of undesirable outputs’ inefficiency in conjunction with pesticides’ overuse reveals a need to decrease pesticide use and their environmental spillovers. Pesticides are on average overused, and the dispersion in shadow prices implies that overuse applies to at least two-thirds of the farms, depending on the chemical material. The results suggest that particularly a reduction of the use of fungicides and herbicides yields high marginal benefits. Hence, policy makers could focus more on reducing the use of these types of pesticides. However, overuse of a particular category of pesticides should be examined relative to their benefits in production, as fungicides are important for combating Phytophtora infestans in potato production, an important cash crop for Dutch arable farmers. Pesticide policies, taking into account both the production and environmental efficiency of the different types of pesticides and their particular benefits to production, may benefit farmers by increasing their profitability and improving environmental quality through reductions in pesticides’ environmental spillovers.
