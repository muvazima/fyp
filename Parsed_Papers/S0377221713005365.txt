                  We formulate a noncooperative game to model competition for policyholders among non-life insurance companies, taking into account market premium, solvency level, market share and underwriting results. We study Nash equilibria and Stackelberg equilibria for the premium levels, and give numerical illustrations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Insurance pricing is a classical topic for both actuaries and academics. Standard actuarial approaches for non-life insurance typically suggest to use expectation, standard deviation, or quantiles of the underlying risk to determine a suitable premium. For an overview of principles of premium calculation, see e.g. Teugels and Sundt (2004). The resulting (so-called technical) premium is then often altered by marketing and management departments, and actual deviations from the technical premium can be considerable. Affordability by customers and mutualization across the portfolio are often used as arguments to justify that policyholders do not necessarily pay the risk-based premium. But another important reason for such deviations from the technical premium is the dependency on market conditions. In order to study that factor, a market model is needed to study the economic interactions between insurers and policyholders.

Basic economic models suggest that the equilibrium premium is the marginal cost, as any upward deviation from this premium equilibrium will result in losing all the policies in the next period. Other advanced economic models generally focus on moral hazard and adverse selection. The Rothschild and Stiglitz’s model (see Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976)) deals with a utility-based agent framework where policyholders have private information on their own risk. In this model, insurers provide a menu of contracts, i.e. pairs of premium and deductible, from which policyholder can freely choose. At the equilibrium, individuals with low risk aversion choose full coverage, whereas individuals with high risk aversion are more attracted to partial coverage. Note that an equilibrium price may not exist if all insurers offer just one type of contract. Picard (2009) considers an extension by allowing insurers to offer participating contracts (such as mutual-type contracts). This feature guarantees the existence of an equilibrium, which reveals the risk level of the policyholders. An important area of applications for such models is health insurance, where moral hazard and adverse selection play a major role, see e.g. Geoffard et al. (1998), Wambach (2000) and Mimra and Wambach (2010). But, in practice customers do not move from one insurer to a cheaper one as swiftly as economic models anticipate. The inertia of the insurance demand prevents policyholders to always look for the cheapest insurer, see Smith et al. (2000) for a case study in Australia. Accordingly, the customer behavior is much more complicated.

Moreover, the economic models mentioned above are not able to incorporate some insurance market features. Taylor (1986, 1987) deals with underwriting strategies of insurers and provides first attempts to model optimal responses of an insurer to the market on a given time horizon, see also Kliger and Levikson (1998); Emms et al. (2007); Moreno-Codina and Gomez-Alvado (2008) for extensions. All these papers focus on one single insurer and in that way assume that insurers are playing a game against an impersonal market player, so that the market price is independent of their own actions.

In this paper, we want to further investigate the suitability of game theory for insurance market modeling. The use of game theory in actuarial science has a long history dating back to K. Borch and J. Lemaire, who mainly used cooperative games to model risk transfer between insurer and reinsurer, see e.g. Section 3.1 of Brockett and Xia (1995) for a review. Among earlier work using noncooperative game theory to model the non-life insurance market, two kinds of models were pursued: the Bertrand oligopoly where insurers set premiums and the Cournot oligopoly where insurers choose optimal values of insurance coverage. Polborn (1998) considers a Bertrand model in which rational consumers maximize their utility function and for which the equilibrium premium is the expected loss. Rees et al. (1999) extend this model by requiring insurers to announce both a premium and a capital value. Under rational behavior, the premium equilibrium remains the expected loss and the capital equilibrium avoids insolvency. Powers and Shubik (1998) propose a Cournot model with two types of players. Policyholders state the amount that they are willing to pay, and insurers state the amount of risk they are willing to underwrite. Based on a clearing-house system to determine the market price, each player maximizes its expected utility. Assuming risk neutral insurers and risk averse consumers, the resulting premium equilibrium is larger than the expected loss. They also study scale effects of the number of insurers on the premium equilibrium. Powers and Shubik (2006) include reinsurers as additional players and study the optimal number of reinsurers in an insurance market.

The present paper aims to model competition in non-life insurance markets with noncooperative game theory in order to extend the insurer-vs-market reasoning of Taylor (1986, 1987). We extend the Bertrand model of Rees et al. (1999) by considering a lapse model and an aggregate loss model for policyholders. The lapse model describes the policyholder behavior through a lapse probability which is a function of the premiums offered by the insurers. We also consider a solvency constraint function for insurers. As a main result, we show that incorporating competition when setting premiums leads to a significant deviation of Nash and Stackelberg equilibria both from the actuarial premium and a one-insurer optimized premium.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the one-period noncooperative game of this paper. Existence and uniqueness of a premium equilibrium are established. Section 3 presents numerical illustrations of the game. A conclusion and perspectives are given in Section 4.

Consider I insurers competing in a market of n policyholders with one-year contracts (n is fixed). The policyholders are assumed to react to price changes (either stay with the present insurer or switch to one of the competitors), but do not have any other influence on the premium level (which is a realistic assumption, in particular for personal lines of business such as compulsory third-party motor liability). In view of the one-year time horizon and the randomness of claim sizes, this model focuses on non-life insurance products (i.e. products for which the claim event is not linked to the life of the policyholder).

The “game” for insurers is to set the premium for which policies are offered to the policyholders. Let 
                        
                           (

                           …
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 x

                           )

                                 I

                        j
                      representing the premium of Insurer j. Once the premium is set by all insurers, the policyholders choose to renew or to lapse from their current insurer. Then, insurers pay occurring claims during the coverage year. At the end of the period, underwriting results are determined, and the insurer capital is updated: some insurers may be bankrupt. As we deal with a one-period model, for simplicity we do not consider investment results.

In the next subsections, we present the four components of the game: (i) a lapse model, (ii) a loss model, (iii) an objective function and (iv) a solvency constraint function. These four components are critical factors for the analysis of the non-life insurance market, see e.g. IASB (2008). In the sequel, a subscript j
                     ∈{1,…,
                     I} will always denote an insurer index, whereas a subscript i
                     ∈{1,…,
                     n} denotes policyholder index. In the sequel, “insurer” is used when referring to players of the insurance game.

In this subsection, we present our lapse model which is designed as a compromise between reflecting the policyholders’ behavior in a reasonable way, yet keeping mathematical tractability. Let n
                        
                           j
                         be the initial portfolio size of Insurer j (such that

                        (x) to move from Insurer j to Insurer k naturally depends on the price vector x, (concretely, the difference of premiums). Empirically, the probability to lapse p
                        
                           j→k

                        ≠

                           j→j

                         is considered in the framework of discrete choice models. In the random utility maximization setting, McFadden (1981, chap. 5) or Anderson et al. (1989) propose multinomial logit and probit probability choice models. In this paper, we choose a multinomial logit model, because of its simplicity (the probit link function, based on the multivariate normal distribution, would not significantly change the shape of the lapse function). Working with unordered choices, we arbitrarily set the insurer reference category for p

                         to j, the current insurer. We define the probability for a customer to go from insurer j to k given the price vector x by the multinomial logit model

This assumption is in contrast to the standard models in classical ruin theory, where the portfolio size is assumed constant over time (see e.g. Asmussen and Albrecher (2010) for a recent survey and Malinovskii (2010) for an attempt to have a premium-dependent portfolio size). With this insurer choice model, the expected portfolio size of insurer j reduces to

                        . In the numerical applications, these two loss models are denoted PLN and NBLN, respectively. For the distribution of Z, we choose the lognormal distribution, which is due to its heavy-tailedness and at the same time pleasant statistical properties is a popular modeling assumption in many lines of non-life insurance. This choice is by no means crucial, as any other can be handled in an analogous way.

In the two previous subsections, we presented two components of the insurance markets: the lapse model (how policyholders react to premium changes) and the loss model (how policyholders face claims). We now turn our attention to the underwriting strategy of insurers, i.e. on how they set premiums.

In Section 2.1, we assumed that price elasticity of demand for the insurance product is positive. Thus, if the whole market underwrites at a loss, any actions of a particular insurer to get back to profitability will result in a reduction of his business volume. This has two consequences for the choice of the objective function: (i) it should involve a decreasing demand function of price x

                           Rating bureaus or rating agencies are organizations collecting statistical data from insurers in order to publish market information both for insurers and policyholders. The credibility factor is the weight given to individual loss experience in contrast to collective loss data.

                        The market proxy aims to assess other insurer premiums without specifically targeting one competitor. It can be interpreted as the premium of an ideal medium competitor. Consequently, Insurer j typically does not target the cheapest, the most expensive or the leader insurers.

Now we can state our objective function. We suppose that Insurer j maximizes the expected profit of next year policies which we here define in the multiplicative form

                           j
                         leads to a trade-off between increasing premium to favor higher projected profit margins and decreasing premium to defend the current market share. Note that O

Another key feature of the model is a solvency constraint the goal of which is to require insurers to hold a certain amount of capital in order to protect policyholders against adverse collective claim experience. Therefore, in addition to maximizing a certain objective function, insurers must satisfy a solvency constraint imposed by the regulator. A reasonable criterion to find the minimum capital requirement is linked to deviations of the aggregate losses from its expected value, concretely the difference of a high-level quantile and the mean of the loss distribution. For simplicity, this quantity is supposed to be a linear function of the standard deviation of the loss distribution. In practice, the solvency capital is also required on a prospective basis; we take here the simplifying assumption to use only the in-force policy number. Thus, we define the solvency constraint function as

We consider two solution concepts for our game: the Nash equilibrium for which it is assumed that insurer actions are taken simultaneously, and the Stackelberg equilibrium for which actions take place sequentially with a leader, see e.g. Fudenberg and Tirole (1991); Osborne and Rubinstein (2006).

A Nash equilibrium can hence be interpreted as a point at which no insurer has an incentive to deviate, given the actions of the other insurers. Now, we turn to the definition of a Stackelberg equilibrium. For simplicity, we assume there is one unique leader (Insurer 1) and insurers j
                        ∈{2,…,
                        I} are followers.

All numerical applications are carried out with the R software, R Core Team (2012), cf. Appendix B for computation details. We start by describing the reference parameters in Section 3.1 for which we give the Nash premium equilibrium in Section 3.2. Then, we continue with a sensitivity analysis in Section 3.3 and an analysis of the distribution of the capital at the end of the game in Section 3.4 for the Nash premium equilibrium. Finally, we compare the results with the Stackelberg equilibrium in Section 3.5.

We consider a game with three insurers operating a 10,000-customer insurance market, i.e. n
                        =10,000, I
                        =3. Insurer initial portfolio sizes are (n
                        1,
                        n
                        2,
                        n
                        3)=(4500,3200,2300). The portfolio size is chosen such that Insurer 1 is the leader, Insurer 2 the challenger and Insurer 3 the outsider with 45%, 32% and 23% market shares, respectively.

We consider the two types of loss models presented in Section 2.2, i.e. (i) PLN loss model such that 
                           
                              E

                         and (ii) NBLN loss model such that

                        . They differ only on the assumption of the frequency distribution (and not on the severity distribution). For these two models, we have a coefficient of variation of the loss distribution of 4.472 and 10.488, respectively (which are reasonable magnitudes for practical purposes).

Before giving the sensitivity parameters β
                        
                           j
                        , we present the two lapse models used. For customer behavior, we have two parameters μ

In Table 2
                        , we give the lapse parameters. Given x
                        1
                        = (1,1,1) and x
                        1.05
                        =(1.05,1,1), lapse parameters are such that 1−
                        p

                        1→1(x

Such values of lapse rates are close to actually observed lapse rates e.g. in continental Europe for private motor lines of business. With these lapse parameters, the expected numbers of lost policies when all insurers propose the same premium are 450.1, 448.0 and 414.0. In Fig. 1

We recall that a change in the loss model does not affect the objective function but only the constraint function by changing the standard deviation σ(Y) of the aggregate claim distribution.

                        , we logically find that the premium equilibrium is the same for the four tested models as long as the constraint functions are not active. However, effects of loss models on portfolio sizes and capital levels are strongly different.

                        ★ can lead to very different situations of solvency for all insurers. For instance, in Table 4 with the capital down scenario, an increase of the premium equilibrium implies a fall in the expected solvency coverage ratio.

In Fig. 2

                         models. In such a setting, the premium equilibrium is given by x
                        ★
                        =(1.544,1.511,1.471). In both Fig. 2a and b, the solid vertical line gives the initial capital value K
                        3. We observe the huge difference of capital values. The solvency in the NBLN case is much weaker (with 11.4% of sample capital values below the initial value) than the PLN case (with 0.2%). For the PLN case, the premium equilibrium x
                        ★ seems rather unfair compared to the actuarial premium. In practice, two scenarios seem natural: (i) some customers may leave the market (because they cannot afford such a high premium) and may start a mutual fund or stay uninsured, and (ii) no customer notices this gap for the joy of insurers.


                        Table 6
                         reports the Stackelberg premium equilibrium. Compared to the Nash equilibrium of Table 3 (where x
                        ★
                        =(1.544,1.511,1.471), the equilibrium value is significantly higher for the Stackelberg equilibrium. We also notice that there is a small difference in terms of the loss model in Table 6, which does not appear in Table 3. In terms of premium ranking, Insurer 1 (the leader) is still higher than competitors, and Insurer 3 asks the cheapest premium at the Stackelberg equilibrium. Regarding the robustness of the premium value, the Stackelberg equilibrium is notably higher than the pure premium

                         and also higher than the Nash equilibrium. Finally, the computation complexity is higher for the Stackelberg equilibrium since we carry out a double-level optimization when minimizing the function

                        n

                        . The increase of insurers in the market reduces the value of the equilibrium, both for Nash and Stackelberg equilibria. However, the ranking remains the same as the leader (Insurer 1) still asks the most expensive premium and Insurer 3 the cheapest. For the Stackelberg equilibrium, the leader premium (Insurer 1) is significantly reduced by the addition of two followers (from 1.740 to 1.600), while the reduction is moderate for followers. Note that results for 5 players still hold when the total number of policyholers is renormalize to 10,000 (as in the 3-player game).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper assesses the suitability of noncooperative game theory for insurance market modeling. We extend the one-insurer models of Taylor (1986, 1987) based on optimal control theory and the subsequent extensions. We also enrich the Bertrand model of Polborn (1998) by refining customer behavior and loss assumptions. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic approach contributes to the growing literature of insurance customer behavior modeling, e.g. Onn and Mercer (1998), Dimitriyadis and Tektas (1998), Yu et al. (2009), Loisel and Milhaud (2011), Leung and Kwok (2012), Takagoshi and Matsubayahi (2013), Chen et al. (2013). The approach proposed in this paper gives a first indicator of the effect of competition on the insurers’ solvency. The proposed game models a rational behavior of insurers in setting premiums taking into account other insurers. The ability of an insurer to sell contracts is essential for its survival. In terms of equilibrium concepts, the Nash equilibrium is a natural concept when there is no strong leadership, e.g. in private lines, whereas the Stackelberg equilibrium is relevant for lines manifesting oligopolistic tendencies, typically corporate lines. Numerical illustrations show that the Stackelberg premiums are higher than the Nash premiums and that these premium levels become lower when the number of insurers in the market increases.

The game can be extended in various directions. A natural next step is to consider adverse selection among policyholders, since insurers do not propose the same premium to all customers. A second extension is to model investment results as well as loss reserves and reinsurance treaties. Furthermore, in practice, insurers play an insurance game over several years, gather new information on incurred losses, available capital and competition level. In addition from being dynamic, the market premium shows patterns of cycles with hard and soft phases, known as insurance market cycles, see e.g. Weiss (2007) for a recent survey. Hence, a dynamic game model for insurance markets to explain the occurrence of market cycles could be of particular interest. This will be pursued in a future study.

Currently, European insurers report their solvency margin in the Solvency I framework, based on the maximum of a percentage of gross written premium and aggregate claim mean. According to Derien (2010), a non-life insurer computes its solvency margin as

This approach is not really satisfactory, as it does not take into account the risk volality of underwritten business. Since 2005, actuaries are well busy with the upcoming Solvency II framework. In this new framework, the quantitative part leads to the computation of two capital values, both based on the difference between a certain quantile and the mean of the aggregate loss distribution. The solvency capital requirement (SCR) is based on the 99.5%-quantile, whereas the minimum capital requirement (MCR) is based on the 85%-quantile Table A.8.

Furthermore, if the solvency requirement is not fulfilled, in Solvency I, the regulator response is immediate: depending on the insolvency severity, regulators can withdraw the authorization to underwrite new business or even force the company to go run-off or to sell part of its portfolio. In Solvency II, this happens only when the MCR level is not met. There is a buffer between MCR and SCR where regulators impose some specific actions to help returning to the SCR level.

In our game context, we want to avoid the simplistic Solvency I framework, but still want to keep the tractablity for the SCR computation rule. We recall that the aggregate claim amount is assumed to be a frequency – average severity model. Consider the aggregate claim amount

                        See e.g. Theorem 12.4.3 of Bowers et al. (1997). Panjer recursion requires that the claim distribution is discrete. So before using Panjer algorithm, we use a lower discretization of the lognormal claim distribution.

                     . While the normal approximation is based on the first two moments of the distribution only, simulation and Panjer methods use assumptions on claim frequency and claim severity distributions, see Section 2.2. We also need a policy number n. In Table A.8
                     , we report solvency coefficients for n

The computation of Nash equilibria is based on a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) reformulation. We present briefly the problem reformulation and refer the interested readers to e.g. Facchinei and Kanzow (2009) or Dutang (2012a). In our setting, we have I insurers and three constraints for each of them. For each j of the I subproblems, the necessary KKT conditions are

The inequality part is called the complementarity constraint. A sufficient condition for a point satisfying the KKT conditions to be a generalized Nash equilibrium is that the objective functions are pseudoconcave and a constraint qualification holds. We have seen that objective functions are either strictly concave or pseudoconcave, whereas constraint qualifications are always verified for linear constraints, or strictly monotone functions, see Theorem 2 of Arrow and Enthoven (1961).

The reformulation proposed uses a complementarity function ϕ(a,
                     b) to reformulate the inequality constraints λ

                        j
                      is the Lagrangian function for the subproblem j and ϕ
                     . denotes the component wise version of ϕ. So, subproblem j reduces to solving a so-called nonsmooth equation. In this paper, we use the Fischer–Burmeister complementarity function. This method is implemented in the R package GNE of Dutang (2012b).
