                  The increase in cost of supplies and services is outpacing the increase in revenues at many hospitals. To address this cost increase hospitals are seeking more efficient ways to store and manage vast inventories of medical supplies. A parsimonious and efficient inventory system which we call 2Bin is becoming increasingly popular in North American hospitals. Under the 2Bin system inventory is stored in two equal-sized bins. 2Bin systems are reviewed periodically and empty bins are replenished. In recent years the adoption of RFID technology for 2Bin systems is allowing continuous-time tracking of empty bins, increasing inventory visibility. In this paper we model the 2Bin inventory system under periodic and continuous review. For periodic review we show that the long-run average cost per unit time is quasi-convex, enabling a simple search for the optimal review cycle. For continuous review, we present a semi-Markov decision model, characterize the optimal replenishment policy, and provide a solution approach to obtain the long-run average cost per unit time. Using data obtained from hospitals currently using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems, we estimate the economic benefits of using the best periodic review length (i.e., parameter optimization), and of using a continuous review inventory policy (i.e., policy improvement). We characterize system conditions such as the number of medical supplies used, replenishment costs, stock-out costs, etc. that favor each option, and provide insights to hospital management on system design considerations that favor the use of periodic or continuous review.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Hospitals are part of complex supply chains including purchase, storage, distribution, and inventory control of drugs and medical supplies. Several factors increase the complexity of hospital supply chains, including the large variety of items used by clinicians. Hospitals often manage hundreds of different items. Inventory availability is critical for patient care. However, high inventory levels increase costs and create a significant economic impact for the hospital. In North America, more than 40 percent of hospital expenses are related to supply chain activities (AHRMM, 2010). While excess inventory is undesirable, enough inventory must be available to avoid disruption to nursing activities that may hinder patient care. Per the report by Meyer and Meyer (2006), one of the future research areas in health care delivery is the study of inventory management practices within hospitals.

In response to the need for storing and managing a large number of low-cost but critically important medical supplies, hospitals have relied on inventory systems such as exchange carts and automated storage cabinets. The use of automated storage cabinets has increased in recent years (Pedersen, Schneider, and Scheckelhoff, 2009), but given the capital investment these systems require and the limited storage space available, many hospitals are using this technology mostly to store and dispense drugs or expensive supplies. In contrast, the inventory system studied in this paper provides an efficient yet simple way to control and dispense hundreds of high-volume, low-cost items without investing in expensive storage units (Denton, 2013).

We use the term 2Bin system to denote an inventory-control method similar to a kanban system in which an item’s inventory is divided and stored in two bins (Hall, 2012). Under a 2Bin inventory system only empty bins are tracked in lieu of unit-level item consumption. This reduces the data collection costs and the inventory control parameters are on bin level as well, such as the bin replenishment frequency or the number of empty bins that trigger a replenishment. More traditional inventory replenishment policies found in the literature are on unit level, which require unit-level demand tracking and inventory control parameters per item, such as reorder points and order-up-to levels (Rosales, Magazine, and Rao, 2014a; Khouja and Goyal, 2008).

In our experience with 2Bin systems, bins are usually denoted as primary and secondary. Although the number of units contained in each bin will differ by item, the primary and secondary bin of the same item have equal capacity. For each item the amount of inventory stored in a bin is typically determined based on the number of desired inventory turns per year. Bins are usually located back-to-back in racks with the secondary bin placed behind the primary bin. When the primary bin is exhausted, it is removed from the racks, and the inventory in the secondary bin becomes available. When the empty primary bin is replenished the bins are exchanged, i.e., the secondary bin becomes the new primary bin, supporting product rotation, and the recently replenished bin becomes the secondary bin. Traditionally 2Bin inventory systems used in hospitals are replenished using periodic reviews (Landry and Beaulieu, 2010), with empty bin replenishments carried out at the beginning of every review interval, usually once daily.

Although the simplicity of 2Bin systems allows hospitals to efficiently replenish a large number of items, policy parameters such as replenishment frequency are often based on values historically used and are typically suboptimal. Performing the replenishment of empty bins requires time from materials management personnel, incurring a fixed cost for each replenishment carried out. In addition, materials management personnel has a limited availability to perform the replenishments. On the other hand, replenishments avoid stock-outs, which can be costly as nurses typically waste valuable time obtaining any items that are short, potentially disrupting patient care. To balance fixed order costs and stock-out costs can be challenging. One of the goals in this paper is to find optimal values for the periodic review interval to improve the inventory systems of hospitals that use a periodic review 2Bin system.

Hospitals are investing in technology such as RFID or barcodes in order to avoid stock-outs, to reduce inventory cost of supplies and to increase inventory tracking. Item-level RFID tags can be prohibitively expensive for low-cost items but not for bins (Johnson and Lee, 2002). The second goal in this paper is to study the use of RFID tags on hospital bins. This research is motivated by our interactions with consulting company Logi-D (www.logi-d.net/en/) which developed such a system, called the 2BIN-iD system. In the 2BIN-iD system a passive radio frequency identification (RFID) transponder is attached to each bin. When a bin becomes empty, the passive RFID tag is removed and placed on an RFID-enabled replenishment board that has an RFID reader capable of reading all tags on the board. The replenishment board is connected to the IT network alerting the system that a product is due to be replenished, which increases inventory visibility. The use of this technology provides hospital management the opportunity to achieve additional economic benefits by using a continuous-review 2Bin system.

Hospitals currently using traditional 2Bin systems have two alternatives to improve their inventory management practices, (1) parameter optimization—starting with a typical hospital periodic review system and optimizing parameters such as the periodic review interval, or (2) policy improvement—changing to a continuous review policy with the use of technologies such as bin-level RFID or barcodes. Therefore the two goals in this paper are referred to as parameter optimization and policy improvement, respectively. We model the 2Bin system under both periodic and continuous review. The periodic review model provides a performance benchmark representing current hospital practice and it allows us to estimate the cost benefit of optimizing the periodic review interval. To achieve this, we show that the long-run average cost per unit time is quasi-convex in the review interval, enabling a simple search to obtain the optimal review cycle length. Conversely, the continuous review model allows us to estimate the benefits of using a new inventory policy enabled by the presence of new technology, we present a semi-Markov model to characterize the optimal policy (i.e., find the optimal number of empty bins over all items that should trigger a replenishment), and to provide an approach to estimate the optimal long-run average cost per unit time. We use data from hospitals currently using 2BIN-iD systems, to conduct a performance comparison between both types of review systems as well as a sensitivity analysis.

In the sensitivity analysis, the following questions are answered: When is the benefit of using a continuous-review policy sufficiently greater than the benefit of using an optimal periodic review policy to warrant investments in new continuous-review technology? How are the relative benefits of using new technology affected by system conditions such as the number of stocked medical supplies, the cost of performing a replenishment, or the cost of material stock-outs? In addition our study allows hospitals to evaluate the cost impact of having several storage locations with few items or fewer storage locations with more items, and how these costs can be affected by using optimal periodic or continuous review policies.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the literature, in Section 3 we describe the 2Bin system and introduce basic notation and assumptions common to both periodic and continuous-review models. In Section 4 we present closed form expressions for the average cost per unit time under periodic review as well as a Golden Section search approach to estimate the optimal periodic review interval. In Section 5 we present a semi-Markov decision model for the continuous-review 2Bin system, as well as a proof of the optimal replenishment policy. We also present a linear programming approach to obtain the optimal threshold value for the continuous-review 2Bin system. In Section 6 we provide a numerical comparison of both models, and finally in Section 7 we summarize our findings and indicate future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

2Bin systems have been in use at hospitals since the 1980s, and kanban-type inventory systems are widely used particularly in lean manufacturing environments. Inventory models in the literature that are closest to the periodic review 2Bin systems are (nQ, r, T) replenishment policies. In such policies, every T time periods an order is placed whenever the inventory position falls to or below reorder level r. The order size is always and integer multiple of Q such that the inventory position exceeds r after ordering. This policy can be mapped to the 2Bin formulation by setting r = Q equal to the bin size capacity. Inventory systems with the (nQ, r, T) policy are first studied by Hadley and Whitin (1963). However, the authors require a fixed order cost per item and it is based on unit-level demand (assumed to be Poisson distributed). Larsen and Kiesmüller (2007) study the same single-item inventory policy using a generalized Erlang distribution.

In the hospital setting, a fixed order cost is incurred per replenishment order regardless of the number of items or number of units ordered. Therefore, our work is related to the joint inventory replenishment literature. Research on multi-item replenishment policies with stochastic demand include the work of Balintfy (1964), Renberg and Planche (1967), Atkins and Iyogun (1988), Pantumsinchai (1992), Viswanathan (1997), Rao (2003), and Özkaya, Gürler, and Berk (2006) among others. Khouja and Goyal (2008) provide a detailed discussion of these papers. More recently Mustafa Tanrikulu, Sen, and Alp (2010) consider a multi-item inventory system in which the setup costs for orders have a step-wise structure. The authors propose a new (s, Q) policy, where s = {s
                     1, s
                     2, …, sN
                     } representing a vector of reorder levels for each item in the system. Under this policy a combined replenishment order of size Q is triggered whenever the inventory of one item falls to its corresponding si
                      value. Under the (Q, S) policy proposed by Renberg and Planche (1967), whenever the combined demand of all items reaches a value Q, an order of size Q is placed to raise the inventory position of all items up to the vector S = {S
                     1, S
                     2, …, SN
                     }. The (s, Q) policy outperforms the (Q, S) when back-order costs are high and lead times are short. None of this multi-item research deals with kanban-type 2Bin inventory systems that we study in this paper.

Research that focuses on inventory replenishment policies in hospital settings includes the work of Lapierre and Ruiz (2007) who present a periodic review multi-item model to coordinate supply operations under deterministic demand. Little and Coughlan (2008) present a periodic-review constraint-based model considering capacity and service level constraints. Bijvank and Vis (2012) present two periodic-review lost sales models, either maximizing service level subject to capacity constraint, or minimizing capacity subject to service level constraint. Opolon (2010) studies the impact of inventory inaccuracies with the use of automated dispensing machines (ADMs) at hospitals and demonstrates that frequent periodic inventory counts can mitigate the impact of imperfect demand recording. Rosales, Magazine, and Rao (2014b) address the impact of ADMs on inventory replenishment practices by studying a new hybrid inventory policy and propose closed-form heuristic expressions to set parameter values for hospital settings. The impact of multi-item replenishment policies with the use of ADMs under unit-level demand is addressed by Rosales et al. (2014a). They test four new replenishment policies that are found to offer significant benefits such as reductions in the number of replenishments performed and inventory carried. With the exception of Rosales et al. (2014a); Rosales et al. (2014b) all the work mentioned follows a periodic review policy while we consider both periodic and continuous review policies.

The impact of the adoption of new technologies such as RFID on supply chain performance has received some attention. Delen, Hardgrave, and Sharda (2007) propose and evaluate performance metrics to assess the value of RFID, and address RFID data quality challenges. Lee and Özer (2007) perform an extensive review of the RFID literature in operations management and emphasize the importance of analytical modeling tools linking underlying operating characteristics to control decisions and performance measures. Gaukler, Ozer, and Hausman (2008) analyze the impact of increased supply chain visibility from the use of RFID allowing placement of emergency orders as order progress information becomes available. Zhou (2009) quantifies the benefits of RFID adoption through uncertainty reduction from a manufacturer’s perspective. A simulation study by Sari (2010) explores different operational and system environmental conditions under which RFID is more beneficial. The author considers a four-echelon supply chain under different levels of supply chain collaboration, finding that RFID is most beneficial under conditions of high supply chain collaboration, low demand uncertainty, and long lead times. The work of Sarac, Absi, and Dauzere-Peres (2010) provides a detailed discussion of supply chain research concerning RFID technology. To our knowledge, there are only two papers that study RFID technology for the management of supplies in a hospital setting. Cakici, Groenevelt, and Seidmann (2010) study the operational and economical differences between a single-item inventory system using barcode technology and one using RFID technology within a hospital setting. Landry and Beaulieu (2010) describe the use of 2Bin systems at hospitals in Europe, Asia, Canada and the United States, with several hospitals implementing RFID with 2Bin systems in Canada. Our work differs from these as we focus attention on a multi-item hospital inventory system, and provide insights into the economic benefits of the use of RFID technology to track bin consumption and replenish in continuous time. In summary, we consider the unique elements of inventory systems observed at hospitals: bin-level demand data rather than unit-level demand, batch size replenishments equal to the bin capacity and multi-item settings.

In this section we first describe the hospital environment and data collected from a facility currently using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems. Then we introduce general model assumptions that will be common to both periodic and continuous-review models that will be introduced in Sections 4 and 5 respectively.

We obtained data from a hospital currently using RFID technology in conjunction with 2Bin systems. From the data obtained the complexity of hospital supplies management is readily apparent. The hospital has many different departments, each having several storerooms. Whenever items are replenished, one order is placed for all items in one storeroom. The number of items per storeroom can vary greatly but typically ranges between 100 and 500 different items. Given the number of items and storerooms in each facility, it is critical to propose replenishment policies that are both simple and efficient.

The data obtained include bin consumption and replenishment data for all medical supplies used throughout the hospital in different nursing units. An example of the data is provided in Table 1
                      which shows that in the emergency department, Item 89017 with 36 units per bin had a primary bin appear on the replenishment board on June 27 at 8:02 pm. The replenishment of this empty bin was triggered June 28 at 7:20 am and was completed June 28 at 11:24 am. Note that the hospital data obtained do not include unit-level demand; the demand captured by the hospital is only at the bin level. Therefore, our unit of analysis is on bin level as well. For scenarios where unit-level demand is available, the online supplement provides extensions to our models that consider unit-level demand.

Another important characteristic of the system under study is the fact that hospitals using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems will typically trigger a replenishment order whenever a certain number of primary bins is empty or whenever both the primary and secondary bin of an item are empty to disrupt patient care as shortly as possible.

Next, we describe the general characteristics with the basic assumptions of the 2Bin inventory system and how the data of Table 1 can be used to set the input parameter values for the inventory system. These characteristics will be common to both periodic and continuous review models, which will be introduced in the following sections. We use N to denote the number of medical supplies or items stored in a particular storeroom using the 2Bin system. Inventory for each medical supply is divided into two equal-sized bins referred to as primary and secondary. For the remainder of the paper we use the following assumptions:

                        Assumption 1
                        Bins become empty following a Poisson process, having probability mass function p( · ), cumulative distribution function 
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    ·
                                    )
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                            and upper tail probability P( · ) with equal bin consumption rates, λ, for each item.

Although demand for medical supplies at the unit level will differ by item, we assume that the consumption rate will be the same at the bin level. This is based on the fact that in our experience hospitals often determine the number of units stored in each bin to achieve a target number of inventory turns. Therefore bins of different items may contain different numbers of units, but bins will have on average similar consumption rates. Based on the bin replenishment data records, we computed the average consumption rates of bins. Table 2
                      shows the average consumption rates for a subset of items tested in the hospital data set. It becomes apparent that bins usually have enough capacity to satisfy the demand for two weeks on average (0.003 × 24 × 14 ≈ 1 bin per 2 weeks)

In addition Assumption 1 also states that bin consumption follows a Poisson process. Our analysis of hospital data identified several items for which interarrival times for bin demand is exponential, and therefore a Poisson process can be a good fit for these items. In Table 3
                      we show the results of the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test for a subset of items tested, where large p-values indicate that the exponential distribution is a good fit for the data (Kelton and Law, 2000). When the bin consumption process is not Poisson we believe that the assumption of exponential interarrival times could be replaced by a phase-type distribution (see Asmussen, Nerman, and Olsson, 1996; Neuts, 1981) that permits an extension of the analysis in this paper.

                        Assumption 2
                        The probability that demand for a particular item during the replenishment lead time L exceeds the quantity stored in both primary and secondary bins is negligible.

Replenishment lead times are on average a few hours. Since the bin demand is on average 1 bin per 2 weeks, the probability that both primary and secondary bins of the same item are consumed during the replenishment lead time is negligible. This assumption implies that at most one bin of each item may become empty during the replenishment lead time. This means that after an order is delivered at most one bin of each item can be empty (the bin used during the lead time).

We obtain estimates for the fixed replenishment cost and the stock-out cost based on a cost analysis recently performed at the hospital under study. In order to obtain the replenishment cost, the hospital estimated the average amount of time materials management personnel spent on processing, refilling, and delivering full bins to the storage locations (i.e., storerooms). The hospital considered that most of the replenishment cost is associated with the time and effort of these activities during the replenishment process. The cost associated with retrieving specific items from the warehouse is considerably smaller and relatively constant. Therefore, it is assumed that the fixed cost of a replenishment is independent of the number of items or the number of units ordered. This means that every time a replenishment order is triggered at the storeroom, a fixed replenishment cost K is incurred.

The stock-out cost was obtained by estimating the amount of time nurses spent requesting and obtaining stock-out items. The unit-level stock-out cost must be converted in our model to a bin level stock-out cost. To obtain the stock-out cost per bin, we multiply the unit-level stock-out cost by a conversion factor. Consistent with the way we selected other parameter values, we use the median number of items stored per bin as a conversion factor. Whenever there is a bin demand while the secondary bin is empty, there is a stock-out cost ρ. Furthermore, we consider a time-weighted shortage cost 
                        
                           ρ
                           ^
                        
                      for each unit time that both bins (primary and secondary bin) are empty (see Özkaya et al., 2006). This cost allows us to penalize long-standing shortages that tend to undermine nurse satisfaction and confidence in the stock replenishment process. Cost parameter values are presented in Section 6. As previously mentioned, we capture demand and costs at the bin level. An extension of shortage cost calculations to the case where unit level demand data are available is presented in the online supplement.

The hospital did not monitor inventory holding costs at point-of-use because inventory costs were already incurred once items were purchased by the hospital and the incremental cost of holding stock at point-of-use as opposed to the central storage location was considered negligible. Nevertheless our model can be extended to consider inventory holding costs when these costs are considered relevant. Further, hospital management controlled inventory levels at point-of-use by restricting the number of units per bin; this bin-size parameter was computed exogenously based on target inventory turns and was considered a pre-specified constant in our model; optimizing bin sizes can be an area of future research.

In this section we develop a model to estimate the long-run average cost for the periodic review 2Bin system. The periodic review case provides the performance benchmark corresponding to current hospital practice. Unless otherwise noted, proofs for all expressions included in this section are available in a separate supplemental file.

We formulate the expected stock-out costs for one representative item and then scale this cost using the number of items in the system (based on Assumption 1, all bins have equal consumption rates). In order to obtain the stock-out costs for one representative item, we first need to understand how the inventory profile for this representative item changes with time. Recall that inventory status is reviewed periodically every T time units, and empty bins of all items are replenished at the review epoch. For the hospital supplying the data for our research, T = 24 hours. Fig. 1
                      illustrates an inventory profile for a representative item with one full and one empty bin at time 0. After a delivery lead time L, the order of one bin is received, and on-hand inventory and inventory position are equalized to two bins. Prior to the next periodic review epoch, one more bin is demanded, consequently when the system reaches time T another order for one bin is triggered and a renewal cycle occurs with inventory position equal to two full bins.

Based on renewal theory (Ross, 2003) we estimate the long-run average cost per unit time for the periodic 2Bin system by the average cost per unit time for one renewal cycle. Total stock-out costs include the stock-out cost per occurrence at rate ρ, and the time-weighted stock-out cost at rate 
                        
                           ρ
                           ^
                        
                     . For a representative item, stock-out costs during interval t depend on the number of non-empty bins at the beginning of the time interval, denoted by m ∈ {0, 1, 2} as there are only two bins per item. When m = 0, products may be in back-order, with incurring shortage costs at rate 
                        
                           (
                           ρ
                           +
                           
                              ρ
                              ^
                           
                           t
                           )
                        
                     . When m = 1 or 2, the total stock-out cost over interval t is denoted as C(m, t).

We use expression C(m, t) to capture expected stock-out costs for a single representative item during time interval t = L and t = T − L. To obtain an expression for C(m, t) we use x(t) to denote bin demand for a single representative item during time interval t. Note that stock-out costs will be incurred only if the secondary bin becomes empty. Therefore, any demand x(t) ≥ m will imply an empty secondary bin and potentially a stock-out. The expression for C(m, t) equals:

To scale the stock-out costs for one representative item to all N items we define the following: ηL
                      denotes the expected number of primary bins empty after replenishment lead time L. η
                     1 denotes the expected number of items with at least the primary bin consumed during the periodic review interval. η
                     2 denotes the total number of secondary bins consumed plus any additional unmet bin demand across all items, representing total stock-outs during the periodic review interval. Expressions for ηL, η
                     1, and η
                     2 are provided below.

                     Note that by Assumption 2, all the primary empty bins immediately after delivery lead time L must have been demanded during this lead time. Hence NλL represents the expected number of bins depleted during the delivery lead time.

Based on expressions (2)–(5) we provide an expression for the long run average cost per unit time for the whole system (that is, for the storeroom). This is denoted by JP
                     (T) and includes fixed order and stock-out costs for all N items. The fixed order cost is incurred when at least one item in the storeroom has an empty bin during the review interval T. Hence, the expected order costs per replenishment cycle are K(1 − p(0, λNT)). To obtain the expected shortage costs we divide T in two time intervals, one of length T − L (the length of the review period after order delivery) and one of length L (the delivery lead time). During interval L, only items with at most one empty bin at the beginning of the review interval (m = 0, 1) can incur stock-outs, since x(L) is 0 or 1 by Assumption 2. When m = 1, expected stock-out costs during L for a single item are given by C(1, L). Multiplying this by η
                     1 yields the expected stock-out cost during lead time L for all items with m = 1. For items with m = 0, there are no non-empty bins, so stock-out costs incurred over interval L are given simply by 
                        
                           (
                           ρ
                           +
                           
                              ρ
                              ^
                           
                           L
                           )
                        
                     . Multiplying this by η
                     2 yields the expected stock-out cost for all items with m = 0. Shortage costs over time interval T − L are obtained analogously by setting t = T − L. Note that m = 1, or 2 because the T − L interval starts immediately after the delivery time L (see also Assumption 2). Furthermore, note that the expected number of items where m = 1 (m = 2) after lead time L equals ηL
                      (N − ηL
                     ). As a result, the total shortage cost over T − L is

                     We code expressions (2)–(6) in C++ and by virtue of unimodality, we find T* as well as the optimal cost for the periodic 2Bin system, Jp
                     (T*), using a Golden section search (Bazaraa, Sherali, and Shetty, 2006).

Under periodic review each empty bin is replenished at the beginning of a replenishment period. By contrast, under continuous review empty bins are replenished when a certain number of items have empty primary bins or when an item has an empty primary and secondary bin, since hospital management can observe the total number of empty bins at all times. In this section, we develop a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) model to analyze such a continuous-review 2Bin system. We first define the possible SMDP states in the system; we then derive basic mathematical expressions for transition probabilities, expected transition times, and expected costs for each possible state in the system. We then use these expressions to obtain the Bellman optimality equations and propose a solution approach. All proofs for expressions found in this section are included in the online supplement unless noted otherwise.

We define the state of the system by the pair (n
                     1, n
                     2) where n
                     1 and n
                     2 denote the number of empty primary and secondary bins respectively; n
                     1 can take any value between 0 and N, while n
                     2 = 0, 1 as a secondary empty bin will always trigger a replenishment under continuous review. Note that triggering a replenishment order when a secondary bin becomes empty may not be the most economical strategy. Without this restriction, when stock-out cost is low, the optimal cost solution may allow more than one secondary bin to become empty before a replenishment order is triggered. Forcing an order to be placed with one empty secondary bin may increase costs, particularly at high values of fixed order cost K. Nevertheless we incorporate this restriction in our model given the importance of having stock available for patient care and also because this is common practice at hospitals using RFID-enabled 2Bin or 2BIN-iD systems.

This means that a new replenishment order can only be triggered after a bin demand. Each time a replenishment order is placed, all empty bins at the order placement epoch will be replenished after delivery lead time L. If no replenishment order is placed, the next system transition time is random and marked by the consumption of one more bin. When a replenishment order is placed, the next system transition time is fixed and marked by the replenishment lead time L. Note that during the replenishment lead time additional secondary bins may become empty; nevertheless, following Assumption 2, the number of secondary bins empty after delivery lead time will always be zero and therefore there is no need to track the number of empty secondary bins during the replenishment lead time.

To model the decisions at the decision epochs (i.e., after bin demand), an action set is specified. Two actions “a” ∈ {do not order, order} = {0,1} are possible. The set of possible actions in state (n
                     1, n

                      during the replenishment lead time. In addition other secondary bins may get consumed during the replenishment lead time causing additional stock-outs. Based on Assumption 2 only secondary bins of items with an empty primary bin at the order placement epoch have the potential for stock-out by depleting during the replenishment lead time. Following the same notation as in Section 4, we use x(L) to denote bin demand for one item during replenishment lead time, and express the expected additional number of secondary bins that become empty during L as n

                     In the event that a = 1 and an order is placed, all empty bins at the order placement epoch will be replenished after L time periods. After stock is replenished the system may not necessarily start in state (n
                     1, n
                     2) = (0, 0) because of the possibility of additional bins becoming empty during the replenishment lead time. By Assumption 2, if the secondary bin of an item becomes empty during replenishment lead time, the corresponding primary bin will be filled when stock is replenished and only new primary bins may be empty after replenishment lead time. After stock is replenished, n
                     1 may take any value in 0, …, N, while n
                     2 = 0. For a = 1, the transition probabilities are given by:

                     So far in this section we have described the possible states and actions for the 2Bin system under continuous review, the expected cost for each possible state-action triplet, and the transition probabilities. In order to define the Bellman optimality equations, the only element that needs to be defined is the expected transition times. For the state-action triplet (n
                     1, n
                     2, a), the expected transition times are defined by:

                     (i, j) provides the minimum over all policies of the difference between the expected cost to reach state (0, 0) starting from state (i, j) for the first time and the cost that would be incurred if the cost per stage at all states were equal to the average J

                      to denote what is commonly referred to in SMDPs as the relative or differential cost (Bertsekas, 2007). As is customary in dynamic programming formulations, the first and second terms in expressions (9)–(11) represent the differential cost and the cost to go for each possible decision a respectively. Equation (9) provides the best decision, whether to order or not, when there are no secondary empty bins; i.e., the state is characterized by (n
                     1, 0). Equation (10) states that no replenishment order is placed in the absence of empty bins; i.e., the state then is (0, 0). Finally Equation (11) states that whenever a secondary bin becomes empty an order is triggered; i.e., the state is characterized by (n
                     1, 1). The system of Equations (9)–(11), has a unique solution that is independent of the initial state if all stationary policies are unichain, i.e., the underlying Markov chain contains only one recurrent class. Furthermore, this unique solution provides the optimal average cost per unit time for the policy structure used in this paper and it characterizes the optimal actions for each state (n
                     1, n
                     2) (see Bertsekas, 2007; Feinberg, 1994).

For the remainder of this subsection we develop various properties of the continuous 2Bin model.

                        Lemma 1
                        All stationary 2Bin replenishment policies are unichain.

By Lemma 1, and results presented by Feinberg (1994) and Bertsekas (2007) we have the following result:

                        Proposition 2
                        The system of Equations (9)–(11) has a unique solution.

Having established the existence of a unique optimal average cost per unit time for the 2Bin policy, now we focus on characterizing the optimal replenishment policy for the continuous-review 2Bin system, based on Equations (9)–(11).

                        Theorem 1
                        Under system conditions specified below in expression (13), the optimal 2Bin replenishment policy is a threshold policy.

A threshold policy is defined as a policy that triggers a replenishment whenever the number of empty bins reaches or exceeds a threshold value

                     . In order to prove the optimality of a threshold policy for the 2Bin inventory replenishment system, we prove that the following relationship holds:

                     The right hand side of expression (13) denotes the expected penalty cost for a secondary bin to become empty during replenishment lead time when we place an order with only one empty primary bin. This expected penalty cost will tend to be very low for system parameters commonly found at hospitals since the replenishment lead time is relatively low compared to the bin consumption rates.

The objective function minimizes the steady-state average cost per unit time. Constraints (14)–(16) represent the balance equations stating that the long-run average number of transitions to any state (n
                        1, n
                        2) is equal to the long-run average number of transitions from state (n
                        1, n
                        2). Constraint (17) requires that the sum of the long-run fractions of decision epochs at which the system is in state (n
                        1, n
                        2) be equal to one. Non-negativity constraints are included in expression (18). The objective function of this linear program provides the value of J

                        . With 4N variables and (11N + 2) constraints, excluding non-negativity constraints, the size of this linear program increases linearly in N. Therefore, this linear program can be solved for values of N found in real settings. We solve this model using AMPL/CPLEX.

In this section we test the benefits of optimizing the periodic review interval and compare them to the additional benefits that can be obtained by implementing a continuous review policy. In addition we perform a sensitivity analysis using data provided by hospitals currently using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems in all nursing wards throughout their facilities. For the periodic review 2Bin model we implement a C++ algorithm to find the optimal review interval T* and the corresponding long-run average cost per unit time Jp
                     (T*) as described in Section 4. We also obtain the long-run average cost per unit time Jp
                     (T) for review interval T = 24 hours as a benchmark, since this is typically used at hospitals. For the continuous review 2Bin model we implement the linear program described in Section 5.1 using AMPL/CPLEX to obtain the long-run average cost per unit time J
                     
                        c
                     * and the optimal threshold value n*.

We select a base scenario choosing parameter values corresponding to median values that represent system conditions commonly found at the hospital from which data were obtained. Based on the data provided as described in Section 3, we set N = 200, λ = 0.002778 bins per hour, L = 4 hours, T = 24 hours, K = $100 and ρ = $55. The only cost parameter the hospital was unable to provide was the penalty cost per unit time 
                        
                           ρ
                           ^
                        
                     . In the absence of hospital data to obtain this parameter, we compare the value of 
                        
                           ρ
                           ^
                        
                      to the median cost of capital traditionally used in industry (Damodaran, 2012). The cost of capital is usually related to the cost of holding inventory. Stock-out cost is typically considered to be greater than inventory holding costs, therefore the median industry cost of capital provides us with a conservative estimate for 
                        
                           
                              ρ
                              ^
                           
                           =
                           0.04
                        
                      dollar per bin per hour.

In Table 4
                      we present the results for the above-mentioned median values of system parameters obtained from hospital data. In this table we also include additional scenarios with one parameter varied at a time to represent typically the 25th and 75th percentiles for each parameter. In the case of 
                        
                           ρ
                           ^
                        
                      we tested additional values 0.0 and 0.08. For the base scenario, we observe that the hospital is performing at conditions close to optimal under periodic review triggering replenishment orders every T = 24 hours, compared to T* = 28.8 hours; with ratio J(T)/J(T*) = 1.02. So using the optimal periodic review interval will not provide significant benefits. By contrast ratio J(T)/J
                     
                        c
                     * = 2.83 indicates that significant benefits can be obtained by changing from a periodic to a continuous review policy.

In general we observe that the continuous review 2Bin system significantly dominates the periodic review system for the conditions typically found at the hospital that supplied the data. Only when the per unit penalty cost (ρ) was low the cost of the periodic review policy approaches the cost of the system under continuous review. In most instances tested the cost of the optimal periodic review policy was at least two and a half times the cost under continuous review. This is significant, especially when we consider that costs provided in Table 4 represent costs per hour for one storage location only. Hospitals usually have several storage locations or supply rooms throughout their facilities. The costs obtained when scaled to a yearly basis at potentially dozens of supply rooms throughout the hospital can become significant. Based on our results the hospital can realize significant savings using the information available and allowing system conditions to trigger replenishment orders in continuous time.

From Table 4 we observe that certain parameters such as λ, ρ, and N can increase or decrease the benefits of continuous review. This is good news for hospital management, as these parameters, particularly λ and N, can be directly controlled by hospital management. It may be possible for hospital management to vary the value of λ by changing the amount of units stored per bin, while N may be changed by effectively allocating items to different supply rooms used throughout the hospital. In order to better understand the effect of these parameters on the models considered, we run additional experiments using the base scenario and testing, ceteris paribus, 30 different values of each parameter at a time, allowing us to observe the behavior of each model under different values of system parameters.


                     Fig. 2
                      illustrates the behavior of Jp
                     (T), Jp
                     (T*) and J
                     
                        c
                     * for different values of λ and N. We see that at low values of λ we obtain lower economic benefits from implementing a continuous review process, and using an optimal periodic review may provide higher benefits. Low values of λ imply more units stored per bin and lower inventory turns. If the hospital chooses to operate under periodic review and reduce costs, then more inventory should be held in each bin, reducing the number of replenishments. Nevertheless factors such as supplies’ expiration dates and inventory rotation need to be considered. By contrast our research indicates that hospitals focusing on reducing the amount of stock held in nursing wards (corresponding to moderate λ values) can obtain greater benefits by implementing continuous time tracking inventory control.

The effect of N on costs as shown in Fig. 2(b) is useful as well from a hospital standpoint; we observe that costs increase more dramatically with N when the system operates under periodic review. We also see that it is less costly to run one supply room, for example with N = 200 items, than it is to run two separate supply rooms, with N = 100 items; moreover, the difference in cost of operating two small supply rooms vs. one larger one is higher under periodic review than under continuous review. This is significant for hospitals as it is very common to have several small supply rooms throughout their facilities. Operating several small or medium-sized supply rooms can become very expensive under periodic review, even when the review interval T is optimized. Therefore hospitals seeking to improve access to medical supplies by increasing the number of supply rooms should consider using a continuous review policy. Note that in our problem setting the value of K is not significantly affected by N. Nevertheless if K changes with N, then our model can be run with additional values of K in order to obtain new insights.

For hospital management it is easier to alter parameters N and λ, while cost parameters K and ρ may be harder to change. It is therefore important to define how each inventory policy behaves at different values of cost parameters so hospitals can choose the right policy for their system conditions. Figs. 3
                      and 4 illustrate the changes in average cost for the models considered with changes in ρ and K. From Fig. 3
                      we see that the benefits of optimizing the periodic review interval versus using a continuous review policy are highly dependent on ρ. At a very low value of ρ (at ρ < 6 in Fig. 3) the benefit of using an optimal periodic review policy can be higher than the benefit of switching to a continuous inventory policy. At higher values of ρ (ρ > 55 in Fig. 3), the benefit of using an optimal periodic review interval decreases relative to the benefit of implementing a continuous review policy. Low values of ρ may be expected when materials stored in nursing wards are mostly low-cost, non-critical items. If hospitals can identify supply rooms where most items fall into this category, then these supply rooms or items can be replenished periodically with low inventory costs. By contrast supply rooms where several critical supplies are stored can benefit considerably from continuous-time replenishments, and potentially from more careful unit-level monitoring as is the case with the use of ADMs (see Rosales et al., 2014b).

From Fig. 4 it is worth noting that the benefits of using an optimal periodic review policy versus using a continuous inventory policy depend not only on the changes in K, but also on the relationship between K and ρ. For higher values of ρ continuous review always dominates periodic review, while at lower values of ρ, periodic review provides more benefits than continuous review for high K. Forcing an order to be placed when a secondary bin becomes empty makes this option less economical, particularly for high values of K/ρ, making the periodic replenishment option more economically attractive. In addition replenishments under continuous review can occur at any time, often disrupting personnel’s daily activities and therefore can be associated with higher fixed order costs (Rosales et al., 2014b). Higher fixed order costs for continuous replenishment can result in even higher K/ρ ratios, decreasing the attractiveness of the continuous replenishment option. In this paper comparisons between periodic and continuous review policies are performed assuming equal values of K. When unequal values of K need to be considered, results illustrated in Table 4 and Fig. 4 can still provide an easy way to compare the benefits of using periodic or continuous review policies under different values of K.

Although hospitals currently operating periodic review 2Bin systems may obtain significant savings by changing to a continuous review policy, many hospital managers are hesitant to operate under continuous review. Periodic review provides an easy way to schedule the replenishment of several supply rooms sequentially throughout the day, simplifying the task of scheduling and assigning responsibilities among material management workers. Allowing system conditions to trigger replenishment orders may imply the need for more complicated workforce schedules, potentially requiring the assignment of additional workers during peak demand hours. Our work provides hospital management with a quantitative tool to assess the potential benefits of using an optimal periodic review interval, or alternatively switching to a continuous review policy when demand is observed at the bin level, so more informed decisions can be made.

2Bin replenishment systems have been used at hospitals for many years because of their simplicity for managing and replenishing medical supplies in a multi-item setting. In recent years technology such as RFID has been used to enhance the 2Bin system by increasing inventory visibility. Based on our interaction with consulting company Logi-D as well as with hospitals currently using RFID enabled 2Bin systems, we have learned that although RFID technology has been implemented in many hospitals, the replenishment policy to be used and the system conditions that should trigger a replenishment are not always completely clear to hospital management. In addition many hospitals currently using RFID-enabled 2Bin systems continue to rely on traditional periodic replenishment policies when RFID technology provides the potential of replenishing materials in continuous time. In this paper we analyze the 2Bin inventory replenishment system and provide quantitative models to evaluate the cost benefit of improving system conditions by parameter optimization, choosing the best review interval for a periodic review model, or via policy improvement, changing from a periodic to a continuous review system. We present a semi-Markov decision model for continuous review and closed form cost expressions for periodic review. We also prove that under conditions we specify (

                     ), the optimal replenishment strategy for the 2Bin continuous review policy is a threshold value policy, characterized by a number of emptied primary bins in order to trigger a replenishment. We also provide a solution methodology to obtain the optimal threshold value for the 2Bin policy using a linear programming formulation.

We find that the benefits of using a continuous review policy can be substantial, typically greater than 50 percent reduction for typical hospital conditions, and discuss how hospitals should consider the type of inventory policy to be used when making system-design decisions such as the number and size of the storage areas to maintain throughout the facility. We find that periodic review policies favor the use of fewer storage areas with a higher number of items. In addition periodic replenishment favors the use of larger bins as a way to reduce fixed order costs, but this reduces stock rotation at point-of-use. Furthermore periodic review outperforms continuous review only at low values of stock-out costs. Therefore periodic review is a suitable policy for storage areas containing mainly low-cost, non-critical hospital supplies.

Future research will focus on assessing the impact of additional factors that may trigger inventory replenishment; for instance the length of time bins have remained empty may trigger a replenishment if bins are not emptied following a Poisson process. For hospitals unable to invest in new technology or simply preferring to replenish inventory periodically, alternative periodic-review policies, such as ones that place periodic orders only when a threshold number of bins are empty can be explored. Furthermore, questions such as how to optimally determine the amount of inventory to be held in each bin, whether inventory should be equally divided between both bins, and how to design a system with multiple storage locations in the facility remain to be addressed.
