                  A simple physical model consisting of a point source displaced from its center of rotation, in combination with a directivity model that includes backwards emitted energy, is considered for the problem of estimating the orientation of a directional acoustic source. Such a problem arises, for instance, in voice-commanded devices in a smart room and is usually tackled with a large or distributed microphone array. We show, however, that when the time difference of arrival is also taken into account, a small array of only two microphones is sufficiently robust against unaccounted factors such as microphone directivity variation and mild reverberation. This is shown by comparing predicted and measured values of binaural cues, and by using them and pairwise frame energies as inputs for an artificial neural network (ANN) in order to estimate source orientation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The estimation of the head orientation (source orientation) of a speaker has gained interest recently, with applications such as intelligent robots [1], voice-commanded devices in a smart room [2], control of powered wheelchairs for disabled people [3], speech acquisition in reverberant environments [4], and ultra realistic communications [5] for recording 3D sound with high accuracy.

Large microphone arrays of dozens or hundreds of units have been used in the estimation of source orientation [6–12], usually as an extension of source localization [13–17] and tracking [18–22]. Recently, binaural approaches for source localization have been explored [23–27] but without exploring the source orientation problem. In some cases, when a large array is considered [6,10], the estimation of the source orientation is based on the directivity of the source and on the intensity of the signals, although in [9] we verified that taking also time difference of arrival of microphone pairs into account led to a significant increase in the precision of the estimate.

The head orientation of human speakers in a smart-room affects the quality of the signals recorded by far-field microphones, and consequently influences the performance of the technologies deployed based on those signals [15]. With the orientation information, several multimodal advanced services can be developed, making head orientation estimation an interesting research topic.

The use of a large array may provide robustness against unaccounted contributions to signal intensity, such as microphone directivity and reverberation. In this work, however, aiming at greater practical interest, we consider an array of only two microphones and investigate the use of the binaural interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) cues for orientation estimation by means of ANNs. An overview of the approach is given in the following.

The observed variations in ITD and ILD caused by variation in the source orientation are tackled by a simple model, comprised of a point source that rotates and a microphone pair. The source directivity, which accounts for the ILD variations, has a model that includes the energy emitted backwards. As for the ITD variations, they result from the location of the point source not coinciding with its center of rotation, and are derived using basic trigonometric functions.

The modeled and the measured values agree in that using only binaural ITD or ILD cues leads to an ambiguity in the estimation of orientation. The inclusion of pairwise frame energies as inputs for the estimation procedure is effective in solving this ambiguity.

Finally, both single frame and multiframe based estimation are considered, the latter being the natural choice in the practical case of voice-commanded applications.

The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 introduce a simple radiation model for a directional source and the proposed physical models of ITD and ILD, respectively. Section 4 presents the experimental setup. Section 5 presents the results and the final conclusions are presented in Section 6.

A Roland DS-7 loudspeaker was taken as the directional acoustic source. For the sake of simplicity, we assumed that the directivity of the source is modeled by an empirical model and is given by

                     ). This model improves the basic cardioid-like emission pattern, like the one presented in [28], by including the energy irradiated backward, controlled by k. In Fig. 1
                     , the measured directivity of the source used in the experiments is compared to the model with 
                        k

                        3
                     . Additionally, the measured directivity of the source determined by processing a test signal [31,32], which is averaged over the frequency, is similar to the radiation pattern of the human head [7], which is the case of most interest in this study.

As a simple physical model, we consider a point sound source at a distance ρ from its center of rotation and with orientation θ (see Fig. 2
                     ). This has in mind a human speaker, with ρ accounting for the distance between the mouth and the neck. Also, we assume the ideal case of no reverberation and an array with identical omnidirectional microphones.

With this model, the ILD for a two-microphone array is given by

                      are the distances from the source to the microphones, and c is the speed of sound. Under the same previous conditions, the values of ITD as a function of θ are presented in Fig. 3b, for the same values of ρ as in ILD, in number of samples

                      is the sampling frequency. Note that ITD is more dependent on ρ than ILD.

As can be seen from the graphs of ILD and ITD in Fig. 3, each of them could be used to estimate the orientation θ of the source, though with an ambiguity between the intervals

                     . This issue will be examined in more detail in Section 5. For now, we note that the absence of ITD in previous works in the literature as a means to estimate source orientation is possibly due to considering a point source coinciding with its center of rotation (
                        ρ
                        =
                        0
                     ), in which case the ITD would be always constant, not varying with the source orientation.

An ANN is a massively parallel distributed structure of interconnected “neuron” elements, each one equipped with a non-linear activation function. By adjusting the weights of the connections in a training phase, the structure can be made to implement a wide range of classification functions (input–output mappings) [29]. In this study, the ANNs were simple fully connected feedforward configurations with one input unit (frame ILD or ITD) or three input units (frame ITD and pairwise frame energies, as discussed in Section 5), one hidden layer, and eight output units corresponding to the tested orientations. The networks were trained by mapping the input values to one of the outputs. The data were divided into three sets, 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for evaluation. A cross-validation was performed five times, with permutation of the original data set. Two measures were used to evaluate the performance of the ANN, the correct orientation ratio (COR), which expresses the agreement between the estimated and the true orientations, and the average orientation error (AOE), which denotes the angle mismatch between the estimated and the true orientations.

It is important to stress that the estimation algorithm does not require any a priori information about the parameters in Fig. 2. Of course, in the training phase of the ANN the correct orientation is provided to the training algorithm.

The experiments were conducted in a soundproof room 3.0 m long, 2.7 m wide, and 3.0 m high. Its reverberation time

                      was around 130 ms. The measured background noise was lower than 30 dB (A-weighted). A Roland DS-7 loudspeaker was placed on a turntable with 360° of freedom and 1 m above the floor. The distance between the rotation axis of the table and the front of the loudspeaker was 
                        ρ
                        =
                        13
                         cm
                     . The array consisted of two omnidirectional Le Son microphones separated by 
                        d
                        =
                        13.6
                         cm
                     , 1 m above the floor, and 
                        L
                        =
                        1
                         m
                      away from the loudspeaker. A device with A/D and D/A converters (Edirol FA-101) operating at 48 kHz sampling frequency was used for playback and recording.

For each of 8 loudspeaker orientations (with 45° shift between each one), a binaural impulse response (IR) was measured [31,32], downsampled to 16 kHz, and then convolved with a set of samples from the TIMIT database (two samples for each of 5 male and 5 female speakers). The TIMIT database is a corpus of read speech of American English and was designed to provide speech data for acoustic–phonetic studies [30]. Using a frame length of 256 samples, a frame shift of 128 samples, and Hamming windowing, frame ITDs were obtained from the generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function [13] and an interpolation method, for greater precision, to obtain a time-delay resolution lower than one sample as expected in the physical model of ITD. Frame ILDs were taken as the ratio of the frame energies. All processing was executed using Matlab.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 3c shows the average and standard deviation of the ILD and ITD for each orientation, measured on the simulated data. It can be seen that the ITD is more robust than the ILD in relation to factors not taken into account in our simple physical model, such as microphone directivity and reverberation. A close look at the ITD statistics strengthens the possibility of automatically discriminating each orientation using a selection mechanism. Thus, following previous works [2,9], the analysis was restricted to ANNs. Consistent with the greater robustness of the ITD, using it as input to the ANN leads to superior performance, as can be seen in Table 1
                        , where the orientation is estimated by frame. We also tested the cross-correlation feature between pairwise frames in ANN, which had an average COR of 16.0% in single frame case, which was worse than ILD, with 22.6%.

Due to the results above, in the following we restrict ourselves to the case of ITD based orientation estimation.

As can be seen in column ITD of Table 1, the angle ambiguity discussed in Section 1 contributes to lower the performance in the interval

                        . In order to resolve that ambiguity, an adequate additional clue has to be extracted from the data and fed into the ANN. Since it is readily available, we consider here the use of the pairwise frame energies (E), which can be expected to be greater when the source is facing the array (

                        ). As can be seen in the column E+ITD of Table 1, this leads to a considerable improvement in performance in the interval

In a voice command system, the entire command utterance could be used in a multiframe estimation procedure, providing a tradeoff between COR and estimation delay. A simple multiframe estimation procedure is a majority voter, which, assuming independent frame estimations would have a multiframe

                         depends on the distribution of the estimation errors. The most favorable assumption would be to consider estimation errors uniformly distributed among all incorrect orientations. A more conservative assumption, which is supported by the experimental results, is that errors are distributed uniformly between 2 incorrect orientations. In this case,

                         are close to the multiframe experimental results, which shows a great improvement over single frame estimation. In [2,9], multiframe approaches were used for estimation of the orientation of an acoustic source. Although the experimental conditions in this work were different from those works (32 microphones, real environment) which makes a comparison difficult, the trend in multiframe decision case is to generate a correct decision. In [2], considering multiframe case, COR of 92.9% was obtained, and in [9], considering multiframe case, COR higher than 99.0% was obtained.

Finally, for ITD+E, considering conditions closer to the actual conditions through simulations, an analysis considering different SNR conditions, with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and different reverberation conditions was performed. Under different

                        , the confusion matrix in Table 3
                         illustrates the multiframe performance of the proposed method considering models created with clean speech samples, and with samples with 
                           
                              SNR

                        , and tested with data in the same conditions. In the frame estimation case, there was a reduction in the performance of the system for all considered directions. However, in the multiframe case, except in the interval

                           °

                           °
                        , where poor performance was observed, the models in the 30 dB and 20 dB cases can deal quite well with clean, 30 dB, and 20 dB data.

To consider different reverberation times, the image method [33], was used to create synthetic binaural impulse responses with

                                 60
                              
                           
                           =
                           {
                           100
                            ms
                           ,
                           200
                            ms
                           ,
                           300
                            ms
                           }
                        , which were convolved with the measured binaural impulse responses. Using the previous set of RT60, averaged values

                           =
                           {

                           }
                         were obtained in the multiframe case, as presented in Table 4
                        . The test consisted in applying the model obtained for low reverberation to higher reverberation cases.

Poor performance was observed for 
                           θ
                           =
                           180
                           °
                         in 100 ms and 200 ms, and by increasing the reverberation time (300 ms) the performance in other orientations started to degrade. Worsening the environmental conditions, the performance of the multiframe case starts to degrade for the other orientations indicating that the approach is suitable to be applied in low to medium reverberation conditions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A simple physical model consisting of a point source displaced from its center of rotation was proposed for the problem of estimating the orientation of a directional acoustic source. When time difference of arrival is taken into account in the estimation, a small array of only two microphones was shown to be sufficiently robust against unaccounted factors such as microphone directivity variation and mild reverberation. This was shown by comparing predicted and measured values of binaural cues ITD and ILD, and by using them as inputs for an ANN in order to estimate source orientation. The absence of ITD in previous works, in spite of its utility, is possibly due to considering a point source coinciding with its center of rotation. Besides ITD and ILD, pairwise frame energy was also used by the ANN, in order to resolve the orientation ambiguity that either cue incurs in when using only two microphones. Using multiframe estimation, a performance evaluation showed that a correct estimation ratio of 98% is feasible for all orientations except 180°, in which case the result was higher than 86%. Under simulated environmental conditions, using multiframe estimation led to a reduction of performance, specially on 180°. The environmental noise as well as the reverberation effect cause the overlapping of the statistical distributions of the features, increasing its variances and, thus, reducing the ability of ANNs to select the correct orientation.
