                  A kind of personalized quantifier, the so-called SEVSI-induced quantifier as an acronym for Subjective Expected Value of Sample Information, is developed in this paper by introducing Bernstein polynomials of higher degree. This allows us to provide a novel solution to improve the final representation of the quantifier that generally performed poorly in our previous work, thus enhancing the quality of global approximation of functions and improving the operability of this kind of quantifier for practical use. We show some properties of the developed quantifier. We also prove the consistency of the OWA aggregation under the guidance of this type of quantifier. Finally, we experimentally show that the developed quantifier outperforms the one with the piecewise linear interpolation in many aspects of geometrical characteristics and operability. Thus it could be considered as an effective analytical tool to help handle the complex cases involving people's personalities or behavior intentions that have to be considered in decision making under uncertainty.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In natural language there are many linguistic quantifiers exemplified by terms such as more than 10, most, some, few, and about half. So far there have been several attempts to deal with this topic, notable among these are the work by Liu (2005), Liu and Han (2008), Yager (2004, 1996), and Zadeh (1983, 1965). And a detailed overview can be found in Guo (2014). This paper is a direct continuation of our previous work (Guo, 2014) in which we proposed a kind of personalized quantifier, the so-called SEVSI-induced one as an acronym for Subjective Expected Value of Sample Information, which can be associated directly with a specified decision maker (DM) and used as a tool to investigate and formalize his/her decision attitude or behavior intention. This makes us believe that it has a wide range of applications in increasingly complex situations. In particular, it may help to bring about more intuitively appealing and convincing results in decision making under uncertainty, especially in the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation under the guidance of quantifier. Noted that the quantifier was realized in Guo (2014) by the piecewise linear interpolation and represented as a piecewise linear function, of which the number of pieces depends on the number of the alternatives in the given sample. Theoretically, the more pieces of the piecewise function, the better performance of the global approximation by this interpolation. For practical applications, however, too many pieces may throw users into confusion and such piecewise functions may become difficult to handle. Besides, the smoothness of the fitted curves by this interpolation may still need improving. Hence, more efforts should be made to tackle these issues so as to further perfect this kind of quantifier.

In this paper, we develop a new type of SEVSI-induced quantifier by introducing Bernstein polynomials of higher degree, thus providing a novel solution to the unsolved problems mentioned above. The consistency of the OWA aggregation under the guidance of the developed quantifier is also addressed and proved. Our aim is to develop a kind of personalized quantifier with excellent properties and pleasing operability, so as to provide an effective analytical tool with a sound theoretical basis for practical applications in more complex situations. Since the Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier is a basis for constructing another two kinds of relative quantifiers, namely the Regular Decreasing Monotone (RDM) quantifier and the Regular UniModal (RUM) quantifier (Yager, 1996), all of the quantifiers considered in this paper are assumed to be RIM.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly recalls the OWA operator and Bernstein polynomials. In Section 3, the SEVSI-induced quantifier with Bernstein polynomials of higher degree is investigated in considerable detail. Section 4 makes use of two numerical examples to illustrate and examine the developed quantifier, followed by conclusions in Section 5.


                        Yager (1988) introduced the concept of the OWA operator that is defined as follows.

The OWA operator of dimension n is a mapping F: Rn

                         is called an OWA argument vector.

It is well known that an OWA weighting vector plays a key role in the aggregation process (Ahn, 2011, Bustincea, Fernandeza, Kolesárováb, & Mesiar, 2015). Yager (2009), Yager (2004), Yager (1996) suggested an effective approach to obtain an OWA weighting vector via the RIM quantifiers that can be denoted by a fuzzy subset Q with the following properties: 1) 
                           
                              Q

                              0
                              )
                              =
                              0
                           
                        , 2) 
                           
                              Q
                              (
                              1
                              )

                        , 3)Q(x) ≥ Q(y)if x ≥ y. These quantifiers were denoted as basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) functions in Yager (2004). Using a quantifier Q, we can obtain the OWA weights as

This is called the quantifier guided OWA aggregation (Yager, 1996).


                        Yager (1993), Yager (1988) further introduced a characterizing measure called the attitudinal character that can be used to characterize an OWA weighting vector with respect to any distinction between preferences for large or small argument values. The attitudinal character is defined as

It can be shown that AC(W) ∈ [0, 1]. Specifically, larger values of AC(W), closer to 1, are an indication of preference for larger argument values in the aggregation. While lower values of AC(W), closer to 0, are an indication of preference for smaller argument values in the aggregation. Values of AC(W) in the middle, near 0.5, can be a reflection of no preference for either large or small argument values at all. Given a connection between Eq. (2) and Eq. (4), the measure of attitudinal character can be rewritten as

5) Geometrically shape-preserving property, i.e., Bn
                        (f; x) is monotonically increasing (or convex) over [0, 1] if the function f(x) ∈ C[0, 1] does so.


                        
                           Proof
                           (a) Assume that f(x) ∈ C[0, 1] is monotonically increasing (or decreasing) over [0, 1]. We shall prove Bn
                              (f; x) does so by checking the sign of its first derivative over [0, 1].

Therefore, the use of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of higher degree, especially of degree more than 8, is not meant to be considered for practical applications.

Let's now try another type of polynomial approximation with Bernstein polynomials. From the structure of Eq. (8), our personalized quantifier can be defined by

It is clear from above that our personalized quantifier shown as Eq. (15) not only is denoted by a BUM function, but also inherits many excellent properties of Bernstein polynomials that may help enhance the performance of global approximation of the fitting functions. In fact, as the value of m increases, the fitting functions are achieving better approximation performance. More notably, this functional form, a polynomial of higher degree, is much easier to handle compared with a piecewise function with many pieces. Thus this study, as a direct continuation of our previous work, actually develops a SEVSI-induced quantifier in a relatively simple functional form with the good theoretical properties and the pleasing operability for practical use.

This section aims at illustrating and examining, by two numerical examples (adapted from (Guo, 2014)), the SEVSI-induced quantifier with Bernstein polynomials through a comparative analysis of the quantifier with the piecewise linear interpolation as presented in our previous work.


                     
                        Example 1
                        Quantifier generation. Assume there is no available quantifier for an involved DM who may show, let's say, a consistent preference or attitude towards attribute values in assessment. We then decide to generate a personalized one for him/her by our developed technique.


                     Step 1. Prepare a collection of multi-attribute sample information involving the assessments for ten prototype missiles, the specifications of which are shown in Table 1
                     . Obviously, the attribute Price (C
                     4) is a cost criterion and the others are benefit ones. This set of sample information can be regarded as a multi-attribute decision matrix with 10 alternatives and 4 criteria, denoted by

Geometrical representation of the exemplified quantifiers with Bernstein polynomials is shown in Fig. 2
                      in an effort to make these quantifiers quite understood.□

For a comparative analysis, let's look at another functional form of our personalized quantifier with the piecewise linear interpolation as presented in our previous work. Under the circumstances, this type of SEVSI-induced quantifier is defined by Guo (2014)

It is clear from above that the SEVSI-induced quantifier with the piecewise linear interpolation may sometimes suffer from some limitations mainly concerning the treatment of too many pieces, the number of which depends on the number of the alternatives in the given sample. In fact, a piecewise function with a large number of pieces may bring some confusion to users and become difficult to handle. Generally, the use of piecewise functions with pieces more than 8 is rarely considered for practical applications (Cheney, 1982). Besides, there is a need, if necessary, for significant improvement on the smoothness of the fitted curves by this interpolation. By contrast, the quantifier with Bernstein polynomials of higher degree can eliminate these limitations with better theoretical properties such as the excellent shape-preserving property and a sufficient degree of smoothness. More notably, the quantifier in this functional form has become much easier to handle either for theoretical analysis or for practical applications, as mentioned before.

It is clear from Table 2 that in terms of the idea of OWA aggregation, the OWA weighting vector W
                     (1) is an indication of preference for argument values in the middle between the large and small ones as the significant weights are dispersed as evenly as possible around the middle positions. This is clearly a reflection of neutral attitude. Similarly, the vector W
                     (2) is an indication of preference for lower argument values as more of the total weight moves to the weights at the bottom. This is clearly a reflection of pessimistic attitude. And the vector W
                     (3) is an indication of preference for higher argument values as more of the total weight moves to the top. This is clearly a reflection of optimistic attitude. Also, from Table 2 it can be seen that for the same decision information, different attitudes may lead to different assessments, which points to the necessity of considering the different attitudes of the involved DMs in increasingly complex environments.

By comparison with Tables 2 and 3, we clearly see that our personalized quantifier, either represented as Bernstein polynomials of higher degree or as piecewise linear functions, can surely produce the consistent results reflecting the decision attitudes or behavior intentions of the involved DMs in terms of what we expect. Thus our work on this research topic has been proven fruitful. By contrast, the quantifier with Bernstein polynomials of higher degree, characterized by the excellent theoretical properties and the pleasing operability, definitely outperforms the one with the piecewise linear interpolation in many aspects of geometrical characteristics and operability, and therefore it could be considered to put to practical use in many areas.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we develop a new type of SEVSI-induced quantifier with Bernstein polynomials of higher degree, thus further perfecting this kind of personalized quantifier as proposed in our previous work. The developed quantifier actually inherits many excellent properties of Bernstein polynomials, and has become much easier to handle in comparison with the one with the piecewise linear interpolation whether for theoretical analysis or for practical applications. As for the application of the SEVSI-induced quantifier in different functional forms, here is some advice from a more practical point of view: if there is only a small quantity of the alternatives in the given sample (more specifically, the number of the alternatives is less than 8) and there is no need for the smoothness of the fitted curves, the quantifier with the piecewise linear interpolation would be a good choice given its simplicity and relatively fast convergence rate in the circumstances; otherwise, the quantifier with Bernstein polynomials should be taken into account. Just because of what we did for the quantifier, it is becoming much more efficient and flexible to deal with such a complex case in which the involved DMs are allowed to have some unusual even extreme decision attitudes. Also, it may help to predict the involved DMs’ future decisions, and with good reason.
