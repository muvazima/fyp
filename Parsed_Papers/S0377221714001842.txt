                  Although splitting shipments across multiple delivery modes typically increases total shipping costs as a result of diseconomies of scale, it may offer certain benefits that can more than offset these costs. These benefits include a reduction in the probability of stockout and in the average inventory costs. We consider a single-stage inventory replenishment model that includes two delivery modes: a cheaper, less reliable mode, and another, more expensive but perfectly reliable mode. The high-reliability mode is only utilized in replenishment intervals in which the lead time of the less-reliable mode exceeds a certain value. This permits substituting the high-reliability mode for safety stock, to some degree. We characterize optimal replenishment decisions with these two modes, as well as the potential benefits of simultaneously using two delivery modes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In inventory replenishment, the three main criteria of cost, quality, and delivery reliability are of paramount importance in evaluating supplier performance, where delivery reliability is typically a function of the supplier’s lead-time performance, as noted by Minner (2003). All else being equal, lower cost shipping modes imply both longer and less reliable delivery lead-time performance. Using such suppliers therefore tends to necessitate at least an occasional use of quick-response suppliers who can fill the gaps when the low-cost supplier’s lead time is too long. Even if a single supplier is preferred for sourcing, a variety of different delivery modes are typically available to shippers, depending on the product type. That is, a wide range of package carriers and third-party logistics providers may be used to fulfill orders. Because of the uncertainty in delivery performance of different modes, it is not immediately clear which mode, or what mix of different modes, should be used when ordering from a supplier or from multiple suppliers.

This research focuses on the benefits of delivery mode diversification as a strategy to reduce inventory-related costs. We consider a system in which a “buyer” uses two different delivery modes for inventory replenishment. These modes may correspond to entirely different suppliers, or they may imply different delivery modes employed by a single supplier. In particular, we consider an inventory replenishment model where the buyer uses a continuous review 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      replenishment policy and has a constant, deterministic demand rate of 
                        
                           λ
                        
                      units per unit time. Our model assumes that the buyer does not permit shortages, and may use two different shipping modes within each inventory replenishment cycle. One of these modes comes at a low cost, but is less reliable, reflected by a stochastic delivery lead time (with a finite upper bound). In addition, a higher cost, perfectly reliable shipping mode is available if needed.

We assume that the uncertainty in the delivery time of the less reliable supply mode results to a large extent from a high utilization of this mode. Our model considers the effect that an increase in the utilization of a stressed shipping mode has on delivery performance. This is done by expressing the maximum value of the less reliable mode’s lead time as a stepwise, nondecreasing function of the order size. We can think of the less reliable supply mode as traversing an already congested route, where sending a larger quantity via this mode might require increasing the number of trucks using the route (or the frequency at which trucks utilize the route). As a result, more capacity is consumed and the expected value and variability of the travel time for the entire order quantity along the route increase. Alternatively, an increase in order quantity would also likely increase the required production time, which leads to an increase the delivery lead time for the order. For the perfectly reliable mode, we assume that it has a sufficient degree of excess capacity, and therefore, it will not be affected by the quantity ordered.

Using multiple transportation modes and making dynamic decisions for deliveries within a supply chain has become more prevalent in recent years with the ability to use information technology to obtain near real-time information on the status of orders placed with suppliers. For example, Liz Claiborne uses a product from TradeBeam that enables monitoring the status of orders placed with suppliers and expediting these orders when needed using an online tool (see Jain, Groenevelt, & Rudi (2010)). The use of multiple sourcing of supply has also been studied in the context of managing supply chain disruptions. Yu, Zeng, and Zhao (2009) discuss several practical situations in which firms have been able to mitigate the impacts of supply disruptions through the use of multiple sourcing strategies. They evaluate the impact of using single or dual sourcing strategies to manage the impacts of supply chain disruptions. Their model also assumes the presence of a less reliable and cheaper supplier (identified as a foreign supplier) and a more reliable but more expensive supplier (characterized as a local supplier). Babich, Aydin, Brunet, Keppo, and Saigal (2012) state that one of the main reasons for firms to diversify their supply base is to manage supply risk. Their work reviews the relationship among financing constraints, trade-credit loans and the number of suppliers. Dong and Tomlin (2012) mention the use of inventory, emergency sourcing, dual sourcing, demand management and process improvement as operational measures to manage disruption risk, and they study the interaction between business interruption insurance and operational measures to manage risk (specifically the use of inventory and emergency sourcing).

Our work falls within a stream of literature on multiple sourcing inventory models. Following the characterization that Minner (2003) presented in his review of multiple-supplier inventory models, we identify two main lines of research based on the assumptions regarding supplier lead times. First, we will review inventory models with n supply modes with deterministic lead times, where the general assumption is that

                     . The main focus of most of the works that employ this assumption is to define optimal replenishment policies or to define policy parameters for a specific replenishment policy. After discussing these works, we will review models that assume multiple delivery options with stochastic lead times. These models are primarily concerned with order splitting, where an order is placed at the beginning of a replenishment cycle and is split among different suppliers.

Among the studies that assume the use of supply modes with deterministic lead times, Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988) consider a model with a continuous review policy, two supply modes and random demand; their goal is to find the order quantities and reorder points for each supply mode in order to minimize total inventory costs. Later, Moinzadeh and Schmidt (1991) presented a model based on a one-for-one 
                        
                           (
                           S
                           -
                           1
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory policy with two supply options, where the decision on whether to place an order with the regular or emergency supplier depends on the age of the outstanding order. Jain et al. (2010) consider a 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      policy in which two transportation modes exist, each with a deterministic lead time and fixed plus variable shipping cost structure. After the manufacturing lead time, the buyer must decide on how much of the order to ship via each transportation mode under stochastic demand. In contrast with our model, these works assume deterministic lead times for both supply modes and allow inventory shortages.

Several past works on multiple sourcing consider a fast emergency supplier, which can be used to avoid shortages by placing an emergency order (based on some triggering condition). For example, Tagaras and Vlachos (2001) assume an emergency order is placed when the probability of stockout is high; Chiang and Gutierrez (1996) propose an ‘indifference level’ for inventory that triggers a second order; in Johansen and Thorstenson (1998), the reorder point for the emergency supplier is a function of the time until the regular order arrives. Our model is similar in spirit to these works, except that an order is placed with the ‘emergency supplier’ only when reaching a given time point in the replenishment cycle, and only if the order from the primary (cheaper) supply mode has not arrived by this time point.

Instead of using multiple supply modes, Chiang and Chiang (1996) propose an inventory model with one supplier and multiple deliveries. They assume the use of a continuous review policy with Normally distributed demand, constant lead time and a predetermined service level. In their model an order of size Q is placed at the beginning of the replenishment cycle, which is split between n deliveries with interarrival times

                      for 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                        
                     . We find a similar approach in Chiang (2001), who proposes the use of one supply mode and multiple deliveries for periodic review 
                        
                           (
                           R
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      inventory systems. In both of these papers, the cost reduction, when compared with a single delivery mode, results from a reduction in cycle stock. Unlike the previous works in the literature, we propose the use of multiple supply modes with different ordering and purchasing costs and different levels of delivery reliability. Our model does not place orders with the two supply modes at the beginning of the replenishment cycle; on the contrary, we decide whether to place a second order with the more reliable and expensive supply mode at a specific time during the replenishment cycle, only if the first order has not arrived by that time.

Past works on models that assume stochastic lead times and multiple delivery options are primarily concerned with order splitting. In order splitting, an order is placed at the beginning of the replenishment cycle, and is split among different suppliers. The main benefit of using order splitting is the reduction in the effective lead time (the time until the first order arrives), which leads to a reduction in the safety stock level required to meet a given service level. This effect was demonstrated by Sculli and Wu (1981) and Kelle and Silver (1990), when each order is split between two suppliers. Later, Pan, Ramasesh, Hayya, and Keith Ord (1991), based on order statistics, presented expressions to estimate the parameters for the distributions of the effective lead time and time between arrivals when two supply modes with identical lead-time distributions are used. As an example, they considered three lead-time distributions: Normal, Uniform, and Exponential, and observed a reduction in the mean and variance of the effective lead time, compared with the use of a single supply mode.

Most of the relevant models that assume stochastic lead times also assume 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      inventory policies, and seek the optimal order quantity, reorder point and the proportion of order splitting, as in Lau and Lau (1994) and Lau and Zhao (1993), the latter accounting for stochastic demand. These works showed that most of the savings from order splitting result from a reduction in cycle stock, which often exceeds the cost savings due to associated safety stock reduction. Ramasesh, Ord, Hayya, and Pan (1991) showed that, under the assumption of identical lead-time distributions for the different supply modes, an optimal solution is found when the order is split equally, and that the savings come from reduced holding and backordering costs. A different approach was presented by Ganeshan, Tyworth, and Guo (1999), who proposed a discounting option for the less reliable supplier, and presented exchange curves to define when it is beneficial to split the order, as well as the percentage discount necessary to make the model attractive.

Our model differs from previous literature as it considers one (cheaper, less reliable) supply mode with a stochastic lead time and another with a perfectly reliable (deterministic) lead time. This more closely reflects typical cases in which a buyer uses a primary delivery mode that is not perfectly reliable, but may place expedited orders (via, e.g., overnight shipping) when stockouts become imminent. In contrast with order splitting models, our work does not place an order with two shipping modes at the beginning of every replenishment cycle. Instead, we seek the optimal reorder point and order quantity such that the long-run expected inventory ordering, holding and purchasing costs are minimized without any shortages (i.e., with a 100% service level). Our assumption of a 100% service level is intended to approximate systems with extremely high stockout costs, and we recognize that many practical systems operate at near 100%, although they are not perfectly reliable (see Graves & Willems (2000) for a similar application of a 100% service level as an approximation to ensure model tractability). Note that a distinguishing feature of our model is reflected in the fact that we need not always place an order with the reliable delivery mode. That is, if the order from the unreliable supplier arrives sufficiently early in the cycle, we need not place an order with the reliable supply mode. In other words, we can ‘wait-and-see’ whether a second order is needed in each cycle, allowing us to incorporate specific information about the unreliable supplier’s performance in each cycle before determining whether a second order is needed.

This feature resembles the use of expediting policies, as in the work presented by Chiang (2010), who considers a single-item continuous review expedited ordering policy with stochastic demand, order quantity Q and reorder point s. In his model, if at the end of the supplier’s manufacturing time, the inventory level falls below the expedite-up-to-level R (
                        
                           R
                           <
                           s
                        
                     ), the firm requests that part of its order is expedited (via a fast transportation mode) to bring its inventory level up to R; the remainder of the order is delivered through the regular supply mode. In contrast to our model, where the decision time on whether to use the second supply mode may occur at any time during the replenishment cycle, Chiang’s model assumes that this expediting decision must be made after the order has been manufactured but before it has been shipped. In addition, the expedited order serves as a fraction of the original order, where we permit an additional order quantity above the amount that was ordered via the regular supply mode. In particular, our model sets a reorder point

                     , where

                      corresponds to an amount of time that may be less than an upper limit on the lead time of the lower cost shipping mode (assuming this lead-time distribution is bounded from above). If an order is placed at time zero, then

                      is the time at which the current on-hand inventory will reach zero, i.e., the inventory ‘run-out’ time. Suppose that at the beginning of each replenishment cycle the buyer places an order using the less reliable shipping mode. If the order has not been received by time

                      is the lead time of the perfectly reliable shipping mode, the buyer will need to place a second order with the faster, reliable shipping mode, which will be received at time

                     , thereby avoiding any shortages.

Another important attribute that differentiates our model from previous works is that we account for the impact that a variation in the utilization level of a congested supply mode has on delivery performance. We assume that the lead time of the less reliable supply mode follows a continuous distribution that is supported on a bounded interval, and that as we increase the size of the order placed with this supplier, the upper bound on its delivery time may also increase; therefore, there is a corresponding increase in the variance of the delivery time.

We are interested in the degree to which using the reliable, quick-response supply mode can reduce inventory-related costs when compared with the use of a single shipping mode. We are also interested in characterizing the circumstances and system parameter values under which the use of both supply modes is beneficial. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model description, where expressions for the cost functions are derived. Section 3 presents a numerical analysis and shows the circumstances under which our proposed model is preferable to using only a single shipping mode, and Section 4 summarizes our work and discusses future research directions.

This section first describes the costs associated with the use of a single shipping mode and then with the use of two shipping modes for inventory replenishment.

We first consider the cost of using each shipping mode independently, which will permit benchmarking the performance of the model with two delivery modes.

We consider an inventory replenishment model where a buyer uses a continuous review 
                              
                                 (
                                 Q
                                 ,
                                 r
                                 )
                              
                            policy, with constant demand rate 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           , where no order crossing is permitted. The buyer orders from a supplier with unlimited capacity who ships via a mode with a stochastic lead time, called shipping mode 1. Given that we treat time as continuous, we initially assume that this delivery lead time follows a Uniform distribution, where

                            shows a realization of the model, assuming without loss of generality that an order is placed at time zero.

Since the lead time is Uniformly distributed, the probability of an order arrival before or at time t is

We next consider the possibility that the degree of uncertainty in the delivery time of shipping mode 1 may be affected by the level of utilization of this mode. Therefore, we would like to account for the potential effect that a change in the utilization of mode 1 has on delivery performance. To approximate this effect, we define the upper limit on mode 1 lead time,

For the remainder, we will assume that the lead-time upper bound for delivery mode 1,

                           , is a step function of Q, since we believe this provides a better approximation of the effect that the order quantity has on the delivery time of a stressed supply mode. That is, a step function allows for changes at discrete quantities, as may be the case when an additional truck is required for a highly congested route or an additional production batch is required on a capacitated production line.

We next consider the cost of using a shipping mode, called mode 2, that has a deterministic lead time

                            is the constant demand rate. We recognize that a more general model would permit holding costs that depend on the variable purchase cost. However, this difference in holding cost is typically very small in practice, and the resulting model in which holding costs do not depend on purchase cost permits obtaining much more in the way of analytical results (our computational tests presented later consider the impact of holding costs that depend on variable costs, and show that this impact is quite small).

                            mode 1 should be chosen as the preferred single mode. Later we will use this expression during the computation of the average inventory cost per replenishment cycle for the dual-mode model.

We next present a model where the buyer may use two different shipping modes, implying a positive (expected) order quantity for both modes. We will then compare our proposed dual-mode model with the single-mode model and choose the one with the minimum expected cost per unit time.

Our proposed model assumes that in addition to mode 1, the buyer may place a second order that will use an expedited shipping mode, called mode 2, with deterministic lead time,

                        . In this case, in order to reduce the required safety stock, the buyer may define a different reorder point

The first three terms of (2.6), are the average annual fixed order cost, holding cost and purchasing cost of the EOQ model if we were to order

                           . The last term represents a correction factor for the average annual holding cost term to account for the fact that the order of size Q faces a stochastic lead time.

                            (from Eq. (2.5)), i.e., when mode 1 is the preferred single mode, then (2.16) will always hold. We also note that the left-hand side of (2.16) is the expected order cost in a cycle divided by the expected extra time in the cycle if an order is placed via mode 2; the left-hand side is therefore an upper bound on the fixed order cost per unit time. The right-hand side of the inequality is less than

                           , the amount by which the cost of buffering the uncertainty using mode 1 exceeds the cost of buffering the uncertainty using mode 2. Therefore, even if mode 1 is not the preferred single mode of operation, it is not unlikely for condition (2.16) to hold for a broad range of practical cases.

This section reports results of a set of numerical tests that characterize the benefits of the dual-mode model. While we show numerous cases in which the dual-mode model outperforms the better of the two single mode solutions, we also analyze how changes in model parameters affect the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model (recall that the minimum dual-mode average inventory cost equals

For our numerical analysis, we created problem instances with parameter values similar to the cost structures that can be observed in practice, and where we can demonstrate the different effects that changes in a particular parameter may have for the dual-mode model. Table 1
                      shows the base parameter values used for the numerical analysis of our proposed model.

For the fixed order cost, we assume that the fixed cost for mode 1,

                      for the dual-mode model, we perform numerical tests to evaluate how changes in key model parameters for modes 1 and 2 may affect the optimal solution of the dual-mode model and its performance relative the single-mode model. Sections 3.1–3.8 show how changes in a single parameter of interest influence the relative performance of the dual-mode model, all else being equal. Following this, in Section 3.9 we compare the results of the dual-mode model under various combinations of mode delivery lead time and variable cost.

                         while holding all other parameters equal, we increase the uncertainty of mode 1. As a result we expect to see an increase in the amount shipped via mode 2, since the dual-mode model will attempt to mitigate the impact of the increased uncertainty in

                         by using mode 2. Note also that an increase in the uncertainty in the arrival time of an order placed with supply mode 1 will increase the average inventory cost of mode 1 exclusively, as well as the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model, although it will not affect the inventory cost associated with using mode 2 exclusively.

In order to evaluate how the demand rate affects the performance of the dual-mode model we performed numerical tests where we increased the value of 
                           
                              λ
                           
                        , while holding other parameters equal.

As the demand rate increases we expect to observe an increase in the total quantity ordered through modes 1 and 2, i.e., 
                           
                              Q

                        , and an increase in the average inventory cost for the dual-mode model as well as for the single-mode model.


                        Table 5 shows the optimal solution and average inventory cost for the dual-mode model and single-mode model for increasing values of demand rate. Note that for these instances, because the demand rates used were less than the base value of 10,000, we modified the break points at which

To evaluate the effect of the holding cost per unit per unit time in the dual-mode model, we performed numerical tests where we increased the value of h and held the rest of the parameters fixed.


                        Table 6 shows the order quantities and average inventory cost for the single-mode model and the dual-mode model. We observe that when h increases, the total quantity ordered in the dual-mode model, 
                           
                              Q

                        , decreases and the average inventory cost increases. Through our numerical tests, we cannot predict the effects of the increase of h on

                        , however, as this will depend on the value of h relative to the other parameters.

Next, we wish to understand how computing the holding cost as a percentage of the item’s variable purchase cost might affect our results. To do this, we first calculated the holding cost per unit time as a percentage of the purchase cost of supply mode 1 exclusively. We then compared this to the case in which the holding cost is computed as a percentage of the value of each item, which depends on whether the item was purchased using supply mode 1 or supply mode 2, assuming a first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory policy. In order to estimate these costs, we used a simulation-based optimization model to estimate the average inventory costs per unit time for our model.


                        Table 7 shows the results for these two cases and the difference in their average inventory costs as a percentage of the average inventory cost for our dual-mode model, where the holding cost is calculated as a percentage of the purchasing cost of mode 1. As expected, the difference increases for increasing values of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        . For every instance, however, this difference is less than 0.05%, and therefore, we conclude that our assumption of a holding cost that is independent of the supply mode has little impact on the results of the model.

When the incremental fixed order cost for using shipping mode 2 in the dual-mode model increases, while holding all other parameters fixed, we expect to observe an increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model, since it is more expensive to place a second order.

Since the average inventory cost for the single-mode model is independent of the extra fixed order cost of placing a second order, as we increase

                         will decrease, making the dual-mode model less beneficial. Table 8 shows the results of our numerical tests when we increase the value of

When we increase the purchasing cost per unit for supply mode 2, and keep all other parameters fixed, we expect to observe an increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model. Tables 2–6 and Table 8 show the optimal solution for the dual-mode model and single-mode model for different values of

We observe that although it may be intuitive to conclude that as we increase

                         follows a probability distribution with some positive skew, since the unusually long cases typically lead to a skew in the distribution. Hence, based on the previous analysis, we can expect to have higher 
                           
                              %
                              CR
                           
                         values than the ones observed under the assumption of a Uniformly distributed lead time, and therefore, the dual-mode model may be more beneficial in practice.

The analysis discussed in the previous sections shows how certain parameter changes affect the benefits of the dual-mode model. This section considers how a buyer might evaluate multiple supply mode options, where a given mode implies certain costs and lead-time distribution characteristics. That is, all else being equal, we would like to know how to choose from different supply alternatives. For example, using the instances in Fig. 10
                        , we can see how the buyer might compare different deterministic supply modes that can be used as secondary sourcing, with different combinations of purchasing costs and lead times.

In Fig. 10 we observe that choosing the supply mode with the shortest lead time, while keeping the other parameters equal, will provide the biggest 
                           
                              %
                              CR
                           
                         value. However, in practice, a reduction in the lead time corresponds to an increase in the unit purchasing cost. As a result it may be more beneficial to choose a shipping mode with a longer lead time but with a reduced unit purchasing cost. Using our model and with this type of analysis, a buyer can negotiate purchasing costs based on delivery times.

Next we would like to compare different supply modes with different uncertainty levels. The curves in Fig. 11
                         represent different shipping modes with Uniformly distributed lead times, each with the same mean, but with different values of variance (where 
                           
                              Δ
                              τ
                              =
                              41
                           
                         days for the base case). This means that we will compare shipping modes with equal values for the expected arrival time, but with different values of uncertainty, 
                           
                              Δ
                              τ
                           
                        .

Although intuition suggests that the dual-mode model will be more beneficial as the uncertainty in the lead time of shipping mode 1 increases, this is not always the case. As we can observe in Fig. 11, when 
                           
                              Δ

                         we obtain the highest

                              CR
                           
                         value for the instances with the smallest values of uncertainty (
                           
                              Δ
                              τ
                              =

                         days). The reason for this is that, for these instances, when 
                           
                              Δ

                        ), and therefore, as we decrease 
                           
                              Δ
                              τ
                           
                         the average inventory cost for supply mode 2 does not change, while the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model decreases, and consequently 
                           
                              %
                              CR
                           
                         increases. Please refer to Section 3.1 for a more detailed explanation.

Next we consider the dual-mode model for different modes with Uniformly distributed lead times and equal uncertainty levels, but increasing values of the expected delivery time. This means that we are comparing shipping modes with equal values of 
                           
                              Δ

                                    L

                        , while holding all other parameters equal. Fig. 12
                         shows the results, where

                              34.5
                           
                         days for the base case.

Note that the average inventory cost of using mode 2 exclusively is independent of 
                           
                              E

                         will not change.

For the single-mode model when we use mode 1 exclusively, in order to avoid stockouts we need an order size at least as great as the reorder point, i.e.,

As our results have shown, the proposed model presents saving opportunities for the buyer who uses a single source, and it can be used in a joint manner with the supplier to achieve inventory cost reductions for the buyer and better resource allocation for the supplier.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

When allocating orders to suppliers, there is often a tradeoff between cost and delivery performance. The use of a cheaper supply mode often implies dealing with higher uncertainty levels when compared with a more expensive mode. Assuming that shortages are highly undesirable, if a cheap and less reliable delivery mode is used, it may be beneficial to consider supplementing this with a secondary supply mode that is more reliable (and therefore more expensive). This paper focused on the benefits of this dual-mode ordering strategy by modeling a buyer’s ordering decisions with two delivery mode options. Our model allowed us to characterize the benefits of the dual-mode supply strategy and compare the optimal dual-mode policy with the better of the two single-supplier solutions.

Using numerical analysis, we characterized situations under which the use of the dual-mode model is preferred over the single-mode model. We observed increasing benefits in our model for increasing values of the mean and variance of the lead time of the less reliable supply mode (assuming that supply mode 1 is used as the preferred single-mode supplier). We also observed that when the supply mode 1 lead time follows a positively skewed probability distribution, which is typically a more realistic assumption than a Uniform lead time, the percentage cost reduction due to the dual-mode operation is greater compared with the results when we assume that supply mode 1 lead time is Uniformly distributed.

Our model can be used by a manager who wants to analyze different combinations of shipping modes in order to minimize inventory costs while guaranteeing zero stockouts. Our work shows that a supplier that offers different shipping mode options with different delivery costs and reliability levels may provide additional value to potential buyers. Further research may consider different supplier pricing and incentives. For example, in order to increase the utilization of shipping modes with available capacity, a supplier might offer quantity discounts for the use of those modes, making shipping diversification more attractive for the buyer. Finally, we note that one dimension our model does not account for is the risk preference of the decision maker, effectively assuming that the buyer is risk neutral. An interesting extension of our work may include accounting for the way in which different buyer risk profiles influence the allocation of order quantities to different supply modes.

First, we analyze the average inventory cost as a function of Q and 
                        
                           β
                        
                      independently, and then we will consider the convexity condition for

                      as a joint function of Q and 
                        
                           β
                        
                     .

To analyze the average inventory cost as a function of Q we need to find the first and second derivatives of

Note that (C.1) it is not restrictive, since the order cost is typically greater than

                      and greater than the holding cost per unit during
