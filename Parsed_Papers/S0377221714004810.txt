                  Four NP-hard optimization problems on graphs are studied: The vertex separator problem, the edge separator problem, the maximum clique problem, and the maximum independent set problem. We show that the vertex separator problem is equivalent to a continuous bilinear quadratic program. This continuous formulation is compared to known continuous quadratic programming formulations for the edge separator problem, the maximum clique problem, and the maximum independent set problem. All of these formulations, when expressed as maximization problems, are shown to follow from the convexity properties of the objective function along the edges of the feasible set. An algorithm is given which exploits the continuous formulation of the vertex separator problem to quickly compute approximate separators. Computational results are given.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper concerns discrete optimization problems on graphs and their formulation as continuous quadratic programming problems. The paper initially focuses on the vertex separator problem, but later observes that the analytical techniques developed to handle this problem are also applicable to other optimization problems on graphs including the edge separator, maximum clique, and the maximum independent set problems.

Vertex separators have applications to VLSI chip design (Kernighan & Lin, 1970; Leiserson, 1980; Ullman, 1984), to finite element methods (Miller, Teng, Thurston, & Vavasis, 1998), to parallel processing (Evrendilek, 2008), to the computation of fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrix factorizations (George & Liu, 1981), and to network security.

An alternative definition of a vertex separator is sometimes used: 
                        
                           S
                        
                      is a vertex separator with respect to 
                        
                           A
                        
                      and 
                        
                           B
                        
                      if every path from 
                        
                           A
                        
                      to 
                        
                           B
                        
                      passes through a vertex in 
                        
                           S
                        
                     . This definition is helpful, since it generalizes to the notion of a wide separator, a separator in which every path from 
                        
                           A

While some authors give special treatment to wide separators (see for instance Pothen, Simon, & Liou, 1990 and references therein), it is worth noting that any method for finding vertex separators can also be used to find wide separators by simply adding edges to the graph. In particular, define an edge set

The difficulty of solving the VSP and the size of the optimal solution are strongly tied to the structure of the graph. For instance, every tree has an optimal vertex separator consisting of exactly one vertex. For planar graphs, Lipton and Tarjan showed that a separator of size 
                        
                           O
                           (

                           )
                        
                      can be found in linear time (Lipton & Tarjan, 1979). However, for general graphs (and even planar graphs), the VSP is NP-hard (Bui & Jones, 1992; Fukuyama, 2006). Hence, heuristic algorithms have been developed for obtaining approximate solutions; for example, see (Benlic & Hao, 2013; Djidjev, 2000; Evrendilek, 2008; Feige, Hajiaghayi, & Lee, 2008; Karypis & Kumar, 1995).

The equivalence between the VSP and (1.3) is in the following sense: For any solution of (1.3), there is an associated, easily constructed binary solution. Moreover, when (C1) and (C2) hold, there exists a binary solution for which the penalty term vanishes and the separation constraint is satisfied. For such a solution, an optimal separator for the VSP is given by

In some applications such as finite element methods, parallel processing, and sparse matrix factorizations, it is important to obtain an approximate solution to the VSP quickly. We show in Section 7 how the continuous formulation may be incorporated into a multilevel algorithm for finding approximate solutions in a reasonable amount of CPU time. Multilevel algorithms have recently been shown to produce fast and high quality solutions to a variety of graph problems (Hendrickson & Leland, 1995; Karypis & Kumar, 1995; Safro, Ron, & Brandt, 2006a, Safro, Ron, & Brandt, 2006b). Other options for finding approximate separators include the use of standard optimization algorithms applied to (1.3), such as the gradient projection algorithm (see Bertsekas, 1999).

In other applications where we need to solve (1.3) exactly, branch and bound techniques can be applied. For illustration, in Hager, Phan, and Zhang (2013) we develop a branch and bound algorithm for the closely related edge separator problem. The continuous formulation of the edge separator problem is the same as (1.3), but with the additional constraint 
                        
                           x
                           +
                           y
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . In Hager et al. (2013) we show that a branch and bound algorithm applied to the continuous formulation of the edge separator problem is particularly effective for sparse graphs.

As noted earlier, our continuous formulation of the VSP is in some sense an exact penalty method. In most exact penalty methods for solving binary maximization problems, the penalty function is chosen both to make the objective function convex, guaranteeing an extreme point solution (Bauer, 1958), and to force the extreme solution to be binary (Giannessi & Niccolucci, 1976; Raghavachari, 1969). Our penalty formulation differs in these two crucial aspects. In particular, if f is the objective function in (1.3):

Hence, f is neither convex nor concave, and the number of positive eigenvalues of the Hessian is equal to the number of negative eigenvalues. Nonetheless, we will show that f is convex along the directions parallel to the edges of the feasible set in (1.3). Consequently, the existence of an extreme point maximizer follows from results of Tardella (1990). Furthermore, we show that every extreme point of the constraint polyhedron in (1.3) is binary, and if (C1) and (C2) hold, then there exists a binary maximizer of (1.3) such that

The idea of exploiting convexity to obtain an extreme point solution to a continuous maximization problem has a long history. The first result of this type was due to Bauer (1958): The maximum value of a convex function over a compact, convex set is attained at an extreme point of the set. (Also see Rockafellar (1970, Thm. 32.3) and Hirsch & Hoffman (1961)). In a seminal paper, Raghavachari (1969) applied this result to the following binary linear program:

                     Since the penalized objective in (1.7) is convex, Bauer’s theorem guarantees that (1.7) has an extreme point solution. Furthermore, when 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      is sufficiently large, Raghavachari shows that the penalty term is zero, which implies that the solution is binary.

Raghavachari’s result was generalized to nonlinear binary programming problems by Giannessi and Niccolucci (1976). Lower bounds on 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      were obtained by Kalantari and Rosen (1987) and Borchardt (2007). More recently, Zhu (2003) found improved lower bounds on 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      in the case where the objective is quadratic. Alternative choices of the penalty function were considered by Lucidi and Rinaldi (2010) and Rinaldi (2009).

As noted by Murray and Ng (2007), one problem with convex formulations of discrete maximization problems is the astronomical number of local maximizers that are created by making the problem convex. When a continuous optimization algorithm is applied to these programs, the iterates typically converge to a stationary point, and hence any one of these local maxima can trap the iterates. On the other hand, since the penalty function in (1.3) is non-convex, the number of local maxima is reduced. Moreover, the program (1.3) has the property that local maximality can be determined in polynomial time as we show in Hager and Hungerford (2013), while for a general indefinite quadratic program, determining whether a stationary point is a local maximizer is NP-hard (Murty & Kabadi, 1987; Pardalos & Schnitger, 1988).

At least three other NP-hard optimization problems on graphs have been formulated as continuous quadratic programs: the edge separator problem (Hager & Krylyuk, 1999), the maximum clique problem (Abello, Butenko, Pardalos, & Resende, 2001; Motzkin & Straus, 1965), and the maximum independent set problem (Harant, 2000). As we show in Sections 4–6, the principle underlying these formulations is essentially the same as that of the vertex separator formulation (1.3). In particular, all of these formulations implicitly exploit the fact that the objective function, when expressed as a maximization, is convex along edges of the feasible set. Moreover, in each case a path can be constructed along these edge directions where the function is convex from a given optimal solution of the continuous quadratic program to another optimal solution which corresponds to an incidence vector of an optimal partition or an optimal set in the graph problem.

Recently, Povh and Rendl (2007) developed a completely positive linear programming formulation for a minimum cut problem in which 
                        
                           V
                        
                      is partitioned into three sets of given size such that the number of edges between two of these sets is minimized. The graph partitioning problem is a special case of their minimum cut problem corresponding to setting the size of one of the sets to 0. They reformulate the minimum cut problem as a linear program over the cone of completely positive matrices. Moreover, Burer (2009) shows that any mixed integer quadratic program (such as (1.2) or (1.3)) can be formulated as a completely positive linear program. While formulating a discrete problem as a completely positive program does not improve the problem’s tractability, it does provide an avenue for obtaining tractable relaxations (see for instance Povh & Rendl, 2007). A survey of copositive programming is given in Bomze (2012).

In Section 2 we give a constructive proof of the equivalence between the continuous bilinear program (1.3) and the integer program (1.2). The proof basically provides an easily implemented algorithm to transform a solution of the continuous program (1.3) into a solution of the binary vertex separator problem (1.2). As pointed out above, there are connections between our continuous formulation of the vertex separator problem and work of Tardella (1990). In particular, we show in Section 3 that the existence of a binary vertex solution for (1.3) follows from the convexity of the objective function along the edges of the constraint polyhedron. In Sections 4–6, we use the concept of edge-convexity to analyze known continuous quadratic programming formulations for the edge separator, maximum clique, and maximum independent set problems. Section 7 shows how the continuous formulation (1.3) of the VSP may be incorporated in a multilevel algorithm in order to quickly approximate an optimal separator. Computational experiments are performed to compare our algorithm with METIS (Karypis & Kumar, 1995) and a recent breakout local search algorithm due to Benlic and Hao (2013).

                           Part 2. This follows from the proof of Part 1. If a strict local maximizer is not binary, then the construction in Part 1 shows how to move to a binary point without decreasing the objective function value. Hence, a strict local maximizer must be binary.

                           Part 4. A binary solution of the relaxed problem (2.7) satisfying (2.8) is feasible in the discrete problem (2.5). Moreover, the objective function values in the relaxed problem and in the discrete problem are the same. Hence, 
                              
                                 (

                            is optimal in the discrete version (2.5) of the vertex separator problem, and a solution of the vertex separator problem is given by (2.6). This completes the proof of Part 4.□

We now explain connections between Theorem 2.1 and earlier work of Tardella (1990), which yields some deeper insights on the relationship between the discrete and continuous formulations of the vertex separator problem. In particular, we will show that Part 1 of Theorem 2.1 follows from edge convexity of the objective function of (2.7).

                     Remark. The fact that (1.3) has a binary solution may be viewed as a consequence of a more general result due to Konno (see Konno, 1976, Theorem 2.1), which gives conditions under which a general bilinear program has an extreme point solution.

In this section, we compare and contrast the formulation (1.3) with a continuous formulation of the edge separator problem given in Hager and Krylyuk (1999). Given non-negative integers

                      is minimized. The edge separator problem is NP-hard (Fukuyama, 2006).

In Hager and Krylyuk (1999), the authors demonstrate that the edge separator problem is equivalent to the continuous quadratic program

                     , and hence solves the edge separator problem.

Necessary and sufficient local optimality conditions for (4.1) and (1.3) are derived using the theory of edge-convexity in Hager and Hungerford (2013). A branch and bound algorithm for solving (4.1) exactly is given in Hager et al. (2013).

In this section, we use the tools of Sections 2 and 3 to analyze a continuous formulation of the maximum clique problem on a graph due to Motzkin and Straus (1965). A clique in a graph

                           )
                        
                      is a complete subgraph; that is, a subset of vertices

                           ∈

                     . The maximum clique problem on G is to find a clique

                      with maximum cardinality 
                        
                           |
                           C

                     . NP-hardness of the maximum clique problem is established in Karp (1972).

In Motzkin and Straus (1965), Motzkin and Straus showed that the maximum clique problem is equivalent to the following continuous quadratic program:

                     the objective function for (5.1) is concave along the edges of the constraint polyhedron. In contrast, our analysis of the vertex separator problem exploited the convexity of the objective function along the edges of the constraint polyhedron. Hence, it appears that the techniques developed in the previous sections are not applicable to the maximum clique problem. Nonetheless, we will show that these techniques are still applicable when used in a selective way. For convenience in the discussion, let us rescale

                     where k is the cardinality of a maximum clique. Note that

                           k

                      is a solution of (5.2). Thus, the solutions of (5.1) satisfying (1) and (2) correspond to binary solutions of (5.2).

Motzkin and Straus’ proof (Motzkin & Straus, 1965) of the equivalence between (5.1) and the maximum clique problem is by induction on

                     . Since then, continuous characterizations of the maximum clique problem, including non-inductive proof techniques, have been extensively studied (see, for instance Bomze, 1997; Bomze, Pelillo, & Giacomini, 1997; Gibbons, Hearn, & Pardalos, 1993; Gibbons, Hearn, Pardalos, & Ramana, 1997; Pelillo & Bomze, 1996). In order to highlight the connections between the formulations (5.1) and (2.7), we offer a direct proof of the validity of formulation (5.1) below.

                                 x

                           is a maximum clique.
                        

First, observe that for any binary feasible point

                                 )
                                 |

                           . By (2.3)

                                 Ax
                              
                            is twice the number of edges between vertices in supp 
                              
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                           . Since there is a maximum clique of size k by assumption, the optimal objective value in (5.2) is 
                              
                                 k
                                 (
                                 k
                                 -
                                 1
                                 )
                              
                           . Therefore, for any binary optimal solution of (5.2), 
                              
                                 supp
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                            is a maximum clique. This proves the second half of the theorem.

Now we will prove that (5.2) has a binary optimal solution. Let

                            as small as possible in size. We consider two cases.

As indicated in Section 1, the continuous formulation (1.3) of the vertex separator problem may be incorporated in either a branch and bound algorithm to find a best separator as in Hager et al. (2013), or in an algorithm to quickly compute an approximate vertex separator. In applications, such as sparse matrix reorderings, it is often more desirable to find an approximate separator quickly than to spend additional CPU time finding an exact solution. Therefore, the goal of this section is to incorporate (1.3) into a new algorithm for finding approximate solutions to the VSP in a reasonable amount of computation time. This balance of solution quality and running time is achieved in part through the use of a multilevel framework: the original graph G is approximated by a hierarchy of coarser graphs having successively fewer degrees of freedom, while preserving the overall structure of G. The problem is solved for the coarsest graph, and this coarse solution is propagated back up the hierarchy to obtain a solution for the original graph. Multilevel graph algorithms have recently been shown to produce fast and high quality solutions to a variety of graph problems in the literature (Hendrickson & Leland, 1995; Karypis & Kumar, 1995; Safro et al., 2006a, 2006b).

Multilevel graph algorithms consist of three phases: coarsening, solving, and uncoarsening. In the coarsening phase of our algorithm, vertices are visited one after another and each vertex is matched with an unmatched neighbor. Matched vertices are merged to form a single vertex in the coarser graph with a vertex weight equal to the sum of the weights of the matched vertices. During this coarsening process, multiple edges may arise between vertices in the coarse graph. Conceptually, these edges are combined into a single edge, which is assigned a weight equal to the sum of the weights of combined edges (edge weights are equal to one in the finest graph).

At the coarser levels of the algorithm, the edge weights are used to match vertices according to a heavy edge rule: a vertex is matched with an unmatched neighbor which has the greatest edge weight. It is believed that matching vertices in this way more carefully preserves the structure of the original graph. This coarsening phase repeats until there are fewer than 100 vertices in the graph.

Once the graph is sufficiently coarsened, the VSP is solved for the coarse graph by finding an approximate solution to the quadratic program (1.3) and taking the steps outlined in the proof of Theorem 2.1 to move to a binary solution satisfying (2.8). From this solution, a separator is obtained for the coarse graph via (1.5).

In order to exploit the bilinear structure of the quadratic program, we solve (1.3) using a modified version of a Mountain Climbing Algorithm developed by Konno (1976) for general bilinear programs. Pseudocode for this algorithm is given in Fig. 7.1
                     , where f denotes the objective function of (1.3),

                      is a vector whose ith component stores the size of the ith vertex in the coarse graph (the number of fine vertices it contains), and 
                        
                           η
                        
                      is a small positive number. Starting from an initial guess, each iteration solves two linear programs, corresponding to the cases where either

The iterates of Algorithm 7.1 typically converge to a stationary point of (1.3). In Hager and Hungerford (2013), necessary and sufficient conditions were developed for checking whether a stationary point of (1.3) is a local maximizer. However, these conditions have not been implemented in the present version of our code. Since the program (1.3) is non-concave, a stationary point is not necessarily a global optimum. Therefore, it is important that any algorithm for solving (1.3) incorporate techniques for escaping from local solutions. In the present algorithm, we escape by reducing the penalty parameter 
                        
                           γ
                        
                      in (1.3) and resolving the problem. From a graph-theoretic perspective, this amounts to relaxing the constraint that there can be no edges between 
                        
                           A
                        
                      and 
                        
                           B
                        
                     , thus encouraging the iterates to explore a larger domain.

When the solution at a coarse level is uncoarsened, a partition is obtained at the next finer level by assigning vertices to the same sets as their representatives in the coarse graph. Many multilevel algorithms employ techniques for refining this initial solution. Typically, these techniques are very discrete in nature; for example, the multilevel partitioner METIS (Karypis & Kumar, 1995) refines the solution using a variant of the Fiduccia Matheyses algorithm (Fiduccia & Mattheyses, 1982). In our algorithm, we consider two refinement types: a Fiduccia–Mattheyses heuristic, which is performed by invoking the METIS routine METIS_NodeRefine (see METIS 5.1 Karypis & Kumar, 1995), and the Mountain Climbing Algorithm applied to (1.3), which uses as its starting guess the pair of incidence vectors 
                        
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           )
                        
                      associated with the current partition. The abbreviation QP is used to refer to the algorithm which only uses the Mountain Climbing Algorithm, in both the solution and uncoarsening phases. FM refers to the algorithm in which both the coarse solution and the refinements are achieved using FM only. QP+FM refers to the algorithm where these two techniques have been combined during the solution and uncoarsening phases. At each level during the uncoarsening, refinements are repeated until no further improvement is made at the current level.

The algorithm was programmed in C++ and our experiments were run on a Dell T7500 workstation with 96gigabytes memory and Intel Xeon 5600 series processors operating at 3.47gigahertz. The graph adjacency matrix and other structures used during the coarsening process, such as node and edge maps, were stored using the LEMON Graph Library (Dezső, Jüttner, & Kovács, 2011). Computational experiments were performed on three separate test sets.

First, in order to evaluate the accuracy of the solutions obtained by our algorithm, the code was run on a set of 104 small problem instances (
                        
                           n

                     ) from the Souza-Balas benchmark set found at the following website: http://www.ic.unicamp.br/∼cid/Problem-instances/VSP.html.

The test problems are partitioned into 4 sets. The instances labeled DIMACS were taken from the DIMACS graph coloring challenge. The remaining graphs were generated from matrices in the Matrix Market by representing columns of a matrix

                      compares CPU times and separator sizes for QP and QP+FM with BLS. Observe that BLS obtains a better solution than both versions of our algorithm for 9 out of 12 problems. Separator sizes obtained by our algorithm were within 3% of those obtained by BLS for the Random Graphs, 12% in the case of G13, and 18% for the Almost Planar Graphs. Considering that QP is an algorithm based exclusively on continuous optimization techniques, these results are remarkable. The regularity in CPU times for BLS is due to a stopping criterion which forces the algorithm to terminate after approximately 2seconds. CPU times for our algorithm were longest for the Random Graphs and shortest for the Toroidal Grid Graphs, which is likely a consequence of the fact that the Random Graphs were the most dense (containing approximately 6% of the number of edges in a complete graph), while the Almost Planar and Toroidal Grid Graphs had densities of approximately 1.5% and .05%, respectively. However, CPU times for our algorithm are not optimized and should only be viewed qualitatively, due to the high cost overhead associated with the use of the LEMON Graph Library.

                      gives a performance profile comparing the separator sizes obtained by QP, FM, QP+FM, and METIS. FM corresponds to the algorithm which uses our techniques for coarsening the graph and METIS’s FM-based techniques for carrying out refinements. The METIS curve in Fig. 7.2 corresponds to the algorithm METIS_ComputeVertexSeparator, in which both the coarsening and refinement phases are handled by METIS. The plot gives the percentage P of problems for which a given algorithm obtained a separator size within a factor of

Since the top curve in a performance profile yields the best performance, it appears that QP+FM gave the best quality separators in this experiment.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have presented the first formulation of the vertex separator problem as a continuous bilinear program (1.3). The continuous formulation (1.3) uses a non-convex/non-concave penalty function which makes the objective convex in all directions parallel to the edges of the constraint polyhedron. Hence, the existence of a vertex maximizer follows from work of Tardella (1990). Furthermore, we show that if conditions (C1) and (C2) hold, then for any solution of (1.3), there is an associated, easily constructed binary maximizer which satisfies the separation condition (2.8) and which yields the incidence vectors for an optimal vertex separator through (2.6).

We have compared the vertex separator formulation to continuous quadratic formulations for the edge separator, maximum clique, and maximum independent set problems on a graph. For each problem, when formulated as a maximization, the validity of the continuous formulation is shown to be a consequence of the convexity of the objective function along the edges of the feasible set.

As seen in Section 7, the continuous program (1.3) is an effective tool for finding high quality separators when used in a multilevel context. In particular, a multilevel algorithm incorporating both continuous quadratic programming based refinements and a Fiduccia–Mattheyses refinement heuristic was shown to outperform METIS (in terms of solution quality) on a large test set of graphs with between 1000 and 5000 vertices. Other avenues for exploiting the formulation (1.3) include the use of standard optimization algorithms such as the gradient projection algorithm (see Bertsekas, 1999) if one seeks an approximate solution, or a branch and bound algorithm along the lines developed in Hager et al. (2013) if one needs an exact solution.
