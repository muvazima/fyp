               Abstract
               
                  Inspired by the matrix-based methods used in feature extraction and selection, one matrix-pattern-oriented classification framework has been designed in our previous work and demonstrated to utilize one matrix pattern itself more effectively to improve the classification performance in practice. However, this matrix-based framework neglects the prior structural information of the whole input space that is made up of all the matrix patterns. This paper aims to overcome such flaw through taking advantage of one structure learning method named Alternative Robust Local Embedding (ARLE). As a result, a new regularization term R
                     
                        gl
                      is designed, expected to simultaneously represent the globality and the locality of the whole data domain, further boosting the existing matrix-based classification method. To our knowledge, it is the first trial to introduce both the globality and the locality of the whole data space into the matrixized classifier design. In order to validate the proposed approach, the designed R
                     
                        gl
                      is applied into the previous work matrix-pattern-oriented Ho-Kashyap classifier (MatMHKS) to construct a new globalized and localized MatMHKS named GLMatMHKS. The experimental results on a broad range of data validate that GLMatMHKS not only inherits the advantages of the matrixized learning, but also uses the prior structural information more reasonably to guide the classification machine design.
