                  The aim of this paper is to present a novel monotone upstream scheme for conservation law (MUSCL) on unstructured grids. The novel edge-based MUSCL scheme is devised to construct the required values at the midpoint of cell edges in a more straightforward and effective way compared to other conventional approaches, by making better use of the geometrical property of the triangular grids. The scheme is incorporated into a two-dimensional (2D) cell-centered Godunov-type finite volume model as proposed in Hou et al. (2013a,c) to solve the shallow water equations (SWEs). The MUSCL scheme renders the model to preserve the well-balanced property and achieve high accuracy and efficiency for shallow flow simulations over uneven terrains. Furthermore, the scheme is directly applicable to all triangular grids. Application to several numerical experiments verifies the efficiency and robustness of the current new MUSCL scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Two-dimensional (2D) shallow water models based on hydrostatic pressure assumption have been used to simulate a wide range of surface environmental flows including dam- or dike-break induced flood events (Viero et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011), urban flood inundations (Hunter et al., 2007; Liang, 2010), rainfall-runoff processes (Esteves et al., 2000; Simons et al., 2014), tidal hydrodynamics and ocean tsunami hazards (Sugawara and Goto, 2012; Pelling et al., 2013), water quality and fluvial morphology (Kneis et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2006), hurricane induced storm surges (Akbar and Aliabadi, 2013), and even gravity currents (La Rocca et al., 2008), among many others. These applications may involve numerical calculation of very complex flow hydrodynamics such as shock-type flow discontinuities, transcritical flows, wetting and drying over irregular topography. A robust numerical scheme is required in order to produce accurate and stable numerical solutions for these applications.

Allowing automatic shock-capturing when computing all of the aforementioned complex flow hydrodynamics, Godunov-type finite volume schemes have been widely used to solve the shallow water equations (SWEs) over the last two to three decades (Anastasiou and Chan, 1997; Chippada et al., 1998; Yoon and Kang, 2004; Liang and Borthwick, 2009; Liang and Marche, 2009; Liang, 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Bradford and Sanders, 2002, 2005; Begnudelli and Sanders, 2006, 2007; Begnudelli et al., 2008; Sanders et al., 2010; Song et al., 2011b,a; Simons et al., 2011; Delis et al., 2008, 2011; Delis and Nikolos, 2013; Gallardo et al., 2007; George, 2010; Loukili and Soulaimani, 2007; Murillo et al., 2007; Skoula et al., 2006; Toro, 2009; Zhou et al., 2001, 2004; Murillo et al., 2006, 2008, 2009; Murillo and Garcia-Navarro, 2011; Benkhaldoun et al., 2010b,a; Zokagoa and Soulaimani, 2010; Hou et al., 2013a,c,b). For most of the applications, first-order finite volume schemes may give rise to unacceptable numerical diffusion and hence poor numerical solutions, especially for flows containing discontinuities, e.g. tsunami and dam-break waves. It is therefore necessary to develop second- or higher-order schemes to predict more accurately the shallow flows. As an effective second-order scheme, the monotone upstream scheme for conservation law (MUSCL) (van Leer, 1979) has been widely recognized and applied in solving the SWEs within the framework of finite volume Godunov-type schemes (Benkhaldoun et al., 2007; Barth and Jespersen, 1989; Hubbard, 1999; Begnudelli and Sanders, 2006, 2007; Begnudelli et al., 2008; Song et al., 2011b,a; Jawahar and Kamath, 2000; Yoon and Kang, 2004; Simões, 2011; Canestrelli et al., 2012; Hou et al., 2013c,b,a). This technique is able to substantially reduce numerical diffusion without causing unphysical oscillations, by means of linearly reconstructing the values of flow variables within a cell or at cell interfaces. The MUSCL scheme was originally developed by van Leer (1979) for uniform grids, but substantial research effort has been devoted to extend its application on unstructured grids to allow better representation of complex domain geometries for real-world applications.

Two-dimensional unstructured MUSCL schemes may be generally classified into two categories according to the way the values of flow variables are reconstructed within a cell, i.e. cell-based and edge-based MUSCL schemes, which are also referred to as monoslope and multislope MUSCL schemes, respectively (Buffard and Clain, 2010). The cell-based MUSCL schemes use unique limited gradients of variables to reconstruct the required values at edges. A number of cell-based MUSCL schemes have been derived for unstructured grids. Being the most efficient cell-based MUSCL scheme, the limited central difference scheme (LCD) has been widely reported for solving the SWEs on unstructured grids (Hubbard, 1999; Begnudelli and Sanders, 2006, 2007; Begnudelli et al., 2008; Song et al., 2011b,a). However, this scheme is known to suffer from excessive numerical diffusion (Hubbard, 1999). A more accurate scheme was developed by Barth and Jespersen (1989), which satisfied monotonicity and was adopted by Anastasiou and Chan (1997) in their shallow water flow model. As the limiting function of Barth and Jespersen (1989) is not differentiable and likely to cause numerical instabilities near to the solution regions with constant variables, the scheme fails to provide converged solution to steady state (Venkatakrishnan, 1995; Jawahar and Kamath, 2000; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2003). To resolve the convergence problem, Venkatakrishnan (1995) devised a modified limiter which was applied by Simões (2011) to simulate shallow water flows. The schemes of Barth and Jespersen (1989) and Venkatakrishnan (1995) were incorporated into the multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) by Park et al. (2010) to achieve a higher accuracy. The MLP based on Barth and Jespersen's limiting scheme was adopted in Canestrelli et al. (2012) to solve the SWEs. In spite of the increased accuracy, MLP requires a much wider stencil of cells and a more complicated solution procedure and hence is computationally more demanding. It should be noted that the above list of references covers only a small number of cell-based MUSCL schemes reported in literature and it is by no means exhaustive.

Unlike the cell-based MUSCL schemes that provide piecewise linear gradients at a cell, the edge-based MUSCL schemes compute the edge values by limiting 1D slopes at each edge of a cell (Buffard and Clain, 2010; Delis and Nikolos, 2013). They may not give linear functions at each cell to preserve the mean values in the cell under consideration (Buffard and Clain, 2010; Delis and Nikolos, 2013). However, it does not affect the accuracy of finite volume method because its kernel lies in computing the fluxes at the cell edges instead of the shape of the reconstructed functions at the cells (Buffard and Clain, 2010). The limiting procedure for edge-based MUSCL schemes is carried out in the same loop of computing the fluxes over all edges of a cell. This eliminates the need of an additional loop as required for cell-based MUSCL schemes for selecting the best limiter of all faces. Hence the number of times that the limiter is invoked is largely reduced (Aftosmis et al., 1994, 1995; Delis and Nikolos, 2013; Hou et al., 2013a). Therefore, the edge-based MUSCL schemes are computationally more efficient and have been employed broadly by model developers for solving the SWEs on unstructured grids (Audusse and Bristeau, 2005; Benkhaldoun et al., 2007, 2010b; Nikolos and Delis, 2009; Delis et al., 2011; Delis and Nikolos, 2013; Hou et al., 2013a,c; Simons et al., 2014). As a simple edge-based MUSCL approach, the minmod scheme that essentially selects the smaller slope between the two alternatives has been widely implemented in unstructured SWE models due to its simple formulation and superior numerical stability (Skoula et al., 2006; Benkhaldoun et al., 2007). However, it may sometimes lead to unacceptable numerical diffusion and gives the lowest order of accuracy among all MUSCL schemes. Delis et al. (2011) developed a more accurate scheme to compute the values at point D (the intersection of the edge under consideration and the line connecting two adjacent cell centroids, see Fig. 1
                     ). Another recent technique to evaluate flow information at D was presented in Kong et al. (2013). Since D does not always coincide with the midpoint M of the edge where fluxes are evaluated (Fig. 1), this type of techniques may result in a loss of accuracy on poorly connected grids (Buffard and Clain, 2010; Delis et al., 2011; Delis and Nikolos, 2013).

The reduced solution accuracy may be largely avoided by using extrapolated flow values at M to calculate the fluxes and the slope source terms (Delis et al., 2011; Buffard and Clain, 2010). The technique proposed in Buffard and Clain (2010) calculates the values at M by constructing the slopes from the cell center to point M based on those from the cell center to point D. But this may affect the computational efficiency of the overall edge-based MUSCL scheme, as a result of a more complex reconstruction procedure. Delis et al. (2011) used unlimited gradients to compute the required values at M and so the monotonicity is not rigorously guaranteed. To increase numerical stability, a new approach was reported by Delis and Nikolos (2013) to limit the slope along 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                    M
                                 
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      (Fig. 1). This technique prevents the potential numerical oscillations but may also lead to increased computational cost due to the necessity of involving a much wider stencil of cells on calculation. Based on the technique of Delis et al. (2011), Hou et al. (2013a) proposed a more efficient method to prevent possible local extreme when extrapolating flow variables from D to M. As demonstrated by Hou et al. (2013a), this improved scheme provides satisfactory numerical solutions for complex flows involving wetting and dying over complex terrains. However, the method is still not entirely straightforward since two steps are required to compute the values at M (firstly the values at D are computed and then they are used to extrapolate the values at M).

In this work, a novel 2D edge-based MUSCL scheme for triangular grids is presented to extrapolate the required values at M directly from the cell center. This scheme is devised to be more efficient but maintains the same or slightly higher numerical accuracy as the one reported in Hou et al. (2013a). The improved scheme is incorporated into a 2D Godunov-type cell-centered finite volume model to solve the SWEs in this work. The reconstructed values at the midpoints of the cell edges are modified by a non-negative water depth reconstruction (Hou et al., 2013c) that preserves the well-balanced solution or so-called conservation property (C-property) (Greenberg and Leroux, 1996). These reconstructed values are then employed to compute the fluxes using the Harten, Lax and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC) and to evaluate the slope source terms. The splitting point-implicit method proposed in Bussing and Murmant (1988) is adopted to discretize the friction source terms. To update the flow variables to a new time level, the two-stage explicit Runge–Kutta approach is applied (Hubbard, 1999; Song et al., 2011a). Implemented with the new MUSCL scheme, the current model is able to achieve second-order accuracy, converge to steady state and predict complex flow hydrodynamics that involves moving wet-dry fronts over uneven topography in an efficient way.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the governing equations; Section 3 presents the novel 2D edge-based MUSCL scheme and the overall shallow flow model; Section 4 validates the model by applying it to simulate several benchmark tests; and finally brief conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

The SWEs are derived from the conservation of mass and momentum by assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution. In a vector form, the conservation law of the 2D SWEs can be written as,

This section describes the numerical model for solving the SWEs within the framework of an unstructured cell-centered Godunov-type finite volume scheme. The SWEs are discretized into algebraic equations by the finite volume method. The fluxes of mass and momentum are computed by the HLLC approximate Riemann solver (Toro et al., 1994). The slope source terms are evaluated by the slope flux method as proposed in Hou et al. (2013c). The friction source terms are calculated by the splitting point-implicit method as presented in Liang and Marche (2009). The two-stage explicit Runge–Kutta approach is applied to update the flow variables to a new time level. When computing the fluxes and the slope source terms, the values at the midpoints of the cell edges are required. These values are evaluated by a novel 2D edge-based MUSCL scheme which is the main focus of this work and is presented in detail in Subsection 3.3.

The SWEs (1) can be integrated over a cell as

Since the explicit scheme is used, the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition must be satisfied to ensure solution stability. In this work, the CFL condition as proposed in Delis et al. (2011) and Delis and Nikolos (2013) is employed to estimate the time step on triangular grids:

                         is the minimum distance from the centroid to the edges of the ith triangle, CFL denotes the Courant number and CFL = 0.5 is adopted in this work for all of the simulations.

To compute the fluxes and the slope source terms, the values of the flow variables at the midpoints of the cell edges are required. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, the existing techniques to compute these values are relatively complicated on unstructured grids. For example, the technique in Hou et al. (2013a) extrapolates the values at D and then extrapolates them again from D to M. In this regard, a straightforward MUSCL scheme is highly desired to extrapolate the required values directly to the edge midpoints. This work devises such a MUSCL scheme which is incorporated into a 2D cell-centered Godunov-type finite volume model as proposed in Hou et al. (2013a,c) to solve the SWEs on unstructured grids. Using the MUSCL scheme as proposed herein, the required values can be sought in two steps: 1) values at the cell nodes are evaluated; and 2) these nodal values are used to construct the slopes which are then limited to extrapolate the values at midpoints of the cell edges.

In a cell-centered finite volume method, since the flow information is stored at the cell centroids, the nodal values can be evaluated from those at the centroids of the surrounding cells using the weighted average method. Based on inverse distance interpolation (Frink, 1991; Park et al., 2010), the values at the ith node N

In triangular cells, since the line connecting the cell centroid and the midpoint E
                           1 also passes through node N
                           1, the upstream slopes for this edge can be easily constructed from the values at the cell centroid and those at node N
                           1 that is opposite to E

Whist the new MUSCL scheme is developed on the basis of the 1D MUSCL scheme which is surely capable of preserving monotonicity for 1D problems, it is not easy to prove that the extrapolated values at the edge midpoints are not local extrema in multi-dimensional problems, due to the complex geometry and topology. The appearance of local extrema is generally recognized as violating the monotonicity. Liu (1993) proposed a local maximum principle to avoid overshoot and undershoot when constructing slopes for multi-dimensional problems. That is, the extrapolated values at edge midpoints or cell nodes must not be higher than the local maximum values and lower than the local minimum values, for example in Hubbard (1999) and Park et al. (2010). According to this idea, the extrapolated values by the new MUSCL scheme are constrained by,

                            are obtained from inverse distance interpolation, they are absolutely not new local extrema. Using this constraint, the possible new local extrema caused by Equations (15) and (17) are completely avoided in a simple way.

Comparing with the prevailing 2D edge-based MUSCL schemes, for example in Delis et al. (2011), Buffard and Clain (2010), Delis and Nikolos (2013) and Hou et al. (2013a), the current MUSCL scheme provides a direct and simple way for calculating the required values at the midpoints of the cell edges. To be more specific, the new scheme demands less storage since it involves directly nodal values while other schemes commonly use the gradients at cells; the number of nodes is typically much less than the number of cells (1/2 in general). Moreover, the new scheme takes the advantage of the geometry of the triangular cells, i.e. slopes are constructed along the line passing through the midpoint of the edge under consideration, the cell centroid and a node where the values are easy to obtain or already available. This therefore represents a more efficient scheme. In addition, the new scheme is straightforward to extend to solve 3D problems by utilising tetrahedron grids. In a tetrahedron cell, the required values at face centers can be extrapolated from the cell center in a similar way, using nodal values computed from Equation (11) to construct the upstream and downstream slopes. Obviously, the current MUSCL scheme is developed in a general way and thus is not restricted to solve only the SWEs. It can also be applied to solve other hyperbolic equations that are widely used in environmental modeling, e.g. the advection–diffusion equations (Rubio et al., 2008; Ani et al., 2009; Gomez and Tchijov, 2010; Liang et al., 2010; Kong et al., 2013; Kourakos and Harter, 2014).

                            are then employed to evaluate the fluxes and the slope source terms in the following subsections. It should be noted that spurious velocities with local extreme values is likely to be calculated with the MUSCL scheme when using the conserved flow variables for a case involves rapidly changing small water depth over rough terrains (Hou et al., 2013b). Those problematic cells are normally located near the wet-dry fronts. In order to prevent the potential numerical instabilities, the MUSCL scheme is disabled at these cells and first-order scheme is used instead. That is, the values at the midpoint of the edges are assumed the same as those at the cell centroid. The problematic cells are identified according to the criteria as presented in Hou et al. (2013b). In addition, first-order scheme is also imposed at those dry cells that are adjacent to a wet cell. Other dry cells away from the wet-dry front are not taken into account during the computation. As a summary, the second-order MUSCL scheme is switched to first-order locally in a cell satisfying the following conditions

To preserve non-negative water depth and C-property, the non-negative water depth reconstruction as proposed by Audusse et al. (2004) is adopted in this work. Using this reconstruction, the water depths at the midpoint of the edge under consideration are reconstructed by,

                         are evaluated from Equation (20). These reconstructed edge values of the flow variables are then employed to compute the interface fluxes and the slope source terms.

The HLLC approximate Riemann solver developed by Toro et al. (1994) is applied in this work to compute the interface fluxes (F

The detailed implementation of the HLLC approximate Riemann solver on unstructured grids can be found in (Song et al., 2011a; Hou et al., 2013c).

The slope flux method presented in (Hou et al., 2013c), suitable for unstructured grids, is adopted to evaluate the slope source terms S

                         is the outward normal vector of the edge of interest.

With respect to the friction source terms, a prevalent method known as splitting point-implicit method proposed in Bussing and Murmant (1988) is adopted. Moreover, in order to prevent the reverse flow direction caused by unrealistic friction, a limiting step introduced by Liang and Marche (2009) is taken into account. The more complete description of this method for 2D schemes can be found in Hou et al. (2013c, b).

The theory of characteristics is considered to be adequate to estimate the unknown variables at boundaries when solving the SWEs. Based on the flow variables at the boundaries, the interface fluxes through cell edges defining the physical boundaries can be directly computed. In this work, the detailed boundary treatment is demonstrated at a boundary edge e as shown in Fig. 4
                        . At first, the values of flow variables on the inner side of the midpoint M are computed from those at the two adjacent nodes N

In this section, seven test cases are simulated to evaluate the performance of the novel MUSCL scheme that has been incorporated into a 2D shallow flow model, roughly following a general evaluation procedure as suggested by Bennett et al. (2013). The first step is to have a clear idea of the aim and scale of the new scheme. The aim is essentially to improve the performance of the shallow water flow model in converging to the general steady state, capturing shocks, maintaining higher-order solution accuracy and handling complex flows with wet-dry fronts over uneven beds on triangular grids. With regard to the scale, the model is valid for the shallow water problems in a wide range of scales, as long as they satisfy the long wave assumption (Hinkelmann, 2005). The second step of the performance evaluation is to check the data. The test cases selected in this work have sufficient data to carry out the performance evaluation. Since the model is physically based, the only empirical parameter as required is the Manning coefficient which is either given or assumed according to the bed materials; no calibration is necessary for all of the test cases as considered in this work. The next two steps are to assess the model performance through visual analysis that applies to all of the test cases and solution accuracy assessment that is only considered in those test cases with analytical solutions or measurements. In this work, the root mean square error is selected as the performance criteria to investigate the accuracy of the model. On unstructured grids, the volume weighted root mean square error (RMSE) (Sun and Takayama, 2003) and volume weighted relative root mean square error (RRMSE) are used, which are respectively formulated as,

If the performance of the model is not satisfactory for a test case, a refinement step will be invoked to prescribe new Manning coefficients according to the flow patterns. By this means, the performance of the new MUSCL scheme based 2D shallow flow model is intensively evaluated through the following test cases.

Theoretically, a well-balanced scheme is defined to be able to preserve a general moving steady state (Greenberg and Leroux, 1996; Vazquez-Cendon, 1999; Parés and Castro, 2004; Gallardo et al., 2007). But it is common to consider a numerical scheme to be well-balanced even if it only satisfies the C-property of Bermudez and Vazquez (1994), i.e. when the quiescent steady states are preserved (Rebollo et al., 2003; Audusse and Bristeau, 2005; Audusse et al., 2004; Ern et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008; Delis et al., 2008; Delis and Nikolos, 2013; Nikolos and Delis, 2009; Delis et al., 2011; Liang and Marche, 2009; Liang, 2010; Song et al., 2011b,a; Benkhaldoun et al., 2007, 2010b; Zhou et al., 2001; Xing et al., 2010; Xing and Shu, 2011; Canestrelli et al., 2012, 2010; Pu et al., 2012; Caleffi and Valiani, 2009; Caleffi, 2011). In order to confirm the capability of the present model to converge to a non-stationary steady state (steady flow with non-zero velocities), the steady test case presented in Ricchiuto et al. (2007) and used in Delis et al. (2011) and Delis and Nikolos (2013) is considered in this work.

In this test case, Ricchiuto et al. (2007) consider a solution in which the velocity field is divergence-free and obtained from the harmonic function ψ

The current model and the one reported in (Hou et al., 2013a) are run with Δt
                        =0.005 s for 6000 iterations on the four different types of commonly used triangular grids with respectively 4066, 5000, 5000 and 4316 cells. These grids are known as the Delaunay grid (type A), Scottish grid (type B), diagonal grid (type C) and distorted grid (type D), respectively (Buffard and Clain, 2010) (Fig. 6
                        ). The trend of convergence is reflected by a global relative error R(h) evaluated by Equation (35). The steady state is assumed to be reached when R(h)<1×10−8. As shown in Fig. 7
                        , the new MUSCL scheme can achieve the steady state as defined on all grids and its converging rate is faster than that of the MUSCL scheme of Hou et al. (2013a). In contrast, the previous MUSCL scheme fails to converge on the Scottish grid and the distorted grid, as it is likely to extrapolate improper values at edge midpoints for such a steady case on the grids with distortions and special arrangements of the triangles.

The contours of computed water depth and velocity field on Delaunay grid at t
                        =25 s are respectively presented in Figs. 8 and 9
                        
                        , which are shown to agree closely with the exact solutions. Table 1
                         compares the relative computational time (with the computational time induced by the new MUSCL scheme on type A grid used as a reference) and the RRMSE of the water depth and unit width discharges computed by the two MUSCL schemes on the four grids. The new MUSCL scheme consistently produces favorable results and is able to save around 5% of computational time comparing with the Hou et al. (2013a) scheme.

This analytical problem was used as a 2D frictional steady state test case in Murillo et al. (2007) and Delis et al. (2011). It is revisited herein to demonstrate the capability of the new MUSCL scheme converging to a steady state with friction effect. When q

In this work, a 10 m×10 m computational domain with the origin defined at the bottom left corner is adopted and the four lateral boundaries are open. Constant q

                           y
                         of 0.1 m2
                        s−1 are specified over the whole domain. A high Manning coefficient n
                        =0.3 m−1/3 s is used to account for the friction effect. As in Murillo et al. (2007) and Delis et al. (2011), the initial conditions are set to be a flow at rest with water level η = 0.0m. The current MUSCL scheme and the one proposed in Hou et al. (2013a) are run with Δt
                        =0.002 s for 10,000 iterations on the four types of commonly used triangular grids with respectively 4024, 5000, 5000 and 4403 cells. The steady state is assumed to be achieved if R(h)<1×10−8. Fig. 10
                         compares the behaviors of the two schemes in terms of convergence rate. The comparison confirms the similar conclusions as in last test case, i.e. the new MUSCL scheme has a higher convergence rate than the MUSCL scheme of Hou et al. (2013a) and is able to reach the defined steady state on all types of grids. The MUSCL scheme of Hou et al. (2013a) is unable to converge on the Scottish grid and the distorted grid, since the scheme fails to extrapolate the right values at the edge midpoints on such grids with distortions and special arrangements of the triangles. In another words, the MUSCL scheme of Hou et al. (2013a) does not meet the generalized well-balanced conditions on the Scottish grid and distorted grid for this test case and this disadvantage is overcome by the new MUSCL scheme.

                        =20 s by the new MUSCL scheme on the Delaunay grid with exact solutions. Good agreement between the numerical and analytical solutions is observed. Table 2
                         compares the RRMSE computed for the water depth and unit width discharges by the two MUSCL schemes on different grids and demonstrates that the new MUSCL scheme can generally produce better results on all grids. Meanwhile, the new MUSCL scheme is again about 5% more efficient than the original approach as concluded by examining the computational times.

As proposed in (Canestrelli et al., 2010), a cylindrical tank of 20 m in diameter is located in the center of the 50 m×50 m domain with four open boundaries. The tank and the remaining domain are initially filled with 2 m and 0.5 m of still water, respectively. The tank wall is assumed to be removed instantaneously to produce a 2D circular dam-break wave. This process is simulated herein to test the automatic shock-capturing capability of the current model. Again simulations are carried out using the current model and the one presented in Hou et al. (2013a) on four different grids, i.e. the Delaunay grid, Scottish grid, diagonal grid and distorted grid, with respectively 16,024, 16,000, 16,000 and 16,384 cells. Since this is a symmetric test, the 1D solution obtained by the 1D PRICE-C scheme in (Canestrelli et al., 2009) is adopted as a reference to be compared with the 2D numerical solutions.


                        Fig. 13
                         shows the 3D view of the computed water level at t
                        =1.0 s and t
                        =2.5 s on the Delaunay grid. Fig. 14
                         plots the corresponding water levels along the radial direction of y
                        =20 m at t
                        =1.0 s and t
                        =2.5 s. It is apparent that the new MUSCL scheme produces more accurate numerical solution than the first-order upwind scheme (FOU) without inducing spurious oscillations. The new 2D results agree satisfactorily with the 1D reference solutions, demonstrating the capability of the model in resolving 2D shocks. The current numerical solutions also compared well with those presented by Canestrelli et al. (2009) where a 2D unstructured high-order scheme is used and those obtained using the MUSCL scheme as reported in Hou et al. (2013a). A quantitative comparison between the two MUSCL schemes is carried out in Table 3
                         where low RRMSE is observed for the two MUSCL schemes. It indicates that the two schemes actually perform equally well in resolving shocks. However, slight lower RRMSE is observed for the new MUSCL scheme especially on the grids of type B and type D. In terms of computational efficiency, the new MUSCL scheme requires approximately 5% less runtime on all grids, comparing with the MUSCL scheme of Hou et al. (2013a).

Numerical diffusion can still be observed for these MUSCL schemes near the shocks as the solution accuracy is locally switched to become first order to preserve monotonicity (Hirsch, 2007). The shocks can be captured more precisely by refining the grid as shown in Fig. 15
                        , where a Delaunay grid with 49,726 cells is used.


                        Guinot (2003) presented a test case involving a 2D Riemann problem that has been subsequently adopted by other researchers, for example Delis and Nikolos (2013), to test their model's capability in solving complex 2D Riemann problems on unstructured grids. This test case has a 200 m × 200 m frictionless computational domain with [0, 0] defined at the bottom left corner. The Riemann problem is created by imposing discontinuous initial flow conditions as listed in Table 4
                        . The existing (Hou et al., 2013a) and the new MUSCL scheme based models are used to reproduce the complex 2D flow pattern on the aforementioned unstructured girds with 68,712, 80,000, 80,000 and 78,622 cells, respectively. For further comparison, a FOU model is also used in the simulations.


                        Fig. 16
                         illustrates the propagation of waves computed by the new MUSCL scheme on the Delaunay grid. The shock wave fronts are well captured by the new MUSCL scheme. The water depth contours and vector fields of the flow velocities on the Delaunay grid are compared respectively in Figs. 17 and 18
                        
                        . Fig. 19
                         plots the predicted water level across a diagonal section through [0, 0] and [200, 200]. The figures show the computed results of the new MUSCL scheme and that of Hou et al. (2013a) are less diffusive than those obtained from the FOU on different grids. The results of the MUSCL scheme are also observed to be consistent with those reported in Guinot (2003) and Delis and Nikolos (2013). As analytical solution is not available for this test case, further quantitative analysis is not carried out. However, as shown in Fig. 19, particularly in the zoom-in views, the new MUSCL scheme is found to perform slightly better in capturing steeper rarefaction waves. Rarefaction waves are likely to be dampened by low-order schemes, according to the theoretic and numerical analysis reported in Trangenstein (2009) and Toro (2009). From this point of view, the new MUSCL scheme is preferable in modeling shock problems on unstructured grids. The same behavior can also be found on the other three grids. In addition, the new MUSCL scheme could be 4.7%, 5.6%, 5.3% and 6.1% computationally more efficient than the scheme of Hou et al. (2013a) on the four unstructured girds, respectively, further indicating the superiority of the new MUSCL scheme.

The theoretical test case developed in Thacker (1981) is applied herein to demonstrate the accuracy of the present model and its capability in tracking unsteady wet-dry fronts over uneven bed. The planar motion is oscillatory with a small enough amplitude that satisfies the long wave assumption. As the bottom friction is not taken into account, no energy dissipation is involved. This test case has been adopted by many researchers to validate their shallow flow models, for example in Marche et al. (2007), Delis et al. (2008), Ricchiutoa and Bollermann (2009), Song et al. (2011a), Delis and Nikolos (2013) and Hou et al. (2013c). The 2D frictionless parabolic bed topography is defined by

The aforementioned triangular grids of different resolution are again used to test the performance of the new MUSCL scheme (Fig. 6). Simulations are also undertaken using the Hou et al. (2013a) MUSCL scheme for comparison. All of the simulations are run for four rotation periods (4T).

                         is the averaged cell area. The results demonstrate that the grid convergence rate (order of accuracy) of the new MUSCL scheme is slightly higher than that the existing MUSCL scheme (Hou et al., 2013a), especially on the Scottish grids and the distorted grids. On average, the order of accuracy of the new MUSCL scheme is a range of 1.7–1.75 while that of the existing scheme (Hou et al., 2013a) is between 1.65 and 1.7 for this test. A similar order of accuracy in terms of L
                        1 errors is also obtained but not presented herein to save space. As expected, the order of accuracy is predicted to be close to but slightly lower than second-order due to the first-order treatment at the wet-dry front; this is a common numerical phenomenon also reported by many other researchers (Bunya et al., 2009; Ricchiuto and A.Bollermann, 2009; Nikolos and Delis, 2009; Delis et al., 2011; Delis and Nikolos, 2013; Hou et al., 2013c). Nevertheless, the solution accuracy is satisfactory for this problem as shown in Fig. 24
                        , which plots the water level and velocities along the cross- section of y = 2.0 m at t = 2.11T when the water sloshes at the right hand side, predicted by the present model on the Delaunay grid with 16,000 cells. Good agreement with the analytical water level is observed and the wet-dry fronts are well captured without presenting any numerical instability such as negative water depths. For the velocities, only small discrepancies are detected near the wet-dry fronts where the water depth becomes very small. The similar velocity pattern can also be found for example in Delis et al. (2011). During the simulation, this perturbation does not increase with time and does not affect the predictions of the wet-dry fronts.

In addition, the time history of RMSE of the computed water depth on the Delaunay grid is illustrated in Fig. 25
                        . It indicates again that the new MUSCL scheme performs more favorably against the existing scheme proposed by Hou et al. (2013a). In terms of computational efficiency, the new scheme also consistently performs better and is around 5%–7% more efficient than the existing scheme in all simulations.

This laboratory test consists of an upstream reservoir filled with 0.111 m of still water and a bump located downstream of the dam (Fig. 26
                        ). It is a benchmark test recommended by the EU IMPACT project (IMPACT, 2004) for validating shallow water models in simulating flows with moving wet-dry interface over uneven bed (Hou et al., 2013c, b). The detailed experimental setup and measured data are available in (Soares-Frazão, 2007). In this work, a Delaunay grid with 3960 triangular cells is generated on the 5.6 m  ×  0.5 m computational domain with four closed boundaries. Manning coefficient is chosen to be 0.011 m−1/3 s as suggested by Soares-Frazão (2007). The simulation is run until t
                        =45 s.


                        Fig. 27
                         plots the computed time histories of water level recorded at the three gauges situated along the centerline of the domain at x
                        =5.575 m, x
                        =4.925 m and x
                        =3.935 m (Fig. 26). Fig. 28
                         shows the computed and measured water levels around the bump. The numerical predictions agree well with the measured data and no numerical instability is detected throughout the simulation. To quantitatively assess the performance of the model, the RRMSE of the water level evolution at the three gauges is computed and the values are 5.494%, 8.467% and 7.623%, respectively. For the water level near the bump, the RRMSE(η) is evaluated to be 16.813%, 10.146% and 8.842% at t
                        =1.8 s, t
                        =3.0 s and t
                        =8.4 s, respectively. It is verified that the present model with the new MUSCL scheme is acceptable in simulating shallow flows over uneven dry beds on unstructured grids. It should be noted that the computed water level on the right hand side of the bump at t
                        =1.8 s does not fit well with the measurement (Fig. 28a) and the RRMSE(η) is about 16.813%. The reason might be because the fully 3D flow features induced by dam-break wave overtopping the bump cannot be accurately captured by a depth-averaged model assuming hydrostatic pressure. Similar predictions can also be found for example in (Hou et al., 2013b). The phenomenon may be also sensitive to bed friction. This is confirmed by the better results, as shown in Fig. 29
                         and the RRMSE(η) of 8.875%, obtained from a further simulation with a reduced Manning coefficient of 0.009 m−1/3 s to allow more water overtopping the bump.

Okushiri island, Japan, was attacked by an earthquake generated tsunami in the Japan Sea in 1993, with a maximum runup of more than 30 m observed at Monai. Following this tsunami event, the Research Institute for Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) in Abiko, Japan constructed a 1: 400 laboratory model of the area around Monai valley at Okushiri island (Fig. 30
                        ) and performed experiments to reproduce the event (Matsuyama and Tanaka, 2001; Liu et al., 2008). This experimental test is considered in this work to verify the capability of the present model with the new MUSCL scheme of simulating long wave propagation onto a complex beach.

The domain and the associated bathymetry used in the experiment are sketched in Fig. 31
                        . The incident tsunami wave created by wave paddles entered the domain with still water through the left open boundary. The full dataset of this test can be downloaded from the website of the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (Benchmark Methods for Tsunami Model Validation and Verification, 2007). A Delaunay grid consisting of 34,409 triangular cells is used to discretize the problem domain and a constant Manning coefficient of 0.001 m−1/3 s is assumed as suggested by other researchers (Popinet, 2011; Funke et al., 2011). Since the measured data for the incoming wave only last for 22.5 s, the simulation is therefore run for t
                        =25 s.


                        Fig. 33
                        
                         plots the 3D view of the computed tsunami wave at t = 10 s, 14 s and18 s to show the resulting wave propagation. The computed water levels at three gauges (G5, G6 and G7), located at [4.521 m, 1.196 m], [4.521 m, 1.696 m] and [4.521 m, 2.196 m], are compared with the measured data in Fig. 32. In the first 10 s, the water levels cannot be accurately modeled due to existence of initial water disturbances in the wave tank (Zhang and Baptista, 2008; Delis et al., 2008; Nicolsky et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the present model is observed to satisfactorily predict the amplitude and phase of the first wave at all gauges. RRMSE(h) is evaluated at the three gauges and the values are 15.991%, 13.715% and 12.951%, respectively. The current numerical results also compare favorably with those reproduced by other unstructured grid based finite volume models, for example in Zhang and Baptista (2008), Cui et al. (2010) and Funke et al. (2011), although a coarser grid is used in the current work. The predicted moving wet-dry interface is also compared with the video records produced by an overhead camera at the frame of 25, 55 and 85 (around t = 15.9 s, 16.9 s and17.9 s), as shown in Fig. 34
                        . Generally good agreement is observed. Furthermore, the maximum runup height is computed to be about 0.083 m, as shown in Fig. 34b at the model scale, which corresponds to 33.2 m at the prototype scale and so agrees well with the field observation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, a new 2D edge-based MUSCL scheme has been developed on triangular grids to reconstruct the required values at the midpoints of the cell edges in a direct and easy way, by constructing the slopes of variables along the medians of a triangular cell. The new scheme was incorporated into a Godunov-type cell-centered finite volume model as proposed in Hou et al. (2013a,c,b) for solving the SWEs.

Extensive numerical experiments suggest that the SWE model implemented with the novel MUSCL scheme is able to converge to steady state, capture shocks and handle complex shallow flows involving wetting and drying over complex beds. Comparing with the existing approach recently reported in Hou et al. (2013a), the current MUSCL scheme has a slightly higher accuracy for general shallow flow solutions, and offers a better well-balanced property indicated by a faster convergent rate to steady solutions on different triangular girds. Furthermore, the novel MUSCL scheme is able to save around 5% of the computational time comparing with the previous model presented by Hou et al. (2013a). The new scheme is also flexible and easy to be implemented on all triangular grids. As a summary, due to its better solution accuracy, higher computational efficiency and simplicity, the proposed MUSCL scheme provides a favorable alternative to the existing approaches for solving the SWEs. It can also be directly extended to solve other hyperbolic equations, e.g. the advection–diffusion equation which is widely used in environmental flow simulations. In addition, the scheme, presented here for the 2D triangular grids, can be easily generalized into 3D tetrahedron grids for solving the 3D problems.
