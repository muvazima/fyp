                  We consider a production/clearing process in a random environment where a single machine produces a certain product into a buffer continuously. The demands arrive according to a Markov Additive Process (MAP) governed by a continuous-time Markov chain, and their sizes are independent and have phase-type distributions depending on the type of arrival. Since negative inventory is not allowed, the demand may be partially satisfied. The production process switches between predetermined rates that depend on the state of the environment. In addition, the system is totally cleared at stationary renewal times and starts anew at level zero immediately. Several clearing policies are considered: clearing at random times, clearing at crossings of a specified level, and a combination of the above policies. We assume the total cost includes a fixed clearing cost, a variable cost for the cleared amount, a holding cost, and a lost demand cost. By applying regenerative theory, we use tools from the exit-time theorem for fluid processes and martingales to obtain cost functionals under both the discounted and average criteria. Finally, illustrative examples and a comparative study are provided.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Stochastic systems with clearing policies model many different applications, including certain bulk server queues and buffers in communication systems and manufacturing. Clearing models were first studied mainly for the stock level of cumulative inventory systems; see e.g., Berman, Porlar, Perry, and Posner (2005), Kella (1998), Kella, Perry, and Stadje (2003), Pinçe, Gürler, and Berk (2008), Serfozo and Stidham (1978), and Stidham (1977). Other applications include public transportation models, where arriving customers form a queue until a server, say, a bus or a train, arrives and removes all the customers present; a tour may depart only after enough interested people are on hand to constitute a group. The shuttle model of Ignall and Kolesar (1972) has some of the characteristics of a clearing system. In the queueing context, systems with work removals have also attracted attention; see, e.g., Boucherie and Boxma (1996), and Jain and Sigman (1996).

In this paper, we consider a production/clearing model in a random environment where a single machine produces a certain product into a buffer continuously. Customers (e.g., retailers) generate the demand for the product. The system is totally cleared at stationary renewal times. The model is therefore characterized by stochastic inputs (production) and outputs (retailers) and additional total “clearings” at certain random times. After each such clearing, the system is assumed to be ready to start working again immediately. Thus, the associated content process is assumed to be semi-regenerative, starting almost anew at level zero at every clearing time.

In the literature, two core models are considered. In the first model, each time a pre-deterministic control limit level is reached by the content level, the buffer is cleared. In the language of inventory theory, the inventory level is controlled under continuousreview because it is observed continuously over time and the controller ”sees” the specific level once reached. In the second core model, the buffer is emptied periodically at random times and we assume that these sporadic clearing times form a renewal process that is independent of the input times and sizes. We emphasize that models with continuous review are different from those with sporadic clearing times, because the timing of the clearing is determined by the controller and is therefore dependent on the inventory level.

The continuous models can be used to describe the control of epidemics, in which the quantity of interest is the number of susceptibles and the clearing corresponds to a mass vaccination whenever the number of susceptibles exceeds a specific number (see also Taylor, 1968 and Perry and Stadje, 2001). Further use of these models includes inventory control. In many factories, due to physical capacity limits or safety and fire hazard regulations, inventory levels cannot exceed a specific level and so the inventory is transferred to other locations. An example that the authors are familiar with comes from Haifa Group Ltd. Haifa Group Ltd. is a global supplier of potassium nitrate for agriculture and industry, specialty plant nutrients and food phosphates. It has two production plants located in Israel and another in France, with a combined production capacity of 0.5 million tons of potassium nitrate annually (see www.haifa-group.com). A huge time and cost factor associated with changing the production rates or switching the plants off causes the plants to operate continuously in a 24/7 manner. Due to the stochastic nature of the production/demand processes, inventories may reach undesirably high levels and exceed the predetermined base stock level. Thus, each time the control level is reached, Haifa Group Ltd. has to dispose of the stock in the form of sales in a secondary market and/or temporary relocation.

Examples of sporadic models are the so-called disasters and obsolescence. In models with disasters all items stored are subject to unexpected external events that instantaneously bring the utility of all items on the shelf to zero, e.g., spoilage because of extreme weather conditions or a malfunction of a refrigerator that stores them; see e.g., Baron, Berman, and Perry (2014), Boxma, Perry, and Stadje (2001), and Gomez-Corral (2005).

The family of models with obsolescence assumes that items become obsolete due to the introduction of a new product that replaces them in the market. Thus, the entire stock will simultaneously become obsolete at some (typically random) time. Examples are ample; in some industries like wireless chips the lifecycles of parts can be less than one year. There are thousand of components that reach the end of their life every month as suppliers prune their offerings (Tyler, 2004); part obsolescence has become an increasingly acute problem for many equipment companies (Shotter, 2012). Further examples of obsolescence models range from avionics and the military sectors, high-tech products, communications, construction equipment, medical devices, transportation, and supply chain networks (we refer the readers to Chandiran (2004), Shen and Willems (2014), Song and Lau (2004), and Song and Zipkin (1996) for more examples).

Combined models have been widely discussed in recent decades. Boxma et al. (2001) consider M/G/1-type queueing system with disasters, occurring at deterministic equidistant times, at random times, and at crossings of some specified level. Kella et al. (2003) study a stochastic input-output system with time between clearings given by a Brownian motion and a compound Poisson process clearing. Berman et al. (2005) introduce two clearing policies: continuous and sporadic review under two different issuing policies. Stadje (2007) studies a cumulative storage system that is totally cleared at stationary renewal times and determines the distribution of the interoverflow times.

In this paper we assume that the arrival times of demands form a Markov Additive Process (MAP) governed by a continuous-time Markov chain (environment), where the demand sizes are independent and have phase-type distributions depending on the type of arrival. The production process switches between predetermined rates which depend on the state of the environment (note that the case of a fixed production rate is a special case of the latter). Negative inventory is not allowed; that is, there is no backlogging and so level 0 is a reflecting barrier and we assume that the demand is completely or partially satisfied.

Three control policies are studied in this paper:

1. Each time a pre-determined control limit level q is reached by the content level, the buffer is cleared and transferred to the wholesaler (e.g., as in the case of a finite storage capacity). Define the first clearing time 
                        
                           
                              T
                              q
                           
                           =
                           inf
                           
                              {
                              t
                              :
                              I
                              
                                 (
                                 t
                                 )
                              
                              ≥
                              q
                              }
                           
                        
                     . For this policy, q is the controller’s decision variable.

2. We assume that the clearing times form a Poisson process that is independent of I. Thus the clearing policy for the first cycle is an exp (ζ) distributed random time, say, Tζ
                     . Alternatively, this can reflect situations where management may have little control or information on the process (as in the case of disasters or obsolescence).

3. We also deal with a combination of the above policies, min (Tq, Tζ
                     ). Clearing takes place at exponential time unless the level q is reached before hand, in which case the controller gets an emergency call, arrives immediately, and clears the system.

For the three policies, we assume the following costs: (i) a fixed cost for each clearing, (ii) a cost for each cleared item, (iii) a holding cost for the inventory, and (iv) a penalty cost for the unsatisfied demand. Our objective is to obtain tractable formulas for the appropriate cost functionals under all of these policies. In this paper we focus on the discounted cost criterion using a discount factor β > 0; however, we also deal with the long-run average cost criterion. To the best of our knowledge, such a general model has never been investigated in the clearing/disaster literature and thus our research is novel. Furthermore, while the afore-mentioned papers involve analytic derivations of the quantities of interest, we emphasize our study using a more probabilistic approach; this enables a simple derivation of quantities of interest and obtains easy-to-implement explicit formulas for each policy. Our analysis is based on martingale techniques and on exit-time results for Markov-modulated fluid flow (MMFF) models. Starting from this analysis, one can minimize the cost of the system with respect to the parameters (e.g., q, ζ, the production rates, the demand size, and the costs) under each policy.

The martingale approach was introduced by Kella and Whitt (1992) and then generalized by Asmussen and Kella (2000); it has become an increasingly popular tool in the study of various stochastic inventory models; see, e.g., Barron (2015), Barron, Perry, and Stadje (2014), Kella et al. (2003) and the references given therein. The exit-time theory for the Markov-modulated fluid flow models have been initiated by some papers; see Bean and O’Reilly (2008), Ramaswami (2006) and others. They develop quadratically convergent algorithms that can be used to calculate the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of the time taken to return to the initial level in an MMFF model.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the inventory content level and the cost functionals in a formal manner. The basic techniques are expounded in Section 3. In Sections 4–6 we present the derivations under the three policies. Section 7 is devoted to the long-run analysis. We also provide some numerical examples by way of graphical displays and tables. Finally, in the concluding Section 8 we propose some extensions for further research.

                           transition of J from state i to state j without any accompanying demand (where i ≠ j ) occurs at rate D
                              0(i, j) ≥ 0; and

transition of J from state i to state j with an accompanying demand (with the possibility that

                     1(i, j), demand arrives upon a transition from state i to state j ≠ i and is called an ij demand.

(d) Unsatisfied demand cost. In our model negative inventory is not allowed. Thus a partially unsatisfied demand occurs whenever the process I(t) down-crosses level 0. Let φ > 0 be the penalty cost per unsatisfied unit of demand. Denote the kth time that this happens by ξk
                      and the size of the corresponding portion of unsatisfied demand by Yk
                     . The expected total discounted cost of unsatisfied demand can be expressed as

The central tools of our analysis are the exit-time theory of fluid process and the optional sampling theorem to the multi-dimensional martingale. We summarize them shortly in order to make this paper self-contained.

Consider an MAP inventory level process with production rates R. Suppose an ij demand of size x occurs at time t so that

                         Then the downward jump of size x is replaced by a line segment of length x/ci
                         of continuous linear decrease at rate ci
                         per time unit. Thus, when the incoming demand has a size that is phase-type distributed with representation (Eij

                        ), the fluid decreases at rate c
                        
                           i 
                         for a time interval whose length has the phase-type distribution with representation (Eij

                           ij
                        ). The process

In order to apply the results to our original process, we replace the argument of the LSTs for the fluid model by 0 (i.e., set 
                           
                              s

                        ) for all matrix entries of the form ((ij, k), j) or ((ij, k), (ij, l)), i.e., in all rows corresponding to states in S
                        2. From now on we assume that all the LST matrices for hitting times are modified for the original inventory model.

                           Remark 1
                           Once our process down-crosses level 0 due to ij demand (either under policy Tq, Tζ
                               or min (Tq, Tζ
                              )), the unfilled demand is lost and the content level starts again from level 0 and state j ∈ S
                              1. In order to ”remember” the process’s state, we need to apply

Under the Tq

                                  (call this rate R).

Let R vary in {0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2} and let q vary in {1, .., 10}. Figs. 2

                                  display the fixed clearing cost, holding cost and lost demand cost, respectively, as functions of q and R. We see that C
                                 1(β) decreases in q and increases in R since increasing q decreases the number of clearings; however, increasing the production rate R clearly decreases the time to a clearing. Fig. 3 shows that the holding cost, C
                                 3(β), increases in q, but it seems to be concave in R. The logic of the latter behavior is that increasing R increases the inventory level; however, for high levels of R, the time to a clearing is reduced, and thus we see a reduction in the inventory level. Regarding q, Figs. 4 and 2 share a similar behavior. Regarding R, we see that C
                                 4(β) decreases for lower values of R and increases for higher values. Clearly, increasing R causes less loss; however, a higher production rate causes more clearings and thus more loss.

In general, different values of the parameters K, f, h, φ imply unique behavior of the total cost C(β). Figs. 5
                           
                           –7
                            present the total cost as a function of q for 
                              
                                 R
                                 =
                                 0.5
                                 .
                              
                            In each figure we vary one of the parameters K, h, φ and fix the other ones. We see that relatively high values of K and h cause C(β) to be a convex function of q (similar to other classical inventory models, e.g., EOQ); thus, we can obtain a q
                           * which minimizes C(β). In addition, Fig. 7 shows that the behavior of C(β) is influenced mostly by K and h and hardly by φ.

We retain the notation introduced in Section 1. Let clearings take place at time instants that form a Poisson process with intensity ζ which is independent of the inventory process (I(t))
                        t ≥ 0. Let Tζ
                      denote the first clearing time; thus, Tζ
                      is exponentially distributed with mean 1/ζ.

For a modulated CTMC J(t), it is well known that the generator matrix Q satisfies

We reveal two cases. In the case of ξ
                        1 < Tζ
                        , assume the process hits level 0 due to (ij, l) demand; thus, X(ξ
                        1) has the same distribution as ε(ij, l) and the (m × m) matrix

                              1(β) is also independent of R and a simple derivation shows that

                               display the variable cost, the holding cost and the lost demand cost, respectively, as functions of R and ζ. Fig. 8 shows that C
                              2(β) increases in R and ζ.Figs. 9 and 10 imply that the holding cost, C
                              3(β), and the lost demand cost, C
                              4(β), have the opposite behavior of the corresponding costs in Figs. 3 and 4 (probably due to the opposite impact of q and ζ on the cycle length, which increases in q but decreases in ζ). However, the behavior of the total cost, C(β), is more difficult to obtain since this cost is influenced by all cost factors.

                           Regarding all the functionals, it is easy to see that for q → ∞, Tq
                               → ∞ and thus we obtain the Tζ
                               policy; for ζ → 0, Tζ
                               → ∞ and we obtain the Tq
                               policy.

We consider the same data as in Example 1. Let ζ vary in {0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2} and q vary in {1, 3, 5, 7}. We fix

                              4(β) as functions of ζ and q. We can see that the fixed clearing cost decreases in q and increases in ζ. Fig. 12 shows that C
                              2(β) increases in ζ, particularly for high levels of q (when the Tζ
                               policy is dominant). Furthermore, it is easy to see that the behavior of C
                              3(β) and C
                              4(β) is a combination of the Tq
                               policy (Figs. 3 and 4) and the Tζ
                               policy (Figs. 9 and 10). In addition, one can conclude that the major growth and reduction of the variable cost, the holding cost and the loss cost are applied for low values of ζ and high values of q.

To learn about the behavior of C(β) we have carried out additional numerical checkings. Our observations show that the behavior of C(β) may be influenced mainly by h. For example, we take the basic values for the parameters

                               and let h vary in {0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20}. Fig. 15
                               shows curves of C(β) as a function of q for various values of h. We see that C(β) decreases in q for low values of h and increases in q for high values. In addition, for relatively high values of h

                               we can obtain q
                              * which minimizes C(β) (where q can be a controller’s decision variable).

Furthermore, it would be interesting to study the case of a relatively high inventory cost under different policies. The following example compares Tζ
                         and min(Tq, Tζ
                        ) policies for such a case.

                               The gray surface in Fig. 16
                               presents C(β) under the Tζ
                               policy and the black surface represents the min(Tq, Tζ
                              ) policy. Due to the high inventory cost, the additional level q (under the min(Tq, Tζ
                              ) policy) leads to a reduced total cost, particularly for small ζ; thus, the min(Tq, Tζ
                              ) policy is preferred. For high ζ and q the surfaces coincide. (Note that in our observations, which are not presented here, for a relatively low h, the Tζ
                               policy performs better and thus is preferred.)

In addition, for a fixed ζ, it would be worthwhile investigating the value of q
                        * which minimizes C(β) in the case where q can be a controller’s decision variable. Table 1
                         presents q
                        *, C(β)* under the min(Tq, Tζ
                        ) policy compared to C(β) under the Tζ
                         policy, for several values of ζ and R (we limited our observations to the set 
                           
                              q

                              )
                              .
                           
                         
                        Fig. 17
                         shows curves of C(β)* and C(β) for 
                           
                              ζ

                         (blue, red and black lines, respectively) as a function of R. For each ζ, we use a dashed line for C(β)* under the min(Tq, Tζ
                        ) policy and a solid line for C(β) under the Tζ
                         policy. A simple observation leads to some important conclusions:

                           
                              (1)
                              The min (Tq, Tζ
                                 ) policy performs better, particularly for low values of ζ and for high values of R (since high production rate and low ζ increase the inventory level and the holding cost).

The value q
                                 * is nondecreasing in ζ and R.

In this section we derive the long-run average costs for the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy. As mentioned before, letting 
                        
                           ζ
                           ⟶
                           0
                        
                      leads to the Tq
                      policy, and letting 
                        
                           q
                           ⟶
                           ∞
                        
                      returns the exponential policy.

For E(θ) we apply the theory of MAP as introduced in Asmussen (2003, Section XI, pp. 312–313) (see also Barron, 2015). We use the notations of (13) and (14) and the method of Asmussen (2003, Section 2d, pp. 312–313), and Asmussen and Kella (2000). The matrix K(α) has a real eigenvalue k(α) with maximal real part among all eigenvalues (cf. chap. XI, p. 312 in Asmussen, 2003). The corresponding left and right eigenvectors

                               other costs (variable, holding and loss costs) show a similar behavior to the discounted case, and hence are omitted.

Clearing policies form an important part of the inventory literature. In this paper we consider three control policies: (i) the Tq
                      policy, in which the inventory is cleared whenever a pre-determined control limit q is reached; (ii) the Tζ
                      policy, in which the time between clearings is exponentially distributed with parameter ζ; and (iii) a combination of the above policies, the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy, in which clearing takes place in exponential time unless the level q is reached before. These policies are applied for a MAP arrival process and demand sizes are i.i.d. phase-type distributed. The cost associated with this problem includes a fixed cost of a clearing, a variable cost for the cleared amount, a holding cost for the inventory, and a lost demand cost due to the reflection in level 0. By a simple probability approach and by applying exit-theory for fluid processes and martingales, explicit cost functionals for the expected discounted costs and for the long-run average costs were derived. These formulas are used for an analysis of the dependence of the cost functionals on the system parameters, for optimization purposes, and enable us to investigate the behavior of the system and study its properties.

Numerical examples present the trade-off between the fixed and lost demand costs and the holding costs as a function of q and ζ (similarly to other classical inventory models, e.g., EOQ). In addition, one can conclude that the major growth and reduction of both the variable cost, the holding cost, and the loss cost are applied for small values of ζ and high values of q (clearly, the parameters q and ζ have an opposite impact on the cost functionals).

The behavior of the total cost, C(β), is more difficult to determine since it is influenced by all the costs. In general, for a high clearing cost K, the Tq
                      and Tζ
                      policies are preferred to the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy (since the former policies have fewer clearings than the latter).

For a relatively high holding cost h, a comparative study between the Tζ
                      policy and the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy was considered and our observations reveal that the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy performs better, particularly for low values of ζ and for high values of R (however, for high values of ζ, both policies perform equally well). Thus, it is worthwhile for the controller to determine the optimal q
                     * (where q can be a controller’s decision variable) in order to reduce the total cost under the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy. In addition, it was found that q
                     *, which minimizes C(β) under the min (Tq, Tζ
                     ) policy, is nondecreasing in ζ and R.

Finally, the average case was investigated, and it was shown that both the discounted and the average cost functionals show similar behavior.

One can try to incorporate the idea of continuous review control policies with lead time with several possible extensions of the above model; the case of fixed or exponential lead time is probably very tractable. In addition, the inventory control during the lead time can be investigated. Another interesting and practical extension is to consider an ”all or none” demand policy, in which each demand can be either completely satisfied or completely unsatisfied depending on the content level present.
