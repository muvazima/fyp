                  This paper explores whether factor based credit portfolio risk models are able to predict losses in severe economic downturns such as the recent Global Financial Crisis (GFC) within standard confidence levels. The paper analyzes (i) the accuracy of default rate forecasts, and (ii) whether forecast downturn percentiles (Value-at-Risk, VaR) are sufficient to cover default rate outcomes over a quarterly and an annual forecast horizon. Uninformative maximum likelihood and informative Bayesian techniques are compared as they imply different degrees of uncertainty.
                  We find that quarterly VaR estimates are generally sufficient but annual VaR estimates may be insufficient during economic downturns. In addition, the paper develops and analyzes models based on auto-regressive adjustments of scores, which provide a higher forecast accuracy. The consideration of parameter uncertainty and auto-regressive error terms mitigates the shortfall.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

The recent Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had its origin in the realization of losses in relation to sub-prime mortgage lending. Mortgage lending is traditionally one of the largest risk exposures of commercial banks. Sophisticated scoring and forecasting techniques have been developed to compute risk exposures for individual mortgages and mortgage portfolios. A key feature in modern credit portfolio management is the modeling of credit losses under severe economic downturns such as the worst outcome in 1000 years.

Given the consideration of such remote economic shock scenarios, it is astonishing that banks were surprised by the magnitude of realized losses. We analyze (i) the accuracy of default rate forecasts, and (ii) whether downturn percentiles (Value-at-Risk, VaR) for the forecast default rate reflecting parameter uncertainty are sufficient to cover default rate outcomes. Uninformative maximum likelihood and informative Bayesian techniques are compared as they imply different degrees of model risk. The accuracy of mortgage portfolio risk forecasts is analyzed prior to, and during the GFC.

An important aspect in this analysis is model risk in the form of parameter uncertainty. Measures for the co-movement of individual risks are based on time series information of limited length and the respective parameters generally attract large standard errors. Bayesian techniques with informative priors are often applied to reduce estimation risk. This is interesting as the reduction of standard errors may create a false indication of certainty if the prior information is representative with regard to the likelihood information but not representative with regard to the validation information.

The contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we compare realized sub-prime mortgage losses with portfolio risk measures such as the forecast default rate and VaR. The portfolio risk measures control for observable loan-level information, macro-economic variables and unobservable systematic frailty. We find that the forecast default rate is lower than the realized loss rate during the GFC and that VaR models based on quarterly forecasts are sufficient under severe economic downturns. As a result, the stark increase of loss rates during the GFC were within standard confidence levels. However, annual forecasts are insufficient under severe economic downturns.

Secondly, two common approaches to measuring credit portfolio risk are compared: uninformative maximum likelihood and informative Bayesian estimation. The informative Bayesian approach is of great interest to mortgage lenders if data is available to form prior distributions of model parameters. Bayesian models lead to similar parameter estimates but lower standard errors and hence, lower VaRs after model risk is included relative to maximum likelihood estimation. The properties of informative priors given the business cycle and the origins of such priors from selected stages of the business cycle have not been explored to date. We find that model risk increases the VaR (for maximum likelihood estimation to a greater degree than for Bayesian estimation). However, the inclusion of model risk does not change our findings for the first contribution.

Thirdly, we extend our scoring model by an auto-regressive adjustment. Prior literature has included frailty effects to control for omitted time variation. We build on this literature and ‘utilize’ the auto-regressive process to improve the forecast accuracy considerably. The resulting default rate forecasts are centered around the realized default rates of the prior period and the resulting VaR forecasts are generally more likely to cover default rate realizations before and during the GFC.

The analysis is based on US sub-prime mortgage loans securitized between 2000:Q2 and 2012:Q2. The data includes over 50 million quarterly loan observations and almost one million individual loan foreclosure events. Training and validation samples are based on random draws of mutually exclusive samples.

Credit portfolio risk scoring and forecasting techniques have enjoyed great interest in the operations research and finance literature. Various authors have analyzed corporate and consumer lending portfolios. With regard to consumer credit risk, Bellotti and Crook (2013) provide an overview of consumer credit risk models. Probabilities of default are modeled by logistic regression models (compare e.g., Crook, Edelmann, & Thomas, 2007; Crook & Bellotti, 2010; Leow & Mues, 2012; Lucas, 2006) and survival analysis (compare, e.g., Bellotti & Crook, 2008; Malik & Thomas, 2009; Tong, Mues, & Thomas, 2012; Quigley & Van Order, 1991) for consumer loans. Generally speaking, the literature has focused on the scoring of individual consumer loans (e.g., credit card and other personal loans).

In addition, a variety of papers identify factors driving mortgage delinquency risk. Elul, Souleles, Chomsisengphet, Glennon, and Hunt (2010) and Goodman, Ashworth, Landy, and Yin (2010) investigate the impact of negative equity, liquidity and unemployment on mortgage default. Amromin and Paulson (2009) evaluate the relative impact of borrower, loan and macroeconomic characteristics on mortgage defaults and identify real estate prices as an important risk driver. Rajan, Seru, and Vig (2015) show that the deterioration of the accuracy of the statistical default prediction model is triggered by the change in lender behavior as the level of securitization increases. Crook and Banasik (2012) forecast time-series default rates of mortgage loans and other consumer loans based on macroeconomic variables. Our contribution relative to this literature is that we (i) compare the impact of different estimation techniques given common control variables, (ii) are able to analyze the sufficiency of economic Value-at-Risk (bank capital) models via the estimation of random frailty effects, and (iii) include a novel auto-regressive term.

The introduction of the Basel II and Basel III capital regulation has triggered the interest of banks in measuring the portfolio credit risk with measures such as VaR and Expected Shortfall. Bonollo, Mercurio, and Mosconi (2009), Duffie, Eckner, Horel, and Saita (2009), Koopman, Lucas, and Schwaab (2011), McNeil and Wendin (2007) and Rösch and Scheule (2014), Lee and Poon (2014) model the joint exposure to latent systematic risk processes in corporate credit portfolios. Default clustering in excess of observable risk factors is modeled by unobservable random factors, which are also known as ‘frailty’. Our contribution relative to this literature is the application of such econometric techniques to residential mortgage loans.

Another stream in literature that is relevant to this paper focuses on estimation risk or model risk. Model risk addresses the uncertainty with regard to estimated parameters. Examples are Jorion (1996) and Escanciano and Olmo (2010) for market risk and Hamerle and Roesch (2005), Loeffler (2003), Tarashev and Zhu (2008) and Heitfield (2009) for credit risk. These papers explicitly take into account that models are based on parameters, which are usually not observable and have to be estimated from data samples. This induces a sampling or estimation error for the parameters, as well as for model outcomes such as expected losses or Value-at-Risk metrics. These papers measure the impact of parameter estimation errors and provide evidence for the substantial impact of model risk. Our contribution relative to this literature is the application of such econometric techniques to residential mortgage loans.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a two-stage framework to measure mortgage portfolio risk and to estimate the model parameters. The mortgage portfolio default model is a non-linear probit regression with both observable and unobservable frailty effects. Observable co-variates, e.g., mortgage-specific and macroeconomic variables, are common in scoring models for individual retail loans. Section 3 introduces the data set on US sub-prime mortgage borrowers including loan-level and borrower-level characteristics, as well as macroeconomic information analyzed in this paper. The data is decomposed into training and validation samples, which are non-overlapping in the cross-section, i.e., relate to different mortgage loans. The training sample relates to the period prior to the GFC and is split into a prior sample for the informative Bayesian technique and a likelihood sample for both the uninformative maximum likelihood and the informative Bayesian estimation. The validation sample covers pre-crisis and crisis periods. The estimation results and empirical findings are presented. Finally, Section 4 concludes and discusses implications for mortgage portfolio risk models.

                        are the sensitivities of the respective co-variates. This paper is interested in the next four quarters of forecast horizons, i.e., 1 ≤ τ ≤ 4, for testing the accuracy of mortgage portfolio risk forecasts. For simplicity, we relate the following equations to a lag of one quarter (

Probit models are similar to survival models and logistic regression models. Note that Allison (2010) shows that Cox Proportional Hazard models are similar to logistic regressions, when data is tied, i.e., observed in discrete time intervals. This is the case for our data which has quarterly frequencies. Hamerle, Liebig, and Scheule (2006) show that logistic and probit regressions result in similar estimated probabilities of default. We chose a probit model rather than a Cox Proportional Hazard model or a logistic model, as much of the current bank regulation on credit risk modeling is based on the probit assumption due to the analytic form of percentiles of risk forecasts (Value at Risk), which is the main focus of this paper.

Mortgage-specific and common factors are time-lagged in Eq. (1) as mortgages are generally foreclosed

                           Foreclosure is the default criterion in the empirical analysis.
                         after a certain period of borrower distress. Hence, mortgage-specific and macroeconomic factors are expected to lead mortgage default in terms of time. This property is of great practical importance, as it implies that mortgage default probabilities can be forecast well given information that is available at the time of forecast. Thus, the first stage model in Eq. (1) is the unconditional probability of default with respect to the latent variable ft

In a second stage, we introduce a time-specific frailty effect ft

                           Idiosyncratic omitted information is generally diversified in large mortgage portfolios and has limited relevance to our results as we analyze the accuracy of probability of default models over time and compare the forecast default rate (the mean probability of default) and the Value-at-Risk (as the percentile of the conditional probability of default) with the realized default rate for a given period.

We assume that the latent factor follows the standard normal distribution regardless of time, i.e., ft
                            ∼ N(0, 1) for all t. The mixture of multiple time periods results in the right (heavy) tailed distribution generally observed in financial markets. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function in Eq. (4) by integrating out the unobservable factor, i.e.,

Likelihood samples are identical for MLE and Bayesian models. However, Bayesian models are based on additional prior information, which contributes to smaller standard errors. The prior distribution may include additional information, which is available from other sources, such as the subjective assessment of an expert system and pre-existing evidence from the past to inform a current analysis. Examples are benchmark parameters or economic forecasts provided by prudential regulators and economists, as well as bank external data provided by data share consortia. Otherwise, uninformative priors assigning equal weights on all possibilities of the parameters may be assumed. We do not consider the use of uninformative priors in the following analysis as these results are similar to maximum likelihood estimation. We denote its prior distribution as

Since the posterior distribution in Eq. (6) is only obtainable in its functional form, posterior samples are drawn using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The full conditional posterior distributions for MCMC are provided in Appendix B.

For the maximum likelihood method, the likelihood in Eq. (5) is found by marginalizing over the latent factor ft

                           . In contrast to MLE, the Bayesian estimation uses the joint posterior distribution of all parameters (including the realizations of the latent variable ft

The maximum likelihood estimation in Eq. (5) and Bayesian estimation in Eq. (6) are generally optimal but computationally expensive for mortgage level data.

The parameters of coefficients (
                              δ
                           ) are generally assumed to be independent from co-variates (
                              x, z
                           , and f). In extensions, one may consider specifying all the possible dependencies between the regression coefficients and the realized values of unknown co-variates using hyper-parameters. We did not follow this path as the results would be less robust due to computational challenges. Hence, we assume the independence between 
                              δ
                            and 
                              f
                            for the prior distribution in Eq. (14).

Bayesian estimates are obtained as the mean of posterior samples from the posterior distribution in Eq. (12) after the convergence test using the Raftery-Lewis diagnostics and Geweke’s χ
                           2 test. We tested whether the MCMC samples after burning and thinning follow a normal distribution using the Jarque–Bera test. These tests show that the MCMC samples follow a normal distribution. Thus, there is no significant difference whether we use the mean or the median as a Bayesian estimate.

We have confirmed consistency for this two-step estimation approach through a Monte-Carlo simulation study in which we simulated default events based on the probabilities of default for given parameters and random realizations for co-variates (data generating process) for a number of borrowers and time periods. The results of this two-step process are asymptotically consistent with the data generating parameters.

The paper uses loan-level data of US securitized non-agency sub-prime mortgage loans collected from monthly loan-level reports for residential mortgage-backed securities by International Financial Research. The data set matches the one analyzed by Rajan et al. (2015) who show that up to 90 percent of all US sub-prime mortgage loans are securitized.

After aggregating monthly defaults to quarterly defaults, the data set comprises a total of 4,978,076 first lien loans observed on a quarterly basis from 2000:Q3 to 2013:Q1. We record 959,587 loan foreclosure events (many during the GFC in 2007 and thereafter). The total number of loan-quarter observations is 50,014,994. We define the default event in our study as a foreclosure event.

Mortgage-specific information at loan origination includes an indicator for adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), FICO score, original balance, original appraisal value of the collateral/ property (OAV), original loan-to-value ratio (OLTV), owner occupancy type (OOT), and dwelling type (DWT).

                              The increase of credit risk in mortgage lending during the Global Financial Crisis has been attributed to a great degree to the decline of house prices, which we include through the computation of the current loan to value ratio (CLTV). Note that the literature has identified a number of additional risk drivers for which we control in our first-stage model.
                           
                        


                           Table 1
                            summarizes the number of observations per observation year. The number of mortgages shows that mortgage origination and securitization increased from 2004 to 2007 and subsided thereafter. Mortgage defaults were at low levels and stable before the GFC and increased to 3.4 percent during the GFC. Over time, the average default rate is 1.92 percent.
                           
                        


                           Tables 2 and 3 describe mortgage-specific and macroeconomic variables at time of origination and observation for default status.

A FICO score measures the creditworthiness of a borrower using information from credit files and is computed by the popular scorecard model provided by Fair Isaac and Company. A higher FICO score implies a higher credit quality. The average FICO score of default mortgages is 35 points lower than for non-defaulted mortgages.

The average original balance is 13,000 dollars lower for defaulted than for non-defaulted mortgages. The mean appraisal values of the collateral (i.e., the financed real estate) is 60,000 dollars less for defaulted mortgages than for non-defaulted mortgage. The mean of original LTV ratio is 5 percent greater for defaulted than for non-defaulted mortgages.

The ARM indicator denotes whether or not a mortgage rate may be adjusted after it is issued. We assign a code of 1 to adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and a code of 0 to fixed rate mortgages (FRMs). The default rate of ARMs is 1.33 percent higher than for FRMs in Table 3.

Owner occupancy is classified into three types: residence (code = 1), investment (code = 2), and others (code = 0). Residence includes both primary and secondary residence. Mortgages for residences and investments are 0.57 percent and 0.77 percent less risky in terms of the default rate than mortgages for other purposes.

Dwelling type includes single family homes (code = 1), planned urban developments (code = 2), condominiums (code = 3), and others (code = 0). Mortgages for single family homes, planned urban developments, and condominiums are 0.05, 0.11 and 0.1 percent riskier than for other purposes in terms of the default rate.

Mortgage-level variables at observation time t are current balance (CB) and current loan-to-value ratio (CLTV). In contrast to the original balance, the current balance of defaulted mortgages is on average 3,000 dollars larger than for non-defaulted mortgages.

The current loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of mortgages is calculated using the Case–Shiller Index for 20 major metropolitan statistical areas in the US. We first compute the physical distance of individual mortgage properties to the 20 US cities for which a Case–Shiller home price index is available via a mortgage’s property postcode. We use the postcode of the largest city in the state of the property in terms of population for mortgages with missing postcodes. Then, we map the closest Case–Shiller index for a mortgage property and approximate the current loan-to-value ratio at observation time t as

                              We use the 10-city composite Case–Shiller Index rather than the 20-city composite Case–Shiller Index as the latter is only available for years after 2000, which would imply a restriction to loans originated after 2000.
                            The CSI shows the spectacular decline during the GFC. On average, CLTV is 21 percent higher for defaulted mortgages than for non-defaulted mortgages in Table 2.

We use a quarterly country-level debt-to-income ratio (DTI) as in Amromin and Paulson (2009), the quarterly real GDP growth rate (GDP) from the OECD data service as in Jimenez and Mencia (2009) as macro-economic risk factor.

                           Fig. 1(b) and (d) show that the CSI and GDP growth co-move with each other, and move in opposite ways to the default rate in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(c) shows that the quarterly reported country-level DTI co-moves with the level of default rate in Fig. 1(a).
                        

We did not consider a lender’s foreclosure strategy as a control variable as this information is unknown prior to default and not available for the construction of forecast models. Furthermore, Adelino, Gerardi, and Willen (2013) document that US banks and mortgage servicers are reluctant to renegotiate mortgages and that less than 3 percent of loans were modified during the GFC.


                           Fig. 2 visualizes the data sampling design of this paper.
                        

We draw three random samples from the extensive data set: (i) a prior sample, (ii) a likelihood sample and (iii) a validation sample. Every data set includes 10 percent of the mortgage loans and is mutually exclusive:

                              
                                 1.
                                 Prior sample: covers pre-GFC periods (i.e., from 2000:Q3 to 2007:Q2). The parameters are estimated using uninformative maximum likelihood. The prior distributions of parameters are approximated by the multivariate normal distribution where the mean is the vector of MLEs and covariance matrix is the Hessian matrix of MLEs.

Likelihood sample: covers pre-GFC periods (i.e., from 2000:Q3 to 2007:Q2). Both the uninformative maximum likelihood and the informative Bayesian estimation are applied to this data. The informative Bayesian method estimates the posterior distribution given the prior distribution from the prior sample (i).

Validation sample: covers pre-GFC and GFC periods (i.e., from 2000:Q3 to 2013:Q1). We apply the estimated models from the likelihood sample to assess the out-of-sample and in-time performance prior to the GFC, and out-of-sample and out-of-time performance during the GFC.

We chose to work with smaller random samples drawn from the complete data set for two reasons. Firstly, we would like to assess the performance of the informed Bayesian approach, where the prior information is representative with regard to the likelihood information and pre-GFC validation information (i.e., pre-GFC periods) and not representative with the GFC validation information (i.e., GFC periods). Secondly, we are keen to increase the computational efficiency without losing accuracy.

We check the robustness of our samples in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows that the default rates are almost identical for the three samples and the complete data set. Fig. 3(b)–(d) shows the default rate of the total portfolio Rt
                            and the 95 percent confidence intervals for sample default rate rt

As shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d), the respective 95 percent confidence intervals include most of the quarterly default rates of the total portfolio irrespective of the sample periods. For the prior sample in Fig. 3(b), the total portfolio default rates are outside the 95 percent confidence interval for 2004:Q4. The average width of the confidence interval is 0.25 percent. For the likelihood sample in Fig. 3(c), the total portfolio default rate is beyond the 95 percent confidence interval in 2003:Q1. These are reasonable under the 95 percent confidence interval, since the percentage of quarters outside the confidence interval to the number of quarters in the prior and likelihood sample is 3.45 percent (one out of 29 quarters), which is close to 5 percent. The average width of the confidence intervals for the likelihood sample is 0.24 percent. For the validation sample in Fig. 3(d), the total portfolio default rate is beyond the 95 percent confidence interval in the three quarters 2005:Q2, 2006:Q4 and 2009:Q1. The percentage of quarters outside the confidence interval is 5.88 percent (three out of 51 quarters), which is again close to 5 percent. For the validation sample, the average widths of the confidence intervals is 0.25 percent before the GFC and 0.15 percent during the GFC. The comparison of default rates and narrow confidence intervals imply that all three random samples are representative with regard to the population. These results validate the representativeness of our data samples.

The mortgage-specific variables and common factors described in Tables 2 and 3 are included in the probit model of the first stage regressions for four different forecast horizons (one quarter to four quarters). The score model in Eq. (1) is estimated for both the prior sample and the likelihood sample using the maximum likelihood method. We use the terms score and probability of default (PD) interchangeably throughout this paper. The estimated unconditional PDs and scores based on the prior sample and the likelihood sample data are used for the conditional PD models in Section 3.4.


                        Table 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters for the prior sample and the likelihood sample models according to the four forecast horizons. Note that a higher score represents a higher probability of default.

Panel A of Table 4 shows that the mortgage-specific variables are consistently significant for both the prior and the likelihood samples across all forecast horizons. As expected, the score of a mortgage increases as the FICO score decreases. The higher the CLTV, the higher the score. On average, an ARM has a higher score than a FRM. The estimated score varies with dwelling and owner occupancy types. For dwelling types, planned urban developments and condominiums are less risky than others. For owner occupancy types, investment mortgages are riskier than residential mortgages. The effect of DTI and GDP are also highly significant. The higher the DTI, the higher the score. The higher the GDP (growth), the lower the score. The sensitivity to the DTI is consistent regardless of the forecast horizons, whereas the sensitivity to GDP decreases for the longer forecast horizons. The reason for this is that we use the level of DTI, which is less volatile over time but the growth rate of GDP, which is more volatile over time for the score models.

Panel B of Table 4 shows the goodness-of-fit of the probit model for the prior sample and the likelihood sample. The measure AUROC is based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve which is a common performance measure for ordinal rating systems. AUROC is approximately 80 percent and the Pseudo R
                        2 is approximately 11 percent for both the prior sample and the likelihood sample.

The literature has identified CLTV and FICO score as key drivers of mortgage delinquency risk. We add loan-level and macro-economic variables suggested in the literature. In order to assess the relative impact of these additional variables, we have estimated various restricted models with a sub-selection of variables.

We find that a model based on CLTV and FICO score is close to our model, which includes macroeconomic and other additional variables, in terms of in-sample performance with regard to discrimination and calibration. The AUROC measure is 0.7860 and the Pseudo R-square is 0.1013 for the model restricted to CLTV and FICO score. The AUROC measure is 0.7892 and the Pseudo R-square is 0.1047 for the full MLE model.

However, we find that the out-of-sample default rate is substantially better forecasted by the full model (e.g., mean absolute deviation (MAD) during the GFC period: 0.5557) than for the restricted model (e.g., MAD during the GFC period: 0.8907). The inclusion of the additional variables, in particular macro-economic variables, provides for better forecasts.

Since the probability of default is usually specified over a one-year risk horizon in the determination of regulatory capital requirements, it is useful to measure default risk over one year in accordance with the Basel framework.

                              are excluded in Eq. (19). The reasons for this are as follows: firstly, we are interested in modeling the default of existing loans rather than new issuance of loans in this paper. Secondly, time-lagged mortgage-specific information is not available for these loans.

In Eq. (20), each term on the right-hand side refers to the probability that mortgage i defaults within four quarters and thus, their sum becomes the unconditional PD over a one-year default horizon.

We compute the AUROC for the probit model, where the annual defaults of the prior and likelihood samples are explained by the one-year ahead unconditional PD. The AUROC measure is 78.55 percent for the prior sample and 79.09 percent for the likelihood sample. The pseudo r-square is 12.75 percent for the prior sample and 13.31 percent for the likelihood sample. These measures are consistent with those for the unconditional PD model on a quarterly basis in Panel B of Table 4.

Uninformative maximum likelihood and informative Bayesian estimates are compared for the likelihood sample in terms of forecast performance of PDs and sufficiency of VaRs. Table 5
                         shows the maximum likelihood estimates and Bayesian estimates of the conditional PD model for a quarterly default rate rt

(9) and (10), the corresponding unconditional default threshold over a one year forecasting horizon is given by

Given the estimated scores in Panel A of Table 4, the conditional PD models of Eqs. (10) and (23) are estimated for the prior sample and the likelihood sample by maximum likelihood. Maximum likelihood estimates for the prior sample data are used to approximate the prior distributions of parameters for the Bayesian estimation with the likelihood sample. The covariances between parameters are estimated from the Hessian matrix. Posterior samples of δ
                        0, δ
                        1 and δ
                        2 are drawn based on the likelihood sample data given the prior information using the conditional posterior distributions by the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method in Appendix B and their convergences are tested by the Raftery–Lewis diagnostics and Geweke’s χ
                        2 test. A multivariate normal distribution where parameters are taken from the columns ‘Bayesian (prior)’ in Table 5 is assumed for the prior distribution of δ
                        0, δ
                        1 and δ
                        2.

Since we use a two-step approach for estimation, δ
                        0 and δ
                        1 are respectively expected to be zero and one, if the unconditional PD estimated from the previous period captures the underlying source of default well and there is not much effect of the unobservable risk factor. In summary, MLEs and Bayesian estimates are comparable in Table 5.

However, the standard errors of the informative Bayesian estimates (posterior) are much smaller than for the uninformative maximum likelihood due to the prior information.

The accuracy of the estimated unconditional PD for a one-year forecast horizon is worse relative to a quarterly horizon. This leads δ
                        0 and δ
                        1 to be different from zero and one as shown in Panel B of Table 5. The effect of the unobservable risk factor becomes stronger for the longer forecast horizon as the uncertainty increases from a quarter to a year forecast horizon.

                           is its inverse. We refer to the VaR in Eq. (25)
as the VaR without model risk.

Observable and unobservable common factors are important to credit portfolio risks. An important aspect in this analysis is model risk as these parameter estimates are subject to time series limitations and parameter estimates have large standard errors. The percentile of the default rate is approximated by the mean VaR over all mortgage loans for a given period. Gordy (2000) shows that this requires the assumption of an infinitely granular portfolio. The infinite granularity is a reasonable assumption for mortgage portfolios with many credits of limited exposure value. Therefore, the inclusion of a time specific random effect has the benefit of analytically deriving the VaR given the parameters δ, δ
                           1, and δ
                           2.

In order to analyze model risk, we simulate the parameters using a standard Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 iterations given the multivariate normal distribution with the mean vector

                           is the sth simulated vector of parameters. We obtain a vector of S VaR values and select the α% percentile of these values as the α% VaR under model uncertainty.

We chose a reference likelihood of 99.9 percent throughout this paper in line with the Basel regulation, i.e., α = 99.9 percent. Banks may choose more conservative levels for economic capital models.

On a quarterly basis, Fig. 4
                            shows the default rate, the mean ECPD from Eq. (24) as the forecast default rates, mean 99.9% VaR, as well as the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty for the validation sample given the MLEs and Bayesian estimates in Panel A of Table 5.

The mean ECPD forecast fits the default rate well for the pre-GFC validation sample (i.e., in-time) for the MLE in Fig. 4(a) and the Bayesian estimation in Fig. 4(b). Note the validation sample is out-of-sample as it relates to a different set of mortgages. However, the model underestimates the default rate during the GFC (i.e., out-of time). The gap between the observed default rate and mean ECPD persists over multiple periods with the exception of the quarters 2009:Q2 and 2013:Q1.


                           Fig. 4(c) compares the mean 99.9% VaR given MLE and Bayesian estimates without model risk which are similar to each other due to the closeness of parameter estimates (compare Panels A and B of Table 5). The mean 99.9% VaR is generally sufficient to cover realized default rates with the exception of the period 2008:Q2. In 2008:Q2, the realized default rate is 3.28 percent and its corresponding VaR is 3.10 and 3.12 percent for MLEs and Bayesian estimates, respectively. This result leads us to conclude that VaR based on quarterly forecasting is generally sufficient.


                           Fig. 4(d) compares the mean 99.9% VaR with model risk based on MLE and Bayesian estimation. Both VaRs are sufficient to cover default rate realizations during the GFC. The Bayesian VaR with model uncertainty is generally smaller than the MLE VaR due to the smaller standard errors of parameter estimates (compare Panels A and B of Table 5).

Panel A of Table 6
                            summarizes the forecast error and VaR sufficiency for the validation sample in relation to (i) pre-GFC, GFC and total sample period, and (ii) MLE and Bayesian estimation for a quarterly default forecasting. The forecasting error is measured by the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) given as

                           (99.9%) is the 99.9% value-at-risk at time t. The higher AVB, the higher the VaR exceedence of the realized default rate.

In Panel A of Table 6, the GFC period results in a higher MAD than the pre-GFC period due to large deviations of the forecast from the realized default rate during the GFC. The reason for this is the severity of the economic downturn reflected in the latent systematic variable ft
                           , which results in an increase of the default rate, which the mean ECPD is unable to forecast.

The AVBs with regard to the 99.9% VaR increase as a reflection of the stark increase of default rates and the non-linearity of the normal cumulative density function Φ(·) with respect to the default rate for both MLE and Bayes during the GFC.

On a yearly basis, Fig. 5 shows the default rate, the mean ECPD from Eq. (28) as the forecast default rate, mean 99.9% VaR, as well as the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty for the validation sample given the MLEs and Bayesian estimates in Panel B of Table 5.

Similar to the quarterly forecasting shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the annualized mean ECPD forecast fits the annualized default rate well for the pre-GFC validation sample for the MLE in Fig. 5(a) and the Bayesian estimation in Fig. 5(b). However, the forecasting error in terms of MAD increases from 0.1556 (MLE) and 0.1567 percent (Bayes) for a quarterly forecasting to 0.5852 (MLE) and 0.5824 percent (Bayes) for an annual forecasting as the forecast horizon becomes longer (compare Panels A and B of Table 6). Moreover, the annual forecasting model responds to the sudden rise of default rate with four quarters lag, and thus underestimates the default rate to a greater extent during the GFC for the longer forecast horizon in Fig. 5(a) and (b) which confirms our expectation. In Fig. 5(c), the mean 99.9% VaR is less sufficient to cover realized default rates during the GFC compared to the quarterly case in Fig. 4(c). In addition, the mean 99.9% VaR with model risk based on MLE and Bayesian estimation is not sufficient to cover default rate realizations during the GFC in Fig. 5(d). These insufficiency of 99.9 percent annual VaR with/without model risk is due to the inaccuracy of default forecasting using more outdated (four quarters old) information, which result in the decreases of AVBs with/without model risk in Panel B of Table 6.

The paper proposes a simple auto-regressive adjustment, which is based on the difference of the past estimated and observed default rate. Note that auto-regressive factors can be applied to single and multiple period forecasts, and that the variance of the forecasts increases with the forecast horizon (see, Rösch & Scheule (2007)).

                           Fig. 6 shows the default rate, the mean ECPD of Eq. (31) as the forecast default rate, mean 99.9% VaR, as well as the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty for the validation sample given MLE and Bayesian estimates with auto-regressive adjustment (see Table 7) on a quarterly basis.

The auto-regressive adjustment considerably improves the forecasting performance of the quarterly conditional PD model during the GFC and thereafter in both the maximum likelihood estimation (see Fig. 6(a)) and the Bayesian estimation (see Fig. 6(b)). The mean 99.9% VaRs (see Fig. 6(c)) and the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty (see Fig. 6(d)) are consistently sufficient prior to, and during the GFC. Similar to Fig. 4 (d), the Bayesian VaR with model uncertainty is smaller than the corresponding MLE VaR due to smaller standard errors of the parameter estimates in Fig. 6 (d).

For a quarterly forecasting, Panel A of Table 8
                            summarizes the mean absolute deviation (MAD, see Eq. (26)) and the average VaR buffer (AVB, see Eq. (27)) for the validation sample in relation to (i) Pre-GFC, GFC and total sample period, and (ii) MLE and Bayesian estimation for the PD model with auto-regressive adjustment.

The MADs for the quarterly PD model with auto-regressive adjustment are much smaller than the ones of the quarterly PD model without auto-regressive adjustment (compare Panel A of Table 6), irrespective of the data period and estimation method. This confirms that the auto-regressive adjustment provides a much better forecast accuracy as it is able to better explain the increase of the default rate during the GFC. Similar to Panel A of Table 6, the MAD increases during the GFC, albeit at smaller increments.

The AVBs for 99.9% VaR with and without model risk increase during the GFC. The non-linear incremental effect of the default rate by VaR is higher than the actual increase of the default rate during the GFC.

In a similar way to the quarterly default forecasting with auto-regressive adjustment in the previous section, the linear predictor of the conditional PD model on a yearly basis can be expressed as

Panel B of Table 7 presents the maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates of the yearly PD model with an auto-regressive adjustment of Eq. (33). As in the quarterly risk forecasting case, the coefficient estimates of the score (δ
                           1) are similar to the ones in Panel B of Table 5, and the estimates of sensitivity to the latent variable (δ
                           2) are smaller as the adjustment absorbs some of the time variation of the latent variable

                           (compare to Panel B of Table 5). The role of the latent factor becomes less important by including the auto-regressive adjustment, which is more outdated relative to quarterly forecasting.

Based on the yearly conditional PD model in Eq. (33), the annual ECPD and α% VaR with auto-regressive adjustment are obtained as

                           Fig. 7
                            shows the default rate, the mean ECPD from Eq. (34) as the forecast default rates, the mean 99.9% VaR, as well as the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty for the validation sample given MLE and Bayesian estimates with an auto-regressive adjustment (see Panel B of Table 7) on a yearly basis.

The results are consistent with quarterly forecasting: for yearly default forecasting, the auto-regressive adjustment improves the forecasting performance of the PD model during the GFC and thereafter in both the maximum likelihood estimation (see Fig. 7(a)) and the Bayesian estimation (see Fig. 7(b)), but the improvement effect is weaker (see Fig. 6 (a) and (b)) as the yearly default forecasts lag four quarters behind the annual default rates.

In Fig. 7(c) and (d), the mean 99.9% VaR and the mean 99.9% VaR with model uncertainty are still insufficient during the GFC after consideration of the auto-regressive adjustment. Thus, during the GFC, the AVBs for 99.9% VaR with/without model uncertainty for a yearly forecasting in Panel B of Table 8 do not increase as much as those for a quarterly forecasting in Panel A of Table 8. This implies that more conservative forecast downturn percentiles should be considered as the risk horizon becomes longer to cover extreme economic downturns such as the GFC.

Finally, in Figs. 4–7, the difference between VaRs for MLE and Bayes in figure (c) are due to the prior information, and the difference between VaRs with model uncertainty for MLE and Bayes in figure (d) are due to the lower standard errors of Bayesian parameter estimates given the prior information. Thus, the mean 99.9% VaR for Bayes may be higher than the one for MLE, but the increment of 99.9% VaR due to model uncertainty given the 99.9% VaR without model uncertainty is always less for the Bayesian estimation than for the ML estimation.

This paper has analyzed the estimation of default probabilities and correlations using MLE and Bayesian techniques. Results were stratified by model risk, forecast horizons, and consideration of realizations of frailty effects. The forecast accuracy of portfolio default rates and bank capital (VaR) sufficiency to cover loss realizations were measured. Our key findings are as follows.

Firstly, the timely control for observable information increases the fit in terms of the portfolio default rate over time as well as the propensity to provide sufficient capital protection for financial institutions during severe economic downturns. The literature has identified CLTV and the FICO score as key drivers of mortgage delinquency risk. We add loan-level and macro-economic variables. We find that the out-of-sample default rate is substantially better forecasted by these models. Examples for timely control of information are quarterly forecasting, control for time-varying variables and control for an autoregressive adjustment.

Secondly, the inclusion of an autoregressive adjustment in credit risk models is an econometric novelty that provides for substantially better portfolio default rate forecasts and is easy to apply. The auto-correlation of the systematic random risk factors may be utilized to considerably improve the accuracy of forecast models. The adjustment is based on the gap between the past realized and forecast default rate. We confirm the superior forecast accuracy out-of-sample and out-of-time. We also find that the resulting VaR forecasts are more likely to cover realized default rates. The adjustment is practical and useful for single-period as well as multi-period models. Hence, banks should focus on the identification of past systematic under-assessments and over-assessments of estimated default probabilities relative to the realization of risk and make a periodic adjustment to the default probability models.

Thirdly, the consideration of model risk contributes to capital adequacy. Credit risk models are empirically estimated and parameter estimates are uncertain. The recognition of this uncertainty (via standard errors and empirical correlations) increases the VaRs.

Banks that do not fully include time-varying information and model risk, should take this into account when selecting the appropriate bank-internal confidence level (i.e., select a higher confidence level) or model horizons (i.e., select shorter forecast horizons). In addition, bank regulators may adjust the standards for regulatory capital and stress-testing.

With regard to Bayesian and MLE estimation techniques, we find that informative Bayesian models using prior information obtained from a training sample lead to similar parameter estimates for similar prior and posterior distributions but lower standard errors and lower VaR forecasts relative to MLE. However, this result has a limited impact on the VaR sufficiency during the GFC.

Estimation techniques, model risk and auto-regressive processes are likely to be important for other risk parameters. Important areas are loss rates given default models (compare Leow and Mues, 2012 and Lucas (2006)) or financial products such as corporate loans, credit derivatives and securitization. We would like to encourage the discipline to analyze these important issues in credit risk to complete our understanding.

Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function in Eq. (4) by integrating out the unobservable factors for

                     , respectively. Note that the posterior distribution of ft
                      in Eq. (39) only depends on defaults at time t. Thus, the conditional posterior distributions in Eq. (38)
and in Eq. (39) facilitate MCMC and save computing time.
