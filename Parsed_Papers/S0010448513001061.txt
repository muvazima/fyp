                  Surface development is used in many manufacturing planning operations, e.g., for garments, ships and automobiles. However, most freeform surfaces used in design are not developable, and therefore the developed patterns are not isometric to the original design surface. In some domains, the CAD model is created by interpolating two given space curves. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain a G2 quasi-developable Bezier surface interpolating two arbitrary space curves. The given curves are first split into a number of piecewise Bezier curves and elemental Bezier patches each of which passes through four splitting points are constructed. All neighboring elemental patches are G2 connected and they are assembled optimally in terms of the degree of developability (the integral Gaussian curvature). Experiments show that the final composite Bezier surface is superior to a lofted one which is defined regardless of the final surface developability.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Surface developability is highly demanded for manufacturing considerations in industrial applications like garment design  [1], sheet-metal forming  [2–4] and windshield design  [5], in which products are often made from planar patterns by welding, pumping or sewing. In these industries, designers often sketch out two space curves, and hope to interpolate them with a developable or nearly developable surface. In practice, the designer uses a loft or skinning method to build a NURBS surface passing through the given curves, and then analyzes the resultant surface to see whether it can be flattened into one or several planar patterns within the allowable distortion. If not, the curves will be repeatedly modified until the desired developability of the loft surface can be obtained. Lofting or skinning is only a general interpolating method which disregards the developability geometric constraint; they suffer from among others one particular problem: the curves may have been modified too much to meet the developability constraint that their final shapes no longer represent the designer’s original intent. Furthermore, if curves themselves are complicated, using the above method to model a developable surface will often become impossible.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct a

                      composite of four-sided Bezier patches to interpolate two arbitrary space curves. These patches are optimally assembled together in terms of developability. The algorithm is inspired by the work of  [6]. The work of  [6] uses planar triangles to interpolate two polylines and an optimal triangulation can be obtained from the given polylines. Our work extends it to polynomial surfaces, and each pair of the neighboring patches will be

                      continuity is sometimes necessary for the purpose of both aesthetic and functional requirement in engineering. For example, in CAM design,

                      can avoid creating abrupt changes on a surface; in sheet metal applications such as a ship hull and the wing and body of an aircraft,

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section  2 reviews the related works. Section  3 defines the problem, with the problem formulation and a general description of our proposed algorithm. Sections  4 and 5 provide details of our methodology, while Section  6 shows the experimental results with discussions. Section  7 concludes the paper.

There is a rich body of study in developable surfaces, especially in the context of NURBS or 
                        B
                     -Spline surfaces  [10–16]. In  [12] a condition is proposed under which a developable Bezier surface can be constructed with two boundary curves. The boundary curves in  [12] are of at most degree 3 and are restricted to lie in parallel planes. Their work was extended by Frey and Bindschadler  [14] by generalizing the degree of the directrices. Maekawa and Chalfant  [16] extended Aumann’s algorithm to
                        B
                     -Spline curves by segmenting the original 
                        B
                     -Spline curves into multi-segment planar Bezier curves. Chu and Sequin  [13] proposed a new method to design a developable Bezier patch. In their method, after one boundary curve is freely specified, five more degrees of freedom are available for the second boundary curve of the same degree. Aumann  [10,11] utilized De Casteljau algorithm to design developable Bezier surfaces through a Bezier curve of arbitrary degree and shape. However, the approach often results in unexpected or undesirable surfaces. In the work of  [4], a quasi-developable 
                        B
                     -spline surface of degree

                        ×
                        n
                      can be determined after searching through a series of ruling pairs. Projective geometry methods exploiting point–plane duality were investigated by the groups of Ravani and Pottmann  [17–21].

Some researchers have used spatial kinematics and line geometry to approximate a given surface by a developable one[22–24]. The idea is to generate a developable surface by sweeping a line along a helical motion. This method is widely used in reverse engineering. Given a set of scattered data points, it is required to find a developable surface of which the generator points are as close as possible to the given points. In Hoschek and Schneider[23,24], the distance from a point to a line was used, leading to a nonlinear optimization problem. Pottmann and Wallner  [21] and Hoschek and Schwanecke  [23,24] independently introduced the error measurement between planes, leading to linear algorithms. Special attention was paid to controlling the regression curve and how to combine the pieces of patches with imposed continuity conditions.

Recently, methods based on discrete data representation have been proposed for design of quasi-developable surfaces, owing to the rapid increase of computing power and popularity of 3D meshes. In this realm, triangle or quad meshes are sought after to achieve maximum developability, with the given interpolating constraints satisfied. In his pioneering work, Frey  [25] showed how to approximate buckled binder wrap surfaces by calculating out the 
                        d
                     -vertices based on the fact that Gaussian curvature at every point on a developable surface is zero, and this condition can be expressed by requiring the internal angle at every internal vertex to be 
                        2
                        π
                     . In  [26], triangular strips are designed by grouping original triangles on the mesh which share similar topological distances, and the resulting pattern gives out a near-developable unfolding of the mesh. Wang and Tang  [27] minimized the total discrete Gaussian curvature for a polygonal surface by relocating each mesh vertex. Tang and Chen  [28] satisfied some interpolation requirements and minimized the developability change by a mesh deformation method and the method was further applied to cloth simulation  [29]. In  [7,30,6] efficient algorithms are given for finding the best (discrete) parameterization of an interpolating ruled surface for a range of optimization objectives, developability included. The algorithm given in  [6] is based on the well-known Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, is deterministic, and is able to find the global optimum. It will be a key component in our optimization algorithm. In the work of  [8], a 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                      planar triangular strip can be constructed to support two curves with branches.

For any two arbitrary space curves, there can be many ruled surfaces interpolating the two, of which the one that we are interested is the developable surface. Unfortunately, there may not exist such a desired interpolating developable surface unless the given curves meet some restricting geometric constraints (cf.  [13]). For certain industries in which some materials such as metal and leather are used, a slight deformation during the manufacturing procedure is allowed due to plasticity. So, from this point of view, a nearly or quasi-developable surface is often acceptable. For this purpose, a criterion–developability degree–should be defined to measure how close a surface is to being developable. For a singly curved surface (ruled surface), the warp angle (normal twist) between the normal vectors at the end points of a ruling is usually used to measure the developability degree  [8,4]. In our algorithm, the final surface will be a composite surface 
                           S
                         made of Bezier patches of degree 5×4; we thus define the integral of the Gaussian curvature

Based on the above definition of developability degree, we want to construct a quasi-developable composite surface to interpolate the two given curves and hope its developability degree is close to zero as much as possible. Considering the fact that a Bezier surface is widely used in current commercial CAD packages, and it can be easily converted to a NURBS surface, which is the de-facto standard to represent product geometric shapes in industry, it is adopted as the basic tile element in our method. Without loss of generalities, the two given curves

                        : the two given curves and the scheme of elemental patch construction are both the same in (a) and (b); however, if those patches are assembled differently, two different interpolation surfaces will be obtained, with drastically different degrees of developability. Therefore, the key to our method is how to find an optimal patch assembling scheme to achieve overall maximum degree of developability. Another problem that we must solve is, once the patch assembly scheme (connection correspondence) is fixed, how to define a

One of our objectives is to find an optimal patch assembly, i.e., the optimal connection correspondence. In principle, the algorithms of  [7,6] will be modified to cater to four-sided patches. The basic idea is to selectively carry out two movements–moving to the next splitting point on

A Bridge Boundary Patch (BBP) is an interpolatory surface comprising a collection of elemental Bezier patches (EBP), all of which are four-sided Bezier patches except at the two ends of the curves where triangular patches may be needed. The four boundary curves of an EBP are made of two bridge curves and two boundary curves. The two boundary curves (green curve segment in Fig. 3
                        ) are coincident with one or two curve segments of

From the above rules, it is evident that triangular EBPs are allowed to occur only at the ends of the given curves, and four-sided EBPs are preferred tiling elements. Intuitively, if all the tiling elements are triangular patches, the modeling seems to be more powerful, as the valence of any vertex can be arbitrary. This flexibility however inordinately increases the combinatorial complexity of the problem. Moreover, vertices where many triangular patches are incident with each other often leave a “swarming” impression to the human eye which actually is not preferred in practice. Therefore, four-sided EBPs are adopted in our method.

As each EBP has at least three possible ways of construction, i.e., cases (a)–(c) in Fig. 3 (for a boundary EBP, two more cases exist), given two curves, there will be many valid candidate BBPs, all of which interpolate the same given curves. Conceivably, there exists an optimal BBP in terms of maximum developability. Explicitly, the total Gaussian curvature of the sought after BBP should be the minimum among all the candidate BBPs. Our preliminary experiments show that the BBP thus obtained is much closer to being developable than that using the lofting method (which is the common method in practice).

Defining a BBP is equivalent to determining the EBPs (i.e., the cases in Fig. 3) and the connections among them. The solution to the optimal connecting correspondence is not trivial. Referring to Fig. 3, it is noted that any BBP is defined by deciding how to propagate the right-side bridge curve, in other words, deciding one out of the three possible cases Fig. 3(a)–(c). At any time of the propagation process, there is a “front” bridge curve denoted as 
                           L

                        , we will construct one triangular Bezier patch to interpolate the end points and the non-constructed portion of

                         or 
                           
                              
                                 C

                        . After mapping all possibilities of front-lines’ advancement under the rules of BBP construction, we will get a directed acyclic graph (DAG), e.g., Fig. 4(c). In this graph, it is noted that triangular patches occur only at the boundary nodes (colored red in Fig. 4(c)). In our algorithm, a triangular Bezier patch is regarded as a degenerated four-sided EBP. By assigning suitable non-negative weights to the edges in the mapping DAG, the optimal connecting correspondence problem is transformed to that of finding a shortest path in the graph from (1, 1) to 
                           
                              (

                              n

                        , which can be solved using dynamic programming, i.e., Dijkstra’s algorithm. One point worth mentioning is that if curves 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         and

                         are closed, the start node (1, 1) and end node 
                           
                              (
                              m
                              ,
                              n

                         should belong to a same front line 
                           L
                        , whose determination is not trivial. In our current solution, the two curves will be first projected into a plane determined by the standard Principal Component Analysis method. Assuming that the closed region is simple and convex, for

                                 1

                        , their leftmost (or in any direction) extreme point will be set as the start node (1, 1). If the closed region consists of holes or is concave, then “cuts” should be created to connect holes to external boundaries so to decompose the domain into convex components, and the same scheme for a simple convex region will then be used.

Increasing the number of splitting points will affect the performance of the algorithm mainly in two aspects: (1) the number of EBPs to be constructed will increase; and (2) the computing time for determining the connection of correspondence of 
                           
                              {

                         will increase. On the other hand, a larger number of splitting points will better capture the features of the curves and in turn offer more flexibility better for the final BBP. Our experiments show that once the sampling density reaches a certain level, the room for improvement will be limited. Considering the above factors, the splitting points are adaptively sampled according to the two criteria: the curvature 
                           k
                         and the sample segment length

To determine an EBP, its two bridge curves must be first determined, which requires first to decide the degree of

                        . Due to numerical stability and other concerns, a lower degree is preferred. However, it must satisfy the conditions of Theorems 1 and 2, which is not straightforward. Actually,

                         must be non-zero. Thus

                         at degree 3, the left side of Eq. (1) should be at least of degree 4. Simple calculation tells us that the degree of the u partial derivative (the left side of Eq. (1)) is the same as the degree of 
                           R

Each EBP will be bounded by two bridge curves (degree-4 Bezier curves) and two boundary curves (quintic Bezier curves). In other words, all EBPs will be four-sided except at the two ends where one boundary curve will degenerate into a point. Our main task is to decide the polynomials in Eqs. (1)–(4).

                           G
                        . Actually,

                         can be any polynomial of degree no more than quartic. For simplicity, it is chosen to be linear in 
                           v
                        . Because a flatter patch is generally wanted, the magnitude of 
                           G
                         is preferred to be minimized. For a

Refer to Eq. (5), since the Gaussian curvature is preferred to be zero, numerical computing can be used here to minimize the integral Gaussian curvature squared over the curve 
                           R

                        , but it may encounter robustness problem and impair the algorithm performance. Instead, as an alternative, we simply minimize the Gaussian curvatures at the two end points of 
                           R

Based on the ways how an EBP is constructed and how its integral Gaussian curvature is calculated, both of which depend only on the local geometry, the weight

                         is easily seen to be a constant. In other words, the mapping graph is path-independent. As a result, the graph is static. Therefore, we can transform our optimal BBP problem into an equivalent one of finding the shortest path from node (1, 1) to node 
                           
                              (

                         in the graph, which is a direct acyclic graph (DAG) with weighted edges. The well-known Dijkstra’s algorithm can then be employed to find this shortest path.

The proposed algorithm has been implemented in C++ and tested on an Intel i5-760 3 GHz, 2 GB DDR2 PC. In our experiments, as a benchmark, we also generated a BBP for the two given curves using the standard lofting method  [33]. All the final BBPs in our test results are unfolded into a plane and compared with their counterparts using the lofting method, in terms of the integral Gaussian curvature

                      is the area of the corresponding 2D pattern. All the computed statistics data are given in Table 1
                     .


                     Example I. Fig. 10
                      shows a simple case. Columns (c) and (e) show the results of the final BBP by our method based on the minimum Gaussian curvature and the minimum surface area criterion (surface area is also an important industrial consideration, cf.  [34,35]), respectively, whereas column (d) displays the benchmark lofted surface. All the results are

                      continuous. In either the Gaussian curvature or surface area, the figures (also the data in Table 1) evidently demonstrate that our method is far more superior to the commonly used lofting method.


                     Example II. Fig. 11
                      is an example in a ship-hull application, in which a product is usually made out of a 2D plate by pumping, and the property of developability will ensure that the product can have longer lifetime as the internal energy has been fully released. One of the side boards (Fig. 11(a)) is first modeled by lofting two space curves, which results in a very narrow and sharp wrinkle in the middle with high Gaussian curvature, as shown in Fig. 11(f). By using our method, a much improved result is obtained (compare Fig. 11(e) with Fig. 11(f) and also refer to Table 1), which reduced the total Gaussian curvature by almost 70% as compared to the lofting method. In this test, we further studied the effect of the normal vectors associated with the boundary curves. The normal vector at a splitting point is user-specified, which can be utilized to improve the developability at some places with high curvature. For example, as shown in Fig. 11(e), the right corner in the bottom has high Gaussian curvature. If for some splitting points near that corner we rotate the normal vectors by an angle 
                        π
                        /
                        6
                      counter-clock wise along their corresponding tangent directions, the final BBP will rid of the problem, as shown in Fig. 11(g). Nonetheless, given freedom, how should a normal vector be decided is nontrivial. If not set properly, worse results may be obtained, as demonstrated by Fig. 11(h) and (i). Another point worth mentioning is that in many industrial applications some correspondences between certain pairs of points on the two boundary curves are already pre-determined. In such case, our method should be run independently for every pair of corresponding sub-curves, as shown in Fig. 11(b) and (c).


                     Example III. This example is used to illustrate the effect of the splitting number 
                        N
                      (number of sample points) on the final surface. Increasing

                     ) will enhance the final BBP in two aspects: (1) better surface developability; and (2) better visual appearance between neighboring BBPs. Fig. 12
                      shows a design strip that provides a transition between the rear and front (toe) part of a shoe upper, as the front upper is often remodeled with new fashion styles while the rear part is relatively stable. On this strip the neighboring EBPs are

                      connected, ensured by the construction of each EBP. But the strip is only

                      connected to its neighboring surfaces. By increasing the number of splitting points, the smoothness of the connections is enhanced (see Fig. 12(a)–(c)), and the developability of the strip increases as well (see Table 1). On the other hand, because our algorithm has an approximate time complexity of

                        N
                      significantly increases the computing time. Much of this time is used to compute the energy of EBPs (the weights of the edges in the mapping graph). As the calculations of the weights are independent of each other, multi-core programming could be used for the task.


                     Example IV. This example is also from ship-hull design. The three given curves shown in Fig. 13
                     (a) are from  [4] which are called Sheer, Chine and Centre line, respectively. Two surfaces are required to interpolate the pair of Sheer and Chine and the pair of Chine and Centre line, respectively. We sample the three curves with three different sampling density

                     , and the corresponding BBPs from our algorithm are depicted in Fig. 13(d), (e) and (g), respectively. It is clearly seen in these three figures that, although with different densities, the three connecting correspondences are analogous. The ruling distribution in  [4] are shown in Fig. 13(b) (copied from  [4]), which is similar to Fig. 13(e). The maximum Gaussian curvature in this case is −2.97∗10−7 compared with 2∗10−6 in  [4]. For the benchmark comparison, we applied the standard lofting method  [33] and Fig. 13(h) displays the iso-curves on the resulting interpolation surfaces, whose sharp difference with our result (Fig. 13(e)) is clearly manifested. The Gaussian distribution maps of our result (Fig. 13(e)) and the lofted surface (Fig. 13(h)) are depicted in Fig. 13(f) and (i) respectively, from which it is obviously seen that ours is much superior to the lofted surface.


                     Example V. This example shows the usage of our method in multiple-curves interpolation applications. Fig. 14
                      shows a case of designing a skirt by interpolating 10 design curves. For each pair of neighboring curves, we can construct a BBP. As discussed in Example III, by increasing the number of splitting points, better smoothness can be obtained across adjacent BBPs.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In many industrial applications, designers are required to determine the shape of a developable interpolating surface between two given space curves. In this paper, we propose a method that interpolates two arbitrary space curves by a composite of 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      connected Bezier patches, which are optimally assembled to achieve the maximum degree of developability. The algorithm first splits the given curves into a number of segments, and then constructs a series of ordered four-sided 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      Bezier patches to interpolate these segments. The optimization is realized by finding the best connecting correspondence (the matching segments on the opposite curves), which is formulated as a dynamic programming problem and solved efficiently by using the well-known Dijkstra’s algorithm. Our preliminary experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is fast, numerically stable, and yields a surface that is, in terms of surface developability, far superior to the counterpart surface generated by the popular lofting method, which is the current standard method used by the most commercial CAD solutions. The limitations of our algorithm lie in two main aspects:
                        
                           (1)
                           The construction of EBP in the current work mainly focuses on 
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                               constraint and enforcing zero Gaussian curvature on its boundary. It is however only one particular construction among many other possibilities and the optimality of the final BBP obtained by our algorithm only pertains to this particular EBP construction.

Although the final BBP is 
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                               continuous, the normal vectors’ information is only used at the splitting points; consequently, in applications of more than two curves to interpolate, between each pair of neighboring BBPs only 
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       0
                                    
                                 
                               continuity is guaranteed.

Future work should be planned to solve the above two issues—the optimization should be taken early in the sampling stage and it should consider different choices of EBP definition. Another future task is to devise a new construction scheme which takes advantage of the normal vector field on the given curves, such that any two adjacent BBPs will be
