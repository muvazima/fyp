@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Digital Image Watermarking is an important technique in the area of information security. It is one of the important techniques which are used for safeguarding the origins of the image by protecting it against Piracy. Multiple watermarking approaches combine the advantages of single watermarking to create a sophisticated multiple watermarking techniques, which is efficient in terms of high security and robustness. Jaiswal and Patil (2012) applied text watermarking to image and text documents will detract the invisibility and robustness of embedded watermarks. This problem can be resolved by using Dual Watermarking Scheme Based on Threshold Cryptography (DWTC) for Web Document. DWTC consists of three processes that is generation of watermark in web document embedding watermark into web document, and detection of watermark from embedded web document. Based on threshold cryptography, generation of watermark process can increase the robustness. But Dual Watermarking based on threshold cryptography has less capacity of watermarking and tamperproof performance. To resolve this problem, they can increase watermarking capacity and tamperproof performance by means of applying multiple watermarking.


                     Nasir et al. (2008) proposed a novel and robust colour image watermarking technique in spatial domain based on embedding four identical watermarks into the blue component of the host image. In the extraction process, the original image is available and five watermarks can be extracted from different regions of the watermarked image and only one watermark is detected or constructed from the five watermarks according to the highest value of normalized cross correlation (NCC). The experimental results show that their proposed scheme is robust for several attacks. Their proposed technique is also secure, and has the correct key to extract the watermark.


                     Kallel et al. (2010) applied a multiple watermarking technique in the wavelet field to preserve the traceability and the record of the medical image diagnosis made by doctors. Their technique is to hide information in the medical image and at the same time to ensure its imperceptibility. Their diagnosis made by the practitioner is the data inserted in the image. The fundamental challenge of their paper is how to hide the full diagnosis of each practitioner in the image ensuring a good quality of the image at the same time.

                              Many digital watermarking techniques have been proposed to solve this problem by hiding an invisible watermark in an image to prove the ownership of the image. Because of most prominent applications, embedded information about the owner to prevent others from claiming copyright is adopted.

Generally, the embedded information of medical images is exchanged from hospitals to required area through unsecured open networks. It creates a threat which results in undesirable outcome. Considering this fact the multiple watermarking techniques are used in the proposed a watermarking scheme. This is important for addressing different problems like high security of medical images, more robustness and to preserve the privacy of patients. The block diagram of medical imaging watermarking is shown in Fig. 1
                                 .

The extraction process of a watermarking algorithm achieves transparency and robustness. The understanding between the requirements of transparency and robustness is considered as an optimization problem and is removed by applying genetic algorithms.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

In recent years, several digital image watermarking algorithms have been proposed based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The wavelet transform which is based on small waves has gained widespread acceptance in signal processing and image compression. Anoop Suraj et al. (2014) reviewed discrete wavelet transform based image fusion and denoising in FPGA. They effectively fused the MRI images of a patient suffering from sarcoma using Daubechies mother wavelet. Their approach is focused on the FPGA implementation of algorithm and the scaling-up of the algorithm to perform real time operations. Wavelet-coding is especially suitable for the applications of tolerable degradation and scalability. The wavelet analysis is the heart of multi-resolution analysis decomposition of an image into sub images of different size resolution levels. The proposed method is two level wavelet decomposition of original image and the watermark is applied on a low frequency sub-band (LL2).

Singular value decomposition is a mathematical approach with several applications in watermarking, image compression, and other signal processing areas. In SVD-based watermarking algorithms add the watermark information to the singular values of the diagonal matrix S in such a way to meet the robustness and imperceptibility requirements. If the watermark is added in the orthogonal matrices of SVD then the imperceptibility of the original image is improved and it is not robust to many attacks because the matrix elements of orthogonal matrices are very small. The SVD of an m

                        n image matrix F has a decomposition form, where m number of rows and n number of columns

                                    F
                                    =

                        ×
                        n diagonal matrix with singular values on the diagonal. An enhanced semi-blind SVD–DWT-based image watermarking technique has been introduced (Sleit et al., 2012). Experimental results also showed that their proposed scheme outperformed in terms of robustness with respect to various attacks.

Genetic algorithms are a powerful adaptive method to solve, search and optimization problems. It is one of the artificial intelligent techniques for optimization. Genetic algorithms are more robust and better than conventional algorithms. In genetic algorithms each individual is coded as a finite length vector of variables and these individuals are linked with chromosomes, then a set of chromosomes form a population. Genetic algorithms start with some randomly selected population is called the first generation and then each individual in the population corresponding with a solution is to the problem domain. The fitness function is also known as the objective functions are formed by combining two metrics are peak signal to noise ratio and normalized correlation. The fitness function is used to evaluate all the individuals in the population and the best individual along with the corresponding fitness value are evaluated. The three main operators in genetic algorithms are: selection, crossover and mutation operator applied to the chromosomes repeatedly. The flowchart of a genetic algorithm is shown in Fig. 2
                        . Kumsawat and Attakitmongcol (2004) developed a technique for optimizing the image watermarking using genetic algorithms. Their method is applied to improve the quality of the watermarked image and the robustness of the watermark.

In multiple watermarking techniques more than one watermark are embedded into the original image. Sheppard et al. (2001) introduced three multiple watermarking algorithms with some properties. Such algorithms describe some potential security problems in multiple watermarking applications that are not applicable for single watermark applications. The multiple watermarking techniques are discussed as follows,

In the embedding process, the multiple watermarks are embedded one after the other to get watermarked images. In the extraction process, the multiple watermarks are extracted from one after the other from the watermarked images. This approach is also denoted as Re-watermarking technique. Mark et al. (2007) demonstrated that the watermark interface is a threat to reliable detection in multiple re-watermarking scenarios. In re-watermarking the watermarks are embedded one after the other. Employing disjoint frequency bands for embedding different watermarks turn out to be more effective and capable of maintaining reasonable detection correlation in multiple embedding applications. The classical robust watermarking technique for multiple re-watermarking is discussed (Kampfer et al., 2006). Their method found that non-blind as well as blind algorithms may be employed for that purpose provided that correct reference image data is recorded and stored for the non-blind algorithms. A surprisingly large number of different watermarks may be detected and also robustness is maintained to a certain extent using their approach.

The segmented watermarking method performs segmentation of the original image so that each watermark has its own separate embedding area. In the proposed work, one watermark is embedded into odd-numbered rows and columns and another watermark is embedded into even-numbered rows and columns in colour image of Lena. A new rotation and scaling invariant image watermarking scheme is proposed (Nantha Priya and Lenty Stuwart, 2010). The image is segmented into a number of homogeneous regions and the feature points are extracted. Based on the image normalization and orientation assignment, the translation, scaling and rotation invariant regions can be used for watermark embedding and extraction. The segmented image is modelled as mixture generalized Gaussian distribution and this model is the basis of mathematical analysis of various aspects of the watermarking processes such as probability of error, embedding strength adjustment. The effectiveness and accuracy of their proposed scheme is established through experimental results.


                           Wheeler et al. (2004) introduced the notion of weighted segmented digital watermarking, and generalized work on cropping-resistance in segmented watermarking to provide performance measures for the weighted case. Segmented watermarking of still images in which segments are formed by dividing the image into square blocks, each of which contains one contributor's watermark. If a watermark is present in one or more segments of their work, the owner of that watermark is reported to be an owner of the work as a whole by an arbiter. Their work compared performance measurement of watermark embedding patterns in the presence of cropping attacks.

A set of schemes and their analysis for multiple watermark placements that maximize resilience to cropping attack is presented (Frikken and Atallah, 2003). Watermarking is a tool for digital rights management, and inserting multiple watermarks into the same data is an important application. Dehghan and Ebrahim Safavi (2010) presented a new wavelet-based image watermarking technique which is suitable for image copyright protection. Their method the host image was segmented to small blocks and the watermark data is embedded in the low pass wavelet coefficients of each block with one of two methods. Due to low computational complexity of the proposed approach, their algorithm can be implemented in real time. Experimental results demonstrated the imperceptibility of their proposed method and its high robustness against various attacks.

Composite watermarking is the process of mixing information of two images of a scene in to a single composite image that is certainly more beneficial and is also far better with regard to visible conception or computer finalizing. The objective of composite watermarking is to combine supporting multi-sensor, multi-temporal and multi-view facts directly into one particular new image. The aim should be to decrease the uncertainty and to limit redundancy in the productivity while maximizing applicable facts. A new singular value decomposition-discrete wavelet transform (SVD-DWT) based composite image watermarking algorithm is presented (Liang, 2006). Watermark is embedded in a high frequency image by singular value decomposition and this is unlike traditional viewpoint that assumes watermarking should be embeds watermarking in low or middle frequency to have good robustness. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that their proposed algorithm is able to withstand a variety of attacks including common geometric attacks.

The proposed scheme, DWT-SVD based multiple watermarking techniques using genetic algorithms are adopted. The watermark embedding, extraction and genetic algorithm process are discussed below.

                              The original image and the first watermark are decomposed by two levels using discrete wavelet transforms.

The SVD is applied to LL2 sub-bands of decomposing the original and watermark images.

The singular value of watermark image is embedded into singular value of original image by the following equation

                              a.
                              Initialize the parameters: crossover rate, mutation rate, initial population size and number of iterations.

Generate randomly the initial population specified by performing the watermark embedding and extraction process, as the attacked watermarked image and extracted watermark is generated for each individual.

The selection of the fitness function is based on the magnitude of imperceptibility and robustness as follows:

Here, the NC value is the average value of two watermarks. In Eq. (12), if the value of 100 is multiplied with PSNR, the fitness value increases more by increasing the value of PSNR rather than NC. So, optimization of imperceptibility takes place for a given value of robustness. The imperceptibility value has a positive peak signal to noise ratio with the fitness function.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this paper, a multiple image watermarking technique is proposed based on wavelet domain and singular value decomposition using genetic algorithms for colour images. Fig. 3(a)–(c) shows the 512×512 original sizes of Lena, medical and military images respectively. Moreover, 48×48 size colour logo is used as watermark images that are shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e).

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

The performance of watermarking technique can be evaluated by considering the peak signal to noise Ratio (PSNR). The PSNR is used to measure the quality of watermarked image, which is given by

To prove the robustness, the watermarked image is tested with selected attacks such as geometric attacks (rotation, translation, cropping, row–column blanking and row–column copying), removal attacks (median filtering, wiener filtering, JPEG compression) and common image processing attacks (salt & pepper noise, Gaussian noise, speckle noise, sharpening, smoothing).

To prove the robustness, the watermarked images are tested with selected attacks on multiple watermarking techniques. Tables 3 and 4
                        
                         show the performance of PSNR and NC values on multiple watermarking techniques (successive, segmented and composite) for Lena colour image.

A multiple watermarking technique is proposed based on DWT and SVD using genetic algorithms. Table 5

The parameters are chosen by trial and error, from that the parameters which have furnished the best results are presented in the paper. The related parameters for the experiments using a genetic tool are as follows: the population size is 20, the number of variables is 2, the maximum number of generation is 5, the probability of crossover is 0.8, and the probability of mutation is 0.2.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A digital image multiple successive watermarking scheme based on the wavelet transform is proposed (Mohananthini and Yamuna, 2013). The successive watermarking method is useful in the applications, where extraction of one watermark should depend on the extract of other watermark. The experimental results show that their proposed method has good imperceptibility on watermarked images and against attacks. Comparison of multiple watermarking techniques (successive and segmented) using discrete wavelet transforms is proposed (Mohananthini et al., 2013). Their proposed scheme shows good performance on original colour images in terms of imperceptibility and the segmented watermarking has better visual quality on watermarked image when compared with successive watermarking.

In our previous work the successive and segmented watermarking algorithm was analyzed (Mohananthini and Yamuna, 2013; Mohananthini et al., 2013). The present work is added with SVD-based method, composite watermarking, and optimization.

The combination of original image with DWT and SVD along with watermark displays high imperceptibility and robustness. While they are treated alone, the original image with DWT or original image with SVD with watermark shows varying high and low values in either cases. Thus, demonstrating the importance of taking DWT and SVD in the original image for watermarking is important.

Regarding the analysis of multiple watermarking techniques, the composite watermarking achieves high PSNR when compared with successive and segmented watermarking technique. The successive watermarking technique achieves more robustness for wiener filtering, rotation, row–column blanking and row–column copying. The segmented watermarking technique achieves more robustness for salt & pepper noise, median filtering, translation, JPEG compression and smoothing. The composite watermarking technique achieves more robustness for sharpening, speckle noise, cropping, JPEG compression and smoothing. From the results, it is observed that the multiple watermarking techniques achieve more robustness when compared with the single watermarking. In multiple watermarking algorithms, the image quality is degraded with embedding a new watermarking into the image. For solving this problem, multiple watermarking is tested using the genetic algorithms (Gas).

In this present work, the following are the outcomes of the chosen parameters in the genetic algorithm which has displayed best results. The genetic algorithm is utilized for solving the optimization problem in watermarking. In the watermarking algorithm PSNR and NC are the two important characteristics parameters. These two parameters must be as large as possible for a superior watermarking algorithm. However PSNR and NC are associated in such way that maximization of PSNR reduces the value of NC. Hence, the watermarking algorithm is described with parameters and genetic algorithm are used to find the best values of parameters to obtain a specified performance of the watermarking system in terms of PSNR and NC.

Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective by checking the fitness function in GA. This includes both factors related to the robustness under attacks (salt & pepper noise, Gaussian noise, speckle noise, JPEG compression, median filtering and wiener filtering) and the improvement in the watermarked image quality with genetic algorithms.

To prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the robustness (NC) value is compared with the SVD-based single watermarking schemes (Ghafoor and Imran, 2012). The authors proposed the watermark which is embedded into the singular values of the discrete wavelet transform sub-band in the original image. The NC values are listed in Table 8
                        , and it is evident that the robustness performance of the proposed scheme is superior to the existing one for Lena image (scaling factor value is 0.03).

To prove the effectiveness of multiple watermarking techniques, the robustness is compared with existing method (Jagadeesh et al., 2012). An Image watermarking scheme based on Singular Value Decomposition, Quantization and Genetic algorithm are presented in Jagadeesh et al. (2012). In their SVD based single watermarking algorithm has a drawback of robustness. For resolving this problem, the DWT–SVD based multiple watermarking techniques using genetic algorithm is presented. The values are listed in Table 9
                        , it is evident that the robustness of multiple watermarking techniques is superior to existing method for the number of generation 5.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, the optimization of multiple watermarking techniques using genetic algorithms has been presented. The embedding and extraction process uses the multi resolution analysis of wavelet transform and singular value decomposition. In multiple watermarking techniques, the composite watermarking achieves high imperceptibility when compared with the successive and segmented watermarking technique. The experimental result shows that the multiple watermarking techniques achieve more robustness when compared with the single watermarking technique. The optimization is to maximize the performance of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation (NC). The experimental result demonstrates the presented work achieves good imperceptibility and robustness against attacks using genetic algorithms. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed by comparing it with the existing scheme.
