                  This paper addresses Markov Decision Processes over compact state and action spaces. We investigate the special case of linear dynamics and piecewise-linear and convex immediate costs for the average cost criterion. This model is very general and covers many interesting examples, for instance in inventory management. Due to the curse of dimensionality, the problem is intractable and optimal policies usually cannot be computed, not even for instances of moderate size.
                  We show the existence of optimal policies and of convex and bounded relative value functions that solve the average cost optimality equation under reasonable and easy-to-check assumptions. Based on these insights, we propose an approximate relative value iteration algorithm based on piecewise-linear convex relative value function approximations. Besides computing good policies, the algorithm also provides lower bounds to the optimal average cost, which allow us to bound the optimality gap of any given policy for a given instance.
                  The algorithm is applied to the well-studied Multiple Sourcing Problem as known from inventory management. Multiple sourcing is known to be a hard problem and usually tackled by parametric heuristics. We analyze several MSP instances with two and more suppliers and compare our results to state-of-the-art heuristics. For the considered scenarios, our policies are always at least as good as the best known heuristic, and strictly better in most cases. Moreover, by using the computed lower bounds we show for all instances that the optimality gap has never exceeded 5%, and that it has been much smaller for most of them.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper we address Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with compact state and action space, linear dynamics as well as piecewise-linear and convex immediate costs. We denote this class of MDPs as Stochastic Linear Control Problems (SLCPs). SLCPs are a broad class of problems that represent many practically relevant problems in various areas, for instance in inventory management.

We study existence and characterization policies that are optimal for the average cost criterion. In particular, we develop conditions that imply the existence of a convex solution to the Average Cost Optimality Equation (ACOE). Such solutions can be used to characterize optimal policies. In addition, we develop an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm for SLCPs. The algorithm generates piecewise-linear and convex relative value function approximations, together with a non-decreasing sequence of lower bounds to the optimal average cost. The relative value functions approximation can then be used to derive a good policies. We show the effectiveness of this algorithm on the Multiple Sourcing Problem (MSP) known in inventory management and compare the results to the current best-known heuristics.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the related literature for average-cost MDPs, ADP, and the MSP. In Section 3, we formally introduce SLCPs. Section 4 discusses the related concepts and results of MDP theory. In Section 5, we review and extend results about the existence of optimal policies and relative value functions for general state space MDPs. In particular, we prove the existence of a convex solution to the ACOE under rather mild assumptions that are typically fulfilled in practice. This motivates our approximation algorithm, which is given in Section 6. In Section 7, we apply our algorithms to various MSP instances, compare the results with state-of-the-art heuristics, and discuss the differences.

In this section we review the relevant literature about MDPs, ADP and MSP, and discuss our contributions in the context of existing results and open questions.

While average cost MDP with finite state and action spaces are well understood (Bertsekas, 2007), much less in known for MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. From the point of view of the present paper, the existing work on continuous state space MDPs can be classified into two groups, distinguished by continuity assumptions on the transition law.

Most authors assume the transition law to be strongly continuous (Hernández-Lerma & Lasserre, 1990; Montes-de Oca & Hernández-Lerma, 1996; Kurano, Nakagami, & Huang, 2000). This simplifies the analysis of the existence of optimal policies and relative value functions. However, in the more general model considered here, we only assume a weakly continuous transition law, so these results cannot be applied.

There are only very few papers that consider weakly continuous transition laws, most importantly Schäl (1993) as well as Hernández-Lerma and Lasserre (2002, chap. 12). Schäl (1993) follows the limiting discount factor approach to establish the existence of optimal policies. We apply these ideas to SLCPs and extend the results to the existence of a convex bounded solution to the ACOE.


                        Hernández-Lerma and Lasserre (2002, chap. 12) follow the infinite dimensional Linear Programming (LP) approach. They provide conditions that imply existence of optimal policies and relative value functions. However, their results only hold almost everywhere with respect to an invariant measure. The conditions we propose in Section 5 imply that all their results are applicable as well.


                        Arapostathis, Borkar, Fernández-Gaucherand, Ghosh, and Marcus (1993) provide a general survey about MDPs with the average cost criterion ranging from finite to Borel state and action spaces.

Finally, we also note that convexity of value functions of MDPs has been an important object of study for a long time. However, most of these structural results have been established for finite horizon or discounted cost problems only (Dynkin, 1972; Hinderer, 1984; Hernández-Lerma & Runggaldier, 1994; Hernández-Lerma, Piovesan, & Runggaldier, 1995).

ADP is an active research area with a variety of literature. Standard textbooks include Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) as well as Powell (2007).

The typical approach in ADP is to approximate an optimal relative value function with a combination of a fixed set of basis functions. Such approaches were shown to work well for some applications (Schweitzer & Seidmann, 1985; De Farias & Van Roy, 2003, 2004; Farias & Van Roy, 2006, chap. 6). However, determining a good set of basis functions is often very difficult and problem-specific.

As we will show in Section 5, there exists a convex solution to the ACOE for SLCPs, therefore we propose to use a piecewise-linear convex approximation of the relative value function instead. Thus, instead of fixing a set of basis functions, we take the maximum of a set of hyperplanes, which we generate in a particular way during the run of the algorithm.

Piecewise-linear convex value function approximations were also considered by Lincoln and Rantzer (2006) and Shapiro (2011). Lincoln and Rantzer (2006) also focus on SLCPs, but instead of the average cost criterion, they consider discounted cost, for which the existence of optimal policies and relative value functions is well established. Lincoln and Rantzer introduce a “Relaxed Value Iteration” and exploit the fact that the Bellman operator can be expressed as a Multi-Parametric LP (MPLP) and thus preserves piecewise-linearity and convexity. In contrast to our approach, Lincoln and Rantzer (2006) have to solve an MPLP in every iteration to obtain the hyperplane representation of the next relative value function, which is a very complex operation (exponential in the worst case and practically solvable only in low dimensions). In order to reduce the complexity of the relative value function, some of the hyperplanes are dropped as long as given deviation bounds are respected. Satisfying the bounds implies performance guarantees for the resulting policies and allows to control the trade-off between computational effort and performance of the policy. However, to get meaningful performance guarantees, the bounds have to be chosen quite tight, which implies that most hyperplanes have to be kept. Unfortunately, solving an MPLP with many hyperplanes is impractical even in smaller dimensions. This drawback might be the reason why this approach has never been applied to problems of realistic size. For more details on MPLPs in control, including finite horizon approximation techniques, we refer to Jones, Baric, and Morari (2007) as well as Jones and Morari (2009).

In this paper, we develop a different approach to cope with the inherent complexity of the exact value iteration step. Instead of solving an MPLP to find all hyperplanes in every step and then dropping some of them, we compute only a subset in the first place. We choose the subsets in such a way that the associated lower bounds are non-decreasing.

Piecewise-linear convex value functions have also been used by Shapiro (2011) to compute a lower approximation of the optimal value function in the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) method, which originated in Pereira and Pinto (1991). SDDP is typically applied to the Sample Average Approximation problem. It is designed for finite horizon problems, whereas the technique proposed here targets infinite horizon problems.

Inventory management with a single supplier is a well studied problem. Scarf (1960) and Iglehart (1963) proved that the optimal policy of an infinite horizon discounted cost problem with deterministic lead times and stationary stochastic demand is an 
                           
                              (
                              s
                              ,
                              S
                              )
                           
                         policy. Veinott and Wagner (1965) concluded that this holds also for infinite horizon average cost per stage problems.

While single sourcing is well understood, there exist only few results about the structure of optimal policies if multiple suppliers are available. Fukuda (1964) proved that for two suppliers, a dual base stock policy is optimal when no fixed order costs are accounted, lead times are deterministic, and the difference of the lead times of the two suppliers is exactly equal to one. However, an optimal policy for a general MSP is highly state-dependent (Whittemore & Saunders, 1977). Therefore, parametric heuristics and the computation of their optimal parameters is an active field of research.


                        Minner (2003) provided a detailed review of MSPs and discussed different heuristics and different setups. Scheller-Wolf, Veeraraghavan, and Van Houtum (2006) showed how the optimal parameters of the Single Index Policy (SIP) can be computed for a general dual sourcing problem with deterministic lead times. In Veeraraghavan and Scheller-Wolf (2008), the more complex Dual Index Policy (DIP) was analyzed and a simulation-based approach to determine the optimal parameters was presented, while Arts, Van Vuuren, and Kiesmuller (2009) provide a different way of approximating the optimal DIP parameters. Finally, Klosterhalfen, Kiesmuller, and Minner (2011) analyzed the Constant Order Policy (COP) and gave an overview of the three aforementioned heuristics and their performance based on numerical studies. The COP was also studied before, e.g. by Janssen and de Kok (1999) who provided an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters under service level constraints. Since the MSP is known to be a very difficult problem and since there are well-studied heuristics for it, it serves as a good test case for the new ADP approach proposed in this paper.

In this paper, we provide results to the following open questions regarding SLCPs:
                           
                              •
                              existence of optimal policies,

existence and structure of the solution to the ACOE,

suitable approximation of optimal relative value functions, and

performance evaluation of approximated policies and heuristics.

We prove the existence of optimal policies as well as convex solutions to the ACOE under very mild assumptions. This significantly extends known results and constitutes the main theoretical contribution of the paper, stated in Theorem 6. These insights from the theoretical analysis motivate our new approximate Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm based on piecewise-linear convex functions. Besides good control policies, the algorithm also provides a non-decreasing sequence of lower bounds to the optimal average costs. The lower bounds allow us to bound the optimality gap of any given policy.

We apply this algorithm to MSP instances and compare the performance with state-of-the-art heuristics. MSP is a typical example of a seemingly simple stochastic control problem with simple dynamics and cost structure. However, nothing is known about the structure of optimal policies, and the only known way to find an optimal policy is via exact dynamic programming, which is usually intractable. Various heuristic policies have been proposed and shown to perform well on small instances by comparing them to the exact solution, but the lack of lower bounds has so far prevented to judge their performance on instances that are too large to be solved to optimality.

We now formally introduce SLCPs, as for instance studied by Lincoln and Rantzer (2006).

                      denotes the indicator function of a given set. Note that (4) defines an atomic transition law. In Section 5, we show that it is weakly continuous, but not strongly continuous. This is the reason why most existing results about continuous state space MDPs are not applicable, since they assume strongly continuous transition laws, as discussed in Section 2.1.

A basic tool from MDP theory is the Bellman operator, which we will need throughout the remainder of this paper. In the following, we provide a formal definition of the Bellman operator and the ACOE for SLCP and discuss some of their properties. For a more detailed discussion of its properties we refer to the standard literature for discrete state space problems (Puterman, 1994; Bertsekas, 2007), since a lot of results hold in the continuous state space setup as well.

From standard convex optimization theory, it follows that the Bellman operator as defined here preserves convexity (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 1999, (2.11)). We state this in the following lemma for further reference.

As noted for instance by Lincoln and Rantzer (2006) the Bellman operator of a piecewise-linear convex function can be written as an MPLP. This immediately implies that it also preserves piecewise-linearity in addition to convexity. We derive the corresponding MPLP since we need the notation later in this section in order to prove Lemma 2.

In this section we discuss the existence of stationary deterministic average cost optimal policies. We show that there exists a convex relative value function that satisfies the ACOE. If there exists a policy that achieves the minimum in the Bellman operator of such a relative value function, the ACOE implies that this policy is average cost optimal and achieves the optimal cost

There are different approaches to study average cost MDPs, primarily the limiting discount factor approach (Schäl, 1993) and the infinite dimensional LP approach (Hernández-Lerma & Lasserre, 2002, chap. 12). The drawback of the infinite-dimensional LP approach is that its results might only hold for a subset of the state space. This subset will be an ergodic class under a resulting optimal policy, but the policy is only defined for this subset, so this does not yield any information about the remaining state space. In this paper we mainly follow the first approach.

The proofs of theorems, lemmas, and corollaries are given in Appendix A. We skip them here, because most of them are very technical and do not provide many further insights.

To begin with, we introduce the concept of Weak Accessibility (WA). This concept is known in discrete state space MDPs (Bertsekas, 2007), but the atomic transition law (4) allows us to extend it to SLCPs over compact state and action spaces.

We know from the discussion in Section 4 that the Bellman operator preserves piecewise-linear convex functions and that we can get a supporting hyperplane by evaluating the dual LP (8). In addition, Theorem 6 implies the existence of a convex solution to the ACOE. These results enable us to propose an approximate version of RVI that uses piecewise-linear convex functions. Our algorithm produces a non-decreasing sequence of lower bounds to the optimal average cost, we therefore call it Monotone Approximate RVI (MARVI). We use the resulting relative value function to determine a corresponding policy as defined in (6). Thus, we can simulate the system under this policy to estimate the resulting average cost. The lower bounds allow us to bound the optimality gap.

A lower bound for the optimal average cost per stage can be computed from every given relative value function as shown in Theorem 3. If the relative value function is piecewise-linear and convex, the lower bound can be computed efficiently as discussed in the following.

                         the corresponding inner minimization problem is an LP, since it can be constructed from (17) by adding a linear term to the objective and adding the required linear constraints to guarantee

In every iteration step, MARVI computes the current lower bound, checks the corresponding minimizer, and updates the current relative value function at all points that influence the value of the corresponding lower bound by computing the supporting hyperplanes. Using the introduced notation, we state MARVI in Algorithm 1. The algorithm always terminates as there is only a finite number of hyperplanes to be added in a particular step.

MARVI and Theorem 8 can also be applied to unbounded state spaces. However, the presented existence theory does not hold in its current form. Whether it can be extended to unbounded state spaces is subject of further research.

In Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2, we provide two ways of speeding up the basic algorithm. First, we explain how the lower bound computation during the iteration steps can be sped up significantly. Second, we introduce a way to reduce the number of hyperplanes after every iteration step without decreasing the associated lower bound.

The lower bound computation within MARVI can be sped up significantly. Within every step, MARVI adds some hyperplanes to the current relative value function approximation and then recomputes the lower bound. The lower bound computation results in an LP for every hyperplane. However, for earlier added hyperplanes the optimal solution is already known if the new hyperplanes are ignored. For the LP corresponding to an old hyperplane, adding hyperplanes translates to adding new constraints. Instead of solving the updated LP again, we check whether the old optimal solution stays feasible when the additional constraints are added. If this is the case, the old solution stays optimal and the LP does not have to be resolved.

                                          K
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . Every hyperplane

                                 k
                              
                            of h translates into constraints in the sub-problem. There are J constraints for every hyperplane to cover the piecewise-linear convex objective and one constraint to restrict to the feasible set 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       k
                                    
                                 
                                 ⊂
                                 S
                              
                           . This follows from (7) and (18).

Removing a hyperplane from h affects all lower bound sub-problems, where the corresponding constraints are active for the optimal solution, and the sub-problem corresponding to the hyperplane itself. We use this relation to construct a directed graph 
                              
                                 G
                              
                            on the set of hyperplanes, respectively sub-problems.

Consider two nodes 
                              
                                 k
                                 
                                 ≠
                                 
                                 l
                                 ∈
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          1
                                          ,
                                          …
                                          ,
                                          K
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . We add a directed edge 
                              
                                 (
                                 l
                                 ,
                                 k
                                 )
                              
                            if the sub-problem corresponding to k has a constraint corresponding to l that is active for the optimal solution. If no such constraint exists, hyperplane l does not affect the optimal solution of sub-problem k.

Next, we compute the strongly connected components of 
                              
                                 G
                              
                           , i.e., the maximal strongly connected sub-graphs. We construct a second graph 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            with the strongly connected components of 
                              
                                 G
                              
                            as nodes. There is an edge between two nodes of 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            if there is at least one edge between the corresponding strongly connected components of 
                              
                                 G

                            is called the condensation of 
                              
                                 G
                              
                           .

It is known that for every directed graph, its condensation is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Every DAG has at least one root node. We pick a root node of 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       G
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                            that corresponds to a strongly connected component with minimal number of elements. We keep all hyperplanes that are elements of the chosen root node and drop the rest.

By construction, the sub-problems of the kept hyperplanes are not affected by the removed hyperplanes, i.e., their optimal solutions stay the same. Since we reduce the number of sub-problems but do not change the remaining ones, the resulting lower bound is greater than or equal to the original lower bound.

We apply this hyperplane reduction at the end of every MARVI iteration step. Since the lower bounds are never decreased by this method, Theorem 8 still holds.

We focus on the MSP to apply our results and as a test case for MARVI. First, we formally introduce MSPs and show that they satisfy the assumptions made within this paper. Second, we investigate a set of dual sourcing instances where we increase the lead time of the slow supplier. We provide the results obtained with MARVI, compare them with the DIP, and discuss the differences.

There are other parametric heuristics studied in the literature besides the DIP, such as SIP and COP (Scheller-Wolf et al., 2006; Veeraraghavan & Scheller-Wolf, 2008; Klosterhalfen et al., 2011). In our studies, DIP has always been superior to SIP and COP. Therefore, we only consider DIP in the forthcoming analysis. Since MARVI provides lower bounds to the optimal average cost, we can bound the optimality gap for different policies although the problems cannot be solved exactly.

At last, we discuss an MSP instance with six different suppliers and a larger state and action space. We can solve this instance to optimality and show that the complexity does not necessarily correlate with the dimension of the state space, but with other problem parameters.

We address the MSP as defined in Veeraraghavan and Scheller-Wolf (2008). Thus, we consider a periodic review problem with 
                           
                              N
                              ∈
                              N
                           
                         suppliers, where unmet demand is backlogged and satisfied as soon as possible. A positive inventory level represents stock on hand, and a negative one represents backlogged demand. The notation is provided in Table 1
                        .

With the notation in Table 1 we can state the MSP dynamics as

Without loss of generality we make the following assumption.
                           Assumption 4
                           Zero demand has positive probability.

Otherwise, we could constantly place orders of the size of the minimal demand at the cheapest supplier. This will shift the demand distribution accordingly.

In order to obtain a compact state space, we impose bounds on inventory level and order quantities. However, these bounds can interfere with Assumption 1. We have to make sure that the system remains feasible. Therefore, additional state-dependent constraints on the action space have to be added.

First, we have to make sure that the inventory level upper bound is never violated. We achieve this by bounding the inventory position (the sum of inventory level and all open orders) by the upper bound for the inventory level:

                           Second, we have to enforce a lower bound for the inventory level. We add a constraint that guarantees that the minimal inventory level at the next time step is greater than or equal to the lower bound:

                           However, this constraint might be infeasible if there is no supplier with lead time equal to zero. In this case, we add an artificial supplier with lead time zero that allows orders of the size of the maximal demand. This supplier is assumed to be very expensive and should never be used in practice. The artificial supplier can be interpreted as lost sales if the backlog is getting too big. If the unit order cost of the artificial supplier and inventory level lower bound are chosen properly, this constraint will never be binding except for transient states.

These additional constraints make sure that the system is feasible, i.e. Assumption 1 holds.

                            with probability greater than or equal to τ in at most T periods. It can be assumed that the system starts with the maximal inventory level and no open orders. This state can always be reached by placing enough orders and assuming zero demand, which has positive probability by Assumption 4. Starting from this state, one can reach any inventory level with constant probability by assuming constant demand and adapting the orders accordingly. Similarly, the open orders of the target state can be reached by assuming zero demand again and placing the orders needed. Since the state space is compact, the needed number of periods can be bounded uniformly. □

                         denotes the lead time of the fast supplier. DIP depends on two parameters. No exact way to compute the optimal parameters is known, but efficient simulation-based approaches have been proposed (Veeraraghavan & Scheller-Wolf, 2008; Arts et al., 2009). DIP is defined as follows.

DIP can be extended to multiple suppliers by introducing one index per supplier and the corresponding order-up-to levels.

We consider a set of MSP instances with two suppliers and increasing complexity. We vary the lead time of the slow supplier without changing the other parameters. The problem parameters are given in Table 2
                        .

We run MARVI with 15 steps to approximate the optimal policy and to obtain a lower bound. The resulting policy and DIP with optimal parameters are evaluated by simulation of 100,000 periods. All computations were carried out on 4 hexa-core Xeon X5660 CPUs (2.67gigahertz). Maximal memory usage was less than 1gigabytes. The detailed results are given in Table 3
                        .


                        Table 3 shows that the difference between the average costs of the MARVI policy and the DIP increases with the lead time difference of the two suppliers. In the remainder of this section, we analyze how the different cost factors contribute to the total costs and what differences there are between the policies. To this end, we show the average holding, backlogging, ordering and total costs for the different instances and policies in Fig. 2

                         is equal to the maximal demand for the scenarios with 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    L

                         greater than or equal to 4. Since the fast supplier can deliver immediately in the next period this implies that there is no backlogging at all under the DIP, as can be seen in Fig. 2.

If the lead time difference is getting too big, the DIP reacts by preventing backlogging completely, which leads to high holding costs. On the other hand, the MARVI policy allows backlogging and usually uses the fast supplier more often to reduce the holding costs significantly compared to DIP.

We now go beyond dual sourcing and consider an MSP instance with six suppliers with different lead times and unit order costs. We choose the unit order costs in such a way that all suppliers are used. The complete specification of the instance is given in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                        .

We approximate the optimal policy for all six suppliers with 15 MARVI steps. Furthermore, we analyze how much is ordered on average at the different suppliers in a simulation run over 100,000 periods. The results of this experiment are given in Tables 4 and 5.

Next, we compare dual sourcing instances where we keep the cheapest supplier and add one of the remaining suppliers. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3
                        . Note that the gap between simulated costs and the MARVI lower bounds has always been less than 1%, usually close to zero. Therefore we consider the resulting policies optimal and only report the optimal costs.

The results of this experiment allow several conclusions. First, a strong portfolio effect can be observed. Using all six suppliers can decrease the costs by more than 4% compared to the best combination of the considered instances (the other possible combinations achieve about the same performance as the reported ones, the corresponding results are shown in Appendix B). In particular, the combination of supplier 3 and 6 achieve the best result (optimal average costs of 27.454) even though they are hardly used in the instance with all six suppliers.

Second, the computation times vary quite a lot and are not at all monotone in the lead times and state space dimension, respectively. The dual sourcing instances where the average order quantity of the two suppliers is about the same are the easiest to solve, whereas the instances with a strong focus on one supplier are the hardest. In particular, the instance with all 6 suppliers was solved the fastest with the smallest number of hyperplanes.

We introduced simple and realistic conditions that imply the existence of an optimal policy and a convex solution to the ACOE for SLCPs, a broad class of MDPs, which is particularly useful in inventory management.

We exploited the insights to construct a new approximation algorithm, MARVI, to compute good policies for this broad class of problems. MARVI provides lower bounds of the optimal average costs, which can be used to bound the optimality gap of a particular policy.

We first tested MARVI on different MSP instances with two suppliers and compared it to the DIP. The policy computed with MARVI consistently outperformed the DIP. In the considered dual sourcing scenarios, we found that a bigger lead time difference leads to a worse DIP performance.

We also investigated a higher dimensional MSP instance with six suppliers. Even though the problem has larger state and action spaces than all the other dual sourcing instances, it was solved faster than most of them, in just a few seconds. This shows that the complexity does not only depend on state/action space dimension but also on other problem characteristics. Determining what drives the complexity is an open task for further research. Once this is understood, it might help designing new, more efficient policy structures, value function approximations, and solution algorithms.

Another open point is related to the convergence of MARVI itself. We know that the sequence of lower bounds converges as it is monotonous and bounded, but it is not clear whether it converges to the optimal average cost. Nevertheless, all empirical evidence points towards this direction.

There are several interesting extensions to the presented theory, algorithm, and application. First, the presented theory does not provide conditions under which the solution of the ACOE has to be continuous to the boundary of the state space as well. This would immediately imply the existence of a corresponding policy. Moreover, the restriction to compact state spaces is sometimes a bit artificial. Therefore it is an open task to extend the presented theory to unbounded state spaces. This could be one way to solve the problem of discontinuity of the relative value function on the boundary of the state space.

It is straightforward to apply MARVI to discounted cost problems, which are much simpler than the average cost problem considered here. The resulting value function approximation would provide a lower bound to the optimal expected discounted cost for any initial state. Another extension could be to replace the expectation in the Bellman operator by the worst case. This is easy to implement, but it is not clear how to interpret this setup within an infinite horizon setting.

Lastly, the MSP as introduced here can easily be extended to stochastic lead times as described, e.g., in Kaplan (1970) and Ehrhardt (1984). This will again yield an SLCP, and the theory and algorithm presented in this paper are applicable.

To conclude, a promising new approach to approximate optimal policies for SLCPs was presented in this paper and successfully tested. There is still potential to further develop the corresponding theory, as well as to extend the algorithm to different settings.

                            we repeat this experiment with the new initial state and run the process for another T periods.

                           In (A.3) we apply the definitions of limit superior and the Bellman operator. Next, we interchange supremum and infimum in (A.4), which can at most increase the value of the expression (Rockafellar, 1970, Lemma 36.1). In (A.5) we take the supremum and the discount factor and put it into the sum, which again can at most increase the value. Once more, we apply the definition of the (undiscounted) Bellman operator in (A.6), and exploit its continuity (w.r.t. the supremum norm) in (A.7). Using the definitions of limit superior and

Inequality (14) can be shown along the same lines. □

The proof follows the idea of a similar result for finite state/action space MDPs stated in Bertsekas (2007), Proposition 4.3.1. From Lemma 6 we know that for all
