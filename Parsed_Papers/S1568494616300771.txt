               Abstract
               
                  This paper presents techniques for GPS based autonomous navigation of heavy vehicles at high speed. The control system has two main functions: vehicle position estimation and generation of the steering commands for the vehicle to follow a given path autonomously. Position estimation is based on fusion of measurements from a carrier-phase differential GPS system and odometric sensors using fuzzy logic. A Takagiâ€“Sugeno fuzzy controller is used for steering commands generation, to cope with different road geometry and vehicle velocity. The presented system has been implemented in a 13tons truck, and fully tested in very demanding conditions, i.e. high velocity and large curvature variations in paved and unpaved roads.
