                  Many problems in computer aided geometric design and computer graphics can be turned into a root-finding problem of a polynomial equation. Among various solutions, clipping methods based on the Bernstein–Bézier form usually have good numerical stability. A traditional clipping method using polynomials of degree r can achieve a convergence rate of 
                        r
                        +
                        1
                      for a single root. It utilizes two polynomials of degree r to bound the given polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      of degree n, where 
                        r
                        =
                        2
                        ,
                        3
                     , and the roots of the bounding polynomials are used for clipping off the subintervals containing no roots of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     . This paper presents a rational cubic clipping method for finding the roots of a polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      within an interval. The bounding rational cubics can achieve an approximation order of 7 and the corresponding convergence rate for finding a single root is also 7. In addition, differently from the traditional cubic clipping method solving the two bounding polynomials in 
                        O
                        (
                        
                           
                              n
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        )
                     , the new method directly constructs the two rational cubics in 
                        O
                        (
                        n
                        )
                      which can be used for bounding 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      in many cases. Some examples are provided to show the efficiency, the approximation effect and the convergence rate of the new method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many problems in computer aided geometric design and computer graphics can be turned into a root-finding problem of polynomial equations, such as curve/surface intersection (Efremov et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009; Nishita et al., 1990; Patrikalakis and Maekawa, 2002), point projection (Chen et al., 2008), collision detection (Choi et al., 2006; Lin and Gottschalk, 1998), and bisectors/medial axes computation (Elber and Kim, 2001). In principle, a system of polynomial equations of multiple variables can be turned into a univariate polynomial equation by using the resultant theory. This paper discusses the root-finding problem of a univariate polynomial equation within an interval.

Many references turn the given polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      into its power series, and a collection of related references can be found in McNamee (1993–2002), Isaacson and Keller (1966), Mourrain and Pavone (2005), Reuter et al. (2007), Rouillier and Zimmermann (2004). The Bernstein–Bézier form of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      has a good numerical stability with respect to perturbations of the coefficients (Farouki et al., 1987; Farouki and Goodman, 1996; Jüttler, 1998). Several clipping methods based on the Bernstein–Bézier form are developed (Bartoň and Jüttler, 2007; Liu et al., 2009; Morken and Reimers, 2007; Sederberg and Nishita, 1990). Note that the number of zeros of a Bézier function is less or equal to that of its control polygon. The method in Morken and Reimers (2007) utilizes the corresponding control polygon to approximation 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     , in which the zeros of the control polygon are used to approximate the zeros of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      from one side. The method in Morken and Reimers (2007) achieves a convergence rate of 2 for a simple root. In principle, a B-spline (or Bézier) curve is bounded by the convex hull of its control polygon, the corresponding roots are then bounded by the roots of the convex hull. The corresponding approximation order of the approach using convex hull is 2 (Schulz, 2009). Comparing with the method in Morken and Reimers (2007), the r-clipping method in Bartoň and Jüttler (2007), Liu et al. (2009) bounds the zeros of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      by using the zeros of two bounding polynomials of degree r, which achieves a higher approximation order 
                        r
                        +
                        1
                     , where 
                        r
                        =
                        2
                        ,
                        3
                     .

In principle, one can also use rational polynomials to bound 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      for root finding. A rational quadratic polynomial has five free variables, which can achieve an approximation order 5 to 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     . If two rational quadratics are utilized to bound 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     , one can achieve a convergence rate of 5 for a simple root, which is much higher than that of 3 when using a quadratic clipping polynomial. However, in some cases when the curve 
                        (
                        t
                        ,
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      is not convex within 
                        [
                        a
                        ,
                        b
                        ]
                     , the denominators of the rational quadratic polynomials for bounding 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      may have one or more zeros within 
                        [
                        a
                        ,
                        b
                        ]
                     , which leads to a bad approximation effect between 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      and its bounding polynomials.

A rational cubic polynomial, on the other hand, can approximate 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      in a much better way than that of a rational quadratic polynomial, even in case that 
                        (
                        t
                        ,
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        )
                      is not convex within the given interval 
                        [
                        a
                        ,
                        b
                        ]
                     . This paper presents a rational cubic clipping method which utilizes two rational cubic polynomials to bound 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      for root-finding. The bounding rational cubics achieve the approximation order 7 to 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      and the corresponding rational cubic clipping method can achieve a convergence rate of 7 for a simple root, which is much higher than that of 4 of previous cubic clipping methods. In addition, the method proposed in this paper directly constructs two rational cubic polynomials interpolating four positions and three derivatives of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     , which can bound 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      in many cases and it leads to a much higher computation efficiency. Some numerical examples are provided to show both higher convergence rate and higher computation efficiency of the new method.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an outline of clipping methods. Section 3 illustrates the rational cubic clipping method for finding two bounding rational cubics in details. Numerical examples and some further discussions are provided in Section 4, and the conclusions are drawn at the end of this paper.

Suppose that 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     , 
                        t
                        ∈
                        [
                        a
                        ,
                        b
                        ]
                     , is the given polynomial of degree n. The basic idea of the clipping methods is to find two bounding polynomials, and then to clip off the subintervals containing no roots of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      by using the roots of the bounding polynomials. The clipping process continues until the lengths of the remaining subintervals are less than a given tolerance. Finally, the middle points of the remaining subintervals are recorded as the roots of 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                     .

The numerical convergence rate of a clipping method within an interval tends to be

                      is large for some cases, the numerical convergence rate is very slow. In this paper, at the beginning, we apply the method in Morken and Reimers (2007) to divide the given interval into several sub-intervals by utilizing the zeros of the control polygon of the given Bézier function, which can improve the corresponding convergence rate.

In each clipping step, one needs to find two bounding polynomials for a given interval 
                           [
                           a
                           ,
                           b
                           ]
                         and then to split the interval 
                           [
                           a
                           ,
                           b
                           ]
                         into several subintervals by using the roots of the bounding polynomials. The subintervals containing no root of 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         are further clipped off. The computation of the two bounding polynomials is one of the key issues of a clipping step. Different clipping methods may obtain different bounding polynomials. Suppose that the two bounding polynomials are obtained such that

Finally, from Lemma 1, the roots of the bounding polynomials can be used for clipping the subintervals containing no roots of 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        .

The analysis of the convergence rate is another key issue of the clipping method, which depends on the approximation order of the bounding polynomials. We have the following theorem.

                      may converge very slowly. In this paper, at the beginning, if there are four or more zeros of the control polygon of

                        (

                      (in Bézier form), or if the first clipping step fails to clip the given interval, we utilize these zeros to divide 
                        [

                      into several subintervals. All of the examples are implemented by using the Maple software on PC with 4 G memory and 2.5 G CPU, the average computation time of a clipping step is tested by setting the number of digits after the decimal point as 16, the corresponding unit is millisecond.

Firstly, we compare the computational complexity and the convergence rate of

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 M
                              
                              
                                 r
                              
                           
                        . If the two bounding polynomials are obtained, the remaining computation of a clipping step can be done within 
                           O
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        , so the computation of the two bounding polynomials would dominant the computational complexity of the methods under discussion. In

                        , it needs to estimate the bounds of a polynomial of degree n, whose computational complexity is

This paper presents a rational cubic clipping method (denoted as 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              r
                           
                        
                     ) for finding the roots of a polynomial 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      within an interval, which can achieve a convergence rate of 7 for a single root by using rational cubic polynomials. Different from previous clipping methods in Bartoň and Jüttler (2007), Liu et al. (2009) for computing two bounding polynomials in 
                        O
                        (
                        
                           
                              n
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        )
                      time, 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              r
                           
                        
                      directly constructs two rational cubic polynomials, which can be used to bound 
                        f
                        (
                        t
                        )
                      in many cases and leads to a computational complexity of 
                        O
                        (
                        n
                        )
                     . Numerical examples also show that 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              r
                           
                        
                      can achieve a much higher convergence rate, much better approximation effect and much higher computation efficiency than previous clipping methods in Bartoň and Jüttler (2007), Liu et al. (2009).

As for future work, it should also be feasible to achieve a higher computation efficiency by using two bounding B-spline curves, or to achieve a higher convergence rate by combining with reparameterization techniques. Another possible future work is to extend 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              r
                           
                        
                      from the curve case to surface cases, which can be used for the root-finding problem of an equation system consisting of two bivariate polynomials.
