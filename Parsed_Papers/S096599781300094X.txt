                  A new hybrid-mixed stress finite element model for the static and dynamic non-linear analysis of concrete structures is presented and discussed in this paper. The main feature of this model is the simultaneous and independent approximation of the stress, the strain and the displacement fields in the domain of each element. The displacements along the static boundary, which is considered to include inter-element boundaries, are also directly approximated. To define the approximation bases in the space domain, complete sets of orthonormal Legendre polynomials are used. The adoption of these functions enables the use of analytical closed form solutions for the computation of all linear structural operators and leads to the development of very effective p-refinement procedures. To represent the material quasi-brittle behaviour, a physically non-linear model is considered by using damage mechanics. A simple isotropic damage model is adopted and to control strain localisation problems a non-local integral formulation is considered. To solve the dynamic non-linear governing system, a time integration procedure based on the use of the α-HHT method is used. For each time step, the solution of the non-linear governing system is achieved using an iterative algorithm based on a secant method. The model being discussed is applied to the solution of two-dimensional structures. To validate the model, to illustrate its potential and to assess its accuracy and numerical efficiency, several numerical examples are discussed and comparisons are made with solutions provided by experimental tests and with other numerical results obtained using conventional finite elements (CFE).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is possible to list three main classes of hybrid and mixed non-conventional finite element formulations [27], namely the hybrid-mixed, the hybrid and the hybrid-Trefftz models [27,29,30,48,49]. All formulations evolve directly from the first principles of mechanics, in particular equilibrium, compatibility and constitutive relations. What distinguishes the three types of formulation is the set of constraints enforced, a priori, on the domain approximations. Two models may be derived for each formulation, the displacement and the stress models [40].

In recent years, some of these non-conventional finite element formulations have been extended to the non-linear analysis of concrete structures using isotropic damage models [52]. In [54] the hybrid-mixed stress model based on the use of orthonormal Legendre polynomials is chosen. The stress and the displacement fields in the domain of each element and the displacements on the static boundary are independently approximated. None of the fundamental relations is locally verified and all field equations are enforced in a weighted residual form, ensuring that the discrete numerical model embodies all the relevant properties of the continuum it represents. The Mazars’ isotropic model [38] is adopted and a non-local integral formulation where the damage variable is taken as the non-local variable is considered.

In [55] an improved hybrid-mixed stress model is presented and discussed. The approximation of the stress field in the domain is replaced by the approximation of the effective stress field. The isotropic damage models presented by Comi and Perego [16,17] are now adopted using a non-local integral model. An alternative technique based on the definition of an explicit enhanced gradient model has also been tested [52].

The use of hybrid-Trefftz displacement formulations, where the displacements in the domain of each element and the stress field on the kinematic boundary are independently approximated, is reported in [53,56]. The main feature of these models is that the functions used to approximate the displacements are derived from bi-harmonic displacement potentials that solve the Navier equations for a homogeneous elastic material [13,28].

The numerical efficiency of the hybrid-mixed stress model with the independent approximation of the effective stress field and of the hybrid-displacement formulation with Legendre polynomials is assessed in [57]. In this paper, a set of classical benchmark tests is chosen to illustrate the use of such models and to assess and compare their numerical performance. Comparisons are also made with solutions obtained with the classical finite element formulation to prove that the proposed models are competitive.

Even if the hybrid-mixed stress model with the independent approximation of the effective stress field and of the hybrid-displacement formulation with Legendre polynomials proved to be robust and computationally competitive when compared with the classical displacement finite element implementations [57], some drawbacks associated to their use can be pointed out. When using hybrid displacement models, local equilibrium, both in the domain and on the static boundary, is enforced in a weak form as in classical finite element formulations. As a consequence, some of the attractive properties associated to the use of non-conventional finite element models may be lost. On the other hand, the use of hybrid-mixed stress models based on the approximation of the effective stress field leads to non-symmetric governing systems that require a much more demanding computational effort for their solution.

To overcome these drawbacks, a new hybrid-mixed stress finite element model, denoted here as 4fHMS (four-field hybrid-mixed stress model) has been developed and presented [1]. This model considers independent approximations for the stress, strain and displacement fields in the domain of each finite element. The displacement field on the static boundary is also independently approximated.

All of the models previously referred for the material non-linear simulation of softening materials were developed for static analysis. The implementation of hybrid-mixed stress finite element models (the initial versions, with the independent approximation of only two fields in the domain) for the dynamic analysis of linear elastic structures has been reported in [3]. In that work, several classical step-by-step time integration algorithms have been tested together with hybrid-mixed stress models. An alternative approach, based on the definition of a mixed approximation in the time domain [26] was also implemented and assessed.

The main goal of this paper is to present and to discuss the generalisation of the 4fHMS model for the physically non-linear dynamic analysis of concrete structures. This model is based on the use of orthonormal Legendre polynomials as approximation functions. The properties of these functions allow for the definition of analytical closed form solutions for the computation of all structural operators in linear analysis. The numerical stability associated to the use of Legendre polynomial bases enables the use of macro-element meshes where the definition of highly effective p-adaptive refinement procedures is simplified.

To model concrete’s physically non-linear behaviour, two isotropic damage models are considered. The first has been introduced by Comi and Perego [18] and the second corresponds to the classical Mazars model [38]. It must be stressed that the objective of this paper is to present an alternative finite element formulation to model softening materials when the structure under analysis is subjected to cyclic and dynamic loads. No emphasis is given to the damage model to be considered, so only simple isotropic damage models are adopted. The combination of 4fHMS models with more sophisticated damage models can be regarded as a future research work.

To control strain localisation problems, a non-local integral formulation is considered [55]. To solve the dynamic non-linear governing system, a time integration procedure based on the use of the α-HHT method [33] is adopted. For each time step, the solution of the non-linear governing system is achieved using an iterative algorithm based on a secant method [20,57].

To validate the model being proposed, to illustrate its potential and to assess its accuracy and numerical efficiency, several numerical examples are discussed and comparisons are made with solutions provided by experimental tests and with other numerical results obtained using conventional finite elements.

This paper is organised as follows: the formulation of the problem and the adopted damage models are presented in Sections 2 and 3. The hybrid-mixed stress finite element model is described in Section 4. The numerical examples are discussed in Section 5 and finally, Section 6 summarises the main conclusions and indicates future research work in this field.

                     where the state variables are the elastic strain tensor components, ɛ, the damage variable, d, and the internal variable, ξ. The associated variables are the stresses, σ, the elastic energy release rate, Y, and the thermodynamic force, χ. The scalars n, k and c are material parameters that define the damage initiation and the softening evolution. These parameters must be determined using experimental data.

The evolution laws are obtained from the loading function f, which depends on the associated variables and is defined in order to satisfy the Clausius–Duhem inequality [36]. Eq. (9) defines the potential of dissipation and the loading–unloading conditions,

It is possible to conclude that, for this particular damage model, the internal variable ξ coincides with the damage variable, d. No permanent strains are considered in this damage model. It is important to notice that the constitutive model adopted has the limitation of considering the same behaviour for the material in prevailing tension and compression states, which is not realistic for concrete. To overcome this limitation, it is assumed that damage may appear and develop only if the strain tensor trace is positive. This constitutive model with the referred assumption is suitable for studying structures subjected mainly to tension stresses and it is competitive due to its simplicity.

The second model used in this work was introduced by Mazars [38]. It is based on an elastic damage constitutive relation with isotropic behaviour. This model assumes the following hypothesis: the damage occurs only due to positive principal strains; it is possible to control the evolution of damage with one scalar damage variable, d; the unloading path is linear and no permanent strains are considered; when considering cyclic loadings hysteretic effects cannot be considered.

Even if the hypotheses adopted by the Mazars damage model may seem simple, they are also considered in other fracture and damage mechanics models implemented in commercial finite element codes for static analyses, as the ones reported in [4,60]. The reason behind the use of these simple models is the fact that for reinforced concrete structures the influence of the plastic strains and the hysteretic behaviour of the steel bars is much larger than the corresponding influence of concrete in terms of the final global structural response.

In this model the specific energy of Helmholtz, Ψ, is given by:

                     If f
                     <0, unloading takes place and no change is observed in the damage variable. Otherwise, an increase of damage occurs and the new value for parameter d may be obtained as a linear combination of two scalar and independent variables, dT
                      and dC
                     , as expressed in Eq. (18). Mazars has suggested a simple expression to compute parameters dT
                      and dC
                     , in a way that no iteration process is required at the material level, separating the loading function

                      are material parameters that control the softening behaviour of the stress vs. strain curve. All of these parameters must be identified using experimental tests.

For the multiaxial case, the values for parameters αT
                      and αC
                      are obtained considering modified strain vectors for tension and compression, defined by Eq. (22). These vectors are computed using the principal positive effective stresses, defined by Eqs. (20) and (21).

A finite element analysis of materials with softening behaviour is known to localise strains in a vanishing volume leading, consequently, to unrealistic solutions associated to zero energy dissipation [5]. From a mathematical point of view, it may be stated that the boundary value problem describing the structural response becomes ill-posed. There are several possibilities to restore the well-posedness of this problem [6]. In the present work, a non-local integral formulation is adopted [5], considering a weighted average over the whole domain of the strain tensor components,

The length lc
                      in (25) is a material parameter related to the width of the fracture process zone [8]. A normalised weight function is chosen because the non-local model should be able to reproduce correctly local uniform fields. The non-local damage models are obtained introducing in (9) and (17) the non-local value for the strain tensor components, which leads to the following loading functions and loading–unloading conditions:

It is necessary to integrate by parts the equation resulting from the weighted residual enforcement of the compatibility conditions in the domain to obtain the corresponding equation in the discrete form. The governing system (36) is obtained by combining the equilibrium, compatibility and elasticity conditions in the discrete model. The governing system of the finite element mesh is assembled by direct allocation of the contribution of the elementary systems [27]. It is important to notice that only the generalised stiffness operator

To solve the dynamic non-linear governing system, a time integration procedure based on the use of the α-HHT method [33] is adopted. For each time step, the solution of the non-linear governing system is achieved using an iterative algorithm based on a secant method [57].

According to Hilber et al. [33], it is possible to rewrite the governing system (40) introducing a parameter α and using the primitive concepts of the Newmark method. For time step tn

The α-HHT method uses the same relations between displacements, velocities and accelerations as the Newmark method. The main difference is that integration parameters, β and γ, depend on a damping parameter, α. According to [33], the method is unconditionally stable if α is contained within the interval defined in Eq. (43). In this work the maximum allowed value of α
                     =−1/3 is used, and consequently γ
                     =5/6 and β
                     =4/9.

Complete sets of orthonormal Legendre polynomials are used to define the approximation bases required by the 4fHMS model. The generation and manipulation of such functions is fully described in [47,48,58]. The Legendre polynomials can be defined using the Rodriguez formula, Eq. (52).

To illustrate the use of the model being discussed and to assess its accuracy and efficiency, three numerical tests are presented and discussed: the compact tension test, the Nooru-Mohamed shear test, and the Koyna dam. The first is a benchmark test commonly used to access the efficiency of new continuum damage models applied together with finite element techniques. Using the experimental data provided in [38,39], the 4fHMS model is compared with the classical displacement finite element formulation (CFE). The numerical performance of the 4fHMS model is initially evaluated and compared with the classical FEM using the numerical results obtained by Comi [15]. The global displacement vs. reaction curves are then obtained and directly compared. The Nooru-Mohamed shear test is usually adopted to study the accuracy of crack propagation when fracture mechanics models are being tested [24,45]. Finally, the analysis of the Koyna dam is used here to test the 4fHMS model for a physically non-linear dynamic analysis considering an earthquake acceleration with soil–structure iteration.


                        Fig. 3
                         presents the geometry of a two-dimensional structure subjected to an imposed opening displacement. Due to symmetry considerations, only one-half of the structure will be considered in the numerical simulations presented in this section.

The concrete’s behaviour is modelled assuming the damage model described in [18] with the following parameters: n
                        =3.5, kc
                        
                        =0.00015MPa, c
                        =1.5, lc
                        
                        =10mm, E
                        =30GPa and ν
                        =0.2. The main purpose of this example is to validate the hybrid-mixed stress model by comparing the solutions with the results obtained in [15]. Even if in the work of Comi an explicit gradient model is used as regularization technique, the numerical results provided in [15] are still useful to validate the solutions provided by the 4fHMS model. The two adopted meshes for the CFE analyses are presented in Fig. 4
                        a and b. Fig. 4c shows the final damage distribution obtained with the coarsest mesh.

For the analyses with the hybrid-mixed stress model, the meshes presented in Fig. 5
                         are considered. The first (Mesh A) is a very coarse mesh with only 5 elements, which strongly violates the geometry of the problem, specifically near the curved boundary. This aspect is taken into account in the definition of the second and third meshes which consider 9 and 18 elements, respectively. Contrary to what is typical in CFE models, where h-refinement techniques are used to refine the solution, with the model being discussed p-refinement is the strategy adopted to fully exploit the properties of these non-conventional hybrid-mixed stress elements. In all the meshes to be used with the 4fHMS model an extra element (element 2) is added. This element is necessary to take into account the horizontal prescribed displacement since the 4fHMS model in its original formulation does not allow for the direct consideration of point loads/displacements.

In this section, the numerical tests considering the p-refinement strategy will be performed using the strain tensor components regularization. The structure is analysed as a plane strain problem. The discretizations considered in the analysis are listed in Table 1
                         and involve the use of Mesh B. The maximum Legendre polynomial degree used to define the approximation for the stress and the strain fields is successively increased. To avoid spurious kinematic modes, the maximum polynomial degree adopted for the approximation of the displacement fields, both in the domain and on the static boundary, is given by nv
                        
                        =
                        nx
                        
                        −1, where nx
                         is the degree of the stress approximation. This procedure is followed in all numerical tests presented in this paper. Table 1 shows also the total number of degrees of freedom (ndof) associated to each tested discretization and the number of Lobatto points used in each direction. The Lobatto points are used to implement the regularization technique based on the definition of the non-local integral quantities and to support the numerical integration of all non-linear operators.

The displacement vs. reaction curves obtained with all tested discretizations are presented in Fig. 6
                        . The horizontal reaction is computed by integrating the component σxx
                         along the left boundary of macro-element 2. The analysis of this figure shows that discretization HDMS2 is not able to reproduce adequately the global behaviour of the structure. This was expected, since low degree polynomials are used to define the approximation bases in this discretization. The remaining tested discretizations led to accurate and objective solutions. As the results do not depend on the discretization being considered, it can be stated that the non-local integral regularization technique used here is performing adequately.


                        Fig. 7
                         compares the displacement vs. reaction curve obtained with discretization HDMS6 with the solutions computed by the CFE formulation presented in [15]. The same plot presents also the experimental results provided in [38,39].

The main difference between the solution obtained with the 4fHMS model and the numerical results provided by the CFE computation corresponds to the peak value of the displacement vs. reaction curve. This difference can be explained by the different regularization techniques used in both analyses. While the 4fHMS model considers an integral non-local model where the non-local variables are the independent components on the strain tensor, the referred CFE model uses an explicit gradient damage model. Fig. 7 shows that both numerical procedures lead to results that are similar to the experimental curves.


                        Fig. 8
                         presents the final damage distributions obtained with the four more refined discretizations listed in Table 1. It is possible to confirm that all discretizations lead to very similar damage distributions, even those considering smaller number of degrees of freedom. Objectivity is also ensured, as all discretizations provide similar damage distributions. In all cases it is possible to detect a spurious damage distribution at the neighbourhood of the region where the displacement is prescribed. This perturbation tends to decrease with the refinement of the discretization and has a very little effect on the global behaviour of the structure.


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the final horizontal strain field distributions, ɛxx
                        . Even for low-level refinements, it is still possible to observe a strain concentration at the fracture process zone. This fact is coherent with the final damage distribution.


                        Fig. 10
                         presents the damage evolution obtained with discretization HDMS6. The distribution is plotted in the deformed shape of the structure, considering a scale of 100:1. For the damage distribution it is used the same scale as in Fig. 8. As expected, the damage starts near the re-entrant corner. Damage initially spreads and then tends to increase at the centre of the plate in a narrow (of constant width) vertical zone, thus correctly simulating the cracking of the plate.


                        Fig. 11
                         presents the evolution of the horizontal normal stress component, σxx
                        , for Mesh B with discretization HDMS6. It is possible to observe that the maximum tensile stress is achieved for prescribed displacement values around 2u
                        =0.1175mm. After reaching this value, unloading occurs near the edge of the structure and the normal stress, σxx
                        , decreases at this location. The stress is redistributed to upper regions of the plate, correctly simulating the crack evolution. Some instabilities in the stress field may be noticed for prescribed displacement values near 2u
                        =0.1175mm. These oscillations are due to the use of high degree Legendre polynomials in the definition of the hybrid-mixed stress model approximation bases.

In order to illustrate the use of a very coarse mesh, consider now the analysis of the plate using the Mesh A presented in Fig. 5. The discretizations used for this purpose are listed in Table 2
                        . When compared to the discretizations defined for the analyses with Mesh B, the main difference is that the degrees of the approximation functions are higher since fewer elements are used. For the same order of number of degrees of freedom the solutions obtained with Mesh A require less CPU time than the ones obtained with Mesh B. This happens because the computational cost associated to the regularization procedure increases when the number of finite elements grows.

The discretizations using Mesh A accurately capture the global behaviour of the structure, even those considering a small number of degrees of freedom. This can be confirmed by the analysis of Fig. 12
                        , where all the displacement vs. reaction curves are plotted. Fig. 13
                         presents the curves obtained with the more refined discretizations using Mesh A and Mesh B. The differences that can be observed are mainly due to the different geometric discretization near the curved notch.


                        Fig. 14
                         shows the final damage distributions obtained with all discretizations using Mesh A. It is possible again to confirm the correct behaviour of the non-local integral regularization technique used with the hybrid-mixed stress model as objectivity is ensured and the final damage distribution is not affected by the finite element mesh and by the level of refinement used in the definition of the approximation bases. When compared to the final damage distributions obtained with Mesh B (Fig. 8), some slight differences may be observed. Those differences are again originated by the different domain discretization associated to the use of Meshes A and B.

As mentioned before, Lobatto points are used to perform the numerical integrations required by the computation of the non-linear generalised stiffness operator. They are used also to support the computation of the non-local quantities required by the adopted non-local integral model. It is important to assess the effect that the number of Lobatto points used in the analysis may have in the quality of the solutions provided by the hybrid-mixed stress computations. For this purpose, Meshes B and C are used. Table 3
                         lists the discretizations associated to Mesh B. The number of degrees of freedom is constant as all approximation bases are defined with polynomials up to the same degree. To define the approximation for the stress and the strain fields, Legendre polynomials up to degree six are considered. To define the approximations for the displacement fields, both in the domain and on the static boundary, Legendre polynomials up to degree five are used. The number of Lobatto points used in each direction ranges from 10 to 25.


                        Table 4
                         lists the discretizations using Mesh C. The degree of the approximation is considered to remain the same for all cases. As the number of elements increases, the degree of the polynomials considered is smaller than before. To fully test the efficiency of the hybrid-mixed stress model, approximation bases involving polynomials up to degree two (for the stress and the strain fields) have been defined in this case. Due to this fact, the total number of degrees of freedom associated to the discretizations listed in Table 4 is smaller than the one associated to the discretizations listed in Table 3. When Mesh C is used, the number of Lobatto points in each direction ranges from 5 to 20. In this case the number of integration points is smaller as the size of the elements decreases and the degree of the polynomials defined in the approximation bases is smaller.


                        Figs. 15 and 16
                        
                         present the final damage distributions obtained with all the discretizations listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. It is possible to verify that all final damage distributions are quite similar. The analysis of Fig. 16 shows that the use of such a low degree polynomial approximation leads to less accurate solutions with some undesired oscillations, even if the global pattern is correctly recovered. The use of such a level of approximation should be avoided when using hybrid-mixed stress models. The analysis of Fig. 15 shows that discretization HDMS6–10 leads to a final damage distribution that is slightly less accurate than the ones obtained with the remaining discretizations using Mesh B. This fact is due to the use of an insufficient number of integration points. This shows that a sufficiently large number of Lobatto points must be used together with hybrid-mixed stress models to ensure the accuracy of the results and the correct behaviour of the non-local integral regularization technique. This number depends on the degree of the approximation used and the size of the macro-elements being defined in the mesh. According to the results reported in this paper, a minimum number of 15 Lobatto points in each direction should be considered for this example.

In this section the hybrid-mixed stress model is tested in the analysis of a structure where damage is activated mainly due to shear stresses. In this example, the physically non-linear concrete behaviour is modelled using the Mazars damage model [38]. To validate the results obtained with the 4fHMS model, comparisons are made with the experimental results obtained and reported in Nooru-Mohamed’s PhD thesis [42] and by van Mier [59].

The square shaped, double edge notched specimen used in the tests is shown in Fig. 17
                        a. This experimental test allows for several load combinations: the structure may be subjected to tension and to shear loads, simultaneously and/or sequentially. One of the most interesting possibilities corresponds to first prescribe a horizontal force Ps
                        , and then enforce a vertical displacement, un
                        , at the top of the structure, maintaining the value of Ps
                         constant.

From the several tests performed by Nooru, only those designated here by “Path A” and “Path B” are considered. In both cases the material remains linear elastic until the normal displacement un
                         is applied. However, due to the shear load the cracking is no longer horizontal. In “Path A” the applied shear load is given by Ps
                        
                        =5kN, while for “Path B” the shear load is given by Ps
                        
                        =10kN. As a consequence of these differences, it is expected that damage appears first in the case of “Path B” test and the damage pattern in this case must be more inclined than in “Path A”. Fig. 17b and c presents the observed cracks in the experimental tests “Path A” and “Path B”, respectively.

The final damage distributions obtained in [45] for “Path A” and “Path B” tests using a CFE model are presented in Fig. 18
                        . In that work an anisotropic damage model [36] is used together with mesh-adaptive techniques [34].

The crack path obtained in the work of [24] is shown in Fig. 19
                        . The crack model used in [24] is based on the concept of finite elements with embedded discontinuities. The strong discontinuity approach, characterised by the representation of cracks by discontinuities in the displacement field, is formulated within the framework of plasticity theory [19,41,43].

As referred in [45], the simulated cracks are not perfectly skew symmetric, despite the skew symmetry of the problem. Since the same is true for the experimental results, one may speculate about a symmetry-breaking bifurcation, but a rigorous analysis of this aspect is beyond the scope of the present paper.

For the analysis of this structure using the 4fHMS model, a plane stress behaviour is assumed. For the material parameters the following values are adopted: E
                        =30GPa, ν
                        =0.2, ɛd
                        
                        0
                        =10−4, AT
                        
                        =0.995, AC
                        
                        =0.85, BT
                        
                        =8000 and BC
                        
                        =1050. For the characteristic length, the value lc
                        
                        =1.74mm is considered in order to ensure an energy dissipation similar to the one presented by the numerical models used in [24,45].

The mesh used in the simulations with the 4fHMS model is presented in Fig. 20
                        a. Fig. 20b plots the Lobatto mesh when 20 integration points in each direction are considered in the analysis.

To simulate both experimental tests, two discretizations are considered. The first, denoted here as D1, uses Legendre polynomials up to degree five to define the approximation bases for the stress and the strain fields. For the definition of the approximation bases for the displacement fields, the rule followed before to avoid spurious kinematic modes is used again. This discretization yields a total of 5168 degrees of freedom. The second discretization, denoted here as D2, uses Legendre polynomials up to degree seven to define the stress and the strain approximation bases. This discretization presents a total of 9208 degrees of freedom.


                        Figs. 21
                        
                        a and 23
                        a present the final damage distributions obtained using discretization D1 for the load cases “Path A” and “Path B”, respectively. Figs. 21b and 23b show the final damage distributions obtained when discretization D2 is considered. In both numerical simulations there is a good agreement with the experimental results, which is quite satisfactory as the constitutive model is rather simple and isotropic. As expected, discretization D1 provides coarse results in terms of the final damage distribution, as shown in Figs. 21a and 23a. Even if discretization D2 provides more accurate final damage distributions, their evolution is still poorer than the ones achieved with CFE analyses using adaptive mesh refinements [45]. Figs. 22 and 24
                         present the final principal positive strain fields obtained with discretizations D1 and D2 for “Path A” and “Path B”, respectively.


                        Fig. 25
                         plots the relative displacement vs. vertical reaction curves corresponding to the experimental results and to the solutions obtained both with the 4fHMS models being tested and a simulation using a classical finite element discretization. In this case, a total number of 22,074 degrees of freedom is considered and an orthotropic damage model is used to model the non-linear material behaviour.

It is possible to observe that the maximum peak load is overestimated by the numerical models being tested and by the classical finite element discretization. This extra resistance was already reported and discussed in [24].

When analysing the numerical results, it is possible to verify that no convergence is ensured beyond a given value for the prescribed normal displacement. This fact may be justified by the use of an isotropic scalar damage model which may be unable to cope with more sophisticated cracking mechanisms.

According to [50], no smeared crack approach with isotropic behaviour is able to reproduce the curvature of the macro-crack observed experimentally. Only using complex anisotropic damage models, incorporating permanent strains and damage deactivation and combined with mesh-adaptive techniques, the curvature of the macro-cracks observed experimentally can be correctly simulated [9,21,44]. This is the reason why the numerical results presented for this test cannot completely match the observed experimental results for advanced stages of the degradation process. The combination of 4fHMS models with more sophisticated damage models and with adaptive refinement techniques can be regarded as a future research work.

It can be said that agreement with experiments is globally reasonable (which is quite satisfactory because the constitutive model is rather simple and isotropic) and no bias of the mesh lines, typical in simulations with the standard fixed smeared-crack concept [23], has been found. The curved character of the cracks could not be simulated, which seems to be a general tendency in smeared simulations, as pointed out by [23].

The conclusions are quite similar when analysing the strain field distributions obtained with both numerical simulations and presented in Figs. 22 and 24. Fig. 24a clearly shows that the strain distribution obtained for “path B” is clearly unsatisfactory, which is once again expected since the degree of the approximation function used in the analysis is not high enough.

The final example presented and discussed in this paper corresponds to the dynamic non-linear analysis of the Koyna dam considering a seismic load. The geometry of this dam is defined in Fig. 26
                        a.

For the analysis of this structure, Legendre polynomials up to degree five are used for the approximation of the stress and the strain fields and polynomials up to degree four are adopted for the approximation of the displacement fields in domain and on the static boundary. In the analysis of this structure, the Mazars damage model [38] is used. The properties considered for concrete are E
                        =30GPa, ν
                        =0.2, ɛ
                        0
                        =6.63×10−5, AT
                        
                        =0.9 and BT
                        
                        =12,000 and for the soil the following parameters are adopted: E
                        =41GPa, ν
                        =0.1, ɛ
                        0
                        =6.48×10−5, AT
                        
                        =0.65, and BT
                        
                        =1100. No compression damage was considered and a characteristic length lc
                        
                        =0.4m is used. For the numerical integration of the non-linear structural operators and to define the non-local quantities, nine Lobatto points are used in each direction, which was considered enough after several preliminary numerical tests.

The additional masses used to simulate the water oscillations are difficult to implement with the current version of the hybrid-mixed stress models, since no mass along the boundary is used. Therefore, the Westegaard method [22] is adopted to add masses in the domain of the macro-elements 1, 4 and 6, identified in Fig. 26b. This approximation was validated with a CFE code, in which additional masses were placed along the left boundary. The vibration frequencies obtained with the CFE simulation and with the 4fHMS model were identical.

The soil foundation dimensions are enlarged as in [22] to allow for an accurate simulation of the interaction between the soil and the structure. At the horizontal boundary, both vertical and horizontal displacements are restricted. At the vertical boundary only the horizontal displacement is restricted in order to simulate the uniform deformation of the soil along the vertical axis. In the analysis presented here, Rayleigh damping is used considering the first and the second vibration frequencies (p
                        1
                        =14.0334rad/s and p
                        2
                        =29.5367rad/s). A variation of the damping magnitude will be considered in order to study its effect on the damage distribution and the evolution in time of the structural response. The damping by radiation in the elastic domain is not considered here. It is know that wave propagation in the soil considerably depends on the shear behaviour [32], but for the generated accelerogram, the parameters that govern this behaviour are not indicated. Another simplification is introduced since the accelerations along the deepness of the soil are not known. A prescribed displacement history is then applied at the horizontal and vertical boundaries. According to [12], the maximum water level at the time of the earthquake was 91m. The vertical self-weight load and the lateral load due to hydrostatic pressure of the water were applied before the seismic load using a non-linear static analysis.

The seismogram used in the analysis was generated using the density spectra defined by the Portuguese norm [51]. For this purpose, Zone A with soil type I and seismic load type 1 has been considered. A total time of 10s has been adopted for the seism duration. The accelerogram is generated from the spectrum densities, using the method described in [14] for the case of stochastic loads in structures. The generated accelerogram is presented in Fig. 27
                         and corresponds to the same that has been used in [22].

The seismogram is computed from the generated accelerogram by using the Newmark method. As the accelerations are integrated twice, the expected mean null value is lost [14]. For the analysis presented here, this issue is not addressed. The resulting seismogram is shown in Fig. 28
                        . As expected, a final residual displacement of 0.0131m appears, as a consequence of the lost null mean value. The final accelerogram and seismogram are scaled in order to ensure that the maximum peak acceleration corresponds to 0.25g. Three different damping levels for the concrete dam have been tested: 5% (SSTI50), 7.5% (SSTI75) and 10% (SSTI100). The Rayleigh method can only simulate the viscous damping. The damping provided by hysteretic effects and radiation of the elastic domain is not taken into account. A time step increment of 0.001s is chosen and a total integration time of 14.0s is considered.


                        Fig. 29
                         shows the evolution of the top left horizontal displacement for each tested damping value. As expected, the higher the damping is the shorter the maximum and minimum peak values are. It can be observed that the test leading to the highest amplitudes corresponds to discretization SSTI50, while the lowest amplitudes are recovered by test SSTI100. Another interesting result is the behaviour of the structure after 10s. A damped free vibration regime starts, and the amplitudes and the damped vibration periods are different in all three cases. This is due to the different damped behaviour and to the different stiffness’s occurring due to the non-linear behaviour, since higher dampings provide lower damage levels in the structure.

Some convergence difficulties have been noticed in the dynamic analysis of this structure using 4fHMS models. These problems may be explained by analysing the damage distribution evolution presented in Fig. 30
                         for the test case where a damping of 5% is considered. The deformed shapes are plotted using a scale factor of 500. The first damage occurs at time step 1.39s at the top of the short cantilever of the dam, but no convergence problems are yet present. The second appearance of damage occurs at time step 1.45s, at the bottom left near the contact zone between the concrete structure and the soil foundation. The convergence rate decreases significantly at time step 1.58s when a wide damaged zone spreads at the short cantilever of the dam. The damage zone quickly evolves between 1.58 and 1.61s reaching values larger than 0.9. In terms of the dynamic behaviour, it can be said that a damage wave is quickly evolving along those four time steps, making very difficult the convergence process. Damage starts to evolve then to values larger than 0.9 at the right side of the short cantilever. This quick evolution also slows the convergence process. After 1.90s, the region near the bottom of the short cantilever is almost completely damaged. At this stage, another convergence issue is activated. This happens when the principal stress components switch from tension to compression and vice versa. The damaged region starts to spread near the foundation 3.00s after the beginning of the loading process. After this, damage spreads smoothly until the end of the loading history.

As it is known, hybrid-mixed stress models do not locally verify the compatibility conditions [47–49]. Therefore, some displacement discontinuities between elements may occur. For time step 9.00s, Fig. 30 shows a clear discontinuity: this is not due to a crack, but due to the lack of compatibility.

The final tension damage distributions obtained with the tests considering different damping magnitudes are shown in Fig. 31
                        . These results were all expected, since it is natural to predict that for higher dampings, lower damage distributions will be achieved. Fig. 31 shows a clear decrease in terms of the dimension of the regions affected by damage when test SSTI50 is compared to tests SSTI75 and SSTI100.

For test cases SSTI75 and SSTI100, since damping is higher than in test SSTI50, the convergence problems have been smaller. It should be noticed that some of these difficulties still appear, namely when damage waves are propagated.

Several works concerning the dynamic analysis of the Koyna dam with CFE may be found in the literature [10,22,31,35]. However, it was not possible to use the results presented in those works to validate the results obtained with the models being discussed and to assess their numerical efficiency. This is due to the fact these works assume several hypotheses concerning the interaction fluid–structure that go beyond the scope of this work. In those works different earthquake accelerations are used, different constitutive relations are considered and different hypotheses for the structural behaviour are assumed. Even if these models cannot be used to directly validate the results provided by the 4fHMS models, it is possible to use them to assess the global response of the structure and to compare the regions where fracture processes are active.

                         presents the damage distribution (or the fracture process zone) obtained with several numerical tests presented in the literature, using different damage constitutive relations with CFE models. The solution presented in Fig. 32a is obtained with the isotropic damage model with no permanent strains proposed by Cervera [11]. An orthotropic damage model with simplified permanent strains due to tension damage and using the principal positive strain theory [31] is used to obtain the solution represented in Fig. 32b. The results reported in Fig. 32c, are obtained with the simplified orthotropic damage model presented in [31] and considering structure–fluid interaction. Finally, the distribution presented in Fig. 32d is obtained with Lubliner’s [37] plastic damage model with permanent strains due to both compression and tension. These results confirm the global predictions provided by the models presented and discussed in this work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The objective of the research work reported in this paper consisted in the development and test of a hybrid-mixed stress finite element model for the static and dynamic analysis of plane structures with damage mechanics. The examples presented show clearly that the model is stable, robust and leads to accurate results. Effective p- and h-refinement procedures can be implemented. Since it is possible the hierarchical refinement without changing the mesh, macro-elements of large dimensions can be used, which greatly simplifies the operations of pre- and post-processing.

When using the 4fHMS model, the discretizations can lead to systems with a relatively large number of degrees of freedom. However, as such systems are always very sparse, the use of algorithms specially designed for the storage and processing of sparse systems of large dimensions ensures the effectiveness of the numerical computation process. The relationship between the degrees of the polynomials used for the approximation of the stress, strain and the displacement fields should be carefully established to avoid the appearance of spurious modes, which lead to dependencies in the governing system.

As future work, the first step will correspond to the implementation of other types of approximation functions in hybrid-mixed models for dynamic analysis, such as wavelet systems. It is expected also the generalisation of the models discussed here to make possible the static and dynamic physically and geometrically non-linear analysis of structures, using the mixed time integration algorithm [26].

The model will also be generalised in order to allow for the inclusion of steel reinforcement bars to model the behaviour of reinforced concrete structures. In this case, bond slip effects should be taken into consideration.
