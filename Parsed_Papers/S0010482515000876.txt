                  This paper employs the root locus method to conduct a detailed investigation of the parameter regions that ensure bistability in a well-studied gene regulatory network namely, lac operon of Escherichia coli (E. coli). In contrast to previous works, the parametric bistability conditions observed in this study constitute a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions. These conditions were derived by applying the root locus method to the polynomial equilibrium equation of the lac operon model to determine the parameter values yielding the multiple real roots necessary for bistability. The lac operon model used was defined as an ordinary differential equation system in a state equation form with a rational right hand side, and it was compatible with the Hill and Michaelis–Menten approaches of enzyme kinetics used to describe biochemical reactions that govern lactose metabolism. The developed root locus method can be used to study the steady-state behavior of any type of convergent biological system model based on mass action kinetics. This method provides a solution to the problem of analyzing gene regulatory networks under parameter uncertainties because the root locus method considers the model parameters as variable, rather than fixed. The obtained bistability ranges for the lac operon model parameters have the potential to elucidate the appearance of bistability for E. coli cells in in vivo experiments, and they could also be used to design robust hysteretic switches in synthetic biology.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The lactose operon (abbreviated as lac operon) of E. coli bacterium is a gene regulatory network that is responsible for controlling lactose metabolism [1]. The lac operon is composed of three structural genes, lacZ, lacY and lacA, which encode β-galactosidase, galactoside permease and thiogalactoside transacetylase enzymes, respectively. The permease enzyme transports lactose or its non-metabolizable analogs, methyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (TMG) or isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside (IPTG), into the cell. β-Galactosidase hydrolyzes the transported lactose (a disaccharide) into galactose and glucose to be metabolized and catalyzes the conversion of internal lactose to allolactose to induce transcription of the lac operon via binding to the lac repressor. β-Galactosidase cannot metabolize TMG and IPTG, so these chemicals are ideal molecules for artificially inducing the lac operon. Thiogalactoside transacetylase, plays roles in sugar metabolism and detoxification, catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to thiogalactosides [2].

The lac operon of E. coli is controlled by two distinct mechanisms: (i) in the absence of lactose and its analogs, the lactose repressor protein encoded by the lacI gene binds to the promoter region of the lac operon and prohibits the expression of lacZ, lacY and lacA, preventing the induction of the lac operon; (ii) when glucose is available in the extracellular medium, E. coli prefers to use glucose as a carbon-energy source even in the presence of inducers, so the lac operon is not induced due to two glucose-induced suppression processes, catabolite repression and inducer exclusion [3]. Herein, catabolite repression is responsible for the inhibition of the mRNA transcription in the presence of glucose. The presence of glucose results in low 3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, which prevents the binding of cAMP to cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which is required to form the catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) complex required for mRNA transcription. The second suppression process, inducer exclusion, involves the inhibition of external lactose transport into the cell via the interaction of glucose with the permease, which excludes the inducer [3].

Under glucose starvation, both the glucose-stimulated suppression mechanisms become ineffective and allow lactose (or an artificial inducer such as TMG or IPTG) to induce the lac operon. Herein, this system is induced via the following molecular interactions: first, the availability of a small amount of permease due to the basal transcription of mRNA mediates the transport of a small amount of external lactose (or an artificial inducer) into the cell. Then, allolactose, which is produced from the transported lactose by β-galactosidase, or the transported artificial inducer binds to the LacI repressor protein and changes the conformation of the repressor to dissociate the repressor from the promoter region. The resulting inhibition of the LacI repressor induces the lac operon, allowing the RNA polymerase enzyme to come into contact with the free promoter site of the lac operon and initiate the synthesis of the lacZ, lacY and lacA genes. Then, the transcription of mRNA and the expression of permease, β-galactosidase and thiogalactoside transacetylase increase rapidly. The increase in the amount of permease due to the production of mRNA provides a positive feedback, resulting in the transportation of lactose (or an artificial inducer) and the production of mRNA in much greater amounts compared to the basal activity. This mutual amplification is limited by the saturated rate of molecular interactions. The amounts of mRNA, internal inducers and permease eventually reach steady-state values, as determined by the reductions, due to degradation and other processes.

By virtue of the above described control mechanisms, the lac operon defines a biological switch controlled by two inputs (i.e., external glucose and lactose-artificial inducer) so that it is open (induced) only when lactose (or an artificial inducer), but not glucose, is available in the extracellular medium. In experiments using TMG and IPTG at the population and cell level, the induction status of E. coli clearly depends on its previous induction status in addition to the levels of extracellular glucose and inducer concentrations [4–8]. E. coli cells maintain their induced and uninduced states (i.e., if they are induced or uninduced, they have a tendency to remain in that state). A large number of theoretical studies have attempted to explain how two alternative equilibrium states (i.e., the induced and uninduced states) exist as steady-state levels for the same concentrations of extracellular glucose and inducer [6,9–19]. Research generally states that this characteristic is due to the bistable behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system possessing two stable equilibria. This induction mechanism of the lac operon has been observed as the response to changing extracellular concentration levels of glucose and inducer, and it has been described in a number of models derived from enzyme kinetics using the well-known engineering concept of hysteresis [6].

Although the above described operation of the lac operon as a bistable hysteretic switch under glucose starvation has been observed in many experimental studies using the gratuitous inducers, TMG and IPTG, no experimental evidence has been reported using lactose as a substrate [6,18–20]. The existence of bistability for both gratuitous inducers and natural inducer, such as allolactose, has also been studied using a number of theoretical models. Most lac operon models are derived from mass action kinetics employing Hill and Michaelis–Menten approaches, and they are defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [3,6,11–16,18–25]. In silico studies revealed that these ODE models exhibit bistable behavior for both artificial and natural inducers, and while bistability is possible for natural inducer, it is less likely to occur compared to artificial inducers.

A portion of the theoretical research suggests that induction of the lac operon in the natural setting with lactose as substrate lacks the bistable phenomenon [13,15,18–20]. Metabolism of the natural inducer attenuates the positive feedback due to the permease [15,18–20], and the increased stabilization of the dilution rate of permease, which is squarely proportional to the permease activity of the metabolism of the natural inducer [13], represent two major biological reasons why bistability is not apparent when lactose is used in in vivo experiments. The literature also suggests [16,24] that bistability does not disappear for lactose, although much higher lactose concentrations are required for it to be observed compared to artificial inducers. Therefore, there is still a need to test theoretical predictions with suitably designed in vivo experiments.

ODE models, which are described in terms of molecule concentrations rather than molecule numbers, effectively represent molecular interactions only at high concentration levels, which is a valid assumption for inducers, but not for mRNA and permease variables. Stochastic models of the lac operon, which are usually expressed as the chemical master equation defining time evolution of the probability distribution of molecule numbers, have also been used to obtain more realistic predictions [16,24,26–30]. One report suggested [16] that the existence of bistability in the ODE model is implied by the bimodality observed in the steady-state solution of the corresponding master equation under the same parameter setting, but the reverse may not always be true. Other reports state [26,29] that bistability and bimodality do not necessarily imply the presence of each other. Thus, ODE and stochastic models for predicting bistable behavior of the lac operon must be analyzed by new theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Moreover, testing the present hypotheses and introducing new ones, such as studying the mechanisms governing lac operon dynamics in vivo, warrant further investigation [7,8,31–34].

ODE models derived from mass action kinetics and stochastic models derived from stochastic chemical kinetics are defined by a number of internal parameters (e.g., reaction rate constants) and external parameters (e.g., external inducer and glucose concentrations) [28]. The quantitative and qualitative behaviors of lac operon models depend on the values of the model parameters. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the estimation of the biophysically realistic values of these model parameters due to the differences between in vivo and in vitro kinetics, laboratory conditions, parameter heterogeneity within a population, a lack of direct measurements, and inaccuracies in data fitting used for parameter calculations, among others [20,29,35,36]. To validate or invalidate the existence of bistable behavior for the lac operon in natural settings, one can attempt to determine the entire bistability ranges of the model parameters and check whether the values falling within these ranges are biophysically realistic.

This paper utilizes the root locus method to determine the bistability parameter ranges of the ODE model of the lac operon. The root locus method is applicable to address this problem because of the following facts: (i) ODE models derived based on mass action kinetics can be obtained as nonlinear state equations whose right hand sides are rational functions of molecule concentrations when Michaelis–Menten and Hill approximations employed; (ii) the equilibrium equation for these ODE models can be written as polynomial equations of the concentrations; and (iii) the model parameters originated from Michaelis–Menten and Hill kinetics constitute the linear coefficients of the polynomial equilibrium equation, so each of these linear coefficients can be considered as a control parameter, such that the number and positions of the equilibrium points can be determined as a function of the chosen control parameter using the root locus method. Thus, the bistability range with respect to a specific model parameter is obtained by specifying the parameter values yielding multiple (real) roots to the equilibrium equation. Herein, the existence of multiple equilibrium points, particularly three equilibrium points, such that two are asymptotically stable and the third is unstable, indicates the presence of bistability.

To identify multiple equilibrium points, one may apply multiple root finding algorithms to determine the number and positions of the real roots of the polynomial equilibrium equation or integrate numerical ODEs to find the steady state solution for each possible initial state. These root finding and numerical integration algorithms, which could be applied for all possible values of the model parameters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, represent a considerable computational burden and do not provide a framework for analytical derivations. The root locus method proposed in this paper to determine bistability ranges presents graphical and numerical information related to the change of the number and positions of the equilibrium points. The method is especially useful for efficiently identifying bifurcation points where a qualitative change starts at these values of the parameters. It also provides a framework for analytical derivations to parameterize the bifurcation points, making it possible to specify the boundaries of the bistability regions. The proposed root locus method can be used for the parametric equilibrium analysis of any ODE model whose state equation form admits a rational right hand side, including models defining gene regulatory networks and metabolic networks. In contrast to a recently introduced discriminant based method [37] that can be used for polynomial equilibrium equations of degree less than four, there is no dimensional restriction when using the root locus method for the derivation of bistability parameter ranges in an analytical way. Therefore, the root locus method is able to determine the optimal value of a specific parameter, so it has a potential application as a design/control tool for biological and synthetic gene regulatory networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the lac operon model analyzed in this paper. Section 3 briefly describes the classical root locus method of control theory and shows the superiority of the proposed root locus method over the root finding method for polynomial equilibrium equations in the steady-state analysis of two production–degradation type biological models. The application of the root locus method for the bistability analysis of a minimal TMG-induced lac operon model, which takes into account the catabolite repression and inducer exclusion mechanisms, are presented in detail in Section 4. The results include the root locus diagrams with respect to the model parameters and analytical derivations based on break-in and break-away points for capturing the bistability region boundaries in the model parameter space. Based on the results obtained using the root locus method, bistability regions were constructed in Section 4 in terms of internal parameters and input variables, namely external glucose and external TMG. Considering the fact that TMG- and IPTG-induced lac operon models have the same structure, despite having different parameter ranges, the bistability parameter region for the IPTG-induced model is also included in Section 4. Section 5 presents the conclusions.

Most in vivo studies on the bistability of the lac operon utilized the artificial inducer, TMG, which allows for the separation of induction and metabolism; TMG is imported via permease, so it induces mRNA production, but it is not metabolized by β-galactosidase. Thus, due to their relative simplicity as a consequence of having fewer interactions and fewer variables involved, TMG and IPTG are suitable for in vivo experimental studies and the analysis of theoretical models of lac operon. In this study, we developed a mathematical model for TMG-mediated induction of the lac operon that is minimal in the sense that it contains the most basic mechanisms needed to express bistable behavior. This model can also be used to evaluate IPTG-mediated induction of the lac operon, although it is important to consider differences of the actual values of the model parameters.

The TMG-induced lac operon model consists of three ordinary differential equations, with the mRNA, permease and TMG concentration as state variables. As shown in Fig. 1
                     , the TMG model includes (i) the catabolite repression and inducer exclusion of the extracellular glucose, (ii) the transcription of mRNA by TMG, (iii) the production of permease, (iv) the transportation of TMG via permease and (v) the degradation of TMG, mRNA and permease. It is assumed that there are no translational and transcriptional delays in the lac operon mechanism. The model is suitable for analyzing the hysteretic bistable behavior of the lac operon, which occurs due to the positive feedback resulting from permease activation, and for representing the inducer but not glucose logical function expressing the induction mechanism of the lac operon.

The TMG-induced lac operon model is described by the following state model, which is composed of three first order differential equations representing the reaction rates in terms of the mRNA, permease and internal TMG concentrations:

                      are decreasing functions of external glucose; the former describes catabolite repression, while the latter describes inducer exclusion.

Regarding the TMG-induced lac operon model, the temporal change in mRNA concentration is defined in (1) as the difference between the production depending on the internal TMG concentration under the catabolite repression effect of external glucose and the losses due to active degradation and growth. Equation (2) accounts for the change in permease concentration in terms of synthesized permease and losses. Similarly, the change in the internal TMG concentration is expressed in (3), where an increase in TMG is due to the import of the external TMG under the reduction effect of inducer exclusion, and a decrease is due to its degradation and dilution.

Assuming the production of mRNA under TMG as an allosteric interaction similar to that of allolactose,

The root locus method is a well-known classical method in control area to determine the changes of the location of closed-loop system poles as a function of a model parameter. The usual concern in control applications employing the root locus method is to identify the range of a controller parameter ensuring a desired behavior of the closed-loop system such as Lyapunov (asymptotic) stability which is obtained for the closed-loop poles all in the open left half-plane. As described in Subsection 3.1, the poles of the Laplace domain (closed-loop) transfer function are indeed the roots to the characteristic equation which is a rational function of s complex variable. So, studying the positions of the poles in the complex plane is equivalent to determine the positions of the roots to a polynomial equation. This classical method of root locus is actually valid for any kind of polynomial equations with real-valued coefficients. The proposed application of the root locus method for the bistability analysis of lac operon relies on the following facts: (i) ODE models derived from mass action kinetics with Michaelis–Menten or Hill approach have state equation forms with rational right hand sides, so their rational equilibrium equations can be rearranged as polynomial equations. (ii) For a deterministic dynamical system defined by ODEs, in particular lac operon model given by (1)–(3), a bistable behavior requires triple equilibria which are actually the real roots to the equilibrium equation, exactly two of which are asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov [37]. So, for the polynomial equilibrium equation case, the range of a specific model parameter ensuring three real equilibria can be found by applying the classical root locus to this equilibrium equation.

To make the paper self-contained, the classical root locus method is briefly described in Subsection 3.1. Subsection 3.2 demonstrates the applicability of the root locus method for studying the change of the equilibrium point(s) of gene regulatory networks on a simple synthetic model representing the production and degradation of a biological molecule. Subsection 3.3 which considers a rather complicated production–degradation model available in the literature is devoted to show that the root locus method is by no means restricted to equilibrium equations of three or less degree as appeared in the bistability analysis of lac operon model presented in Section 4 but valid for the equilibrium equations of arbitrary degree.

It is well known that the transient behavior and the Lyapunov stability can be studied based on the positions of the closed-loop poles which are the roots to the following characteristic equation:

Since a linear time-invariant system provides always rational transfer functions of s complex variable, then the characteristic equation can be factored out in terms of the open-loop zeros (z

Herein, K
                        
                           p
                         stands for a non-negative constant which may be the proportional controller gain. To find the range of K
                        
                           p
                         ensuring Lyapunov stability, one may try to find the roots to the characteristic equation for all possible K
                        
                           p
                         values. Despite such a brute force approach leading an inefficient way, the root locus method exploits a set of useful properties to draw the loci of the roots as a function of K
                        
                           p
                         parameter without determining the roots for all K
                        
                           p
                         values. The most basic property might be the one stating that the roots to the characteristic equation starts from the open-loop poles (p
                        
                           i
                        ׳s) and tends to the open-loop zeros (z
                        
                           i
                        ׳s) as the gain K
                        
                           p
                         changes from zero to infinity. The other basic properties on which the steps of root locus method are based can actually be derived from the magnitude and phase conditions in the following equation:

Drawing the root locus can be implemented in a procedure combining the results of the following steps: (i) Calculate the open-loop poles and zeros. (ii) Determine the root loci on the real axis. (iii) Calculate the asymptotes of the root loci. (iv) Find the break-in and break-away points. (v) Calculate the departure angles away from the complex open-loop poles and the arrival angles to the complex open-loop zeros. (vi) Find the points where the root loci cross the imaginary axis. The implementation details and derivation of the properties of the root locus method can be found in a standard control text book, e.g. [38].

                         which is the finite root to the nominator while the other tends to the infinite root to the nominator. Using appropriate properties stated in Subsection 3.2, one can obtain the root loci as in Fig. 3
                         for 
                           μ

In fact, for this second order polynomial equilibrium equation, one can also find the root loci in a closed form as:

                        . Despite such closed form solutions are not available for polynomial equilibrium equations with degrees higher than three, the root locus method is valid for any degree of polynomial equilibrium equations. When no closed-form solution exists, one may try to find the roots to the equilibrium equation for each possible K
                        
                           p
                         parameter values by a root finding algorithm. The root locus method is numerically more efficient in comparison to such a brute force method since it needs to calculate some feature only to capture the whole root loci.

The computer experiments for the root locus method and also the root finding method were conducted in MATLAB numerical software. In a PC with a 2GHz Core 
                           i
                           7
                         Quad processor with 8GB RAM, the computation times needed for the root locus and the root finding were measured as 2.04s and, respectively, 6.59s when the v parameter was chosen in the range of 
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           5000
                           ]
                         and incremented with a step size of 0.1 starting from 0. When the step size was chosen as 0.01 for a better resolution for the same range 
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           5000
                           ]
                        , the computation time became 12.57s for the root locus and 770.54s for the root finding. To obtain the root loci for the above mentioned specific values of parameter v, the Matlab function, rlocus(num,den,v), was used. The roots in the root finding method were computed for the same values of parameter v by using the Matlab function, roots. The results show that the root locus method is much more efficient than the root finding method in terms of computation time and that a ten-fold increase in the resolution of the parameter space results in approximately a six-fold increase in the computation time for the root locus method while more than a 100-fold increase in the computation time for the root finding method. It should be further noted that the computation time given for the root locus method includes also the time for plotting the root loci and the computation time for the root locus was obtained as 0.58s when the Matlab function, rlocus (num,den), providing a self-adjusting resolution was used.

This subsection is devoted to explain that the root locus method can be applied to high order equilibrium equations associated to gene regulatory networks modeled by assuming Michaelis–Menten and/or Hill kinetics. Let consider the model of [26] where the production is of Hill type with Hill coefficient n=3 and the degradation is linear:

                        .

Let us apply the root locus method to find the range of v parameter ensuring the bistability for the above given nominal parameter values. The equilibrium equation in the so-called characteristic equation form is obtained in the following equation:

The root loci of the equilibrium equation in (12) are drawn in Fig. 4
                        .

Three positive real roots which are the necessary and sufficient for the bistability of the model are seen by the root loci to exist for the range 
                           v
                           ∈
                           (
                           36.8
                           ,
                           47.5
                           )
                        . The upper and lower limits of the range are indeed break-away and break-in points of the root loci. The superiority of the root locus method becomes evident in this example since there is no known closed form expression for the roots to the fourth order polynomial equilibrium equation

As done in Subsection 3.2, the computation times needed for the two methods were measured in the same numerical environment. The computation times needed for the root locus and the root finding were measured as 2.54
                        sec and, respectively, 28.92
                        sec when 
                           v
                           ∈
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           5000
                           ]
                         with a resolution of 0.1. For a resolution of 0.01 in the same range 
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           5000
                           ]
                        , the computation time increased to 26.27
                        sec for the root locus and to 3182.9
                        sec for the root finding. The results show that the root locus method is much more efficient than the root finding method in terms of computation time also for the model in (11).

As stated in Section 3, bistability of an ODE model necessitates to have three equilibria taking place at the positive concentration levels so that they are valid biologically. Exactly two of these equilibria should be asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov [37]. Herein, the unstable equilibrium point at the mid actually behaves as a separator between the domains of attractions associated to the asymptotically stable equilibrium points. Thus, the bistability analysis of an ODE lac operon model is realized by first determining the roots to the equilibrium equations, such that the real roots provide the equilibria, and followed by studying the Lyapunov stability of each equilibrium point. It is shown [37] that the lac operon model defined in (1)–(3) either has a unique asymptotically stable equilibrium or triple equilibria two of which are asymptotically stable and the other unstable for all possible p, K, K
                     1 parameter values. The Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium points of the model (1)–(3) has been well studied in [37]. So, this paper is focused on the existence of triple equilibria which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the bistability of the lac operon model (1)–(3).

The parameter ranges that ensure the existence of triple equilibria for the ODE lac operon model (1)–(3) can be determined by finding the real roots to the associated polynomial equilibrium equation for each specific set of model parameters in a numerical way. Alternatively, the real roots can be identified by obtaining the closed form (in particular, analytical) expression of the roots and/or the transition points from real to complex roots as functions of the model parameters, for instance, by employing a cusp analysis [20] or a method based on discriminant of the polynomial equation [37]. The available analytical methods provide valuable insights into how the number and position of the real roots change depending on the parameters; however, they may be hindered when using polynomial equations greater than the third degree because these equations need to use derivations requiring the closed form (parametric) expressions of the roots of the polynomial equations or the discriminant of a polynomial equation. As described below, the root locus method serves as a powerful numerical and analytical tool for studying the conditions of model parameters yielding multiple equilibria. It should be noted that the root locus method is applicable to any polynomial equilibrium equation of arbitrary degree, and it is valid for multi-parameter cases. However, it is especially suitable for analyzing the effect of single parameter variations on the occurrence of multiple equilibria.

To obtain the equilibrium equation for T, the state variables M, P and T are assumed to be constant in (1)–(3), and the equilibrium concentrations M and P are eliminated:

As is the case for any odd degree polynomial equation, the third order equation (15) always has a real root corresponding to an equilibrium point. The other two roots of (15) may be either a complex conjugate pair or real. In the case of three real roots, they may appear as (i) three identical roots, (ii) two distinct roots, such that one is double, or (iii) three distinct roots. The existence of bistable behavior occurs only with two stable equilibria separated by an unstable equilibrium requiring three different real roots [37]. To determine the ranges of the parameters ensuring the bistability of the TMG-induced lac operon model in (1)–(3), we must identify the parameter values at which the complex roots transform to the real roots. These transition points are the break-in/away points in the root locus analysis.

To determine the bistability parameter region of our lac operon model, the root locus method will be applied according to the following steps:
                        
                           1.
                           For each model parameter (p, K, and K
                              1), the equilibrium equation (15) will be written in the usual characteristic equation form:

                        [6], the root locus diagram for the p parameter is drawn in Fig. 5
                         using Matlab numerical software. The diagram reveals that there is only one real root for small and large p values, and three real roots exist for a bounded interval of p. By computing the break-in and break-away points, the bistability interval is determined as 
                           p
                           ∈
                           (

                         for the considered K and K
                        1 values.

The bistability interval in Fig. 5 is derived for particular values of K and K
                        1. The lower and upper limits, as well as the existence of the bistability interval for p depend on K and K
                        1 values. Eq. (19) for break-in and break-away points indicates that the (positive) K
                        1 acts only as a scaling factor, causing a quantitative, not a qualitative, change on the root locus drawn for p. To observe qualitative changes in the root locus and the bistability interval for p, it is sufficient to only consider different values for the K parameter.

A gallery of root locus diagrams obtained for different K values is given in Fig. 6
                        , where K
                        1 remains constant at

                        . Fig. 6a demonstrates the scenario with only one real root for all p values, in other words, complex root loci that never cross the real axis. Herein, K is equal to 2 as an example of K values less than 9 that lack break-in and break-away points. Fig. 6b corresponds to the limit case of K=9, where the break-in and break-away points coincide, so there is a triple real root for a specific p value, but no other p value providing multiple real roots. In Fig. 6c–f, which consists of four different K values greater than 9, three real roots exist for p values in non-empty and bounded intervals. Herein, K=167.1, K=1000, and K=7200 are the values of the repression factor measured/estimated by the work in [6] for the TMG-induced lac operon, by the works in [11,39] for the IPTG-induced lac operon, and by the works in [26,40] for the IPTG-induced lac operon, respectively.

The computation times needed for the root locus and root finding methods were measured in the numerical environment expressed in Subsection 3.2. The computation times needed for the root locus and the root finding were measured as 3.39
                        sec and, respectively, 18.85
                        sec when

                        sec for the root finding.

                         are defined in (30) and (31). Actually the upper bound in (33) is equivalent to the upper bound in (20), although their closed-form expressions are quite different and very hard to justify their equivalence by algebraic manipulations. The equivalence of the boundary surfaces defined with (33) and (20) can be shown in a numerical way. So, there is a need to apply the root locus method for each specific parameter if the bistability range of it is of particular interest. Another reason for the necessity of applying the root locus for each parameter, namely p, K, and K
                        1 follows from that each bound of a specific parameter defining a two dimensional boundary surface in the three dimensional

                         parameter space is obtained by assuming the other two parameters as free ignoring any possible constraint over them and so there is a need to capture these constraints.

                         displays a gallery of root locus diagrams for K
                        1 that were obtained using Matlab with a fixed p value and different K values, yielding the existence or non-existence of the break-in and break-away points.

The bistability conditions derived using the root locus method in Subsections 4.1–4.3 were obtained for one-parameter only (i.e., for

The upper and lower limits of the bistability interval for a specific parameter are functions of the other two parameters.

                        Fig. 13 demonstrates that the apex of the bistability region occurs at K=9. In other words, K=9 is the lowest value of K that ensures the existence of a non-empty bistability interval for K
                        1. Furthermore, the bistability interval for K
                        1 grows as K increases, and the interval becomes narrower as p values increase.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we used the root locus method to derive the ranges of the model parameters providing bistable behavior for minimal TMG- and IPTG- induced lac operon models in a detailed and systematic way. The theoretical results obtained for the ranges of external glucose and external inducers, which ensure the bistability of the lac operon for both of TMG and IPTG are compatible with the experimental observations reported in the literature.

To derive the bistability parameter regions, we employed the root locus method to determine the number and positions of the real roots of the equilibrium equation of the considered ordinary differential equation model in a successive way, such that one model parameter is taken into consideration at each step, while the remaining parameters remain fixed. The root locus method not only provides an efficient numerical tool for multiple equilibrium analysis, but it also specifies the bistability region boundaries, namely the bifurcation points, in an analytical manner based on the parametric expression of break-in and break-away points.

In contrast to existing methods that enable analytical derivation to determine bistability parameter regions, the root locus method is applicable to state equations with rational right hand sides that yield polynomial equilibrium equations without any dimensional restriction.

The determined bistability ranges for the lac operon model parameters might aid our understanding of variations in the appearance of the bistable behavior of the biological lac operon, which presents differently from one species to another and even from one experiment to another. By checking whether the experimentally measured parameter values fall in the determined bistability regions, it may be possible to achieve the validation of the lac operon models developed in the literature.

The determined bistability ranges may allow us to determine feedback and/or optimal control methods to regulate the behavior of lac operon, while optimizing performance measures.

The developed root locus method is especially useful for understanding the effect of a specific parameter on the bistability behavior of the lac operon without assuming any nominal value for this parameter, so it provides a solution to the issue of parameter uncertainty, which is the norm, rather than the exception, in gene regulatory networks.

The root locus based parametric equilibrium analysis used for bistability analysis of lac operon models in this paper is applicable to any multi-dimensional multi-parameter system model defined by state equations whose right hand side is rational in terms of state variables. Metabolic and gene regulatory networks represent examples of these types of systems when Hill and Michaelis–Menten approaches are employed for the derivation of system models based on enzyme kinetics. To implement the classical single-parameter root locus for a multi-dimensional multi-parameter model describing the dynamics among a set of molecular concentrations, one needs first to recast the equilibrium equations in terms of a number of state variables into a single equilibrium equation of a single state variable by eliminating all state variables other than the one of particular interest. What would be done for a model with a large number of parameters such as models of cell fate decision processes with more than 50 parameters [42] is (i) to reduce the number of parameters as much as possible by combining the ones having an effect on the positions of the roots as if a single parameter such as p parameter of the paper, (ii) to consider the model constants only which are the input (control) parameters or the ones with large uncertainties as the parameter, (iii) to apply the root locus for a specific parameter after holding all parameters fixed other than the specific one, and then (iv) repeat this procedure for all possible values of the fixed parameters and also for each other parameter whenever necessary, so combine the results.

The described root locus-based bistability analysis may be applied to study of the effect of a specific mechanism not included by the considered minimal lac operon model, and it could also be used study the bistable behavior of the lac operon under natural conditions.

Taking into account possible connections between the loci of the equilibrium points and behavioral characteristics, we expect that the root locus method is appropriate for potential applications in designing synthetic biological switches and for bifurcation analysis of multi-dimensional and multi-parameter biological models with respect to some control parameters.
