@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  We study the effect of capacity uncertainty on the inventory decisions of a risk-averse newsvendor. We consider two well-known risk criteria, namely Value-at-Risk (VaR) included as a constraint and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). For the risk-neutral newsvendor, we find that the optimal order quantity is not affected by the capacity uncertainty. However, this result does not hold for the risk-averse newsvendor problem. Specifically, we find that capacity uncertainty decreases the order quantity under the CVaR criterion. Under the VaR constraint, capacity uncertainty leads to an order decrease for low confidence levels, but to an order increase for high confidence levels. This implies that the risk criterion should be carefully selected as it has an important effect on inventory decisions. This is shown for the newsvendor problem, but is also likely to hold for other inventory control problems that future research can address.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In most of the inventory control literature, demand uncertainty is the only type of uncertainty considered. However, there are many reasons why in real life situations capacity may also be uncertain. These include yield loss (related to quality considerations), unreliable machinery and unplanned maintenance. We refer interest readers to Yano and Lee (1995) and Grosfeld-Nir and Gerchak (2004) for summaries of the effects of random capacity on inventory control.

Random capacity, resulting from the before mentioned uncertainties, has been studied for the well-known newsvendor problem. Ciarallo et al. (1994) show that random capacity does not affect the order quantity of the risk neutral newsvendor, i.e., under the profit maximization objective. More general, as discussed in detail in Section 2.1, the effect of random capacity under the risk-averse criterion on the single period problem is limited. However, Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) provide experimental evidence suggesting that inventory managers are risk averse for high-value products. Thus, the assumption of risk neutrality is not always applicable. In view of this, a number of authors have therefore considered the risk aversion issue through the use of some related objectives, such as utility functions, the mean–variance objective function, VaR (downside risk) and CVaR (coherent measures). We will summarize key results in Section 2.2. It will appear that risk aversion has not been studied on inventory systems with random capacity.

In this paper, we consider a risk-averse newsvendor problem with uncertainty in both demand volume and production capacity. We find that the risk criterion should be carefully selected, as different criteria affect the inventory decision in different ways. More specifically, we find that capacity uncertainty always leads to a lower order quantity under the CVaR criterion, but it may lead to either a lower or a higher order quantity under the VaR constraint. So, different from the risk neutral setting, we find that additional uncertainty may lead to a lower inventory level under both considered risk averse criteria.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature on the newsvendor problem with random capacity and on the risk-averse newsvendor problem. Section 3 introduces the risk-averse newsvendor model and the various criteria. In Section 4, we derive the optimal order decisions under different risk measures. Section 5 discusses the impact of the randomness of capacity and the mean-CVaR criterion. Section 6 concludes the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The newsvendor literature is surveyed from two aspects: random capacity/yield and risk averseness. We mainly focus on the single-period newsvendor problem, but also consider more general periodic review models that include the newsvendor model as a special case.


                        Ciarallo et al. (1994) first study of the implications of variable capacity for the newsvendor problem. They study a periodic-review production model with random capacity, and show for the single-period problem that random capacity does not affect the optimal order quantity. Wang and Gerchak (1996) extend their model to a system with both random capacity and random yield. Bollapragada et al. (2004) consider assembly systems with random capacity at each component supplier that are controlled with base-stock policies. Erdem et al. (2006) consider an EOQ model with multiple suppliers who face random capacities. They obtain the unique optimal order quantities for the suppliers under which the expected unsatisfied order is the same for each supplier, and study the diversification among suppliers for some given distributions. Okyay et al. (2010) consider the classical newsvendor problem with random demand, random capacity and/or random yield where the demand and supply are assumed to be dependent. They provide mathematical characterizations of the optimal order quantity.

This research area related to random yield, started by Karlin (1958), has received a lot of attention in operations research. Basu (1987) characterizes the optimal order policy when the mean of random supply is proportional to the quantity ordered. Hsu and Bassok (1999) study the optimal production strategy for multiple products with downward substitution. Khouja (1999) provides a comprehensive review of research before 1995 in this area. Some renewed interest and new applications have appeared in this area in recent years. Grosfeld-Nir et al. (2000) develop a framework to calculate the optimal batch and the expected number of inspections with uncertain yield patterns. Under an acquisition-price-sensitive yield rate, Bakal and Akcali (2006) analyze the impacts of yield variation on the profitability of remanufacturing and the value of perfect yield rate information. Rekik et al. (2007) analyze the optimal order quantity in the presence of two types of errors caused by yield uncertainty: the standard deviation of the received quantity is independent of the quantity ordered and the standard deviation of the quantity received is proportional to the quantity ordered. All these authors assume a risk neutral newsvendor, different from our research.

Modelling risk-averse newsvendor problems has received considerable attention in recent years. Utility functions (e.g., Lau (1980), Agrawal and Seshadri (2000), Chen et al. (2007), Choi and Ruszczyński (2011)), mean–variance (e.g., Chen and Federgruen (2000), Wu et al. (2009)) and VaR/CVaR are the three main research streams. We refer interested readers to Qin et al. (2011) for summaries of the ordering policies of newsvendors with various risk preferences. Here, we review the key contribution of the VaR/CVaR approach, which are the two most important financial risk measures that have emerged and been widely used in recent years.


                        Luciano et al. (2003) use the VaR as a risk measure in a single product, multi-period inventory model. They give an exact analysis to obtain the VaR. Gan et al. (2005) incorporate the VaR concept for a newsvendor problem with a downside risk constraint for a single product. They study channel coordination without shortage cost where the supplier is risk-neutral and the retailer is constrained by a downside risk. spsacctoremoveAPAÖzler et al. (2009) consider the single-period newsvendor problem with VaR constraints in the multi-product case. They derive the exact profit distribution function for the two-product newsvendor problem and develop an approximation method for the profit distribution of multi-product case. Jammernegg and Kischka (2012) present a comparative analysis of VaR and CVaR as objectives and constraints, respectively, in the newsvendor problem. They show that the CVaR newsvendor orders less than the VaR newsvendor.


                        Gotoh and Takano (2007) investigate the risk-averse newsvendor problem under the objective of minimizing the CVaR. They show that downside risk measures including the CVaR are tractable due to their convexity. Ahmed et al. (2007) study the multi-period newsvendor problem without shortage cost, where the objective function is a coherent risk measure. They show that the structure of the optimal solution of the risk-averse model is similar to that of the risk-neutral case. Jammernegg and Kischka (2007) analyze the ordering policy and its corresponding performance measures, such as the cycle service level. They consider the tradeoff between the CVaR and the expected profit and conclude that a risk-averse (risk-seeking) newsvendor orders less (more) than a risk-neutral newsvendor. Chen et al. (2009) analyze a price-dependent newsvendor model under the CVaR criterion, and derive the optimal ordering and pricing decisions for both the additive and multiplicative demand model. Choi et al. (2011) consider a multi-product risk-averse newsvendor without shortage cost under the law-invariant coherent measures of risk and show that increased risk aversion leads to decreased orders. Xu and Li (2010) discuss the newsvendor problem with shortage cost by balancing the expected profit and the CVaR criterion. It is shown that the optimal order quantity of the risk-averse newsvendor can be either larger or smaller than that of the risk-neutral newsvendor.

A common assumption of all the literature on VaR and/or CVaR approach is, to the best of our knowledge, that the only source of uncertainty is the demand. An interesting and unexplored question is what happens in an, arguably even more realistic, situation with random capacity. This is the main focus of our research, where we will consider both the VaR and the CVaR approach in order to gain insights into the effects of different risk criteria.

In this section, we define the newsvendor problem under three different objectives. The notations used in the paper are given in Table 1
                     . Random demand and random capacity are assumed to be independent. Without loss of generality, we assume that F(0)=
                     G(0)=0.

The expected profit, VaR and CVaR are three main approaches of modelling newsvendor problem. The expected profit objective as the traditional risk neutral criterion is to maximize the expected profit.

VaR measures the maximum profit loss in the majority of cases (normally 95% or 99%). The standard VaR criterion maximizes the lower end of a one-sided confidence interval (Artzner et al. (1999)). A clear disadvantage of the standard VaR criterion is that it purely considers risk but not the expected profits. Although many inventory managers may be risk averse, they still strive to attain a high (expected) profit. To reflect this, the VaR can be used as a constraint, e.g., with a probability of at least 95% the realized profit is above some fixed amount. Gan et al. (2005) point out that the VaR constraint is equivalent to a downside risk constraint, which requires that the worst loss given a confidence level be less than a given bound. The decision problem with the VaR constraint is formulated as follows:

                     0 is a given constant and η
                     ∈(0,1]. Note that, for η
                     =1, the newsvendor problem with the VaR constraint reduces to the standard newsvendor problem.

In practice, a drawback of the VaR constraint is computational complexity because the feasible region may be non-convex. To overcome this drawback, Daníelsson et al. (2008) provide a sufficient condition under which the computational complexity can be significantly reduced. Recently, Birgin et al. (2011) develop a low order-value approach for solving the VaR-constrained optimization problem. These above results can be used to find the optimal solution to the newsvendor problem with the VaR constraint.

The CVaR maximizes the average profit of the profit falling below a certain quantile level (or VaR) which is defined as the maximum profit at a specified confidence level. More formally, the CVaR is defined as

                     where η
                     ∈(0,1] reflects the degree of risk aversion. The CVaR is a coherent risk measure with attractive computational characteristics and consequently is widely used in the financial fields. Further, the CVaR not only considers the downside risk, but also takes into account the profit since it can be equivalent to a special mean-risk criterion (Choi and Andrzej (2008)). For more details on the CVaR, we refer to Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000), Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002) and the references therein.

To minimize the downside risk of the profit, the objective of the decision maker is to maximize the CVaR, i.e.,

We start in Section 4.1 by giving the optimal order quantities under all three approaches without a capacity shortage. These will serve as important benchmarks. Then, in Section 4.2, we derive the optimal order quantities under random capacity.

Under the risk-neutral criterion, it is well know that the optimal order quantity of the standard newsvendor model is

                         is increasing in Q, which implies that, for a given target profit π
                        0, the probability that the profit with unlimited capacity is less than the target profit is increasing in the order quantity. Furthermore, it follows from (3) that the newsvendor problem with a VaR constraint can be written in terms of the probability distribution function of the demand as

We first discuss the effects of capacity uncertainty under different risk measures by comparing the results in Sections 3 and 4. Besides analytically comparing order quantities, we also provide numerical examples to illustrate our results. Further, to address the trade-off between the expected profit and the risk, we explore the model under the mean-CVaR criterion.

Under the risk-neutral criterion, it is obvious that the uncertainty of capacity does not affect the newsvendor’s optimal order quantity, i.e.,

                     . Indeed, this result is intuitive, as the newsvendor gains nothing by ordering more if the capacity is uncertain, and receives a lower profit by ordering less.

Under the VaR constraint, the effects of capacity uncertainty on the optimal order quantity are stated in Theorem 2, proceeded by Lemma 1.

We next present an example to illustrate our findings and explain why, under the VaR constraint, capacity uncertainty leads to an order increase for small values of η, but to an order decreases for large values of η. Suppose that demand and capacity are both normally distributed with mean 5 and standard deviation 1. Let r
                     =3, c
                     =2, s

                     0
                     =3. Then we easily get that

                      under random capacity, the corresponding probability clearly reduces and turns out to be 17.9%. This implies that the randomness of capacity reduces the downside risk of the profit. Therefore, in order to increase the downside risk to the allowed level, the order quantity under random capacity has to be enlarged. In Fig. 2, for random capacity, the probability of the profit being less than the target profit is indeed 20%.

                      under unlimited capacity, then the corresponding probability increases to 24.4% which means that the downside risk under unlimited capacity is increased. In order to decrease the downside risk, fewer items need to be ordered for unlimited capacity.

                      under unlimited capacity, then the corresponding probability decreases to 2.8%. This indicates that the downside risk under unlimited supply is decreased. In order to increase the downside risk, the order quantity under unlimited supply has to be enlarged.

Under the CVaR criterion, capacity uncertainty always leads to a smaller quantity as is stated in the following theorem.

Under the CVaR criterion, the optimal target profit ϕ is equal to (r
                     −
                     c)Q which is the maximal profit for an order quantity Q. Fig. 5 shows that, for unlimited capacity, the probability of the profit being less than ϕ is 1%. However, if the newsvendor still orders

                      when the capacity is uncertain, then the corresponding probability increases to 1.33%. This implies that the newsvendor is less likely to get the maximal profit with uncertain capacity. Therefore, in order to increase the probability of getting the maximal profit, the newsvendor should reduce the order quantity. In Fig. 6, the probability of the profit with random capacity being less than ϕ is indeed 1%. Figs. 5 and 6 also show the downside of a reduced order size is namely a reduction in the maximal profit, which is ignored by the CVaR criterion that focuses on the downside risk only. Therefore, the newsvendor orders less under capacity uncertainty.

As a coherent risk measure, although CVaR has better computational characteristics and has been widely used in the financial field, there exists a limitation when the CVaR criterion is applied to the newsvendor model. By (6), when c converges to s, the newsvendor should order the maximal demand since there is almost no risk of overstocking. However, under the CVaR criterion, the ordering quantity is only F
                     −1(η). The explanation for this result is that the CVaR criterion is too conservative for decision makers, because only the worst outcome is considered. To address this issue, most users in portfolio optimization/inventory problems are inherently interested in the trade-off between the risk and the expected profit. Xu and Li (2010) and Jammernegg and Kischka (2012) consider the newsvendor problem under the mean-CVaR criterion, i.e., the objective of the decision maker is to maximize a convex combination of the expected profit and CVaR, given by

                     ∈[0,1] represents the relative importance of the expected profit compared with the CVaR. For λ
                     =0, this criterion becomes CVaR while we have the risk-neutral newsvendor for λ
                     =1.

Under the mean-CVaR criterion, Xu and Li (2010) show that the optimal order quantity for the newsvendor with unlimited capacity

By Theorem 5, we show that the result in Theorem 3 for the CVaR criterion carries over to the more general mean-CVaR criterion. We warn readers that although the mean-CVaR criterion can address the tradeoff between risk and expected profit and is a coherent risk measure for computational efficiency, it may be difficult for managers to determine the appropriate value of λ. Since the optimal order quantity heavily depends on the choice of λ, an effective mechanism for the choice of λ should be developed in order to make the mean-CVaR criterion implementable in practice.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we study the effect of random capacity for the newsvendor problem. For the risk-neutral newsvendor, the order quantity is not affected by capacity uncertainty. However, this does not hold for a risk-averse newsvendor. The most interesting result is that under both the CVaR and the VaR constraint risk criteria, capacity uncertainty can lead to significantly lower order quantities, e.g., a 12.5% decrease is observed for η
                     =5% under the VaR criterion. Indeed, for CVaR, this is always the case. The insightful explanation for this result is that by shifting focus (completely for CVaR) from profit maximization to risk avoidance, buying fewer products is more attractive since it increases the probability of selling all those products and in that sense, achieving the maximal profit. However, an important disadvantage of this risk avoidance behavior is that the expected profit is reduced. The effect is less significant for the VaR constraint as it focuses on the expected profit as well as risk. In fact, under mild risk averseness, the added uncertainty does lead to higher order quantities. The flexibility of the VaR constraint in appropriately weighing risk vs. profit may be preferable to applying the more rigid CVaR approach in some situations. In any case, our results stress the importance of carefully selecting the (risk) objective criterion.

Since the newsvendor problem does not address the impact of inventory leftover or shortage on future order decisions, an interesting direction for further research is to consider the multi-period risk averse problem with random capacity. Moreover, this paper assumes that the demand is independent of the selling price. In practice, firms may use the price to control demand in order to match it with supply. Therefore, it may be worth studying joint pricing and inventory decisions with random capacity under different risk criteria.
