                  The asymmetry in the tail dependence between U.S. equity portfolios and the aggregate U.S. market is a well-established property. Given the limited number of observations in the tails of a joint distribution, standard non-parametric measures of tail dependence have poor finite-sample properties and generally reject the asymmetry in the tail dependence. A parametric model, based on a multivariate noncentral t distribution, is developed to measure and test asymmetry in tail dependence. This model allows different levels of tail dependence to be estimated depending on the distribution’s parameters and accommodates situations in which the volatilities or the correlations across returns are time varying. For most of the size, book-to-market, and momentum portfolios, the tail dependence with the market portfolio is significantly higher on the downside than on the upside.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Several recent papers have pointed out that the dependence across asset returns may be stronger in bearish markets than in bullish markets. Longin and Solnik (2001) investigate the asymmetry of the correlation across markets using the exceedance correlation, i.e., the correlation between realizations that are jointly above or below a given threshold. For international stock markets, they demonstrate that the correlation between large negative returns does not converge to zero, but instead, tends to increase with the threshold. At the same time, the correlation between large positive returns decreases to zero. Ang and Bekaert (2002) describe the joint behavior of market returns using a regime-switching model and provide empirical evidence that cross-market correlation is significantly higher over bearish markets than over bullish markets. Ang and Chen (2002) formally test the asymmetry in the dependence across stock returns using exceedance correlations. They demonstrate that the correlation between Fama–French portfolio returns and the market return is significantly larger when the market return is negative than when it is positive. They also show that this correlation asymmetry is greater for small firms, value firms, and past losers. Hong et al. (2007) also investigate the asymmetric dependence between portfolio returns and the market return. They find that this asymmetry matters for asset allocation for investors with disappointment-aversion preferences.

All of the above-mentioned papers provide empirical evidence that stock returns display asymmetric dependence in bearish and bullish markets. This evidence raises several interesting questions. First, it is not clear whether the asymmetric dependence reported in these papers really implies an asymmetric dependence in the tails of the distribution, as initially claimed by Longin and Solnik (2001). It may well be that dependence vanishes once one considers extreme realizations, as is typical with Gaussian-type distributions. Tail dependence is a key measure for risk management, which mainly focuses on the extreme events of joint distribution. The present paper contributes to this literature by investigating the tail dependence between the Fama–French portfolio returns and the market return. Specifically, we show that the tail dependence is indeed, very often asymmetric, i.e., joint extreme negative returns are more likely to occur than joint extreme positive returns.

Another question raised by the recent literature relies on the difficulty of finding an appropriate model for testing the asymmetry in the tail dependence. Ang and Chen (2002) find that none of the standard models that they investigate is able to generate the asymmetric pattern observed in the data. Hong et al. (2007) use an ad-hoc mixed copula model to reproduce the empirical asymmetry found in tail dependence. Most of the multivariate distributions used for modeling financial returns are unable to produce reliable estimates of the left-tail and right-tail dependence found in the actual joint distribution. For instance, the asymmetric 
                        t
                      distribution (Mencia and Sentana, 2009; Hu and Kercheval, 2010) implies full dependence on one side of the distribution and full independence on the other side. By contrast, the skewed 
                        t
                      distribution (Jondeau and Rockinger, 2009) captures the asymmetry in the exceedance correlations but does not generate asymmetric tail dependence. Similarly, most of the copulas considered in the empirical literature generate tail dependence for the extremes on one side of the distribution, but no dependence for the extremes on the other side (see, among others, Lee and Long, 2009). None of these models allows a free measure of the asymmetry in the tail dependence. Last, a few papers have investigated the asymmetry in tail dependence from a non-parametric standpoint, in the context of extreme value theory (Longin and Solnik, 2001; Poon et al., 2004). As it is illustrated below, one difficulty with this approach is that the non-parametric estimators typically have poor finite-sample properties.

This paper proposes a distribution that allows a different level of tail dependence for each side of the distribution so that one can directly test the asymmetry in the tail dependence. This distribution, namely the non-central 
                        t
                      distribution (NCT), was initially introduced by Kshirsagar (1961) in a different context. The aim of this paper, then, is to describe how to use the NCT distribution to model and test the asymmetry in the distribution’s tails in a conditional setup. The NCT distribution has a natural interpretation in terms of a normal mixture distribution. As a consequence, it shares their properties: in particular, it is closed under contemporaneous aggregation. Another important issue in a multivariate context is the fact that the tail dependence may be different from a pair of variables to another. In the copula literature, this issue has been recently addressed through vine copulas (Nikoloulopoulos et al., 2012) and hierarchical Archimedean copulas (Okhrin et al., 2013). Although the NCT also allows the tail dependence to be different from one pair to another, we do not focus on this property in this paper.

The approach developed in this paper is a parametric one. The objective is to provide a full description of the joint distribution of the time series. The key properties of the tails are then deduced from this distribution so that the test of symmetry in the tail dependence is based on the restrictions on the model’s parameters. It should also be noted that, given its analytical expression, the NCT distribution provides a quick estimation of both the model’s parameters and of the distribution’s quantiles.

We investigate the dependence between size, book-to-market, and momentum portfolios and the market index, following Ang and Chen (2002) and Hong et al. (2007). The NCT provides a good description of the data and is able to reproduce fairly well the observed asymmetric tail dependence, provided that returns are filtered for AR and GARCH effects. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section  2 describes the data and provides empirical evidence of asymmetry in the tail dependence using non-parametric statistics. Section  3 describes the NCT and its main properties and discusses the estimation procedure used in the paper. Section  4 describes estimates of the model and demonstrates that the NCT provides a good fit of the data, including the ability to reproduce the asymmetry in the tail dependence. Section  5 concludes.

As in most of the papers discussed in the introduction, the analysis is based on the US equity market. Ang and Chen (2002) and Hong et al. (2007) already considered several Fama–French portfolios, which were sorted based on size, book-to-market ratio, momentum, or industry. From these studies, it is known that the relation between size or momentum portfolios and the market index is highly asymmetric but less so for the book-to-market sort. In the following, we consider size, book-to-market, and momentum portfolios. For size portfolios, all common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ of companies incorporated in the US are sorted by market capitalization. Then, five quintile portfolios are constructed and the daily return of a given portfolio is computed as the value-weighted average of the daily simple returns of the constituting stocks. For book-to-market portfolios, all common stocks are sorted by book equity to market equity ratio. The five quintile portfolios are constructed and the daily return is computed in the same way. For momentum portfolios, all common stocks are sorted by cumulative returns from 12 to 2 months prior to portfolio formation. Ten decile portfolios are then constructed. Quintile portfolios are constructed by taking the average of pairs of decile portfolios (1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and 9–10). The data are available from French’s webpage: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/. The data cover the period from July 1963 to July 2014 at a daily frequency (

                        Table 1
                         provides the summary statistics on market and portfolio returns. As the table indicates, non-normality is a major feature of the portfolio returns at hand: the asymmetry of the univariate distribution is pronounced for all series. The skewness ranges from −0.65 to −0.48 for size portfolios, from −0.71 to −0.27 for book-to-market portfolios, and from −0.67 to 0.29 for momentum portfolios. The thickness of the distribution’s tail, measured by the kurtosis, also illustrates that the return’s distribution is far from normality. The issue of the existence of these higher moments will be discussed in the next section, devoted to the univariate tails.

Turning to the dependence relation between portfolios and the market, the table reveals that there exist some non-linear dependencies: the co-skewness

                         is large, suggesting that the volatilities of both processes are also strongly correlated. These features hold for all of the portfolios.

Another important feature of all of the portfolio returns is temporal dependency. We observe a sizable serial correlation in the returns and an even more pronounced serial correlation in the squared returns. This evidence suggests that an appropriate modeling of the time dependency is required as a preliminary step before investigating the distribution properties of portfolio returns. It is known that the existence of time-varying volatility could affect the tail behavior and the dependence structure between the processes under consideration (Loretan and English, 2000) To capture the time dependence in portfolio returns, the univariate dynamics is described as follows:

                           p
                        )-GARCH(1,1) filter are reported in Table 2
                        . A maximum of four lags is sufficient to remove the serial correlation found in the portfolio returns. The conditional volatility is found to be highly persistent and asymmetric, in particular, for small firms, value firms, and past winners.

                         indicate that this filter is sufficient to remove the serial first-order and second-order dependence found in almost all of the portfolio returns. Yet, the estimated skewness and kurtosis of the filtered returns are still significantly different from the values implied by a normal distribution, although the kurtosis is found to be much smaller than in the case of unfiltered returns (between 4.8 and 5.9).

With regard to the univariate tail properties, one statistic of particular interest is the tail index, which measures the thickness of the distribution’s tails. A widely-used estimator is the estimator proposed by Hill (1975). If

                           ξ
                         is adjusted for the temporal dependence. Hill (2010) shows that asymptotic normality holds in very general cases, such as GARCH, FIGARCH, or nonlinear GARCH processes. He also describes a consistent non-parametric estimator for the asymptotic variance. As returns are not i.i.d., we use this estimator in the sequel. If a time series has a distribution with tail index 
                           ξ
                           >

                           k
                        -th moment of this series exists. In addition, the tails of the distribution decay essentially like a power function, with rate of decay

                         and between 0.28 and 0.43 for

                           129
                        , which corresponds to considering 1% of the sample in the left and right tails. These values suggest that, for all portfolios, the kurtosis does not exist and that in some cases even the skewness is not well defined. A possible explanation for this result is that the properties of the unconditional distribution of returns are in fact affected by the time dependency of the return process. For this reason, we will not consider the estimation of the NCT for unfiltered returns.

Turning to the tail analysis of AR-GARCH-filtered returns,

                        , Panel B indicates that the tail index now ranges between 0.22 and 0.24 for

                                    (
                                    −
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         and between 0.19 and 0.23 for 
                           
                              
                                 ξ

                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Consequently, in all cases, the skewness does exist, and in most cases, the kurtosis is also well-defined. In addition, once heteroskedasticity is taken into account, the left-tail index is systematically higher than the right-tail index for most portfolios, indicating that negative extremes are more likely to occur than positive extremes of similar magnitude. Such an asymmetry has already been reported for a large set of financial markets (Jondeau and Rockinger, 2003).

We now consider the tail dependence between a given portfolio return and the market return. Pairs of returns are defined as

Several statistics have been proposed to measure the strength of the link between two time series when large realizations occur. A widely used measure is the aforementioned exceedance correlation (Longin and Solnik, 2001). Here, we define the left exceedance correlation between two random variables (

                        . Ang and Chen (2002) propose a related test for correlation symmetry, which tests whether the empirical exceedance correlation can be explained by a given model. The test of Hong et al. (2007) allows for answering the question of whether the exceedance correlations are symmetric. Dobrić et al. (2013) propose a similar test under weaker conditions on the serial dependence of the return process. An important drawback of the exceedance correlation is that it is affected by changes in the marginal distributions (Loretan and English, 2000; Longin and Solnik, 2001).

Another measure of tail dependence, which is not affected by a change in the marginal distributions, is the tail dependence coefficient (TDC). The left TDC is defined as the probability that

On average, the difference between the left and right exceedance correlations is 0.11 for size portfolios, 0.08 for book-to-market portfolios, and 0.09 for momentum portfolios. The difference is particularly large for small firms (0.82 versus 0.55), for value firms (0.89 versus 0.76) and for past winners (0.88 versus 0.68).

                           λ
                         can be interpreted as an indicator of dependence in the extremes, which measures the probability of a co-crash conditionally on a market crash. The ranking of 
                           λ
                         is essentially the same as the ranking of the exceedance correlations, with

                        . The difference is again larger for small firms and value firms, although it is not always significant. The bottom part of Fig. 1 displays systematic differences between the left and right TDCs, although these differences are less pronounced than those for the exceedance correlations.

We now turn to AR-GARCH-filtered returns. As Table 5
                         shows, the exceedance correlation is, in general, much smaller for filtered returns than for raw returns. In addition, the difference between the left and right exceedance correlations is much more pronounced, with an average of 0.18 over all of the portfolios. This evidence is confirmed by Fig. 2
                        . The equality of the left and right exceedance correlations is rejected for the first three size portfolios, the three largest book-to-market portfolios, and three out of four momentum portfolios. These results clearly confirm that filtering for AR-GARCH effects is necessary to obtain unbiased estimates of exceedance correlation.

The table also shows that the TDC is significantly larger than zero on both sides of the distribution. In addition, the difference between the left and right TDCs is above 0.1 for the first four size portfolios, the three largest book-to-market portfolios, and the lowest and largest momentum portfolios. This finding indicates that large negative and large positive extreme are tail dependent but possibly at different levels. This evidence is not consistent with many copula models (such as the Clayton or the Gumbel copulas), which generate tail independence on one side of the distribution only. It should be mentioned that the difference

                         is significant in only two cases, presumably due to the fact that these non-parametric measures are estimated using a small number of realizations (approximately 80 observations on average for 
                           u

                        ), and therefore have large asymptotic standard errors. In Section  4, the use of a parametric model will allow us to obtain more accurate measures of tail dependence.

The previous section illustrates that the joint distribution of the market return and several portfolio returns exhibits asymmetric tail dependence. As described by Ang and Chen (2002), most of the commonly used distributions cannot generate this property. This section describes how to capture this feature.

In a multivariate setup, several extensions to the normal distribution have been proposed to generate asymmetry and fat tails. A particularly fruitful area of research has built on the so-called normal variance mixture model. For a survey of these distributions, see McNeil et al. (2005). A

                         is a generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) variable.

The normal variance mixture model imposes symmetry to the joint distribution so that it cannot generate asymmetric dependence between the processes. A natural asymmetric extension is the normal mean–variance mixture model (NMVM), in which both the mean and variance are conditioned by the mixing variable

                         is a measurable function. This class of models has interesting properties. First, NMVM models allow for asymmetry and fat tails in the marginal distributions as well as a non-linear and asymmetric dependence structure between the processes. They also generate tail dependence because a large realization of

                         implies that all of the elements of

                         take simultaneously large values. Second, NMVM models are closed under (temporal and contemporaneous) aggregation: a portfolio composed of NMVM series has itself an NMVM distribution.

More recently, Mencia and Sentana (2009) analyzed the properties of this distribution, and its adequacy for multivariate financial time series. By further restricting the GIG distribution, one can generate the normal inverse Gaussian (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1995) or the Variance Gamma distributions (Madan and Seneta, 1990).

                         the degree of freedom (Mencia and Sentana, 2009). This last distribution has been advocated by Aas and Haff (2006), Hu (2005), and Hu and Kercheval (2010) in a univariate framework and by McNeil et al. (2005) and Mencia and Sentana (2009) in a multivariate setup because it typically provides superior estimates. However, Banachewicz and van der Vaart (2008) have recently demonstrated that the GH asymmetric 
                           t
                         distribution generates an extreme behavior in the tails: in the presence of asymmetry, the series are either fully tail-dependent or fully tail-independent. Therefore, the TDC goes to zero on one side of the distribution while converging to one on the other side. As it is illustrated in Table 5, the property is clearly at odds with the empirical evidence found on financial returns. The reason is that the inverse gamma in the first term of Eq. (5) completely dominates the second term when it takes very large values. This extreme result is also illustrated in Mencia and Sentana (2009, Fig. 2). This undesirable property is shared by the other GH asymmetric distributions, which have the same “linear-in-the-variance” mean specification.

For this reason, we investigate an alternative family that also belongs to the NMVM models but that allows for less extreme tail dependence. In this family, the mean function is defined as

                         is distributed as an inverse gamma, the resulting process has a known distribution, called the non-central 
                           t
                         (NCT) distribution. The NCT has been initially described by Kshirsagar (1961) in a different context. For a statistical description of the multivariate NCT, see Kotz and Nadarahjah (2004, Chapter 5).

The main advantages of the NCT distribution are the following. (1) It is more flexible than the GH asymmetric 
                           t
                         distribution to fit the observed tail dependence. (2) It can be estimated by a direct ML technique, so that it is much faster to estimate than most GH distributions. In general, direct ML estimation is not recommended for GH distributions, given the highly non-linear expression for the unconditional distribution. The Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm has been proposed by Protassov (2004) to overcome this difficulty. However, the estimation of this model is still time-consuming for large dimensions. Mencia and Sentana (2009) describe an ML estimator for multivariate GH distributions in a conditional setup. (3) It shares the aggregation properties of the NMVM models; in particular, it is closed under (temporal and contemporaneous) aggregation.

This section briefly describes the multivariate NCT distribution and provides some new results about this distribution.

This property is important for portfolio construction, as demonstrated in Mencia and Sentana (2009) and Hu and Kercheval (2010) in the context of the GH asymmetric 
                           t
                         distribution. It implies that all of the portfolio return characteristics are directly deduced from those of the components. It should be noticed that the previous proposition does not apply in the presence of GARCH effects because GARCH models are not closed under aggregation. Section  3.4 describes how to obtain the conditional distribution of the portfolio return in the context of a multivariate GARCH model.

An important issue is whether a given distribution is able to reproduce the asymmetric tail dependence found in actual data. For this purpose, we now compare the TDC implied by the standard 
                           t
                        , the GH asymmetric 
                           t
                        , and the NCT distributions. For these three distributions, analytical expressions of the TDC are available. For a bivariate 
                           t
                         distribution with degree of freedom

                         distribution, Banachewicz and van der Vaart (2008) have shown that it results in extreme behavior of the distribution’s tails. For convenience, their theorem is reported below.

When the series are asymmetric, there is full right-tail dependence and left-tail independence if both asymmetry parameters are positive, or full left-tail dependence and right-tail independence if both asymmetry parameters are negative. When one series is positively skewed and the other is negatively skewed, then there is full (both left and right) tail independence.

This result reflects that the tail dependence generated by the asymmetric

                         distribution is too extreme to fit most actual data. As the following theorem shows, the NCT provides much more flexibility.

As already mentioned, the estimation of the NCT can be performed by direct likelihood maximization. The (non-standardized) NCT distribution has been defined in Section  3.2, for a given mean and covariance matrix. As suggested by empirical evidence, we consider a conditional model, in which the expected returns and the covariance matrix are time-varying and the innovations are drawn from a (standardized) NCT distribution. In the next section, the NCT distribution will be used to describe the AR-GARCH-filtered innovation

This specification raises several issues, as highlighted by Mencia and Sentana (2009). In particular, the log-likelihood function depends on the decomposition used to construct the “square root” matrix

We adopt an alternative specification and separate the modeling of the conditional variances from the modeling of the dependence structure in a two-stage approach: on the one hand, the dynamics of the variances is modeled through univariate GARCH processes; on the other hand, the dependence structure is captured through the distribution of the innovation

                        . In particular, the dynamics of the correlations is modeled through the covariance matrix

                        , whose off-diagonal elements are now allowed to vary over time. The multivariate model is thus defined as follows:

                           ζ
                        ) yields the ML estimator. From a technical point of view, it should be mentioned that the estimate of the infinite sum in the NCT pdf (Eq. (7)) converges quickly to 0 as 
                           k
                         increases. In all of our experiments, the sum converged with a precision of 10e−10 with less than 50 terms, which is why the estimation of the model is fast. 
                           Remark 1
                           As is well known (Nijman and Sentana, 1996), (strong) GARCH models are not closed under contemporaneous aggregation. Consequently, the unconditional distribution of the aggregate return is not known. It is, however, possible to define the conditional distribution of the portfolio return process at a given date

                           Once the model is estimated, it is easy to test hypotheses about tail dependence. Indeed, the TDC is related to the model’s parameters (through Eqs. (9) and (10)), so that Wald-type tests are easy to implement. For instance, the null hypothesis of the equality of the left and right TDCs can be tested by defining

In this section, we apply the above-mentioned methodology to the size, book-to-market, and momentum portfolios discussed in Section  2. Unreported results (available in Technical Appendix 3) indicate that the NCT for unfiltered returns does not fit the actual data. However, the estimates reported below show that the NCT is able to capture the asymmetric tail dependence found in actual data, provided that returns are filtered for first-order and second-order time dependence.

We now consider the estimation of the conditional model (12)–(15) in which returns are filtered for AR and GARCH effects. The parameter estimates and summary statistics of this model are reported in Table 6.  The parameter estimates are in line with the empirical evidence reported in Section  2. The degree of freedom is between 6 and 7.7, reflecting fat-tailed processes but with well-defined kurtosis. Another interesting result is that the magnitude of the asymmetry parameters is rather large. It ranges between −0.29 and −0.13 for the market return, depending on the pair considered. Size portfolios have large negative asymmetric parameters, with a value of 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         close to −0.4 for the first three portfolios. Book-to-market portfolios have rather homogeneous values of 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        , close to −0.15. Momentum portfolios display more heterogeneity, as the asymmetry parameter increases from −0.02 for past losers to −0.31 for past winners.

The table also reports goodness-of-fit test statistics based on hit regressions described in Section  3.4. The statistics reveal that, for size portfolios, the regions of interest in the unit square are well described by the model. However, for 7 out of the other 10 portfolios, the model does not pass the test at the 5% significance level.

Finally, the estimated TDCs, implied by the parameter estimates, are often close to the sample TDCs. In some cases, both values are barely distinguishable. However, when the difference between the sample values of

                                    −
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 λ

                         is large, the model is unable to reproduce such a large difference. This is typically the case for small firms, values firms, past losers, and past winners. In 7 of the 15 portfolios, the left and right TDCs implied by the NCT are significantly different from each other.

The second model corresponds to the case where the correlation takes different levels depending on the market conditions. These correlation levels are denoted by

                         when the market return is below its 5% quantile, by 
                           
                              
                                 ρ

                         when the market return is above its 95% quantile, and by 
                           
                              
                                 ρ

                         otherwise.

As Table 7
                         reveals, the estimates of the asymmetry parameter and degree of freedom are close to those reported in Table 6 with constant correlation. Regarding correlation estimates, we observe some large differences between the left and right correlations. For instance, the estimates for the smallest firms are 
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.865
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.786
                        , with a highly significant difference. This result implies a large improvement in the log-likelihood of the model. The LR test statistic is equal to 40, with a 
                           p
                        -value below 0.1%, for the test of the null hypothesis that the correlation is constant over time. More importantly, the time variability in the correlation gives some freedom for the estimation of the TDC and allows us to obtain estimated values that are in line with the sample values. We observe a similar improvement for the past losers and, to a lesser extent, for the value firms. For these portfolios, the LR test statistic has a 
                           p
                        -value below 0.1%, indicating that the model with constant correlation is rejected.

The Hit test statistics indicate that the null that the model is correctly specified cannot be rejected for all pairs but three at the 5% significance level. In addition, a comparison of the sample and estimated TDCs clearly shows that the two measures are now very close to each other. These results confirm that the model with different levels of correlation is able to reproduce the asymmetry in the tail dependence observed in the actual data, while at the same time providing a good fit of the data.

As we have obtained a correct specification of the parametric model, we can now discuss the test of symmetry of the TDC. The table reports the 
                           t
                        -stat of the difference

                         is as high as 0.18 for small firms, 0.10 for value firms, 0.11 for past losers, and 0.07 for past winners. The null hypothesis of equality of the left and right TDCs is rejected for 14 out of the 15 portfolios under consideration. The rejection is particularly strong for all the size portfolios, for all the book-to-market portfolios, and for past losers and past winners. This evidence clearly demonstrates that asymmetric tail dependence is an empirical feature shared by most of portfolio returns and, consequently, that it is worthwhile having a parametric model to capture this property.

Our results provide an interesting interpretation of the debate about the difference between left and right correlations obtained in actual portfolio returns. On the one hand, several authors have argued that the correlation between the market and portfolio returns is, indeed, different on the left and right sides of the distribution (Ang and Chen, 2002). On the other hand, the finding that the left and right correlations are different may in fact come from the asymmetry in the joint distribution (Loretan and English, 2000). Our evidence suggests that both the negative asymmetry in the joint distribution and the difference in the correlation levels during crashes and booms are required to generate a large asymmetry in the distribution’s tail dependence. Asymmetry in the distribution is indeed the main driver of the asymmetry between left and right correlations, but it is not sufficient to fully explain the difference. Adding some difference between the conditional tails, depending on market conditions, allows us to capture some amount of the difference between left and right tails.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it extends the recent research on asymmetry in correlations by Longin and Solnik (2001), Ang and Chen (2002), and Hong et al. (2007). These authors have shown that international markets and Fama–French portfolios are more correlated in a bearish market than in a bullish market. This paper investigates the possibility of asymmetry in the dependence between extreme realizations. Using standard non-parametric measures of tail dependence, we find that for most portfolio returns, the tail dependence is stronger in the left tail than in the right tail of the distribution. In most cases, however, the difference is economically sizable, yet statistically insignificant. This result is presumably due to the poor finite-sample properties of the usual non-parametric measures, which are based on a small number of realizations.

The second contribution of the paper is to describe the NCT distribution that allows us to capture the reported asymmetry in tail dependence. From this perspective, it is more effective than alternative distributions, such as the GH asymmetric distributions, which result in overly extreme levels of tail dependence. We also describe how to compute the TDC for the NCT distribution and present the main drivers of this measure. Finally, empirical evidence suggests that the NCT distribution is able to correctly reproduce the joint behavior of the market return and portfolio return, provided that returns are filtered for AR and GARCH effects. To fully reproduce the asymmetry in tail dependence, we also need to allow the correlation to vary over time. Once different levels of correlation are introduced for large negative and large positive shocks, the fit of the left and right TDCs is almost perfect.

The results reported in this paper have important implications from an asset and risk management perspective. On the one hand, an investor who worries about the possibility of extreme realizations in her portfolio may introduce some concerns about extremes in her allocation criterion or in the portfolio weight constraints (such as Value-at-Risk constraints). In such a case, having a good description of the behavior of the asset returns in the distribution’s tails is of primary interest. On the other hand, this approach provides consistent and fast estimates of some tail measures involving the joint distribution. For instance, the expected shortfall of an asset return, conditional on some realization of the market return, can be computed by integrating the joint density. This measure of conditional (or marginal) expected shortfall is the key tool of the systemic risk measure described by Acharya et al. (2010) and Brownlees and Engle (2010).
