                  The use of location-aware services to deliver short message advertisements requires an in-depth review of the literature in general and the applicable domains and needs and wants of both marketers and consumers in particular. This paper presents a location-aware service application that develops a recommendation system (RS) for mobile short message advertising (LARSMA). The LARSMA prototype is developed through two stages: system parameter consultation and system development. System parameter consultation involves the collection of advertising categories and their attributes from storeowners and current interests and preferences from mobile phone users. Using a pull-oriented advertising model, system development involves the creation of the LARSMA prototype system, which allows storeowners to create and directly send short messages and mobile phone users within the defined area to automatically retrieve short messages that depend on their inputs. The implicit content-based recommendation mechanism embedded in the designed LARSMA performs filtering and comparison to derive the final top N formatted advertising messages as outputs of LARSMA. An application case is used to demonstrate the proposed LARSMA system prototype. Validation and evaluation are conducted, and feedbacks are addressed.
               
            

Location-aware services (LAS) or location-based services (LBS) integrate the technologies of geographical information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), multi-function mobile devices, and Internet network services (Gavalas, Konstantopoulos, Mastakas, & Pantziou, 2014; Junglas & Watson, 2008; Li & Du, 2012; Raper, Gartner, Karimi, & Rizos, 2007; Wu, Kao, & Yang, 2012; Zhou, 2011). LAS development and applications consider not only location-driven but also time- and preferences-driven services, covering a wide spectrum from marketing (e.g., delivery of advertising messages), monitoring (e.g., tracing logistic trucks), to searching (e.g., finding the nearest hospitals). Four tasks are generally required to model the LAS: context modeling and adaptation, location modeling, user modeling, and geospatial data modeling and processing (Junglas & Watson, 2008). Context modeling and adaptation address the information flow of the defined context (e.g., marketing within a time zone), which can be applied to characterize the situation of an entity for relevant communication (e.g., a person or an object). Location modeling specifies the context of the location (e.g., one-mile radius zone), which determines the information or services suitable to be delivered. User modeling develops a wide range of user properties (or preferences) for further attempts, such as the current state of users, information searching behavior, and online merchandising profile. Geospatial data modeling and processing manage and process geospatial information, which may be concisely delivered to users.

A review of the literature indicates that advanced LAS and context-aware applications have increasingly attracted the attention of companies that aim to engage in business and develop their Internet communication channels for consumers (e.g., Li & Du, 2012; Sukaphat, 2011; Tussyadiah, 2012; Wilson, 2012). For example, Tussyadiah (2012) conducted an exploratory study that reports the increasing use of location-based social network marketing in the context of tourism and hospitality businesses. Li and Du (2012) demonstrated a targeted mobile advertising system that serves as platform for both merchants and consumers with context-aware advertisements. These findings imply that LAS with immediate information service flow has been extensively used to narrow the marketing gap between marketers and consumers. For example, one of the findings of Wei, Xiaoming, and Pan (2010) in examining the intentions of users in mobile advertising is that short message service (SMS) advertisements can be highly effective in encouraging purchases in the context of marketing services. “Immediate action” is particularly the common aspect that marketers focus on to improve service quality (e.g., responsiveness). The statement “I am going to tell my consumers some good news right now” expresses the common desire of storeowners to market instantly. Correspondingly, the statement “Is there anything suitable for me to buy around here now” expresses the common desire of consumers to acquire a particular product or service.

Mobile marketing is generally highly customer-centered, message-straightforward, and privacy-sensitive (Abbas, Michael, Michael, & Nicholls, 2013; Raper et al., 2007; Wilson, 2012; Xu, Luo, Carroll, & Rosson, 2011). One of the main dilemmas in using LAS is location privacy, which may cause a considerable barrier to its adoption by users (e.g., Pingley, Yu, Zhang, Fu, & Zhao, 2012; Xu et al., 2011; Zhou, 2011; Chen & Hsieh, 2012; Abbas et al., 2013). However, Xu et al. (2011) reported that personalization somehow overrides privacy concerns for both covert- and overt-based location-aware marketing. One of the research findings of Zhu, Chang, Luo, and Li (2014) is that perceived control is significantly associated with the use intention of location-based recommendation systems (RS). Therefore, allowing consumers to dynamically define their needs and wants as they accept incoming information services may possibly overcome the disadvantage of the privacy barrier. An example is the following situation involving a marketer (or owner) and consumers. The marketer of a store picks up his cell phone, launches a location-based advertising service marketing system, types in the text “Buy anything and get any different thing for free. Come to the cheapest store xxx from 1:00pm to 4:00pm at address xxx. Come now!” The marketer then simply clicks OK to complete the advertising task, and the message is sent directly to the advertising message pool. Meanwhile, mobile phone users launch the location-based advertising message service system at any time, select “on” to accept incoming messages, and wait for recommended outcomes. Their location and time are detected, and as they move across a defined area within an identified time zone, they receive messages that match their interests and preferences. They can switch “off” these services to disconnect at any time.

However, the review of literature indicates that mobile marketing, particularly the location-aware service, has not been developing a common understanding and regulations that mobile service providers can rely on to appropriately model both advertising behavior of storeowner and consumption behavior of consumer. The current research therefore develops the research questions that in the context of location-aware short message service what are the expectations and concerns of both storeowners and consumers? what if different, how to balance, and what the consequences are? It conducts a consultation of both storeowners and consumers to help system design and introduces a location-aware RS for mobile SMS called LARSMA. Several tasks are considered in the design and development of LARSMA: (1) consultation of expectations and concerns of both storeowners and mobile phone users, (2) system framework, (3) system input, (4) service mechanism, (5) output, (6) system test and validation, and (7) system evaluation. The system framework identifies the entities and their interrelationships. Based on the survey of both storeowners and mobile phone users using the system inputs as parameters, the system allows storeowners and/or advertisers to indicate marketing preferences and mobile phone users to indicate advertisement preferences. The effect of privacy risk on the willingness of mobile phone users to use LARSMA is considered during the data collection and analysis. The service mechanism processes and then receives inputs (e.g., location and time) to produce the outputs that define the contents delivered to users. System test and validation ensure that the prototype system is functional and that the outputs are correct. The system evaluation conducts an evaluation survey involving the mobile phone users, storeowners, and software development specialists and then provides a summarized report. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the related concepts. Section 3 presents the method and describes the design procedure and LARSMA framework, including the interface, data tables, and system mechanism. Section 4 presents the testing and evaluation of LARSMA. Section 5 provides the discussion and implications of the study. Section 6 concludes the research and addresses possible directions for future research.

The main purpose of LAS is to allow content providers to deliver appropriate and relevant services to consumers at the right time (Gavalas et al., 2014; Tussyadiah, 2012; Wilson, 2012). These services are tagging, tracking, navigating, and mobile commerce (Ström, Vendel, & Bredican, 2014; Wilson, 2012). Based on the location, the tagging service provides information relevant to the targeted area, such as weather forecasting. The tracking service delivers information on the position of subjects or objects vis-à-vis the users or organizations that need it, such as roadside assistance, offender tracking, personal safety, tracker for family and friends, staff management, and vehicle tracking. The navigating service provides users with directions from one place to a target destination, such as route guiding and road finding. Mobile commerce service is used in various domains, such as the delivery of advertising messages from marketers to target consumers, mobile transactions, partition billing, and specific locations or events for billing (Tussyadiah, 2012; Wilson, 2012; Wu et al., 2012). The ultimate purpose of LAS in the mobile commerce service is to facilitate location- and situation-based service flows, which ultimately benefits both marketers and consumers.

Aside from location, situation is used to explain the conditions related to a subject (e.g., a Facebook user), object (e.g., a building), or relationship (e.g., a Facebook friend). de Carolis, Mazzotta, Novielli, and Silvestri (2009) described two major types of situations. The first type includes situations related to user(s), such as persons surrounding the user(s) and their relationships and preferences. The second type includes the environment of the moving subject, such as space, date and time, weather, temperature, noise and lighting, and any useful resource. A situation-aware system is developed, which can analyze people, time, location, object, and their relations to the delivery of services. To date, situation-aware applications include food, entertainment, music, shopping, and traveling. The following are the purposes of these applications: (1) to provide users with information or services, (2) to automatically implement services that users need, and (3) to mark information regarding a situation on the original data for further use (e.g., searching preferred shops). However, to effectively enable these applications, recommendation mechanisms (RMs) embedded in situation-aware systems are necessary to derive information services suitable to the users’ needs and wants (Gavalas et al., 2014).

A survey of the cited literature reveals two major approaches to the development of an RM: explicit and implicit (Wei et al., 2010). The former primarily asks users to indicate certain conditions in a questionnaire as the basis for subsequent recommendations, such as a user’s personal information and product and restaurant categories of interest. A salient way to do this is to allow users to participate in the scoring survey for potential recommended services. Based on the collected actual behavioral data, the information is analyzed instantly, and possible attractions are identified as the next recommended outcomes. For example, based on the preferred types of restaurants and sightseeing spots provided by a user and his or her current location, an implicit RM can recommend related restaurants and attractions by analyzing accessible advertising messages. To address the concern of user involvement, Gavalas et al. (2014) reviewed the literature, proposed a classification of RMs in the domain of mobile tourism, and provided insights on the services they offer. However, barriers that may influence the use of RM include the parameters used, inefficient extraction of the outcomes, personalization of needs and wants, and privacy risk, particularly when the mobile LAS model is considered.

Push- and pull-based approaches are regarded as the typical approaches in using LAS in mobile advertising (Unni & Harmon, 2007; Xu, Teo, Tan, & Agarwal, 2009). The push-based approach actively delivers messages, which include text, multi-media, and a combination of both, to users without their permission. By contrast, based on the users’ consent and by actively asking to allow a link to a website, the pull-based approach adopts the approach of permissive marketing, which effectively conveys advertising messages to users through an interactive process to further understand the user’s habits and preferences (Barutçu, 2007). These two types of approaches These two types of approaches are applied in three models: the permission-based advertising model (PBAM), incentive-based advertising model (IBAM), and location-based advertising model (LBAM) (Wilson, 2012). PBAM is based on the pull strategy and enables advertisers to send specific messages about goods, services, or contents to eager users (Barwise & Strong, 2002). PBAM is used to reduce unexpected advertising interference, find potential consumers, and therefore achieve specific marketing purposes. Aside from the conditions of PBAM, IBAM sends special messages, such as information on discounts, bonuses, gifts, and vouchers to increase the eagerness of users to purchase. Based on the users’ location information, LBAM combines both pull and push strategies to send consumers advertising messages related to their location, such as travel discounts, on-sale goods, and local activities (Bamba & Bames, 2007; Tussyadiah, 2012; Wilson, 2012; Wu, Huang, & Peng, 2013; Wu et al., 2012). LBAM utilizes location positioning technology to send advertising messages related to specific areas and is one of the applications of location-aware mobile advertising services with permission-and-pull orientation and positioning, personalization, and real-time characteristics.

Upon the users’ acceptance, the pull-oriented LBAM actively seeks services according to the consumers’ preferences and interests or provides different types of service messages according to their locations. The pull-based LBAM is regarded as a permission-based LBAM. By contrast, the push-oriented LBAM has two options. One is opt-in, which sends advertising messages only after obtaining the users’ permission; the other is opt-out, which directly sends messages without permission until the users refuse the receipt of the messages (Bruner & Kumar, 2007; Unni & Harmon, 2007). Based on one of their experimental findings, Unni and Harmon (2007) reported that consumers prefer the pull-oriented LBAM because of their concern on intrusiveness. In connection with this concern, Kwon, Choi, and Kim (2007) also suggested that psychological and ethical issues related to privacy and trust are important in examining the consumer acceptance of GPS systems. Moreover, Watson, McCarthy, and Rowley (2013) reported that the users’ acceptance can be significantly enhanced by a permission-based mechanism in the mobile marketing communications. On the one hand, privacy can be viewed as a security aspect, which implies that trade-offs among group interests are necessary. On the other hand, Xu et al. (2011) reported that personalization can somehow dominate privacy concerns. Ho (2012) also reported that the effect of personalization (e.g., intrinsic motivations) in the context of the location of individuals’ intention to use mobile services is significant. In their investigation of the factors that affect the use intention of social networking communities, Tan, Qin, Kim, and Hsu (2012) reported that, although privacy concern does not directly affect users’ acceptance, it moderates the usefulness toward users’ acceptance. To balance the personalization concerns and privacy drawback, the LARSMA developed in this study provides mobile phone users the options to switch on to accept or switch off to reject the messages at any time. Pull-oriented services are preset by the users’ preferences and/or by the query they forward.

Consumers usually consider present situations (e.g., location, time, and instant likes) while proceeding with the next move, such as making actual purchase decisions. An RM generally consists of four main steps: collection, analysis, recommendation, and feedback (Billsus, Brunk, Evans, Gladish, & Pazzani, 2002; Schilke, Bleimann, Furnell, & Phippen, 2004). Collection involves gathering both users’ details (e.g., defined preferences) and actual behavioral historical data (e.g., accessed information service). Analysis involves the utilization of a pre-defined mechanism to compute the collected data. Recommendation involves the users’ utilization the analyzed results according to the designed mechanism, which determines whether or not the outputs match the pre-defined conditions. Feedback involves the solicitation of the likes or dislikes of users for the recommended options to update the historical data by popularity. To address the concept of RM, Herlocker, Konstan, Terveen, and Riedl (2004) indicated that an RS should focus not only on experienced data but also on current conditions to derive results from a task-focused decision. In support of this, Bose and Chen (2009) reported that, in addition to target locations, understanding the preferences of consumers is the key to the success of situation-aware applications in the mobile marketing environment. The literature has demonstrated various situational parameters (or factors) used to identify consumers’ preferences for particular purposes (e.g., Gavalas et al., 2014). These parameters are location, season, distance, weather, time, age, and gender. The number of situational parameters significantly affects the accuracy of returned recommended outcomes, and those who accept less parameters that partially match their preferences may be misled, particularly when efficiency is an issue. In their survey report, Wu et al. (2013) suggested that allowing consumers to select the parameters while the SMS is being delivered can be achieved by developing an LAS system. However, a trade-off issue occurs in the determination of parameters.

For the mechanism used to derive the recommended service information for users, the literature indicates three main filters: content-based (e.g., Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2005; Choi, Yoo, Kim, & Suh, 2012), collaborative (e.g., Kim, Ji, Ha, & Jo, 2010; Lee, Cho, & Kim, 2010), and blended filters (e.g., Liu, Lai, & Lee, 2009; Wei, Yang, & Hsiao, 2008). The content-based filter considers the degree of similarity between recommended options and interests, whereas the collaborative filter considers the degree of association between recommended and users’ opinions. The blended filter considers these two types of filter to derive results. Choi et al. (2012) summarized the pros and cons of their basic use, precisely introduced and confirmed a better hybrid online-product RS, and recalled by considering the use of implicit rating. However, the processing time required to derive the recommended outcomes was not examined or at least accepted by the users, particularly when the datasets are larger, which may limit their use from a practical perspective.

Although the studies depicted in the literature present important aspects in general and mechanisms that can be used to recommend precise information in particular, these studies give only limited attention to the features of mobile information delivery service. Mobile SMS has its own characteristics, such as being dynamic, user-centered, instant, and history-independent (Wei et al., 2010), particularly when location and time are involved. For example, the outputs of content-based RM may simply be categories (e.g., food and clothes) with short messages that match the users’ current location, time, and likes, which may not be related to their past purchase details. In support of this concept, Ortega, Bobadilla, Hernando, and Gutiérrez (2013) reported that, although attempts have been made to aggregate available data to develop a better RM, system accuracy does not significantly vary according to the stage in which aggregation is performed. This is possibly because of the dynamic mobile needs of users, such as time, location, or instant emotion. Therefore, balancing the consumers’ preference, consuming behavior, accuracy of information delivered, privacy, and SMS characteristics by considering the needs and wants of storeowners, mobile advertisers, and mobile phone users is an important issue when RM-embedded LAS is designed and developed.

The current study considers two types of contents: category and use contents. Category contents contain attributes that are from both/either the defined objectives and/or experts or category providers. For example, a restaurant can be classified under the food category, while its name, phone number, price level, star rating, type, and features are its attributes. With user characteristics, use contents reflect the users’ simple profiles, which contain their interests and preferences relative to their behavior (e.g., contacts, purchase, and evaluation). To implement similarity computation, a comparison is conducted between a user’s profile and category contents. Content-based RM is a dynamic system that considers mainly the updated use contents. However, a disadvantage that limits its use is the modification (i.e., add, change, or delete) of the defined categories and attributes when necessary. One of the solutions to this problem is the design of a system with a simple, category-selectable, and -addable mechanism. The current study addresses this need by conducting a consultation to derive the categories and attributes based on advertisers’ opinions, product interests, and preferences based on the responses of mobile phone users. Details are described in the following sections.

@&#METHOD@&#

The design procedure of the LARSMA for delivering SMS is illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . The procedure highlights two purposes: (1) to obtain and summarize the opinions and comments of SMS providers and receivers and (2) to balance the opinions and comments of both parties by conducting a cross interview, that is, to deliver the opinions and comments of one party to the other and solicit responses. The results may generally be consistent, conflicting, or optional. No common advertising and access contents currently exist for our study to adopt; hence, the study underwent two phases. In the first phase, which focuses on the content-based RM for mobile advertising, two storeowners and three advertisers were consulted for the development of the advertising category content, their attributes (e.g., categories and post period), and concerns, all of which were in turn used to establish an advertising data table for the storage of advertising contents. This study also consulted five mobile phone users to collect data on user interests and preferences (e.g., category and distance). The data were used to establish the access data table for the storage of access contents. In the second phase, a cross-interview was conducted to balance the concerns of both message providers and receivers. The results of the cross interview were used in the system design. The summarized responses of the message providers and receivers are presented in Tables 1 and 2
                        
                        , respectively. The tables also present the balance of expectations and concerns of both parties regarding the system design. The remarkable results that structurally present the expectations, balance, and design decisions are illustrated in Fig. 2
                         that highlights the system design decisions used in the second phase as follows: (1) using a permission-oriented mechanism that users can turn on to receive SMS or turn off to discontinue receiving SMS because of privacy concerns; (2) non-recording of any access data because of privacy; (3) allowing the distance entry of users to fit the dynamic consumption behavior; (4) considering adequately sufficient parameters and determining the top 10 outcomes to balance use willingness, accuracy, and efficiency; and (5) considering the total number of hits and total number of “likes” involved to satisfy the perceived expectations.

On the basis of the summarized expectations, balance, and design decision, the LARSMA was developed in the second phase as an Android-based system that integrates Google Maps API for location awareness and similarity computation for data filtering and comparison. A PBAM-oriented RM was embedded in the designed LARSMA to filter, compare, and derive the final top N formatted short advertising messages and/or local promotion messages. The characteristics of the LARSMA are listed in Table 3
                        . The domain, type of mobile advertisement, type of RM, attributes of the advertising contents, attributes of the access contents, system mechanism, development method, system outputs, and objectives of the system are presented in the table. When the LARSMA system is activated, the storeowners or advertisers sign in as users, type an advertising message (text form), type the address of their stores, type the time period, select the advertising category, and click OK to complete the location-aware SMS advertisement. Meanwhile, mobile phone users open the LARSMA system, select “on” to accept incoming advertising messages, define the preference scale of distance and time (a 10-digit scale), select interesting advertising categories, select a number of the top-ranked advertising messages, and then click OK to receive the top N recommended outcomes. After reviewing a recommendation, the mobile phone users can indicate whether they like it or dislike it. The users can discontinue the service by turning the related setting off. In this work, the developed LARSMA was validated and evaluated by storeowners, mobile phone users, and domain specialists using test scenarios (e.g., service process, usefulness, and ease of use). The details are described in the succeeding sections.

The system framework of LARSMA is illustrated in Fig. 3
                        . The framework comprises of five components: user interface, system mechanism, database of advertising messages, database of usage contents, and recommended outputs.

This study categorizes users into two main types: storeowners and/or advertisers and mobile phone users. The user interface designed for storeowners and advertisers is a web-based page in which they can simply enter their advertising messages, including their store names, store addresses, promotional messages (e.g., on-sale messages), advertising categories (e.g., food and clothes), and time periods (e.g., starting from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM). The user interface designed for mobile phone users is an app-based page. The page has a feature that allows users to switch the service on or off, accept or disregard incoming messages, define their preferred degree of distance and time, select specific advertising items on the basis of their interests, and enter the actual range of distance from which they are to receive the advertising messages. Given that the LARSMA prototype system was designed with a function that presents the location of a selected store, the interface incorporates the Google Maps API into the system mechanism to help direct users toward such store. The user interface also allows users to indicate whether or not they like the store.

The created database contains five data tables: Storeowner, Advertise, User, UConditions, and ReIntermediate (in Fig. 4
                           ). Storeowner contains five attributes with which to store the basic data of storeowners (or advertisers) who sign in on the LARSMA: the storeowner number (SANo, an identifier), name (SAName), phone number (SAPhon), postal address (SAAddr), and email address (SAEmal). Advertise contains ten attributes with which to store the advertising message contents provided by the storeowners: the advertisement number (AdNo, an identifier), storeowner number (SANo), store name (ADSN), message contents (AdMC), store address (AdSA), starting time (AdTs), ending time (AdTe), advertising category (AdCa), number of accessed marks (AdAM), and number of positive marks (AdPM). User contains three attributes with which to store the code of the mobile device, degree of preferred distance, and degree of preferred time. UConditions contains nine attributes with which to store the conditions defined by the user attempting to access the advertising messages: the access number (AcNo, an identifier), use content number (UCNo, or code of mobile device), distance defined (AcDi), and ten preferred categories (Fo for food, Cl for clothes, Ho for housing, Tr for transportation, Ed for education, En for entertainment, 3C for 3C products, Mm for multimedia products, Pe for pets, and Bk for books). ReIntermediate contains eleven attributes with which to store the data used to derive intermediate recommended outcomes: advertisement number (AdNo), access number (AcNo), access conditions such as preferred categories (Pc), access distance (AcDi), access time (AcT), semi-dynamic parameters such as weight of distance (Wd) and weight of time (Wt), dynamic parameters such as distance to the store (Ds) and time left (Ts), obtained score (Score), and recommended priority (RP).

All the tables created for the LARSMA system are connected with relation lines to ensure that the data are correctly stored and efficiently accessible from each data table. The relationships between these tables are illustrated in Fig. 4. A relation line with an arrow indicates that a record with a particular attribute value in a table can have many records with the same attribute values as the other. This relation is referred to as the one-to-many relation, in which the key sign represents one. For example, an attribute value “SANo” in the Storeowner table can have many “SANo” values in the Advertise table. This condition implies that a storeowner can have many advertising message contents. In another example, a mobile phone user can repeatedly request for location-aware advertising messages. All relation lines that are required for the data tables in the LARSMA system are created accordingly.

The system mechanism contains two parts: the data maintenance of the data tables and the pull-oriented and explicit content-based RS for the extraction of outcomes. Data maintenance is designed simply for storeowners to maintain their advertising message contents through a designed interface and for mobile phone users to define the degree of importance of their preferred distance and time for their request conditions related to access distance and preferred advertising categories while attempting to receive advertising messages. For example, the storeowner of a restaurant can add a new on-sale message, which contains an advertising message for the category of food, store address, message contents (e.g., “buy one, get one free”), and time period (e.g., from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM). Similarly, a mobile phone user can add or modify the degree of importance of his or her preferred distance (e.g., 7), time (e.g., 5), access distance (e.g., 0.5miles), and preferred advertising categories (e.g., food and clothing).

The pull-oriented and explicit content-based RS analyzes both the semi-dynamic and dynamic data that are respectively defined and provided by users when they access the LARSMA system and their present location to derive the top 10 recommended outcomes (Yuan & Tsao, 2003). Recommendation tasks can be accomplished in three steps. First, when a user signs in, the mechanism for the semi-dynamic data simply retrieves and analyzes the entry of the user regarding the degree of importance of this user’s preferred distance and time. These data are contributed to the parameter weight computation of the recommended outcomes. However, to dynamically create links to current interests, the data must be user modifiable. The current study defines two parameters: distance and time. Weight is calculated using Eq. (1):

The second step involves the mechanism for dynamic data, which considers the distance parameter, time parameter, selected advertising categories, and feedback of users through the number of “likes” to derive the rank of advertising messages as the recommended outcomes for mobile phone users within the target zone. The obtained values of the distance and time parameters are standardized on the basis of the degree of importance. This study adopts the rule that a minimal difference in the distance between a store location and a user equates to a high degree of importance of the advertising message of that store. For the time parameter, the degree of importance of an advertising message is high when the duration of the advertising message of the store is short. The standardization of distance (D’) and time (T’) is given in Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively.

The mechanism computes the score by considering both the semi-dynamic and dynamic data (Yuan & Tsao, 2003). The score for Advertising Message A (ScoreA) is determined by the weight in Eq. (1), the degree of importance of distance in Eq. (2), the degree of importance of time in Eq. (3), and the selection of advertising categories and number of “likes” by the user on the advertising messages. The mechanism is expressed as Eq. (4). For the relevant use of this mechanism, the initial value of N is set to 1, and n/N is ignored but specified when n
                           =0.

An artificial test case was used to present the manner of deriving the recommended outcomes and to validate the system mechanism. Three tables were created for the illustrated example. The Storeowner (Table 4
                        ) and User (Table 5
                        ) tables had five records each while Advertise (Table 6
                        ) had 16 records. Given the previously described example, we did not show the UConditions table, which stores the inputs of a user. The conditions were as follows: user code of U000001, access distance of 0.3miles, access time of 11:00 AM, and selected categories such as food (Fo) and clothing (Cl). The system mechanism was subsequently implemented to derive the intermediate recommended outcomes. The results are shown in Table 7
                        , which has four parts: the access conditions, semi-dynamic parameters, dynamic parameters, and score and priority. For example, the system received access conditions from a mobile phone user (U000001) and exhibited two advertising categories selected by the user selected, namely, food and clothing. Whether or not the access time was within the time period was also considered. Six advertising messages were returned. The semi-parameters distance and time were computed using Eq. (1); 0.583 and 0.417 were obtained, respectively. The dynamic parameters distance and time were also computed using Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. The final score and recommended priority for each advertising message were then returned by Eq. (4). For example, the advertising number 2014010100126 obtained the highest score of 0.496 and was therefore recommended with priority. All the results were verified to be correct.

The developed LARSMA system was tested using a variety of scenarios, and the test outputs generated at each stage were checked and validated. The test scenarios were run to verify all the different functions of the developed LARSMA for all users (i.e., storeowners and mobile phone users). This testing was periodically conducted through all the stages of system development to ensure that the system performed as expected. The evaluation was conducted by collecting responses from storeowners and mobile phone users who were asked to use the developed LARSMA and provide comments. Specialists in the LAS domain were also consulted, particularly for the system mechanism and overall prototype system development. Their feedback and suggestions were collected and summarized.

Two main functions were used and tested by the storeowners. First, with a lean interface, a storeowner could enter the store name, store address, advertising message, start time, end time, and advertising category. The created message was then added to the advertising list. Second, the storeowner could double-check the contents of the list, which he or she could launch right after confirmation. The results for entering the advertising messages and for confirming them in the demonstrated case were correct, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6
                     
                     , respectively. The entered address in the test case was “288 Lanten Rd., Nanzih District, Kaohsiung”. The message content was “Pintian Ranch Pork Chops, buy one get one free”. The category was food, and the start and end times were “2014/2/10/11/00” and “2014/2/10/14/00,” respectively. The results were confirmed to be correct in the advertisement list (see Fig. 6).

Five main functions were available to mobile phone users: access category, access radius, top N outcomes, map, and feedback. First, an interface was presented after the system was initiated. A user selected the categories he or she was interested in and then entered the access radius. In the test case, the present time was 11:00 AM, and the access categories were food, clothing, pets, and entertainment. The top N was 5, and the access radius was 250m. Fig. 6 presents the recommended outcomes, all of which were verified to be correct. Each outcome was designed with a hyperlink connected to Google Maps in case users would need directions. This access was counted once in the attribute (AdAM) table of Advertise. The user showed a positive response to this advertising message by indicating “like.” This “like” was counted once in the attribute of AdPM. All functions and computations were verified to be correct.

For the system evaluation, the LARSMA prototype system was also demonstrated to the storeowners, mobile phone users, and software development specialists in the LAS areas. The feedback on its system usefulness, ease of use, and privacy were collected from the three groups of reviewers. To collect data, we considered the evaluation outline proposed by Lee, Wu, and Wei (2008) that mainly included items of ease of use, system appropriateness, system mechanism, efficiency to reach solutions, and usefulness. However, to maintain the features of the current prototype system, several items were modified in deriving the questionnaire (Table 8
                     ) that contained both quantitative and qualitative items. This modification was aimed at facilitating the acquisition of feedback from the invited users and reviewers. Several sections were covered to address topics such as the service process, RM, usefulness, ease of use, privacy, interface, and outcomes. For quantitative feedback, each question item was based on a seven-digit Likert scale for the users and reviewers to present their degree of perception. For qualitative feedback, they were encouraged to provide answers to all the questions in the evaluation questionnaire. On the basis of these requirements, six storeowners, six mobile phone users, and five specialists were invited through face-to-face requests and telephone calls. A total of four storeowners (i.e., two restaurant managers, one clothing store owner in a local mall, and one bookstore owner), six mobile phone users (i.e., two company workers and four college students), and three specialists (i.e., all in the mobile service software development domain) accepted the invitation to help in the evaluation. The storeowners and managers were asked to review the idea of and use the location-aware mobile advertising functions while the mobile phone users were asked to access the location-aware advertising services. The specialists were requested to review the service process, RM, and interface used in the development of the LARSMA.

The comments and suggestions were concisely collected, and both quantitative and qualitative feedback was summarized (Table 9
                     ). We must note that although the quantitative feedback using the statistic mean of the small sample size may not be able to sufficiently represent the generalized findings, it can somehow reflect the perception level of the users for the evaluation items. The main findings are as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           For the service process, the mean of the storeowners was 6.0, that of the six mobile phone users was 6.0, and that of the specialists was 5.7. Most of the reviewers accepted the service process that directly connects storeowners and consumers. Despite its simplicity, the service process is relevant in reflecting the characteristics of SMS. Moreover, the storeowners and mobile phone users suggested that the prototype system should be made available not only to physical stores but also to online stores. A reward feature for every Facebook (FB) check-in as an incentive for users to increase the visibility of the visited store was also suggested for the next version of the LARSMA. This suggestion implied that they considered extending the service process to FB check-in services. However, the specialists did not mention such suggestion because of the research focus.

For RM, the mean of the four storeowners was 5.5, that of the six mobile phone users was 5.8, and that of the specialists was 5.3. The storeowners accepted the current mechanism used. Both the mobile phone users and the specialists recognized the consistency between the use of the permission-based and pull-oriented mechanism and previous research findings. Moreover, the specialists suggested that additional awareness parameters, such as season, weather, and temperature, should be considered to provide highly relevant advertising messages. By contrast, mobile phone users were likely to make decisions according to present situations and the degree of urgency. No inconsistent comment was found with respect to the system RM.

For usefulness, the mean of the four storeowners was 3.8, that of the six mobile phone users was 4.5, and that of the specialists was 4.0. Usefulness obtained the lowest degree among the evaluation criteria. A consistent comment from the storeowners and specialists was that the prototype system should be verified from a practical viewpoint. In other words, the LARSMA should be used in actual stores to observe its performance. Such method of verification may be time consuming, but it is the next step in assessing the current LARSMA because the proposed system at the current stage is only a prototype. The storeowners suggested extending the range of its use from physical to online stores by providing services such as an online-aware advertising service. A feasibility analysis will be considered in the next version of LARSMA. The mobile phone users suggested a keyword filter for large advertising messages and expressed serious concern over the LARSMA being free. The specialists suggested developing incentives to increase the willingness to reuse. This proposition was consistent with the comment of the mobile phone users regarding the reward feature for every FB check-in. The specialists also suggested that the current study should consider acceptable efficiency on the basis of the receipt of outcomes, which is one of the main issues of the LARSMA that needs to be addressed.

For ease of use, the mean of the four storeowners was 6.3, that of the six mobile phone users was 5.5, and that of the specialists was 6.3. The mobile phone users and specialists acknowledged this feature in a straightforward manner. The storeowners suggested that new categories, such as sports and fortunetelling, should be added to the list. No insistent comment was found.

For privacy, the mean of the four storeowners was 6.0, that of the six mobile phone users was 6.0, and that of the specialists was 5.7. On the one hand, the storeowners gave no comment because no consumer data were recorded for them to use. On the other hand, the mobile phone users recognized that the LARSMA only had their device code and IP, which ensured the protection of their personal privacy. This feedback was consistent with the comment of the specialists regarding the RM being capable of reducing location privacy risk through the “on” and “off” options. However, this feature was found to be inconsistent with the following comment about the RM: “more aware parameters should be considered to increase accuracy.” When a large number of parameters are involved, a large number of interactions with users are necessary. This condition prolongs the service process, which in turn may reduce the level of user privacy. The currently developed LARSMA balances the conflicts among privacy, efficiency, and SMS characteristics through consultations with storeowners, advertisers, and mobile phone users. However, an in-depth analysis is necessary to solve this dilemma for the next version of the LARSMA.

For the interface and outcome, the mean of the four storeowners was 5.8, that of the six mobile phone users was 5.7, and that of the specialists was 6.0. The mobile phone users suggested that the present recommendations be in the form of a list, in which each outcome is shown with a different background color. They also suggested showing the ratio of the number of “likes” to the total number of access to facilitate decision making. By contrast, the storeowners and specialists accepted the current form of the interface. Moreover, they checked and confirmed the case outcomes to be correct and inquired about the number of hits in each category. No insistent comment was found.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Although Table 9 reveals some useful information on the proposed LARSMA, a notable conclusion on the system’s strengths and weaknesses may not be achieved at its current state. The proposed LARSMA is essentially an exploratory study that deals mainly with the development of advertising channels using the LAS model. The collected and summarized results in Table 9 are insufficient to generalize opinions on the basis of such a small sample set. To determine the usefulness and ease of use of the system, extensive, practical, and in-depth investigations should be conducted on its tangible and intangible benefits. For example, a tangible benefit may consist of true marketing benefits. For intangible benefits, the main reason why users are relatively willing to use the system is its efficiency in delivering advertising messages and its capability of increasing market visibility and demonstrating the strong connection of a store with new social network marketing and purchasing behaviors. Table 9 also shows that although most of the evaluators noted that the LARSMA prototype system is acceptable based on the review scenarios, storeowners must be allowed to maintain the category and message attributes. This feedback is understandable because most information providers, particularly advertisers, usually attempt to deliver as many information categories as possible to their target receivers. The dilemma involving the parameters used, privacy, and efficiency also requires suitable solutions that may entail close collaboration among advertisers, consumers, and domain experts. To this end, the next version of the LARSMA should balance the expected sufficiency and suggested precision by considering a flexible mechanism with which mobile phone users can select parameters to derive recommended outcomes for their present access.

The significance of the current research comes in two forms. First, the study involves consultations with both storeowners and consumers to identify their concerns and expectations. The same has not been done in the literature. The balance of the concerns and expectations of all the users is also considered. We must note that no exact goal is set for this balance process because psychological and ethical behavior, cognitive behavior, consumption behavior, and use behavior for both storeowners and mobile phone users are generally not easy to define. Second, this study designs and develops the prototype system on the basis of the aforementioned system design. A salient concern is to evaluate the developed prototype and report the evaluation results as a response to the research questions.

The following are the theoretical implications of the study. The increasing emphasis on the social relevance of information and the development of communication technology in the delivery of services has been recognized (Mumford, 2006). In addition to technological problems, privacy issues, information security, legal aspects, and trust are being carefully considered while focusing on accuracy, convenience, and efficiency (Abbas, Michael, & Michael, 2014; Chen, Ross, & Huang, 2008; Xu et al., 2009; Zhou, 2011). The current study proposes, analyzes, develops, and implements the significance of the research idea for location-aware advertising services. On the basis of the theoretical concept of the pull-oriented information service model, the proposed LARSMA combines LAS and implicit content-based analysis to develop the RM that helps derive recommended outcomes for mobile phone users. Privacy can particularly be viewed as an aspect of security. Such perspective implies that trade-offs among group interests are necessary. In contrast to previous studies that focus mainly on technical enhancement (e.g., prediction accuracy) (e.g., Kuo, Chen, & Liang, 2009; Xu, Liao, & Li, 2008), application relevance (e.g., function diversity) (Chen & Hsieh, 2012), or development of a privacy protection mechanism (e.g., Pingley et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2009), the current research consults storeowners and mobile phone users to balance privacy and the various factors involved in the services of the proposed LARSMA. Such consultation is conducted for two purposes. One purpose is to follow the argument of Chen et al. (2008) and Tan et al. (2012), which states that information and decisional privacy (or autonomy privacy) should be carefully considered while developing mobile services, and that of Xu et al. (2011), which states that personalization can somehow prevail over privacy concerns. Another purpose is to reflect the SMS characteristics as dynamic, user-centered, instant, autonomous, and independent from user behavior (Wei et al., 2010).

Service mobilization is one of the important marketing channels for the delivery of information services. It has developed its own characteristics, such as real time, personalized, location-aware, situation-aware, and even emotion-aware characteristics. One of the key success factors in the delivery of advertising messages (e.g., short messages) is the optimization of service flow by reducing the delivery time between senders (e.g., marketers) and receivers (e.g., mobile phone users). The simple RM developed for the proposed LARSMA is based on consultations with storeowners and mobile phone users. The results from the evaluation of the storeowners and mobile phone users reveal that the proposed LARSMA prototype is acceptable for direct linkage between message senders and receivers. Without involving a number of parameters for accurate prediction, the LARSMA prototype recognizes the simple but practical needs of storeowners and mobile phone users. Furthermore, the prototype serves a common platform, through which one party directly sends messages anytime and anywhere, whereas the other party pulls matched ones as preferred and sends feedback as desired. However, the true usefulness of the prototype has yet to be verified. One of the summarized comments discloses the possibility that online stores can also deliver pop-up real-time short messages to online users (both members and non-members) on the basis of the pull-oriented model and user preferences. Theoretically, a feasibility analysis may be necessary in future research.

With respect to practical implications, the results of the evaluation provide LAS providers with a summarized analysis of the LARSMA prototype’s appropriateness and acceptability, as well as the user adoption attitude, according to the perception of the participating storeowners, mobile phone users, and specialists. This evaluation highlights the usefulness, ease of use, privacy, interface, service process, RM, and outcome of the system. On the one hand, true usefulness via verification is still unknown because of the unavailability of true users (both storeowners and mobile phone users). This situation limits the contribution of the current study to the literature. On the other hand, the results imply that although LAS vendors and agents, particularly those who deliver short advertising messages, perceive that the LARSMA prototype helps reduce the gap of service flow, they stress the need for a successful case collection to demonstrate to storeowners and mobile phone users to enhance their adoption willingness. To this end, LAS vendors and agents can increase usage confidence in the storeowner side and maintain customer relationships in the user side. Mobile commerce has been seen as an increasingly important channel by which sellers provide buyers with information, services, and products anytime and anywhere. Initiators or consultants implementing the LARSMA system or other similar systems should emphasize the gap in the flow of advertising services between advertisers and consumers and the importance of using geographical data. Initiators or consultants explain that the employed LARSMA with a mechanism of recommending advertising messages can help target mobile consumers by considering their location and personal preferences with an acceptable privacy risk (Zhu et al., 2014).

In most cases, developing an LAS-enabled and privacy-accepted application is advantageous. However, confidence and trust in LAS-enabled applications take time to develop and accumulate. From an important perspective, privacy can be one of the barriers and is viewed as an aspect of security; in this case, swaps among parties are necessary (Chen & Hsieh, 2012; Zhou, 2011). To resolve this issue, LAS developers, vendors, or consultants should consider privacy options while increasing the effectiveness of their targeting accuracy (Wu et al., 2013). In addition to consulting with storeowners and mobile phone users regarding the involved parameters, the proposed LARSMA provides mobile phone users with two options: on and off. The “on” option is for accepting information according to the defined rules (e.g., within a one-mile radius of the area for categories of food and clothing). The “off” option stops the LARSMA from sensing user location for privacy protection. LAS developers, vendors, and consultants are advised to recognize that this approach has been implemented and accepted by storeowners and mobile phone users.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In general, the LARSMA prototype is not a complex technology (e.g., installation and use) and is one of the important tools that storeowners can use to self-deliver short advertising messages to mobile phone users who accept this service. LAS adoption is a technical, management, behavioral, and strategic issue. Thus, the opinions and preferences of consumers must be explored. This research briefly described the pull-oriented LAS as used in the delivery of short advertising messages to mobile users and designed and developed the LARSMA, a location-aware RS. The developed LARSMA was evaluated according to the scenarios of system usefulness, ease of use, RM, correctness, privacy, service process, and outcome. Unlike other studies, the present work performed consultations with storeowners and mobile phone users to identify the parameters that balance the concerns of privacy, accuracy, and SMS characteristics (e.g., efficiency).

In developing the LARSMA, determining the parameters used in the RM was the most difficult but the most important task. The parameters used in this study included advertising category, advertising message, store address, start time, and end times at the side of the storeowners; and the device code, distance preference, time preference, category preference, and feedback from the user side. These parameters were collected through interviews. An in-depth review of the literature was required. This review included the applicable domains and the needs and wants of the interviewees. The LARSMA applied in the delivery of short messages was considered from the perspective of mobile and location awareness. Other perspectives in terms of applications, such as emotion and weather awareness, may entail particular design principles, special domain knowledge, and other requirements.

The findings from the evaluation of this study are remarkable because early studies focus mostly on empirical data and technical enhancement without emphasizing the comments and opinions of sampled subjects with respect to service process, usefulness, and ease of use. LAS significantly changes the implementation of mobile social networking as an important marketing tool between marketers and consumers. From the real-world perspective, location-aware social networking aids business development by establishing direct connections among parties. However, many unknown details regarding the usage and performance of the LARSMA as it virtually deals with offline commercial activities must be identified by modeling LAS. Such details include mobility, social, and privacy relevance. Innovative solutions and practical investigations are also necessary.
