Sub-endothelial LDL accumulation

                  Accumulation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the vessel wall is suggested as the initiator of atherosclerosis and coronary stenosis. This process is associated with the performance of endothelium layer that regulates entering of macromolecules to the vessel wall. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules in a coronary tree and predict atherosclerosis prone sites. Non-Newtonian blood flow is simulated for normal and hypertensive conditions through the lumen of a right coronary artery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) images. A three-pore model is implemented as the endothelium boundary condition and hence, plasma flow and LDL transport are simulated within the arterial wall. Based on the pore model, endothelium pathways divide into normal junctions, vesicles and leaky junctions. Most of LDL molecules pass through the leaky junctions that arise at locations with low wall shear stress (
                        WSS
                     ). Results indicate that increase in the number of leaky junctions at branch points with low 
                        WSS
                      can lead to both elevated levels of sub-endothelial LDL accumulation and atherosclerosis risk. Findings reveal that at the branch points with disturbed flow, sub-endothelial concentration of LDL for the hypertensive condition is higher than the normal condition, however for the rest of regions with uniform geometry and unidirectional flow, this is reversed. Comparisons of non-Newtonian and Newtonian flows show mean increases of 34% and 13% in the sub-endothelial concentrations of Newtonian flows during the normal and hypertensive conditions, respectively.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Atherosclerosis is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular diseases around the world. Atherosclerosis refers to the stenosis of arteries and decrease of blood supply to tissues because of plaques formation in the vessel wall. Development of atherosclerosis is associated with the performance of endothelium layer and accumulation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the arterial wall [12,26,34]. Endothelium is a continuous layer of cells that responds to blood flow shear forces, acts as a semipermeable membrane and controls penetration of macromolecules to the vessel wall [10,11]. Disturbed flows which are characterized by non-uniform and irregular flow patterns including recirculation zones [4,6], disrupt the performance of the endothelium and cause leaky junctions at this layer. These junctions exceedingly promote mass flux of LDL macromolecules into the vessel wall that leads to the formation of plaques and development of atherosclerosis [4,6,44].

In addition, incidence of atherosclerosis plaques in the coronary arteries reduces blood supply to the heart muscles that may cause severe problems to this vital organ. Several mathematical models have been published for prediction of arterial regions potential to atherosclerosis. Some models have exclusively investigated the blood flow in the coronary arteries and analyzed velocity stream lines, wall shear stress (
                        WSS
                     ) and its spatial and temporal gradients to identify the atherosclerosis prone sites [14,16,22,23,32,38,45,48]. To enhance the accuracy of such models, the periodic and non-Newtonian properties of blood flow [14,16,48], time variable geometry of coronary arteries [22,45] and appropriate boundary conditions are taken into account [22,38]. Knight et al. [23] and Rikhtegar et al. [32] conducted simulations of blood flow through the coronary arteries of various patients and analyzed performance of different hemodynamic variables in identifying atherosclerosis plaques. They reconstructed the healthy state right and left coronary arteries of the patients and obtained time average wall shear stress (
                        AWSS
                     ) and wall shear stress gradient (
                        AWSSG
                     ), oscillatory shear index (
                        OSI
                     ) and relative residence time (
                        RRT
                     ) through the computational study of periodic blood flow. Then, using statistical analysis, these variables were evaluated as the indicators of atherosclerosis prone sites. According to the statistical studies, even though 
                        AWSS
                      correctly predicted the largest number of plaques, it produced more false positives than the other variables. Therefore, they demonstrated that although low 
                        WSS
                      is necessary to initiate atherosclerosis process, it is not sufficient for the plaque formation. Other important factors such as endothelium permeability, LDL mass flux and inflammatory processes are also involved in the coronary stenosis that should be taken into account in the prediction of potential sites of atherosclerosis plaques.

There are other studies that simulated LDL transport in addition to the blood flow to predict arterial regions potential to atherosclerosis development. LDL transport models are categorized into three types of wall-free models, lumen-wall models and multi-layer models. In the wall-free models, fluid dynamics and LDL transport are studied only in the lumen side of artery which do not provide any information on the transmural flow and solute dynamics in the arterial wall. Kaazempur-Mofrad and Ethier [18] used a wall-free model to analyze mass transfer patterns in realistic geometries of right coronary arteries and Soulis et al. [40] studied effects of 
                        WSS
                      on LDL accumulation on the luminal of surface of patient specific right coronary arteries. Homogenous-wall models that in addition to the arterial lumen, consider the wall structure. These models approximate multi-structure of the arterial wall as a mono-layer with homogeneous transport properties. Olgac et al. [31] used experimental results of other investigators and related endothelium fluxes to 
                        WSS
                     . In this research, material pathways through the endothelium were divided into three classes: normal junctions, vesicles and leaky junctions. They used this model for the analysis of LDL transport in an idealized and also patient-specific geometries of left coronary artery with a single layer homogenous wall [30,31]. Their results showed that locations with the lowest values of 
                        WSS
                      had maximum fluxes through the endothelium layer were coinciding with the locations of LDL accumulation within the wall. The most complex models are multi-layer models that simulate fluid dynamics and material transport through each layer of the arterial wall with distinct properties. Chung and Vafai [9] studied effects of atherosclerotic wall thickening on LDL transport in a multi-layer arterial wall. Kenjeres et al. [21] analyzed LDL transport through a four-layer wall model of an anatomically realistic carotid artery bifurcation.

The present study examines LDL transfer through single-layer wall of an image-based geometry of a human right coronary tree and investigates effects of hypertension and non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on the sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules. Three dimensional geometry of the coronary tree was obtained using patient׳s computed tomography images. Employing generalized power law model (as an appropriate non-Newtonian model for blood flow [17]) and time averages of velocity and pressure waveforms reported by Kim et al. [22] (as boundary conditions for the normal and hypertensive conditions), steady state non-Newtonian flow of blood is simulated and 
                        WSS
                      distribution is obtained. Then, with a three-pore model and application of filtration flow and LDL transport equations within the wall, locations of sub-endothelial LDL accumulation are identified and reported as prone sites of atherosclerosis and coronary stenosis.

The present study is unique in that it investigates effect of non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on accumulation of LDL molecules within the arterial wall of the right coronaries. Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] previously simulated sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules in the right coronary arteries. However, they neglected effect of non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on the LDL transport. Nonetheless, in the current study, due to low shear stresses in the right coronary artery, non-Newtonian behavior is included by the generalized power law model. One of the major differences with the simulations of Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] is at shear dependent boundary conditions and contribution of leaky junctions in the plasma flow and LDL transport through the endothelium layer. They did not considered proportion of leaky junctions in the materials transport into the wall. Whereas, in this study, based on observations of Cancel et al. [2] and due to the importance of leaky junctions in the LDL transport, these pathways are included in the modeling of the endothelium layer.

A simple schematic of the computational domains with model specifications is shown in 
                     Fig. 1. Pulsatile nature of the blood flow through the arterial lumen is described with steady in the mean flow conditions. A filtration flow including plasma and LDL molecules gets out from blood stream, passes the endothelium layer and enters the wall according to the three-pore model. Darcy׳s law is employed to describe transmural flow in the single layer wall porous medium and convection-diffusion mechanism with a reaction term is applied to model LDL transport within the arterial wall.

Blood flow through the arterial lumen is described by the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations. With the assumptions of steady, laminar and incompressible flows, these equations are given as:

Generalized power law is presented as one of the most suitable models for the blood flow at low shear stresses [17]. Based on this model, viscosity is higher than that of Newtonian value (

Blood plasma and LDL molecules can enter the arterial wall through the endothelium pathways. There are three types of material pathways in the endothelium layer namely normal junctions, vesicles and leaky junctions [44]. Normal junctions are as considered cylinders between endothelial cells which block passage of macromolecules with radii larger than 2nm such as LDL (with a radius of 11nm) [31]. Vesicles are bubbles within the endothelial cells which provide pathways for LDL macromolecules by the process of Endocytosis. Leaky junctions are assumed as a ring-shaped pore with the widths of 40nm [31] surrounding the dividing or dying cells through which both plasma and LDL molecules can pass. Having considered these, to calculate the fluxes through a particular surface, one needs to determine what percentage of cells are healthy or leaky. The fraction of leaky cells

                         are the osmotic and solvent reflection coefficients, respectively. Following previous computational studies, in order to decouple fluid dynamics equations from solute dynamics, osmotic pressure difference across the endothelium layer is neglected [30,31,36,41,42,43]. Therefore, by considering the fact that plasma pass through the normal and leaky junctions and also, LDL molecules pass through the vesicles and leaky junctions, plasma volume flux and LDL mass flux are given by summing the fluxes over each pathway:

Therefore in the present study, by simulation of the transport equations, then calculating surface average value of the mass flux through leaky junctions and finally regarding the proportions reported for each of the pathways, values of

The evaluated geometry in this study belongs to a 49 years old male patient that scanning operation was performed on him at the imaging center of Kosar hospital in Shiraz using a 64-slice Philips CT machine. Anatomical geometry of right coronary tree with five primary side branches was reconstructed from the CT raw image data (
                        Fig. 2). After appropriate smoothing operations, enclosing surface of the coronary tree was regarded as a mesh representing artery lumen. In order to reconstruct the arterial wall, the luminal surface was uniformly extruded in the normal direction by a thickness of 0.34mm. Boundary conditions for the blood flow were computed from wave forms reported by Kim et al. [22]. They used lumped parameter models for the prediction of flow rate and pressure wave forms in the coronary arteries during the rest and exercise conditions. Therefore in the present study, using time averages of the results for the right coronary artery and considering the rest condition as a normal state and the exercise condition as a hypertensive state, flow rates equal to

Numerical solution of the governing equations was obtained with unstructured tetrahedral grids for the lumen and arterial wall. In order to gain accurate results, mesh independency operations as detailed in Appendix were performed for various sets of computational grids in the lumen and wall. Regarding the grid independence studies, the coronary lumen was discretized into 2,678,115 unstructured tetrahedral volumes and arterial wall was discretized into 3,139,652 volumes. All transport equations were solved by the finite element software, Comsol Multiphysics V3.4. Blood flow were solved using generalized minimum residual iterative method attached by a multigrid preconditioner and solution of transport equations within the arterial wall which have solution dependent boundary conditions, were obtained by iterative method of conjugate gradient coupled with a multigrid preconditioner.

Biomechanical forces from the blood flow act on the endothelium layer and regulate its permeability to blood various components. Geometric complexities cause disturbed flow in the arteries and hence irregular entry of macromolecules to the wall that increases the risk of atherosclerosis. In this study, effects of disturbed flow on the performance of the endothelium layer and sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL are presented.

Slices of velocity distributions are shown in 
                        Fig. 3A. According to the Murray׳s law and imposed boundary conditions, percentages of total flow through each of the first to the fifth side branches are 5%, 7%, 14%, 23% and 51%, respectively. Branch points are the major regions of disturbed flows. Stream lines of the secondary flows created at these locations are depicted in Fig. 3B. Due to low radius of the first and second side branches, minimum portions of the main flow enter these side branches. Therefore, areas of low speeds with secondary flows being formed at the bifurcations that with the increase in the intensity of main flow during the hypertensive condition, vortexes are created at these locations. At the trifurcation point, flow is diverted toward the fifth side branch and maximum velocities are stablished in this side branch. As a result of this flow division, a region of weak flows is created at the beginning of third side branch. As stream lines of the secondary flow at branch points visualize, during the hypertensive condition, disturbed behavior of blood flow increases and hypertensive velocities for some areas at the beginning of side branches 1, 2 and 3 near to the wall, are equal and even lower than the normal condition.

                           Pa
                        , respectively. Minimum values of 
                           WSS
                         are located at the entries of side branches 1, 2 and 3. Due to the non-uniform and complex flow patterns, magnitudes of 
                           WSS
                         at the bifurcations regions are low. Moreover, diversion of non-uniform flow through the trifurcation point distributes the 
                           WSS
                        ; maximum values of 
                           WSS
                         are located at the entry of the fifth side branch, whereas for the entry of the third side branch this variable approaches to zero.

According to the employed pore model, low 
                           WSS
                         causes mitosis of endothelial cells and triggers incidence of leaky junctions. Therefore, with the increase in 
                           WSS
                         from the normal to the hypertensive condition, average value of 
                           ϕ
                         decreases from 0.0054 to 0.0023. As distributions of fraction of leaky cells in Fig. 4B indicate, in all locations except for the branch points, value of 
                           ϕ
                         during the normal condition is higher than that of the hypertensive condition. At the entries of the first and second side branches for both conditions, a reduction in 
                           WSS
                         causes fraction of leaky cells to reach its maximum. However, at these locations, in spite of larger flows during the hypertensive condition, values of 
                           ϕ
                         are equal and even more than the normal condition. This can be illustrated by considering the secondary flows depicted in the Fig. 3B. Because of the sharper flow during the hypertensive condition, vortexes created at the entries of the first and second side branches (cross Sections 1 and 2). This, in turn, causes a region with lower values of 
                           WSS
                         and thus higher fractions of leaky cell relative to the normal condition. At the trifurcation point such behavior also occurs (cross Section 3); at the beginning of the third side branch during the hypertensive condition, disturbed behavior of blood flow increases and a region with lower 
                           WSS
                         and higher fraction of leaky cells is formed at this location.

Once the leaky junctions occur, plasma that could previously pass through normal junctions, has a chance to flow through leaky junctions. Distributions of plasma volume flux through leaky junctions and total volume flux are shown in 
                        Fig. 5. As this figure indicates, places with maximum cell leakage, show also maximum values of volume flux through leaky junctions. Low 
                           WSS
                         at these locations, causes elevated number of leaky junctions, which, in turn, leads to the increase in the amount of plasma enters the wall structure by leaky junction pathways. The magnitude of plasma volume flux through leaky junctions at the branch points with low 
                           WSS
                         increase up to 40-fold compared with the regions with maximum values of 
                           WSS
                        . Surface average values of this parameter for the normal and hypertensive conditions are determined to be

                         and pressure during the hypertensive condition, have opposite effects on the plasma flux through leaky junctions. Regarding the increased

Based on the pore model, total volume flux decomposed into two parts: volume flux through leaky junctions and volume flux through normal junctions. In spite of volume flux through leaky junctions which is a decreasing function of 
                           WSS
                        , volume flux through normal junctions is a rising function of 
                           WSS
                         (since normal and leaky junctions act in parallel). As seen in Fig. 5, variation of volume flux through leaky junctions is dominant and the total volume flux is higher at the regions with low 
                           WSS
                        . However, due to the opposite effects of 
                           WSS
                         on the volume fluxes through the normal and leaky junctions, maximum variation of the total volume flux and also, relative difference between surface averages of the normal and hypertensive conditions are significantly lower than those of the volume flux through leaky junctions. Maximum values of total volume flux are located at the branch points that are only 1.67-fold of the minimum values at the regions with the highest 
                           WSS
                         and also, surface averages of the normal and hypertensive total volume flux are very close to each other with the magnitudes of

LDL flux is sum of the mass flux through the vesicle pores with constant values and mass flux through leaky junctions which is a rising function of the volume flux through leaky junctions. Therefore, with the increase in the volume flux of leaky junctions at the regions with disturbed flow, LDL mass flux enhances from a surface average value of

                         for the hypertensive condition (
                        Fig. 6A).

Distributions of normalized sub-endothelial LDL concentration are shown in Fig. 6B. There are similar patterns for the distributions of the wall side concentrations and volume and mass fluxes through the endothelium layer. Surface average values of normalized concentrations for the normal and hypertensive conditions are 0.130 and 0.050, respectively. Bifurcation and trifurcation points are the main regions with the highest values of LDL concentration. Concentration distributions indicate that for the uniform regions of the coronary tree where the blood flow is generally unidirectional, sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL during the normal condition is higher than the hypertensive condition. However, for the branch points with disturbed flow and maximum values of mass flux, this is reversed and sub-endothelial concentration of LDL during the hypertensive condition is more intense than the normal condition. Accordingly, the branch regions are at the highest risk of atherosclerosis and this risk for the hypertensive condition is more intense than the normal condition.

Disturbed flows create locations with low 
                           WSS
                         that leads to the sub-endothelial aggregation of LDL molecules. In order to investigate the relation between 
                           WSS
                         and sub-endothelial concentrations, these variables were plotted against each other for several computational nodes on the surface of the geometry in 
                        Fig. 7. It is evident that the two variables are highly correlated and regions with elevated levels of LDL concentration correspond to regions of low 
                           WSS
                         and vice-versa. Low 
                           WSS
                         and thus increase in the fraction of leaky cells has two contrary effects on the sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules. Firstly, increased number of leaky junctions leads to the elevated level of total filtration velocity through the arterial wall and therefore, enhances convective removal of LDL molecules. But in contrast, leaky junctions promote LDL mass flux into the wall. However, increased filtration velocity is not enough to overcome mass flux into the wall and LDL molecules accumulate at regions with low 
                           WSS
                         and high fraction of leaky cells.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

LDL molecules dissolved in the plasma are transported in the arterial lumen by the blood flow and in the porous wall by the plasma flow. To enter the wall, these molecules have to cross the endothelium membrane. Hemodynamic forces trigger a series of cellular and molecular processes and regulate selectiveness of the endothelium membrane for macromolecules. In the case of hemodynamic complexities, leaky junctions form which cause LDL molecules to reach the wall and atherosclerosis plaques grow and develop. Various researchers have expressed that areas with low 
                        WSS
                      development, atherosclerosis plaques is more concentrated [3,24,37]. Therefore in the present study, using 
                        WSS
                      as the only effective hemodynamic force in the formation of leaky junctions, simulation of LDL transport through the endothelium layer and wall structure was performed. Bifurcation and trifurcation points are the major regions of disturbed flow with maximum values of sub-endothelial LDL concentration where are introduced as the stenosis prone sites of the coronary tree which is in agreement with the findings presented in previous studies [1,8,14,46]. Simulation results of the employed normal and hypertensive conditions show that sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL for the hypertensive condition at the pre-titled complex regions is higher than those of the normal condition. On the contrary, LDL aggregation during the hypertensive condition for regions of arterial tree with the uniform geometry and unidirectional flow is lower than the normal condition.

In the presence of plasma proteins (fibrinogens and large globulins), red blood cells aggregate at low shear stresses and form 3D structures called Rouleaux which increase viscosity of blood and its non-Newtonian behavior. To investigate this behavior at several values of

                         are shown in 
                        Fig. 8. Due to low shear stresses, maximum values of this factor (higher than 2.0) are located at the bifurcations and trifurcation points that indicate highly non-Newtonian flow of blood at these regions. As non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow for the normal condition is more important than the hypertensive condition, surface average value of blood viscosity during the normal condition (

                           s
                        ) is higher than that of the hypertensive condition (

                        ) which is close to the Newtonian value (

                        ).

In order to better understand non-Newtonian behavior effects, Newtonian flow of blood during the normal and hypertensive conditions was simulated and distributions of 
                           WSS
                         and sub-endothelial concentration of LDL are shown in 
                        Fig. 9. By comparing the results from the Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow simulations, it is clear that Newtonian flow reduces 
                           WSS
                         and leads to further accumulation of LDL molecules. The mean point-to-point absolute differences of 
                           WSS
                         values and normalized concentrations are respectively, 
                           0.10

                           0.04
                           
                           Pa
                         and 0.01 for the hypertensive condition.


                        
                        Fig. 10 compares histograms of 
                           WSS
                         and normalized sub-endothelial concentration between non-Newtonian and Newtonian flows. Newtonian flow enhances percentages of total coronary surface area exposed to low 
                           WSS
                         values and high sub-endothelial concentrations and correspondingly, decreases proportions of high 
                           WSS
                         values and low sub-endothelial concentrations. Unlike the hypertensive condition, considering Newtonian behavior for the blood flow during the normal condition has profound effects on histograms. For the Newtonian flow of blood during the normal condition, percentage of coronary surface area exposed to 
                           WSS
                         values lower than 
                           0.4
                           
                           Pa
                         increases from 41% to 75% and accordingly, proportion of surface areas with normalized concentrations higher than 0.16 increases from 24% to 63%. However during the hypertension, Newtonian flow enhances percentage of coronary tree exposed to 
                           WSS
                         values lower than 
                           0.6
                           
                           Pa
                         from 20% to 28% which leads to only a 7% increase in the proportion of normalized concentrations higher than 0.1 from 10% to 17%. One point to note here is that dissimilar to the hypertensive condition, Newtonian flow of blood during the normal condition causes considerable increase in the percentage of coronary surface area exposed to high values of sub-endothelial concentrations (normalized concentrations higher than 0.25) which shows during the normal condition, Newtonian flow expands areas potential to atherosclerosis, compared to the non-Newtonian flow. This is due to low gradients of non-Newtonian 
                           WSS
                         in the branch regions. Low gradient of 
                           WSS
                         near to the branch locations means low values of 
                           WSS
                         close to the minimum values and thus, neglecting non-Newtonian behavior considerably enhances sub-endothelial concentrations for these low 
                           WSS
                         values that alters prone regions of atherosclerosis. But during the hypertensive condition, because of the flow intensity, there are high values of 
                           WSS
                         close to the minimum values located in the branch points with disturbed flow that ignoring the non-Newtonian behavior has insignificant impacts on the sub-endothelial concentrations.

Surface averages of relative differences between non-Newtonian and Newtonian values of LDL sub-endothelial concentrations are 34% and 13% for the normal and hypertensive conditions, respectively. These results show the degrees of non-Newtonian behavior importance during the normal and hypertensive conditions. Relative differences between non-Newtonian and Newtonian values of sub-endothelial concentrations for 300,000 points throughout the surface of the coronary tree are shown in 
                        Fig. 11. According to this figure, in many data points with 
                           WSS
                         values between 0.10 and 0.85Pa, relative differences for both conditions are higher than 20% which indicates neglecting non-Newtonian behavior at these points would significantly influence the distribution of sub-endothelial concentrations. Computations show that regions with relative differences higher than 20% constitute 87% and 27% of the coronary surface area during the normal and hypertensive conditions, respectively. This analysis highlights the effects of non-Newtonian behavior on the sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules. During the normal condition, non-Newtonian behavior has considerable effects on sub-endothelial concentrations that neglecting this behavior could give rise to a mean relative increase of 34% in the LDL sub-endothelial concentrations. For the hypertensive condition, even though the mean relative difference between the non-Newtonian and the Newtonian sub-endothelial concentrations is relatively small with the magnitude of 13%, for 27% of the coronary tree surface area the relative differences are higher than 20% which imply the non-Newtonian behavior should not be ignored at least at these locations.

Johnston et al. [17] studied blood flow through main trunks of right coronary arteries for different non-Newtonian models. They demonstrated that the model of generalized power law was the most appropriate model for blood non-Newtonian behavior at low shear stresses. Their results indicated that increase in the inlet velocity is associated with increase in shear stresses and the importance of non-Newtonian behavior is reducing; up to center-line velocities of

                        , the importance of non-Newtonian behavior can be ignored (for generalized power law model). However, the present study by evaluating the sub-endothelial concentrations suggests that the non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow through the right coronaries should be considered even at the hypertensive condition with the center-line velocity of 
                           0.130

In the present simulation, through the modeling of endothelium layer, the shear dependent boundary conditions was obtained by the equation proposed by Olgac et al. [31], which relates number of leaky cells to the local

Magnitudes of volume fluxes resulted in the present simulation are higher than values reported by Olgac et al. [30]. For this study, magnitudes of the volume flux through leaky junctions are in the range of

                           mmHg
                        ) are greater than the intraluminal pressure used by Olgac et al. [30] (
                           70

                         for the coronary tree at this study especially at the branch points are lower than the values predicted for the left coronary artery which give rise to higher fractions of leaky cells and volume fluxes for the right coronaries. One of the major differences between the present study and simulation of Olgac et al. [30] is the evaluation of hypertension effects on LDL accumulation. They increased intraluminal pressure from 
                           70
                           
                           mmHg
                           
                        to 
                           120
                           
                           mmHg
                         at a constant inflow rate that accordingly, LDL accumulation and atherosclerosis risk increased throughout the coronary artery. Nevertheless, during the hypertensive condition, in addition to the intraluminal pressures, inflow rate increases too. In this study, increase in pressure, led to the enhancement of inflow rate. Because increase in the luminal pressure and inflow rate have contrary effects in the atherosclerosis risk, results for the evaluated sets of boundary conditions suggest that hypertension reduces atherosclerosis risk at straight segments of arterial tree and only at the branch regions with disturbed flow it increases. It is noteworthy that the present study only investigates a specific hypertensive condition including a 131% higher inflow rate and a 7.2% higher intraluminal pressure relative to the normal condition. Although this study reveals important aspects of hypertensive conditions which should be considered in the evaluation of atherosclerosis risks, various degrees of changes in the flow rates and the intraluminal pressures from normal conditions to hypertensive conditions lead to different effects on the sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules. Therefore, more researches with various sets of boundary conditions are needed to elucidate effects of hypertension on sub-endothelial LDL aggregation.

Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] previously investigated effects of 
                           WSS
                         on sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL in right coronary arteries. However, because they ignored proportion of leaky junction pathways in the plasma flow and LDL transport through the endothelium layer, there are significant differences between the results of the present study and these simulations. Both studies used shear dependent hydraulic conductivities for the endothelium layer that only reflect the effect of 
                           WSS
                         on the flow through normal junctions and led to a rising function of 
                           WSS
                         for the plasma volume flux. However, in this study, in addition to the normal junctions, leaky junctions are also considered responsible for the plasma flow that resulted in a decreasing function of 
                           WSS
                         for the total volume flux through the endothelium layer. Furthermore, because at the present study 90.1% of LDL molecules pass through leaky junctions, predicted values for the LDL mass flux are much more than values calculated by Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] and therefore sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL is more intensified. Reported values of LDL mass flux by Sakellarios et al. [36] for intraluminal pressure of

Major assumptions in this simulation are rigid geometry, hemodynamic boundary conditions and limitations of the pore model. Time varying geometry of the right coronary tree is considered to be rigid. Torii et al. [45] simulated blood flow through a right coronary artery and compared results for a time varying geometry with a static geometry. They demonstrated that 
                           AWSS
                         distributions for both models were similar and the assumption of rigid geometry for right coronary artery is acceptable. A further limitation that influences the results is that inflow and outflow rates and also outlet pressures are not patient-specific. In order to exert more accurate boundary conditions, magnetic resonance imaging (to obtain inflow rates [15]) and lumped parameter models (to obtain outflow boundary conditions [22,27,47]) should be applied. According to various studies, in addition to 
                           WSS
                        , its spatial and temporal gradients influence the performance of the endothelium layer [13,23,32]. However, due to unavailability of sufficient experimental data, in the pore model, fraction of leaky junctions is only a function of

                     Objective: The present study investigates low density lipoprotein (LDL) transport through endothelium layer into arterial wall of an image-based model of a human right coronary tree and aims to predict prone sites of atherosclerosis and evaluate effects of hypertension and non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules


                     Methods: Three dimensional geometry of the right coronary tree consisting of five primary side branches was reconstructed from computed tomography images. Non-Newtonian flow of blood for the normal and hypertensive conditions was simulated by continuity and Navier-Stokes governing equations and employing non-Newtonian model of generalized power law and proportional boundary conditions. Plasma flow and LDL transport within the wall were represented by Darcy׳s law and convection-diffusion-reaction equation, respectively. The endothelium boundary conditions were defined by a three-pore model that takes into account the proportions of normal junctions, vesicle pores and leaky junctions. According to the pore model, most of LDL molecules pass through leaky junctions which arise at locations with low wall shear stress (
                        WSS
                     ).


                     Results: Results show that sub-endothelial concentration of LDL molecules is a highly decreasing function of local 
                        WSS
                      and maximum degrees of LDL accumulation are located at the branch regions where the blood flow is non-uniform and magnitudes of 
                        WSS
                      are low. Comparison between results of the hypertensive condition with the normal condition reveals that for the branch regions with disturbed flow, hypertensive values of sub-endothelial LDL concentration is higher than the normal condition. However, for the rest of regions where the blood flow is unidirectional, this is reversed. Findings also indicate that neglecting non-Newtonian behavior reduces 
                        WSS
                      values and leads to increase in the sub-endothelial concentration of LDL molecules. Surface average values of relative differences between sub-endothelial concentrations of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows are 34% and 13% for the normal and hypertensive conditions, respectively.


                     Conclusion: It is concluded that the branch points with disturbed flow are the major regions of the arterial tree potential to atherosclerosis and this risk for the hypertensive condition is more intense than the normal condition. Furthermore, non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow reduces sub-endothelial concentration of LDL molecules and must not be neglected in simulation of LDL transport in right coronary arteries.

The grid independence study for the computational results of the motion equations in the lumen was performed with four sets of unstructured tetrahedral grids consisting of 1,039,820, 1,795,493, 2,678,115, and 3,147,814 elements. 
                     Fig. 12A compares distributions of 
                        WSS
                      at a cross section in the trifurcation region with complex flow patterns and different values of 
                        WSS
                     . Evaluations showed that the mesh with 2,678,115 grids provides an accurate solution for the local values of 
                        WSS
                      with maximum relative error of 1% compared with the finer mesh. Three sets of unstructured tetrahedral grids with 2,215,863, 3,139,652 and 3,925,990 elements were also analyzed to solve the Darcy׳s law and convection-diffusion-reaction equation within the arterial wall. Fig. 12B shows discrepancies between the distributions of normalized sub-endothelial LDL concentration at the preceding cross section. The mesh with 3,139,652 elements was found to accurately compute the LDL concentration with maximum relative error of 1% compared with the finer mesh.
