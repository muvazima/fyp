                  In the aftermath of a mass-casualty incident, effective policies for timely evaluation and prioritization of patients can mean the difference between life and death. While operations research methods have been used to study the patient prioritization problem, prior research has either proposed decision rules that only apply to very simple cases, or proposed formulating and solving a mathematical program in real time, which may be a barrier to implementation in an urgent situation. We connect these two regimes by proposing a general decision support rule that can handle survival probability functions and an arbitrary number of patient classifications. The proposed survival lookahead policy generalizes not only a myopic policy and a cμ type rule, but also the optimal solution to a version of the problem with two priority classes. This policy has other desirable properties, including index policy structure. Using simple heuristic parameterizations, the survival lookahead policy yields an expected number of survivors that is almost as large as published methods that require mathematical programming, while having the advantage of an intuitive structure and requiring minimal computational support.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A mass-casualty incident (MCI) is an event resulting in a number of injured persons (casualties) that is larger than the number of available emergency-response resources, so that it is not possible to provide immediate treatment to every casualty. In the aftermath of a MCI, responders attempt to provide care to as many of these casualties as effectively as possible. A critical component of any such response effort is mass-casualty triage. Mass-casualty triage consists of two steps: classification and prioritization. In the classification step, casualties are evaluated based on medical criteria and assigned to one of several triage classes. In the prioritization step, responders use intelligence about the type of incident, the number of available resources, and the number of casualties in each triage class, to decide which triage class should receive priority to access the available resources. Resources could include ambulances, hospital beds, doctors and nurses, medical equipment, or medicine. In many MCIs, mass-casualty triage is performed at the site of the incident to determine how to transport the casualties to the hospital(s) participating in the response effort, in which case resources are typically ambulances. Decisions made by responders include the order in which to transport the casualties and the destination hospital for each casualty (when more than one hospital is available).

The goal of mass-casualty triage is to “do the greatest good for the greatest number” (Frykberg, 2005). Towards this goal, medical researchers and operations researchers have studied the problem of patient prioritization in mass-casualty triage, and proposed methods that range widely both in terms of their level of sophistication (such as the ability to account for various operational constraints) and also in terms of their level of operational complexity (such as the technology required to implement them). While simple triage methods involving a small number of patient classes have traditionally been preferred by providers due to their ease of implementation, recent research has suggested that emergency planners may want to evaluate the use of additional triage classes or more sophisticated prioritization policies in order to increase the expected number of survivors.

In this article, we propose a simple yet effective decision support policy called survival lookahead, wherein priority is assigned to the class whose survival probability decreases the most over a class-specific period of time, and we show that this type of policy performs almost as well as much more sophisticated optimization models but is far more practical from an implementation perspective. In order to develop this decision support policy, we first review existing methods for patient prioritization in mass-casualty incidents and identify desirable characteristics of a patient prioritization policy (see Section 2). Using stylized optimization problems that maximize the expected number of survivors, we show that with appropriate tuning, a survival lookahead policy generates priorities that are partially consistent with the optimal solution (see Section 3). Building on these results, we propose heuristic implementations that do not require any sophisticated computational technology (see Section 4). Finally, we conduct numerical experiments comparing the performance of the proposed heuristics to published optimization problems (see Section 5) with an extension to the case where not all casualties have arrived when the initial decision is mode, and we discuss the implications for practice (see Section 6).

Prior work on mass-casualty triage and patient prioritization has involved three main methodologies. Qualitative fixed-priority methods have largely emerged from the medical community, and place a much larger emphasis on patient classification than on optimal prioritization for treatment or transportation. Triage rules based on quantitative methods offer an alternative to fixed-priority methods but without solving a full-fledged optimization problem (Argon, Ziya, & Righter, 2008; Jacobson, Argon, & Ziya, 2012; Mills, Argon, & Ziya, 2013; Mills, Argon, Ziya, Hiestand, & Winslow, 2014). Finally, mathematical programming models to determine an optimal patient prioritization schedule have been published in both the medical and operations literature (Dean and Nair, 2014; Sacco et al., 2005, 2007). We review each of the existing types of models and the benefits and drawbacks of each.

One of the most popular qualitative, fixed-priority methods is START, which stands for Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment. START has been used for mass-casualty triage in the United States since the 1980s. Providers using START assess each casualty using strictly medical criteria and assign one of four triage classes: expectant or black tag for patients who are expected to die regardless of the resources provided to them, immediate or red tag for patients who need treatment most urgently, delayed or yellow tag for patients who have critical conditions but can afford to wait for some length of time, and minor or green tag for patients who do not have any critical condition and would therefore be expected to survive (Lerner et al., 2008). Fig. 1
                         depicts the START classification. Once the casualties are classified, a simple fixed-priority policy is used, with immediate having the first priority, followed by delayed, minor, and expectant.

A recent effort made to update and standardize mass-casualty triage in the medical community resulted in SALT, which stands for Sort, Assess, Lifesaving intervention, and Treatment/transport. SALT emphasizes these four steps to reflect the fact that mass-casualty triage involves more than just assessing the casualties’ conditions. The “assess” phase of SALT is depicted in Fig. 2
                        . One of the major differences compared to START is that qualitative consideration is given both to the availability of resources and to the probability that the patient will survive when deciding whether to tag patients expectant or immediate. In other words, SALT incorporates operational considerations in a qualitative way. However, like START, once the assessment phase is over, SALT also prioritizes patients in a fixed-priority manner, without regard to the number of casualties or number of resources.

Patient prioritization in mass-casualty incidents can be modeled from a queueing perspective as a multi-class clearing system. In such a system, each patient is available at time zero and belongs to a class, with different classes potentially having different rewards, service times, and lifetimes. Glazebrook, Ansell, Dunn, and Lumley (2004) establish the near-optimality of a state independent fixed-priority scheduling policy when lifetimes are exponentially distributed under the limiting case where lifetimes approach infinity. In that case, patients should be prioritized according to an “rμ” rule, where r is the expected reward, μ is the service rate; patients with larger values of rμ should be prioritized. Argon et al. (2008) and Jacobson et al. (2012) model each patient’s lifetime as a random variable whose distribution depends on the class of the patient, with more critical patients having shorter lifetimes in a stochastic sense. If a patient is not served before his or her lifetime, he or she dies, otherwise the patient either definitely survives (Argon et al., 2008) or survives with a class-dependent probability (Jacobson et al., 2012). Argon et al. (2008) show that if the optimal policy is an index policy, it must agree with the “rμ” rule, but that the optimal policy is often more complicated than an index policy. Jacobson et al. (2012) report a threshold policy based on the total number of patients performs well in the case with two classes.


                        Mills et al. (2013) use a fluid model with decreasing survival probability functions to develop the ReSTART rule. ReSTART uses resource availability to determine the relative priority of immediate and delayed patients who are assessed using START, SALT, or another color-tag system, by computing an index τ based on the number of patients in each class, the number of resources, the service rate, and the survival probability functions. When τ takes on values below zero, delayed patients should be prioritized. When τ takes on a sufficiently large value immediate patients should be prioritized. Finally, when τ takes on an intermediate value, immediate patients should be prioritized only for the first τ minutes. In other words, τ can be thought of as a timer that indicates it is time to switch priority from the immediate to the delayed class (see Fig. 3
                        ). While ReSTART provides a simple and intuitive prioritization policy, its main specification is based on the difference between two survival probability functions and so it does not have a natural extension to more than two patient classes.

Methods that formulate a mathematical program offer the greatest level of precision and can incorporate a richer variety of operational constraints, but they also pose the greatest challenges to implementation. Sacco et al. (2005) propose an approach named “Sacco Triage Method (STM)”, which is a combination of patient assessment using a Respiration–Pulse–Motor (RPM) score and patient prioritization using linear programming. An RPM score is determined by rating the casualty on a zero-to-four scale on three dimensions and adding these three numbers together, resulting in 13 possible triage classes corresponding to the integers 0–12. In the linear program, time is discretized and it is assumed that each ambulance can take one patient to the hospital in each time period, while no consideration is given to treatment time. Dean and Nair (2014) propose “Severity Adjusted Victim Evacuation (SAVE)” to incorporate multiple hospitals and different treatment times that depend on the patient’s triage class. SAVE outperforms STM and various fixed-priority policies in this more-realistic scenario (Dean and Nair (2014)). Both STM and SAVE operationalize the goal of mass-casualty triage (to do the greatest good for the greatest number) in terms of the expected number of survivors by modeling patient criticality through declining expected survival probability functions (see Fig. 4
                        ).

The method of Dean and Nair (2014) is attractive because it provides a very general specification that can be adapted to many different situations, and with sufficient data, such functions may be estimated empirically. However, there are some potential drawbacks to an optimization-based approach. In our discussions with emergency planners, managers, and responders, we found that in MCIs, triage often begins (and sometimes ends) before a full incident command can be established. In the absence of a managerial structure, initial responders may be able to implement simple decision rules (such as those that can be presented on a chart or determined with a simple calculation), but they would not have the organizational capability or software support required to solve a mathematical program. Even in a well-organized incident, variations in technology adoption may necessitate using triage priorities that can be calculated offline. In the US, mass-casualty triage is usually carried out by first responders in a local emergency medical services (EMS) system. Because EMS systems are established in local jurisdictions, there is wide regional variability in the amount and type of technology resources available to EMS providers, ranging from complex electronic systems to simple pen-and-paper recordkeeping. Therefore, not every EMS system can realistically expect to implement a solution based on solving an optimization problem in real-time.

A natural research question is whether we can develop decision support policies for patient prioritization that generalize existing decision rules and add additional precision or richness to the problem without solving a mathematical program for each problem instance. Ideally, we would like to have a policy that is intuitive for responders to understand, easy to implement in a chaotic environment without software support, capable of handling an arbitrary number of patient classes, and capable of handling general survival probability functions.

In order to satisfy the first two characteristics, we take an approach that falls mostly in line with the stream of literature reviewed in Section 2.2, namely using a quantitative model to develop a rule or policy that can be used in decision support, and testing the resulting heuristics against an optimization model.

Denote the set of triage classes by C. Each customer in class i ∈ C has expected reward Ri
                     (t) when that customer is taken into service after waiting t ≥ 0 time units, and we can serve patients in class i ∈ C at rate μi
                      per unit time. In the mass-casualty triage problem, rewards are equal to survival probabilities, and thus the expected total reward is equal to the expected number of survivors. We first state an assumption to guarantee that rewards are consistent with the fact that patients deteriorate over time.

                        Assumption 1
                        The expected reward Ri
                           (t) is decreasing in t ≥ 0 for all i ∈ C.

In Sacco et al. (2005), Dean and Nair (2014), and other papers using RPM triage, 
                        
                           C
                           =

                           0

                     . In both of these papers and Mills et al. (2013), it is the case that classes with larger indices bring larger expected rewards at all points in time. We adopt this observed phenomenon as an assumption and state it formally as follows:

In Dean and Nair (2014), patients in classes with smaller indices have a longer service time, while in Sacco et al. (2005) and Mills et al. (2013), all patients have the same service time. We generalize these assumptions here:

                        Assumption 3

                                 ≤
                                 
                                    μ

                                       1
                                    
                                 
                              
                           .


                     Assumption 3 means that casualties belonging to a less-severe class have a shorter expected service time. We note that Assumptions 2 and 3 together imply that μiRi
                     (t) ≤ μjRj
                     (t) for any i < j, meaning that less-severe patients always accrue more reward per unit time in service than more-severe patients.

Given the assumptions defined above, we now discuss two published formulations: one discrete formulation, which is due to Sacco et al. (2005), and one fluid formulation, which is due to Mills et al. (2013). Both of these formulations are highly stylized in the sense that they consider only the decision of which class of patients should be transported, ignoring factors such as bed availability at hospitals, the presence of multiple hospitals, etc. However, both of these formulations incorporate declining survival probability functions. We will show in Section 3.2 that the optimal solution to both of these two formulations have a certain structure, which we later exploit to develop heuristics that can be used for obtaining solutions to the broader patient prioritization problem. STM formulates the patient prioritization problem as a linear program by discretizing the time horizon into k equally-spaced time periods occuring at time points

The objective function maximizes the expected number of survivors (assuming that casualties of class i transported in time period j have survival probability Ri
                        (tj
                        )). The first constraint ensures the number of patients transported in each time period cannot exceed the service rate. The second constraint ensures that all patients are eventually transported (note that it is assumed in STM that patients are stabilized and do not die before transportation begins). Because the constraint matrix is totally unimodular—in fact, (1) is a minimum cost flow problem over a network—an integer solution is guaranteed.

We can approximate the reward earned in the clearing system by a fluid model, where patients are served continuously, as in the model used for ReSTART. The fluid model approximates discrete patients as a continuous quantity of fluid, which makes analysis more tractable (because a partial customer may be served without worrying about preemption, and treatment times need not correspond to an integral number of time periods) without sacrificing the basic structure of the problem. Therefore, when the system prioritizes class i ∈ C patients at time t ≥ 0, the system earns reward at the rate of μiRi
                        (t) per unit time. By letting c(t) denote the decision variable for which class is in service at time t, we formulate the fluid maximization problem as

                         which is to say, there exists an optimal solution to (2) where patients of class i receive service during a set of non-overlapping time intervals. Formulation (2) is similar to the formulation used by Mills et al. (2013) but allows for different service rates by patient class.

Before moving on, we note that both the discrete formulation (1) and the fluid formulation (2) approximate the real world in different ways: the discrete formulation assumes that treatment/transportation occurs in a single time period and that the reward depends only on the point in time when the patient is transported, while the fluid formulation assumes that treatment/transportation occurs continuously and the reward is averaged over the time interval in which the class of patients is served. Because we can discretize time into arbitrarily small increments, the fluid formulation (2) can be seen as a limiting case of the discrete formulation (1), but where transportation is allowed to take more than one time period.

In our analysis, we begin by making an observation about the structure of the optimal solution to a special case of the fluid model (2) with two classes (see Section 3.2). Then, we analyze the solution to the discrete formulation (1) (see Section 3.3). The analytical results for both models motivate the heuristics we develop in Section 4.

                        where Δ
                        1 is the length of time needed to serve all class 1 patients. One can interpret (3) as saying that priority should be given to class 1 when it has “the most to lose” over a certain time interval, in this case, the length of time it would take to serve all the class 1 patients. This decision rule depends explicitly on the reward functions and implicitly on the number of class 1 patients, their service rate, and the number of servers (through Δ
                        1). Under Assumption 3, the result of Mills et al. (2013) extends naturally to the case with unequal service rates as follows.

The above result leads us to consider a way to generalize such a rule to more triage classes. The type of decision rule observed in Proposition 1 belongs to a class of decision rules that we call survival lookahead policies.

                           A survival lookahead policy is a policy that gives priority at time t ≥ 0 to the class i ∈ C with the largest index

                               (among those classes with non-zero number of patients at time t), where τi
                              (t) ≥ t is a point in time in the future relative to t (i.e., when to “look ahead” at the survival probability).

                           Constant SL policy


                           A survival lookahead policy is constant if there exists constant σi

A survival lookahead policy is shifted if there exists constant ζi

                                    =

                                    +
                                    
                                       ζ

                               for all t ≥ 0.

In other words, a survival lookahead policy is constant if it always looks ahead to the same point in time σi
                         for class i regardless of the current time t. On the other hand, a SL policy is shifted if it always looks the same amount of time ζi
                         ahead into the future for class i regardless of the current time t. By examining the definitions above, we see that any given SL policy may be constant, shifted, or neither.

We now give a partial characterization of the optimal solution to the discrete model (1), which lends further support to the idea that SL policies may be a good heuristic for patient prioritization.

A proof is given in the Appendix. Proposition 2 states that there exists an optimal solution where the relationship between classes i and j takes one of three forms: (i) low index priority, i.e., class i finishes service at or before the time when class j begins, (ii) high index priority, i.e., class j finishes service at or before the time class i begins, or (iii) high-interrupts-low, where j begins service at or after when i begins, but ends at or before when i ends.

A proof is given in the Appendix. Note that Proposition 3 suggests that there is a constant SL policy that is partially consistent with the optimal solution to (1), in the sense that for any two classes, in the optimal solution the class with smaller index either always has priority over the class with the larger index or it has priority over the class with the larger index only if it has priority in the constant SL policy. Because the proposition is unidirectional (“only if” rather than “if and only if”), this leaves open the possibility that the constant SL policy may give priority to the class with the larger index in some time points where the optimal policy gives priority to the class with the smaller index. In other words, the given constant SL policy may prioritize classes with larger indices more aggressively than the optimal policy.

                           Remark
                           Because time could be discretized into arbitrarily small increments in (1) (in which case, the solution to the discrete formulation approaches the solution to the fluid formulation), the structure proved in Proposition 3 would also hold for the fluid formulation (2) for the special case where all service rates are equal, i.e.,

                                    =
                                    μ
                                 
                               for all c ∈ C.


                        Propositions 1 and 3 both indicate that under certain conditions, the optimal solution to formulations (1) and (2) are similar to an SL policy. This observation suggests that using some SL policy should be a reasonable heuristic for solving the patient prioritization problem. Unfortunately, neither proposition gives us a way to determine which SL policy to use, without already knowing the optimal solution. Therefore, while we have reason to believe a SL policy should work well, we need heuristics to determine how to translate a problem instance to an implementable SL policy. In both Propositions 1 and 3, the constant SL policy looks ahead to the last point in time when patients of a given class are served. Given this observation, in the next section, we use this intuition to develop heuristics to approximate the last point in time at which patients of a given class will be served.

In this section, we construct four heuristics using the SL policy framework. Two of the heuristics are based on simple limiting cases of the SL policies (see Section 4.1). The other two heuristics are more sophisticated in the sense that they incorporate information about the number of patients in each class to approximate the constant SL policy of Proposition 3 (see Section 4.2).

It is natural to consider two possible limiting cases for the SL policies. The first limiting case is the limit of the constant SL policy where σi
                         → ∞ for all i ∈ C. That is, the policy compares the survival probability now to the survival probability arbitrarily far in the future and selects the class with the largest difference. When the time-limiting survival probability for all injured casualties is zero, this policy amounts to simply selecting the class i at time t that has the largest value of μiRi
                        (t). From here on, we label this policy myopic.

The second limiting case is the limit of the shifted SL policy with ζi
                         → 0 for all i. That is, we consider the change in (service-rate-weighted) survival probability over an infinitesimally small amount of time, or in other words, the derivative of the survival probability. This policy amounts to selecting the class at time t with largest 
                           
                              −
                              
                                 R
                                 i
                                 ′
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 t
                                 )
                              
                              
                                 μ
                                 i
                              
                           
                        . This policy is very similar to the generalized cμ rule (van Mieghem, 1995), so we label this policy G–Rμ.

While the existence of a constant SL policy that is partially consistent with the optimal solution suggests that constant SL policies may be good heuristics in the patient prioritization problem, constructing the constant SL policy in Proposition 3 requires knowing the time that the last patients in each class are transported in the optimal solution. While we obviously cannot know this time exactly, we do know how long it will take to transport all the patients in a given class, and from Proposition 2, we know which other class(es) may preempt patients of a given class. Specifically, at any time t, without knowing the optimal solution, we at least know that the elapsed time until the last patient in class i ∈ C is transported will be at least the amount of time to transport all remaining patients in class i and at most the amount of time to transport all remaining patients in class i and all other classes that may preempt class i. This principle forms the basis of the following two shifted SL policies, which bound the constant SL policy given in Proposition 3.

                        Heuristic 2 chooses the class whose survival probability function will deteriorate most over the length of time that would be required to serve all patients of that same class, plus all patients of all other classes that could preempt the service of class i patients, according to the third case of Proposition 2. In this case, 
                           
                              t

                         is an upper bound for the last point in time when class i would be served in an optimal solution, because not all such classes actually will interrupt class i (i.e., there may be classes j ∈ C: j > i for which the first case of Proposition 2 applies).

We can also apply the class of SL policies to the case of patient transportation to multiple hospitals. Let H be the set of available hospitals and for any class c ∈ C and hospital h ∈ H, and let μ
                        
                           c, h
                         be the service rate if the available resources are used to take class-c patients to hospital h. For example, if there are a ambulances traveling at rate r and the round-trip distance to hospital h ∈ H is dh
                        , then 
                           
                              
                                 μ

                                    ,
                                    h

                              r
                              /

For the myopic and G–Rμ heuristics, no further modification is needed since these heuristics use only μ and Ri

We use these modifications in the results where we compare the performance of the SL policies to SAVE, which considers multiple destination hospitals (see Section 5.2). Specifically, to determine the optimal solution, a formulation generally needs to make two decisions (which class of patients to transport and to which hospital) at the same time. We separate these decisions as follows to keep the policy simple to implement and understand:

                                    (t) computed according to the heuristic in use (myopic, G–Rμ, Heuristic 1, or Heuristic 2).

For the selected class, send patients to the closest hospital with available beds for that class of patients.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to test the performance of the survival lookahead policies on data sets that have been published in the literature. Because the class of SL policies generalizes the type of optimal policy used for the two-class prioritization policy in ReSTART to the case with multiple patient classes and multiple hospitals, we test their performance against the STM and SAVE models, which incorporate a general number of triage classes and more general operational constraint structure. In Section 5.3, we conduct an additional experiment comparing the heuristics with SAVE in the case where some patients arrive after 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        
                      (which was not considered in any of the prior models cited in Section 2).

In order to understand how the survival lookahead policies would compare to the mathematical programming approach of STM, we considered the experimental setup of Sacco et al. (2005). As we mentioned in Section 2.2, STM uses 13 triage classes based on patient RPM scores. Survival probabilities associated with blunt trauma for each RPM score are shown in Fig. 4. All survival probability functions shown satisfy Assumption 1, and with a small number of exceptions, pairs of functions satisfy Assumption 4. STM assumes a single hospital and all classes have a common service time.

We first implemented the STM model using SAS/OR 13.1, and we ran the model using the four patient distributions shown in Table 1
                         and the high, medium, and low resource availabilities shown in Table 2
                        , which were used in Sacco et al. (2005). For illustrative purposes, we added a fourth “very low” resource availability that was not considered in Sacco et al. (2005). Our results were very close to those presented in Table 6 of Sacco et al. (2005), with slight differences likely attributable to rounding during manuscript preparation.

We implemented a simple iterative algorithm in Matlab 2014a to test our proposed heuristics. In each time period, the algorithm examines the reward functions to determine the survival lookahead policy index for each patient class according to the heuristic in use. Heuristic 1 looks ahead only the amount of time needed to transport all patients of the same class, while Heuristic 2 looks ahead the amount of time needed to transport all patients of the same class or classes with larger survival probability. The class with the largest SL policy index receives priority for available transportation resources. If any unused resources remain after transporting all patients of the top priority class, the class with the next-highest index is transported. We also implemented the G–Rμ and Myopic policies for comparison purposes.

The results of the experiment are shown in Table 3
                        , in which we calculate the expected number of survivors under each policy as a percentage of the expected number of survivors generated by solving the STM model. Over all scenarios considered, Heuristics 1 and 2 are within 6 percent of the STM solution, and in many cases, these heuristics yield the same solution as STM. G–Rμ also performs very well in most cases, although its performance degrades somewhat in the very low resource availability case (we included this level of resource availability to demonstrate that the G–Rμ policy is not always the best). The myopic policy performs notably more poorly, with some instances returning less than 80 percent of the expected number of survivors of STM.

We now compare the four heuristics to the SAVE model. Before testing the survival lookahead policies against the SAVE model, we implemented the SAVE model in SAS/OR 13.1 (see online Supplementary material). We then implemented a simple iterative algorithm in Matlab 2014a to test the performance of the survival lookahead policies on the same instances (see online Supplementary material). Since bed capacity was an issue, in each time period, we scheduled patients from the class with the largest SL policy index for which beds were available.


                        Dean and Nair (2014) developed a comprehensive numerical study to test the SAVE model with 384 instances, each consisting of 130 patients and 2 hospitals. Varied factors were the initial number of ambulances (5, 10, 15, and 20), distribution of patient RPM scores (Uniform, Left Skewed, and Right Skewed), capacity at the local hospital for each RPM score (2, 4, 6, and 8), capacity at the remote hospital for each RPM score (2, 4, 6, and 8), and travel time to the remote hospital (8 and 20 minutes), while travel time to the local hospital was held constant at 5 minutes.

We used our implementation of the SAVE model in SAS/OR 13.1 to solve the same 384 mixed integer linear program problem instances, and our iterative algorithm coded in Matlab 2014a to test the performance of the survival lookahead policies on the same 384 instances. In all tests, we used the same care times as in SAVE. Results from this numerical study are shown in Table 4
                        , which displays the average percent of the optimal MILP solution returned by each heuristic. The major differentiation between heuristics can be seen as the number of ambulances and the patient severity distribution vary. In particular, although the myopic policy performed poorly overall, it performed worse with the right skewed distribution (when there were more severe patients), suggesting it was over-prioritizing less severe patients (since it considers only the current survival probability, not the future decline in survival probability. Heuristic 2 and G–Rμ performed better as the number of ambulances increased. This result makes sense for Heuristic 2, because as the number of ambulances increased, the upper bound on transportation time approached the actual end of transportation, and this result makes sense for G–Rμ in the sense that with more transportation resources, the total transportation time decreases. Heuristic 1 had overall the strongest performance, returning on average 97–99 percent of the objective value of the optimal MILP solution. Dean and Nair (2014) compare SAVE to “low-score first” and “high-score first” with different hospital assignment policies, and report approximately 10–120 percent improvement in the number of survivors using SAVE as compared to the various heuristics. In contrast, Heuristic 1 returns on average 98 percent of the number of survivors as SAVE, but without solving an optimization problem. Heuristic 1 simply examines the survival probability functions and chooses the class with the most to lose over a defined period of time, namely the amount of time it would take to transport all patients of that class.

The different heuristics have different strengths—see Table 5
                        , which shows the parameter values for which each heuristic performs best. While all heuristics seem to perform best when there are many ambulances (i.e., transportation resources are abundant), Heuristics 1 and 2 both perform best relative to the optimal solution when capacity is restricted at the local hospital but not at the remote hospital and travel times are unbalanced, while G–Rμ performs best in the reverse case, when capacity is abundant at the local hospital and restricted at the remote hospital, but travel times are similar, which intuitively seems like an “easier” instance since the local hospital can be more freely chosen. Finally, the myopic policy performs best when hospital resources are severely limited—in such a case, because most patients will wait very long to be transported, it is best to first transport those who have the best chance of survival, which is exactly what the myopic policy does.
                     

Although the results in Tables 4 and 5 are extremely promising, averaging over even a small number of instances (as we did in Table 4) can obscure robustness issues: practitioners considering implementing a heuristic policy should be confident that it will perform reasonably well in a wide variety of situations. We found that the myopic heuristic returned less than 90 percent of the optimal objective value in 68 of 384 instances, while Heuristic 2 did so in only 14 instances, the G–Rμ heuristic did so in 12 instances, and Heuristic 1 never returned less than 90 percent of the optimal objective value. We further analyzed the worst instance under each heuristic and found that all heuristics performed worse when there were 5 ambulances, left skewed patient distribution (i.e., fewer severely injured patients), low local capacity (2 or 4), high remote capacity (8), and long remote travel time (20 minutes). It is not surprising that such instances pose a difficult challenge because resources are limited. It is somewhat interesting that the left skewed distribution (where patients are not as severe) resulted in the worst performance, but this is consistent with our discussion following Proposition 3, where we discuss the fact that SL policies may prioritize less severe patients more aggressively than the optimal solution. In this problem instance, there was a marked difference in performance, with Heuristic 1 returning 92 percent of the optimal objective, Heuristic 2 returning 88 percent, G–Rμ returning just 72 percent, and myopic returning 89 percent. The performance of G–Rμ is particularly poor and suggests it is not as robust as Heuristics 1 and 2, even though it had reasonably good average performance in Table 4.

One of the benefits of using a heuristic policy, especially an index policy like the proposed heuristics, is the ability to rapidly re-assess the prioritization policy when the situation changes. Specifically, in mass-casualty incidents, it is sometimes the case that not all patients are present at the time the initial prioritization decisions are made.

In order to test the performance of the heuristics in the case where some patients arrive after the initial decision is made, we replicated the same 384 instances studied in Section 5.2, but with half of the patients arriving at 
                           
                              t

                              30
                           
                         minutes. In running both the SAVE model and the heuristics, all decisions from 
                           
                              t

                              0
                           
                         to 
                           
                              t
                              =

                         were made in accordance with the solution to the problem instance with only the original patients; that is, neither the SAVE model nor the heuristic policies were able to “anticipate” the arrival of the remaining patients at time 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              30
                           
                        . At

                              30
                              ,
                           
                         we updated the patient distribution and re-solved. From that time forward, prioritization was made with respect to the new solution. The results are shown in Table 6 (cf. Table 4, which displays the same results for the case where all patients were available at time 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ). We see that Heuristics 1 and 2 are again quite effective, nearly matching the solution to the SAVE model, and they are more robust to number of ambulances and patient distribution than the G–Rμ rule or the Myopic heuristic. It is important to note that because we solve SAVE in a non-anticipatory manner, for some instances the heuristic solution may outperform the SAVE solution, unlike in the setting of Section 5.2.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In Section 2, we noted that prior OR approaches have been quite disparate: some methods, such as START and ReSTART, propose simple, easy-to-understand decision rules, but are limited by the lack of a dynamic prioritization policy (START) or a small number of triage classes with the same service time (two in the case of ReSTART), or other similarly restrictive assumptions; other methods, such as STM and SAVE, propose more precise, realistic models but require formulating and solving a mathematical program, which is unrealistic in the chaotic aftermath of a mass-casualty incident, where every minute is important and providers typically lack the type of computational support or knowledge of mathematical programming to make such a solution viable.

Our proposed decision support rule, namely the survival lookahead policy, generalizes the two-class solution of ReSTART and adds additional richness such as multiple hospitals, and has analytical properties that are at least partially consistent with the optimal solution of the LP used by STM (as shown in Proposition 3). Survival lookahead is an index policy, which is to say, each class has an easy-to-compute index (namely, the decrease in survival probability over a specified period of time, weighted by service rate), and the decision rule is to prioritize the class with the largest index. Index policies are ideal for providing decision support, i.e., for informing providers’ decisions, rather than replacing them.

Within the class of decision rules, we proposed four different heuristics, and showed that all four performed reasonably well compared with the optimal solution to the more-complicated STM and SAVE models. In particular, Heuristic 1, which provides a lower bound on the amount of time to look ahead, performs exceptionally well, returning on average 98 percent of the optimal solution to SAVE. This performance is impressive considering the fact that SAVE is a mixed integer linear programming model with thousands of variables and constraints. If for some reason, implementing Heuristic 1 is not possible (for example, if responders perceive that it is difficult to estimate ζi
                        ), responders could still use the generalized Rμ rule, which is to prioritize whichever class has the fastest-decreasing survival probability function at each instant, weighted by service time. This rule also performed well overall in the numerical experiments, but was not as robust as Heuristics 1 and 2, and it exhibited poorer performance when resources were severely constrained. Therefore, we recommend the generalized Rμ rule particularly for cases when resources are more abundant, where it did not perform notably worse than Heuristics 1 and 2. Finally, the Myopic heuristic (which under Assumption 2, that classes with larger indices have larger rewards, is equivalent to choosing the highest index first) is by far the simplest heuristic to implement, although it does not perform nearly as well as the other three heuristics, because it does not consider the rate at which survival probabilities decline.

It is important to note that while the heuristics provide an overall expected number of survivors that is quite similar to the globally optimal solution (from the SAVE model), the structure of the heuristically determined solution does not in general qualitatively match the structure of the solution from SAVE, due to the complexity of global optimization.

While implementing any of the proposed heuristics does not require solving an optimization problem, it is necessary to compute an index for each triage class in order to prioritize the class with the largest index. For Heuristics 1 and 2, in addition to requiring information about the number of casualties and service rate (which should be relatively easy to obtain), providers need a quick way to estimate the decrease in the survival probability function Ri
                        (t) for each class. There are several ways this information could be made available and used, for instance in a set of tables. One easy way to facilitate the necessary computation is via a nomograph. A nomograph is a two-dimensional plot containing several scales, which is used to facilitate arithmetic operations by connecting two or more points on the plot. By appropriately marking the scales, increasing or decreasing functions can be incorporated on the nomograph. Fig. 5
                         shows example blank and completed nomographs that can be used to perform the calculations for Heuristic 1 and 2.

To use the nomograph, the user draws a line from the current time t in minutes (on the top scale) to the lookahead time

By appropriate re-scaling of the top and bottom axes, a nomograph can be printed for any decreasing function Ri

                               minutes, there are 8 patients with RPM 8 and 21 patients with RPM 10 remaining at the scene. RPM 8 patients can be taken to one hospital at a rate of 6 per hour (meaning they would complete transportation at time

                              ) and RPM 10 patients can be taken to another hospital at a rate of 8 per hour (meaning they would complete transportation by time 
                                 
                                    t

                              ). The user connects the dots on the nomographs to determine that the RPM 8 patients have priority level “3” while the RPM 10 patients have priority level “9”. This means that the RPM 10 patients have a survival lookahead index three times as large as the RPM 8 patients, so they should be prioritized.

The label of the bottom axis (“time transport will be complete–this class”) corresponds to the interpretation of the lookahead time used in Heuristic 1, but the nomograph itself could also be used for any SL policy.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the aftermath of a mass-casualty incident, responders need to rapidly evaluate, prioritize, and distribute patients to hospitals. Mathematical formulations of the patient prioritization problem can lead to a substantial increase in the expected number of survivors compared to simple fixed priority policies like START. However, uptake of such solution methodology by EMS systems is slow at best. Two barriers to implementing an optimization-driven triage system are lack of technological capability and organizational inertia. Solving an optimization problem and implementing its solution requires access to computational technology as well as practice and experience using it. EMS managers face many competing demands on their time and budget, and therefore may be resistant to changing triage systems due to the cost and time associated with training. Because EMS systems in the United States are organized at the local level, there is a large amount of variability in the willingness and ability of EMS systems to adopt new triage methodology. Providing solutions that are relatively simple, yet improve upon widely used triage systems such as START, is a first step in convincing EMS systems to innovate in the area of mass-casualty triage.

Our analysis shows that much of the value that could be obtained from using precise mathematical programming models to determine patient prioritization can be achieved without as much computational effort, using the survival lookahead decision support rule, which prioritizes patients who will deteriorate the most over a predefined period of time. This type of rule is intuitive and easy to understand, and can be readily implemented even during the aftermath of a mass-casualty incident when resources are limited and time is of the essence. As such, it might serve as a stepping stone for EMS systems wishing to improve their triage capability without investing in the technological or organizational capability to use an optimization model.

One implementation challenge that the survival lookahead heuristic shares with STM and SAVE is estimation of survival probability functions. The results in this paper are based on patients with blunt trauma who have been prioritized using the RPM method, and the heuristics may perform differently in different settings. Existing work on this subject for patients with traumatic injuries is sparse. Although Sacco et al. (2005, 2007) have proposed estimation via the Delphi method and Mills et al. (2013) have proposed a curve-fitting model, substantial additional data collection and research is needed to verify these approaches and estimate survival probability curves for more specific types of incidents.

Other challenges in triage are not limited to any particular triage methodology. Gathering the necessary information and implementing a particular solution to a problem instance requires good coordination among first responders, their managers, and other autonomous healthcare entities (such as hospitals). Moreover, triage guidelines are decision support, and providers need to know when to use their clinical gestalt to override the suggested policy. These issues will continue to present challenges for researchers and practitioners in understanding how to do the greatest good in a mass-casualty incident with limited resources, and should be avenues for future research.

We show the result by constructing policy π from a given optimal solution x satisfying Proposition 2. For c ∈ C, define uc
                            to be the first time point in which class c is served in the optimal solution x and define vc
                            to be the last time point in which class c is served in the optimal solution x.

Now, define

                                    c
                                 
                                 =

                            for all c ∈ C. Suppose that for fixed classes i, j ∈ C with i < j neither (a) nor (b) holds. Then there exists a time in which class j is prioritized over class i under π but not in the optimal solution. Let w denote the earliest such time this occurs. At time w, we must have class i patients in service in the optimal solution, and some class j patients remain (not in service) in the optimal solution. It must be the case that ui
                            ≤ w < vj
                           , because of which, by Proposition 2, we must have ui
