@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The behavior and evolutionary properties of metabolic pathways have been studied for a long time using architectural and network-based methods [1]. Among various research attempts undertaken in network-based studies, an essential one is based on identifying meaningful patterns within metabolic pathways. It aims at identifying essential regions within metabolic pathways and is useful for studying evolution. Furthermore, it also identifies functionally important metabolites that help in determining alternate paths in metabolic pathways [2,3]. This also help in identifying analogous pathways that exist in different species and provide a key step in discerning essential properties of evolution in terms of interactions among metabolic pathways [4]. To analyze the importance of interactions among metabolic pathways in evolution, we have selected certain metabolic pathways involved in the prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D).


                     Diabetes Mellitus (DM), one of the most prevalent diseases in India, is mostly due to the food habit and lifestyle. We have implemented our proposed algorithm on certain metabolic pathways involved in the emergence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D). It is a disorder characterized by high blood sugar, resulting in improper production of insulin. It results in failure and dysfunction of multiple organs. Moreover, till date around 250 genes have been studied for analyzing their role with T1D, one of which is anti-Glutaric acid decarboxylase (GAD) that leads to autoimmune processes for β-cell destruction [5]. Similarly, the insulin gene (INS) is the second well established susceptibility locus in Diabetes Mellitus, contributing to about 10% towards T1D susceptibility [6]. We have considered four metabolic pathways which have shown role in the expression of GAD and INS genes, namely, glutamate, β-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine and butanoate metabolisms, for the purpose of studying their development from an evolutionary point-of-view. This study is very critical, as analyzing the growth history and lineage of these metabolic pathways can lead to understanding the circumstances and role which might be responsible for a diseased state.

The major hypotheses proposed till date regarding metabolic pathway evolution are based on gene duplication events. One of the earliest attempts in this regard has been the ‘Retrograde’ hypothesis, which suggested that the biosynthesis of metabolites requires sequential activities and sub-step conversions of precursors [7]. Alternatively, the ‘Granick’ hypothesis suggested that biosynthesis of metabolites are results of forward evolution from simple precursor compounds [8]. Likewise, the ‘Patchwork’ hypothesis suggested that metabolic pathways have evolved through the reactions of certain primitive enzymes with a variable number of chemically related metabolites, followed by duplication events, resulting in metabolite diversification [9]. Similarly, the ‘micro-evolution’ theory states that certain divergent features are significant among growing entities in metabolic pathways [10]. Lastly, the ‘Semienzymatic’ origin of metabolic pathways suggested that certain prebiotic stable metabolites, mediated by specific and non-specific enzymes resulted in their evolution.

Our proposed algorithm has three modules, first, ‘pattern finding’ identifying patterns in metabolic pathways based on structural and functional features. We have used Hamming distance, the Tanimoto coefficient and Community structures for detecting meaningful patterns [11] (discussed in ‘Methodology’ section). The second module, i.e., ‘interaction identification’ identifies interactions based on the patterns [12], wherein interaction is ‘the effect that is conferred upon one biological moiety to another׳. Fig. 1
                      illustrates interactions occurring within carbohydrate metabolism in H. sapiens at levels of representations [13]. We use cut-sets and a ‘Divide-and-conquer’ strategy for studying interactions [14]. For example, in Fig. 2
                     , butanoate metabolism is partitioned into S1 and S2 by removing a link between acetoacetyl CoA and (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl CoA. The third module, i.e., ‘growth detection’ identifies growth using the patterns, their interactions and certain perturbations, for which we have associated weights to metabolites and reaction links (butanoate metabolism in Fig. 3
                     ). But, analyzing metabolic pathways on the basis of architectural features only may not facilitate functional significance. For this purpose, we have identified cycles and Hasse 
                     [15] (qualitative), ODEs for identifying Stoichiometric 
                     [16], Gradient 
                     [17], Jacobian 
                     [18] and payoff matrices [19] (quantitative); and ‘bi-directional best hit criterion’ and nutrient availability (functional) features respectively. For evolutionary studies, we have studied scale-free properties [20] (discussed in ‘Methodology’ section) (Fig. 4
                     ), wherein the evolutionary growth resides on novel link attachment in existing metabolic network, as per the ‘micro-evolution’ theory. We term this evolutionary process as ‘divergent root-to-leaf’ growth model (discussed in detail in ‘Methodology’ section).

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

In this section we describe the proposed methodology. We have integrated the pathway related information from 36 public repositories. We initiate with this integration followed by describing the proposed methodology.

We have performed this integration step, since none of the repositories have complete information about the metabolic pathways and suffers from redundancy too. We observed that in case of glutamate metabolic pathway, the highest number of links (12) is predicted by KEGG, followed by Gold.db (11), HumanCyc (11), HMDB (11), INOH (11), Kappa-View4 (11), KOBAS (11), MetaCyc (11), MANET (11), PathCase (11) and Pathguide (11). Likewise, the repositories predicting lowest number of links (1) are Ambion Pathway Atlas, BioCarta, BioCyc, BioSilico, Caleydo, CellML, ChemProt, MSEA, Pathway Commons, Reactome and TRMP.

In case of β-alanine metabolic pathway, the highest number of links (16) is predicted by BMBP and KEGG, followed by Brenda (15), Pathguide (15) and David (11), whereas the lowest number of links is predicted by PMAP (1), CellML (2), E-Cell (2), Gold.db (2), Modomics (2), PathExpress (2) and Peroxisome DB (2). Similarly, in taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathway, the highest number of links is predicted by Brenda (6), Gold.db (6), HumanCyc (6), HMDB (6), INOH (6), Kappa-View4 (6), KEGG (6), MetaCyc (6), MANET (6), PathCase (6), Pathguide (6) and SMPDB (6), whereas the lowest number of links (1) is predicted by E-Cell and PMAP. Lastly, in butanoate metabolic pathway, the highest number of links (15) is predicted by Gold.db, INOH and KEGG, whereas the lowest number of links (2) is predicted by Bionemo and ChemProt.

Moreover, all these repositories are different from one another in terms of the information that is stored, offered, visualized and maintained in them. Thus, in addition to quality, there exists a problem of lacking specific biological or experimental facts listed in the repositories [21]. Thus, for providing the most correct input, we chose to integrate and construct the above four metabolic pathways. The constructed metabolic pathways are given in Fig. 5
                        . Moreover, since our algorithm accepts SBML file format as input, we have constructed the SBML format of all the four constructed metabolic pathways using XML Editor [22]. As discussed in the ‘Introduction’ section, our algorithm consists of three modules, namely, pattern finding, interaction identification and growth detection (Fig. 6
                        ).

This module deals with identifying patterns from metabolic pathways based on commonly occurring functionally related sequence of metabolites. The community structure-based approach detecting patterns provides information about how metabolic pathways are different topologically. Certain approaches for community finding are already existent which includes minimum-cut method, hierarchical clustering and modularity maximization [8]. Here, we have used Hamming distance as a basis to identify and group community structures.

We describe our algorithm taking into consideration butanoate metabolism in Homo sapiens. This module (finding patterns) has nine sub-steps, namely, building adjacency matrix, Hamming distance calculation, community structure identification, pattern identification, cycle detection, ODE conversion, stoichiometric matrix buildup, Jacobian matrix buildup and eigenvalue calculation. The first sub-step is creating an adjacency matrix between all metabolites involved within the pathway with a ‘1’ placed in the matrix if a reaction occurs between the corresponding metabolites. The second sub-step calculates the Hamming distance, where for two rows in the adjacency matrix, it is ‘the number of positions where values (1 or 0) are different’ [23]. For instance, if the two rows are 1101001 and 1001011, then Hamming distance is 2. The third sub-step deals with grouping metabolites into community structures using similar Hamming distance values [24] (Pseudocode 1). For example, metabolite pairs having Hamming distance 3 are grouped into one community structure. The fourth sub-step module identifies patterns for metabolites which are already grouped based on community structures.

Each pattern consists of two segments, first, the longest branch and second, the sub-branches [25]. The longest branch consists of 1st line of each pattern, followed by other sub-branches denoted with prefix ‘~’. The character ‘– –’ is used to represent whether there is a direct connectivity among neighboring metabolites. For instance, in butanoate metabolism the patterns found for Hamming distance 4 are [butanoyl coA]–[crotonoyl coA]–[S-3-hydroxybutanyl coA], suggesting that there are direct links occurring between butanoyl coA and crotonoyl coA as well as crotonoyl coA and S-3-hydroxybutanyl coA (Table 1
                        ).

The patterns so identified are further validated by identification of cycles (fifth sub-step). For every visited metabolite M(usedindex), if there is an adjacent metabolite M(unusedindex) such that M(unusedindex) is already visited and M(unusedindex) is not predecessor of M(usedindex), then a cycle cy is existent in pattern pat. If such an adjacent M(unusedindex) is non-existent for any metabolite, a cycle does not exist (Pseudocode 2). For example, we identified two cycles in butanoate metabolism, namely, acetoacetyl CoA–acetoacetate–(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (cycle 1) and acetoacetyl CoA–acetoacetate–acetyl CoA–(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (cycle 2) respectively (Fig. 7
                        ) [26].

The seventh sub-step is calculating the stoichiometric matrix for the corresponding cycles and ODEs. We first identify the stoichiometric matrix for the complete metabolic pathways and use them as reference maps for validation. For instance, in butanoate metabolism, the stoichiometric matrix (SM) for the corresponding cycles (1 and 2) as well as ODEs are represented in Tables 2 and 3

The ninth sub-step identifies eigenvalues from JM using Newton׳s finite difference method. Considering a synthetic system,

                        , where Func=0 is a function of a variable x (in steady state), we implement Newton׳s method by initial approximation of x
                        0 for obtaining a solution. Thus, we solve the expression

The second module identifies interactions using Hasse diagrams and cut-sets. Hasse diagrams identify smaller reaction sets from metabolic pathways and provide a hierarchical view with smaller sets at the bottom (Fig. 8
                        ). Likewise, cut-set detection initiates with calculating the degree of metabolites, followed by assigning weights (w) to all reaction links (Pseudocode 3).

This is followed by applying the ‘Divide-and-conquer’ (DC) method for back-validating the cuts and group metabolites based on similarity features using HD and TC 
                        [39] (Pseudocode 4). We first create an ‘incidence matrix’ (IM) for detecting metabolite similarities (Tables 7a–d and 8 in Supplementary Information). For instance, in case of butanoate metabolism HD is found to be 1 for all, whereas TC is found for (acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA)=0.79, (l
                        -glutamate, 4-butanoate)=0.52. Next, we we find ‘Strong’ links (+1), those which are most essential for GAD and INS genes functionality, and ‘weak’ links (−1), those which are of lesser importance as compared to strong links. For butanoate metabolism considering acetyl-CoA as ‘basis node’ creates a weak links with acetoacetyl CoA, 
                        l
                        -glutamate and 4-butanoate. Similarly, considering acetoacetyl CoA as ‘basis node’ creates a weak links with all, whereas for l
                        -glutamate to be considered as ‘basis node’ creates strong link with 4-butanoate (Fig. 10 in Supplementary Information). The metabolite groups are, namely, Group1={l
                        -glutamate, 
                        l
                        -glutamine, 
                        l
                        -1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate}, Group 2={β-alanine, 
                        l
                        -aspartate, oxaloacetate, 
                        l
                        -arginino-succinate}, Group 3={taurine, hypotaurine, 
                        l
                        -cysteate, 5-glutamyl-taurine}, and Group 4={l
                        -glutamate, 4-butanoate, acetyl-CoA}. Furthermore, we have done a cross-validation for DC by identifying the ‘strongly connected components’ for the metabolic pathways, consisting of functionally significant metabolite groups having strong intra-interactions leading to essential gene functionality and vice-versa. In case of butanoate metabolism, only 1 strong component exists, namely, butanoate, 
                        l
                        -glutamate; acetoacetyl CoA, acetyl-CoA (Fig. 10 in Supplementary Information). Thus, we observe that the most essential metabolites, namely, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl CoA, 
                        l
                        -glutamate, 4-butanoate (in butanoate metabolism), that are actively responsible for the functioning of GAD and INS genes are present in strong components.

Next, we arrange the metabolites having highest to lowest weights followed by identifying the reaction link between the highest and next highest weighted metabolite. Now, we calculate size (φ) of the sub-pathways, using the formula, 
                           φ
                           =
                           Σ
                           
                              
                                 w
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                        . Size of the metabolic pathway denotes the boundary assignment of the metabolites with higher the size lower the robustness and more the chance of metabolic pathways being targeted for external perturbation [27].

Next, we identify the interactions present in butanoate metabolism. Here, we have categorized the interactions into neighbored, serial, parallel, convergent and divergent. An interaction is said to be neighbored if the number of metabolites in one sub group equals that of the other sub groups. For instance in Fig. 11a (in Supplementary Information), sub groups s
                        1 and s
                        2 have three metabolites each. An interaction is said to be serial if the number of sub groups is atleast two and there is one to one interaction between the metabolites. For instance in Fig. 11b (in Supplementary Information), there are only two possible sub groups, s

                        2. An interaction is said to be parallel if the number of sub groups is greater than two. For instance in Fig. 11c (in Supplementary Information), there are only three possible sub groups, s
                        1, s

                        1 has an avgd=2.8 whereas for s

The third module identifies lineage of metabolic pathways by analyzing mutations as well as interactions in both healthy and diseased states. We use weighted graphs for identifying interactions which change due to the occurrence of mutations where weights,

                        . We calculate the interaction weights before and after the mutational event and analyze whether there are any changes in the weights. These weights highlight the compactness of the structure and thus, lower the weight more compact the structure and thus the metabolites are more robust. The reason being, compact structures are conserved during evolution and remain as it is through time span [31].

Next, we identify the most robust and dense metabolites, in terms of connectivity patterns within the metabolic pathway. For this reason we target the non-pool metabolites only. We checked the occurrence nature of these non-pool metabolites before and after the mutational event. The occurrence for all the metabolites involved in butanoate metabolism ranged from 1 to 5. After single mutation, i.e.,

                           j
                         and degree is the degree of metabolite m
                        
                           j
                        . Here, clustering coefficients ranged from 0 to 0.33, suggesting that metabolites m
                        14, m
                        15, m
                        16, m
                        17 are more compact than the others among which m
                        19 acts as central metabolite having the highest connectivity value. After a single mutation none of the metabolites are removed, whereas for multiple mutations, when m
                        13, m
                        15, m
                        16 are removed, clustering coefficients ranged from 0 to 1.0 respectively. Thus, we found that with a deletion mutation of (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl CoA (m
                        7) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate (m
                        14), the overall structure of the metabolic network broke suggesting that the compact structure was more dense and robust than the other metabolites.

The last step is to analyze the growth pattern of metabolic pathway. For this purpose, we considered two parameters, namely, 
                           cc
                           (
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           )
                         of metabolites and weight of interactions. We suggest that metabolites which are likely to be the most robust and dense should have high 
                           cc
                           (
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           )
                         and their interaction weights with other neighboring metabolites should be less. Thus, the growth of metabolic pathways initiates from the densest metabolite and proceed to the least dense one. With decrease in connectivity, 
                           cc
                           (
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                           )
                         decrease whereas their interaction weight with neighboring metabolites increases suggesting less participation in the metabolic pathway [32,40].

For instance, considering the healthy metabolic network in Fig. 13a (in Supplementary Information), the densest metabolite in terms of connectivity is acetoacetyl CoA (compactness value, C.V.=0.1). Thus, the next metabolites produced from it are (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl CoA (C.V.=0), acetyl CoA (C.V.=0.16), (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (C.V.=0.33), and acetoacetate (C.V.=0.16). Similarly, the next groups of metabolites arisen from these are m
                        14 (C.V.=0), m
                        5 (C.V.=0). The growth pattern of other metabolites like m
                        1 (C.V.=0), m
                        9 (C.V.=0), m
                        8 (C.V.=0), m
                        20 (C.V.=0), m
                        3 (C.V.=0), m
                        6 (C.V.=0), m
                        4 (C.V.=0), m
                        10 (C.V.=0), m
                        11 (C.V.=0), m
                        12 (C.V.=0) and m
                        17 (C.V.=0) are not dependent on the previously discussed metabolites and they grew simultaneously along with the others, due to low compactness and high interaction weights (Fig. 13b–f in Supplementary Information). Another interesting feature that we observed from this study was that with an increase in mutational events the compactness of the densest metabolite and its neighbors increases. But this phenomenon occurs only when mutations occur in its outermost neighbors. If the same events occur in the nearest neighbors of the earliest metabolites, the complete metabolic network collapses. The evolutionary theory proposed by us in this work is an extension to the classical ‘micro-evolution’ theory, which states that certain divergent features are significant among growing entities [10]. Moreover, we saw that the nature of this ‘micro-evolution’ is based on the presence of divergent interactions as well as the growth patterns, which is observed to initiate from a root or the densest metabolite to the least dense metabolite in terms of occurrence [10].

We validate the growth results using ‘Hurwicz׳s index’ [41] (Pseudocode 6).

@&#RESULTS AND ANALYSIS@&#

In this section we discuss the results of our methodology on the four metabolic pathways, namely, glutamate, β-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine and butanoate metabolisms, for elucidating the changes adhered by them during evolution, for identifying their possible role in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D).

We performed a comparison among metabolic pathways belonging to Homo sapiens with non-obese diabetic Mus musculus, biobreeding Diabetes-prone Rattus norvegicus, Pan troglodytes, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster. For selecting the species that are closely related to H. sapiens, we performed a phylogenetic analysis by comparing the mitochondrial DNA sequences for all. Fig. 9
                         illustrates our results in this regard. The comparison was on the basis of similarity among pathway structure, patterns, interaction and growth nature. The four metabolic pathways were integrated from the 36 databases and validated using literature resources as well as a method called SAGPAR [33]. Structure-wise the pathways displayed similarities among results obtained. For instance, in case of glutamate metabolic pathway 12 links were predicted by KEGG, β-alanine metabolic pathway 16 links were predicted by KEGG, taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathway 6 links were predicted by Brenda whereas butanoate metabolic pathway 15 links were predicted by KEGG (in M. musculus, R. norvegicus, P. troglodytes and O. cuniculus).

The essential pattern in glutamate metabolism involves l
                        -glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, 4-aminobutanoate, 
                        l
                        -1-pyroline 5-carboxylate and l
                        -glutamate with Hamming distance 3 and the eigenvalues for each JM have the largest real part as 1.49 ⁎10−17 where all negative real part (in M. musculus, R. norvegicus, P. troglodytes and D. rerio). Similarly, in case of β-alanine metabolism, the pattern found was l-asparagine, oxaloacetate, l-arginino succinate, l-alanine and l
                        -asparate with Hamming distance 3 and the eigenvalues for each JM have the largest real part as 0 where all negative real part (in M. musculus and D. melanogaster). In case of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism the pattern was l-cysteate, taurocholate, hypotaurine, 5-glutamyl-taurine and taurine having Hamming distance 3 and the eigenvalues for each JM have the largest real part as 0 where all negative real part (in R. norvegicus), P. troglodytes, and O. cuniculus. Lastly, in case of butanoate metabolism the pattern found was butanoate, l-glutamate, 2-acetolactate and butanoyl coA with Hamming distances 3 and the eigenvalues for each JM have the largest real part as 0 where all negative real part (in both M. musculus, R. norvegicus and O. cuniculus). Moreover, the interactions for all the four metabolic pathways belong to divergent category.

Likewise, in case of glutamate metabolism the payoff matrix has stable interactions existing within the modules ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 with l-glutamate having clustering coefficient 0.06. Similarly, in β-alanine metabolism the payoff matrix has stable interactions existing within the modules ranging from 0.01 to 0.06 with β-alanine having clustering coefficient 0.05. Furthermore, in case of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism the payoff matrix has stable interactions existing within the modules ranging from 0.01 to 0.08 with taurine having clustering coefficient 0. Lastly, in case of butanoate metabolism the payoff matrix has stable interactions existing within the modules ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 with butanoate having clustering coefficient 0.03. Table 6
                         provides a comparative study of our results.

We implement the pattern identification strategy to identify suitable patterns that remain conserved, are of primary importance during evolution for the above given metabolic pathways and establish their role in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. As already discussed in methodology section, we use an approach based on detecting community structures, providing an insight into how network function and topology affected each other. We identify Hamming distances as a basis to group community structures.

From Table 1 we observe that in case of glutamate metabolism, l
                        -glutamate is involved in four reactions leading the formation of a pattern having Hamming distance 3. This pattern consists of metabolites l
                        -glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, 4-aminobutanoate, l-1-pyroline 5-carboxylate forming links with l-glutamate. Similarly, in case of β-alanine metabolism, l
                        -aspartate and oxaloacetate are involved in four and three reactions and had Hamming distances 3 and 4 respectively. The patterns consist of metabolites l
                        -asparagine, oxaloacetate, l
                        -arginino succinate, l
                        -alanine (forming links with l
                        -asparate) and pyruvate, N-acetyl-
                        l
                        -aspartate, D-aspartate (forming links with oxaloacetate). Also, in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism taurine was involved in four reactions having a pattern with taurine having Hamming distance 3. The metabolites involved in this pattern are l
                        -cysteate, taurocholate, hypotaurine, 5-glutamyl-taurine. Furthermore, in case of butanoate metabolism for Hamming distances 3 and 4, three and four patterns are found having butanoate, l
                        -glutamate, 2-acetolactate and butanoyl coA as maximally found metabolites respectively (already discussed in ‘Methodology’ section).

Hamming distance helps in signifying a biological meaning to the patterns. Moreover, the community structures found on the basis of Hamming distances consist of metabolites separated by the same number of substitutions. We observe that the patterns found above are separated by least number of substitutions and remain conserved through evolution. Thus, we could say that these patterns are significant as they are least mutated through evolution and needs to be further studied for analyzing any possible interactions, to predict their role in evolution [24].

We further perform functional validation of the patterns by representing them using cycles and ODEs. Glutamate metabolism has a single cycle, l
                        -glutamate–l
                        -glutamine–2-oxoglutaramate–2-oxoglutarate represented by

                        Moreover, the SM and JM for the cycles are illustrated in Tables 11 and 12 (in Supplementary Information). By calculating the eigenvalues for each JM (Table 5), we observe that the largest real part is 0, thirteen are purely real, one is equal to zero and thirteen have negative real part, again suggesting that the cycles so formed are stable [34].

                        Lastly, the SM and JM for the cycles are illustrated in Tables 13 and 14 (in Supplementary Information). By calculating the eigenvalues for each JM (Table 5), we observe that the largest real part is 0, three are purely real, one is equal to zero and five have negative real part, again suggesting that the cycles so formed are stable.

                         corresponding to l
                        -cysteine, l
                        -cysteate, 3-sulfino l-alanine, hypotaurine and taurine respectively. Furthermore, identifying the largest real part of eigenvalues specifies the slowest timescale of the metabolic system which is stable if all the eigenvalues have a negative real part. For all these four metabolic pathways, the metabolite groups correspond to the cycles predicted previously which are stable as they correspond to eigenvalues with negative real part [34].

Interaction analysis on the four metabolic pathways is performed for analyzing if any interaction is existing among the patterns already detected using pattern identification strategy. We found interactions among the already generated patterns as detected in the previous section as we are specifically interested in finding the type of interactions among patterns, which could further be used to study evolution.

From Table 15 (in Supplementary Information), it is evident that the cut set l
                        -glutamate … l
                        -glutamine and l
                        -glutamate … Carbamoyl-P in glutamate metabolism, one of the patterns already found before, had an avgd (1.7 (A), 1.2 (B)), hd (4.0 (A), 2.0 (B)) and φ (24.0 (A), 6.0 (B)), making the interaction belonging to divergent category. Similarly, in β-alanine metabolism l
                        -aspartate … oxaloacetate and l
                        -aspartate … l
                        -alanine, two of the patterns found before, having avgd (2.0 (A), 1.8 (B)), hd (3.0 (A), 4.0 (B)) and φ (22.0 (A), 53.0 (B)), making the interaction divergent. In taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, l
                        -cysteate … l
                        -cysteine and taurine … hypotaurine pattern present in cut set had an avgd (1.7 (A), 2.0 (B)), hd (3.0 (A), 2.0 (B)) and φ (3.0 (A), 0.0 (B)), making the interaction belonging to divergent category. Furthermore, patterns found in butanoate metabolism also have divergent type interactions (already discussed in ‘Methodology’ section).

From the above discussion we found that the interactions present in patterns behave in divergent manner. However, a ‘divergent’ interaction might not suggest that the metabolites involved in them behave in divergent manner during evolution. For this reason it is evident that we further perform the analysis on these patterns and their interactions for studying their growth pattern and evolutionary significance [36].

Continuing our analysis with cuts and DC, we observe that for glutamate metabolism, high TC is found for l
                        -glutamate, l
                        -glutamine=0.78, (l-glutamate, l-1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate)=0.64, (l-glutamate, 4-aminobutanoate)=0.61. In case of β-alanine higher TC is found for (l-aspartate, l-asparagine)=0.75, (l-aspartate, β-alanine)=0.64. Similarly, for taurine and hypotaurine metabolism TC is found for (taurine, hypotaurine)=0.82, (taurine, l-cysteate)=0.75. Likewise, implementing DC for glutamate metabolism, we consider l-
                           glutamate
                         to be the ‘basis node’ initially. We assume that all metabolites that are paired with glutamate have ‘weak’ links initially. On the basis of higher values for TC a weak link is converted to a strong link, whereas a lower TC value result in a weak link. We observe that l-
                           glutamine
                         has a strong link with l-
                           glutamate
                        , whereas l-1-
                           pyrroline
                        -5-
                           carboxylate

                         as the ‘basis node’ creates all weak links with their corresponding pairs (Fig. 20 in Supplementary Information). Likewise, for β-alanine metabolism considering l-

                         as ‘basis node’ creates strong links with l-

                           cysteate
                         whereas weak links with 5-

                        , taurocholate and hypotaurine as ‘basis node’ creates all weak links with their corresponding pairs (Fig. 22 in Supplementary Information). Thus, on the basis of link type metabolite groups were formed, namely,

We continue with validating the DC by identifying the ‘strongly connected components’ for the metabolic pathways. A strong component in a metabolic pathway consists of functionally significant metabolite groups, which have strong intra-interactions leading to essential gene functionality whereas a weak interaction leads to non-essential gene functionality. In case of glutamate metabolism, a single strong component exists, i.e.,

For ‘bootstrapping’ [30], we assign accuracy measure in terms of confidence score for estimating the interaction correlation among metabolites (Pseudocode 5). We perform various combinations of the metabolites and estimate their correlation tendency to identify the most probable combination, as predicted by the Hasse. For each metabolic pathway, we perform 7 distinct combinations of the metabolites, estimate the confidence score and compared with the already generated Hasse.

For butanoate metabolism we represent the metabolites as

After performing interaction analysis on the metabolic pathways, next step is analyzing the evolutionary growth history of metabolic pathways with special emphasis on patterns and their interactions. In case of glutamate metabolism (Fig. 25a and Table 16 in Supplementary Information), the interaction weights ranged from 2.0 to 12.0 for 12 reaction links. For single mutation the typical metabolic network is given in Fig. 25b (in Supplementary Information). In case when the modifier 
                           pt
                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 12
                              
                           
                        , the corresponding interaction weights range from 0.0 to 2.0. In case of multiple random mutations, pt=y
                        12, y
                        10, y
                        8, y
                        6, y
                        2, modified interaction weights ranges from 0.0 to 0.75 (Fig. 25c and Table 17 in Supplementary Information).

Now, we checked the occurrence nature of non-pool metabolites before and after the mutational event. The occurrence, degree(m
                        
                           j
                        ) for all the metabolites involved in glutamate metabolism are found to be from 1 to 6. After single mutation, i.e., 
                           pt
                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 12
                              
                           
                        , metabolite m
                        5 was removed, and for multiple mutations, i.e., p=y
                        12, y
                        10, y
                        8, y
                        6, y
                        2, the metabolites removed were m
                        2, m
                        5 for which the connectivities ranged from 0 to 4 respectively. Next, we proceed for checking the compactness of the metabolites using clustering coefficient which ranged from 0 to 0.06, suggesting that metabolite m
                        6 was more compact than the others. After a single mutation where y
                        7 is removed and the corresponding clustering coefficient values from 0 to 0.06, whereas for multiple mutations when y
                        12, y
                        10, y
                        8, y
                        6, y
                        2 are removed, clustering coefficient values are 0. This suggested that deletion mutation of reaction links 12, 10, 8, 6, 2 result in removal of 2, 11, 5. It was evident that the compact structure had l
                        -glutamate (m6) with six reaction links. Likewise, the payoff matrix also suggests that the interactions existing within the modules thus found are stable and have a significant value, thus validating our results [31]

                        Similarly, for analyzing the growth pattern of glutamate metabolism, as none of the metabolites had any significant C.V., we propose that the growth is based on the interaction weights and connectivity value. For instance, considering the healthy metabolic network in Fig. 25 (in Supplementary Information), the densest metabolite in terms of age is l
                        -glutamate having clustering coeffiecient 0.06. The next metabolites which were produced from m
                        13 were l
                        -glutamine, carbomoyl-P, l
                        -1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, 4-aminobutanoate, l
                        -glutamyl-tRNA)=0.0), 2-oxoglutarate. Similarly, the next groups of metabolites arising from this was m
                        8. The growth pattern of the other metabolites does not give rise to meaningful result as clustering coefficients were 0 (Fig. 26a and Tables 16 and 17 in Supplementary Information) [38].

In case of β-alanine metabolism (Fig. 13a in Supplementary Information), the interaction weights ranges from 0 to 21.0. For single mutation the typical metabolic network is given in Fig. 13b (in Supplementary Information). In case when the modifier was 
                           pt
                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 7
                              
                           
                        , the corresponding interaction weights are found to be within 0–21.0, with changes in most of the links, especially for 7th, and 19th links. In case of multiple random mutations, pt=y
                        7, y
                        4, y
                        3, y
                        11, y
                        21, modified interaction weights 0–21.0, respectively (Fig. 26c and Table 17 in Supplementary Information). Now, we check the occurrence nature of non-pool metabolites before and after the mutational event. The occurrence for all the metabolites involved in β-alanine metabolism ranged from 1 to 9. After single mutation, i.e., 
                           pt
                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 7
                              
                           
                        , none of the metabolites is removed, and for multiple mutations, i.e., pt=y
                        7, y
                        4, y
                        3, y
                        11, y
                        21 the metabolites removed are m
                        6, m
                        7 for which occurrences ranged from 1 to 6 displaying a slight change. Next, we proceeded for checking the compactness of the metabolites using clustering coefficient, which ranged from 0 to 0.05 (for m
                        3), suggesting that it is more compact than the others (Table 17 in Supplementary Information).

After a single mutation when y
                        7 was removed, the clustering coefficients range from 0 to 0.05, whereas for multiple mutations when y
                        7, y
                        4, y
                        3, y
                        11, y
                        21 are removed, clustering coefficients ranges from 0 to 0.06, respectively. Thus, we find that with a deletion mutation of the link having l
                        -aspartate made the overall structure of the metabolic network unstable suggesting that the links having l
                        -aspartate as one of the metabolite is more densed than the other metabolites [38]. Likewise, the payoff matrix again suggest that the interactions existing within the modules have a significant value, thus validating our results

                        Similarly, for analyzing the growth pattern of β-alanine metabolism, as none of the metabolites had any significant C.V., we propose that the growth is based on the interaction weights and connectivity value. For instance, considering the healthy metabolic network in Fig. 26 (in Supplementary Information), the densest metabolite in terms of connectivity was l
                        -aspartate having C.V. of 0.05. Thus, the next metabolites which were produced from it were l
                        -alanine (C.V.=0), malonate semialdehyde (C.V.=0), l
                        -aspartyl tRNA (C.V.=0), N-carbamoyl l-aspartate (C.V.=0), D-aspartate (C.V.=0), N-acetyl 
                        l
                        -aspartate (C.V.=0), l
                        -asparagine (C.V.=0), l
                        -arginino succinate (C.V.=0), adenylo succinate (C.V.=0).

In case of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism (Fig. 27a in Supplementary Information), the interaction weights ranged from 0 to 9. For single mutation the typical metabolic network is given in Fig. 27b (in Supplementary Information). In case when the modifier

                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        , the corresponding interaction weights are found to be within 0–3, respectively. In case of multiple random mutations, pt=y
                        1, y
                        8, y
                        5, y
                        4, y
                        6, modified interaction weights were from 0 to 1, respectively (Fig. 27c and Table 19 in Supplementary Information). Now, we check the occurrence nature of non-pool metabolites before and after the mutational event. The occurrences for all the metabolites involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism range from 1 to 4 respectively. After single mutation, i.e., 
                           pt
                           =
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        , the metabolite removed was m
                        1, and for multiple mutations, i.e., pt=y
                        1, y
                        8, y
                        5, y
                        4, y
                        6, the metabolites removed were m
                        1 and m
                        6 for which occurrences ranges from 0 to 1 respectively. Furthermore, the payoff matrix also suggests that the interactions existing within the modules have a positive value

                        Next, the clustering coefficient values are found to be 0 for all metabolites. After a single mutation when y
                        1 was removed, clustering coefficient values were still found to be 0, whereas for multiple mutations where y
                        1, y
                        8, y

                        4, y
                        6 were removed, still no change in clustering coefficients took place (Table 19 in Supplementary Information). This suggests that even after mutational event/deletion, no significant change in compactness is evident. The reason for this was the small size of the metabolic pathway [38]. For growth pattern analysis, considering the healthy metabolic network in Fig. 27 (in Supplementary Information), the densest metabolite in terms of connectivity was taurine (C.V.=0). Thus, the next metabolites which were produced from it were taurocholate (C.V.=0), 5-glutaryl taurine (C.V.=0), hypotaurine (C.V.=0), l
                        -cysteate (C.V.=0) (Fig. 28a–c in Supplementary Information). The public repositories that we considered for our pathway construction are listed in Table 19 in Supplementary Information.

The ‘Hurwicz׳s index’ [41] defines a coefficient of optimism (Pseudocode 6) by identifying the best possible Payoff value, suitable to analyze the interactions during metabolic pathway growth. It initiates with identifying a random value between 0 and 1 (0 is pessimistic whereas 1 is optimistic). For each of the payoff matrices, the largest and smallest payoff score is selected corresponding to individual metabolites. The largest score is multiplied with the random value whereas the smallest one is multiplied with 1-random value, followed by summation. For each of the payoff matrices, the number of summed-up value is equal to the number of metabolites selected. For payoff validation, the highest summed-up value is considered and all the payoff scores corresponding to the payoff matrix should be less than or equal to it.

In case of each payoff matrix, v is selected to be 0.9. Initiating with butanoate metabolism (cycle 1), for acetoacetyl CoA the highest and lowest payoff scores are 0.06 and 0.03 respectively. Thus, the summed-up value is 
                           0.03
                           ×

                           0.9
                           )
                           +
                           0.06
                           ×
                           0.9
                           =
                           0.057
                        . Similarly, for metabolites acetoacetate and (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA the summed-up values are 0.054 and 0.057 respectively. Similarly, for cycle 2 the summed-up values for metabolites acetoacetyl CoA, acetyl CoA, acetoacetate and (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA are 0.06, 0.054, 0.081 and 0.111 respectively. The highest summed value in both the cycles are 0.057 and 0.111 whereas the highest payoff scores for both the cycles are 0.06, thus satisfying the criteria. Likewise, in case of glutamate metabolism summed-up values for metabolites l
                        -glutamate, l
                        -glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxoglutaramate are 0.056, 0.074, 0.054 and 0.072 respectively. The highest summed value is 0.074 whereas the highest payoff score is 0.06. Similarly, in case of β-alanine metabolism the summed-up values for metabolites β-alanine, β-amino propion aldehyde, carnosine, histidine are 0.117, 0.0081, 0.0091 and 0.0091 respectively. The highest summed value is 0.117 whereas the highest payoff score is 0.11. Lastly, for taurine and hypotaurine metabolism the summed-up values for metabolites l
                        -cysteine, l
                        -cysteate, 3-sulfino 
                        l
                        -alanine, taurine, hypotaurine are 0.0, 0.144, 0.072, 0.144 and 0.072 respectively. The highest summed value is 0.144 whereas the highest payoff score is 0.16 in this case [41].

Among various investigations undertaken in systems biology, an important task is identifying meaningful patterns within metabolic pathways. This approach aims at identifying essential regions within metabolic pathways of various organisms and is useful for studying evolution as well. Here, we developed an algorithm that has three modules, of which the first one was used for pattern identification on the basis of structural, functional features and topologies. Commonly occurring patterns identified similar patterns of conversion and mutation, and thus could provide key insight essential for drug development in relation to rogue pathways. We analyzed the onset of T1D in H. sapiens by studying the role of GAD and INS genes in metabolic pathways, namely, glutamate, β-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine and butanoate metabolisms, involving in T1D for the purpose of studying their growth in evolutionary time scale.

In our algorithm we used the concept of Hamming distance and Tanimoto coefficient for identifying certain graph-based Community structures in metabolic pathways, which were further used to detect meaningful patterns. We further used functional validations representing the patterns using cycles and ODEs. We then tested the stability of these cycles by calculating eigenvalues from the Jacobian matrix that we formulated from the ODEs. Likewise, metabolic networks consisted of large number of interactions that occur among its components. These interactions also gave an insight into the functional, structural, topological and evolutionary organization of the network. The second module of our algorithm identified interactions based on the patterns found by the first module. Study of interactions among the components of a network is usually carried out by partitioning it into sub-networks and analyzing the types of interactions occurring among them. In this work, we developed a technique for network-partitioning based on cut sets. We analyzed the size of metabolic pathways, which denoted the boundary assignment of the metabolites involved in the metabolic pathways. We further used hasse diagrams and implemented DC method to test for cuts and metabolite groups. Furthermore, higher the size of metabolic pathway, lower was the robustness, as more was the chance that the metabolic pathways could be targeted for external perturbation. In this work we categorized the interactions into neighbored, serial, parallel, convergent and divergent. The third module of our algorithm was to identify the growth of metabolic network based on the already known patterns, their interactions and some other parameters like performing mutational events. We further tested the various interactions by plotting Payoff matrices. These matrices identified those interactions which are of functional significance to the metabolic pathway. For evolutionary studies, we used the concept of identifying the densest metabolites in the pathway along with their reactions. We suggest that the densest metabolite in the metabolic pathway was the earliest one in terms of evolutionary occurrence. This is an extension of the classical ‘micro-evolution’ hypothesis. We use a combinatorial approach for the same. This approach began with comparing the metabolic pathways of glutamate, β-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine and butanoate metabolisms involved in T1D ongrowth in H. sapiens from the available public repositories.

An interesting feature that we could observe from this study was that with increase in mutational events the compactness of the earliest metabolite and its neighbors increased. However, this phenomenon occurred only when mutations occurred in its outermost neighbors. But, if the same events occurred in the nearest neighbors of the oldest metabolites, the complete metabolic network collapsed. Thus, in terms of functionality, the oldest metabolite was of the topmost priority. We concluded that Hamming distance and TC helped in signifying a biological meaning to the patterns. Moreover, the community structures found on the basis of Hamming distances consisted of metabolites separated by the same number of substitutions. We observed that the patterns found above were separated by the least number of substitutions and remain conserved through evolution. We could say that these patterns were significant as they were the least mutated through evolution, and needed to be further studied for analyzing any possible interactions, to predict their role in evolution. Furthermore, we found that the interactions found in the pattern behaved in divergent manner. But, a ‘divergent’ interaction might not suggest that the metabolites involved in them behaved in divergent manner during evolution. For this reason, it was evident that we further perform the analysis on these patterns and their interactions for studying their growth pattern and evolutionary significance. We found that the most significant interactions existing among the patterns found in these metabolic pathways were divergent in nature. We found that the densest metabolite, in terms of occurrence, in glutamate, β-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine and butanoate metabolisms were l
                     -glutamate, l
                     -aspartate, taurine and acetoacetyl CoA, respectively. We finally conclude that these four metabolic pathways grow in a manner which was very similar to divergent growth, i.e., the earliest metabolite evolves first, followed by the growth of its reaction links and branches, leading to a method, we termed as ‘divergent root-to-leaf’ model, an extension to the ‘micro-evolution’ theory. Thus, the metabolites and associated reaction links other than the root or the most dense metabolites are thought to have evolved from these dense metabolites.
