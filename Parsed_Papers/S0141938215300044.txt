                  3D has been one of the most important technologies of the last decade having an exponential progression. Nevertheless, several problems such as visual discomfort and visual fatigue have slowed its progression for homes. This factor decreases significantly the overall quality of experience from watching 3D content and reduces the level of satisfaction of a user. This study explores the accumulation of visual fatigue when watching 3D video in close to real-life conditions. In order to obtain more information about visual discomfort, an hour of eye-tracking experiments have been conducted. Investigations have been made by analyzing information provided both by users through questionnaires and visual gaze characteristics recording. Obtained results are compared to data produced when watching 2D. The deep statistical analysis showed that time and video content have an influence on video fatigue accumulation and visual functions. With respect to the obtained results, a model has been proposed based on video characteristics (motion activity, disparity range and changes) and the previous state of visual fatigue.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

3D television is seen as the next step in the telecommunication world. An important research effort has been already dedicated to the process of compression, delivery and display of 3D content. Stereoscopic 3D content delivery is possible more than ever. However, new parameters have appeared as part of the overall quality of experience (QoE) from watching 3D content, such as visual comfort and feeling of depth. Both of them influence significantly the user’s satisfaction, and their mechanisms are not explored enough. Moreover, S3D watching effects on children developing vision is not studied sufficiently. Thus, measuring the impact of 3D watching on human vision is an important issue in 3D perception research.

Human visual system (HVS) is able to accomplish the task of processing visual details thanks to its organization, i.e. eyes, nervous path and brain. One of the main functions of the eyes is the analysis of images on the light-sensitive layer, retina. For the most accurate perception, the input information should get on the part of the retina, called fovea, representing central vision. Each eye has its own location in space, so the entering information varies slightly depending on the viewing position. This slightly different information coming to both retinas is transformed into electrical signals and sent to the brain to be processed. The difference between the left and right retinal images is called retinal disparity and used by the brain through a series of binocular simple and complex cells to reconstruct depth [1]. This basic principle is followed by the S3D industry to create artificial stereo vision using different technologies [2].

Creating the illusion of the 3rd dimension relies entirely on the fact that we have two eyes separated by the inter-ocular distance. In order to reproduce this natural effect the idea of stereo-imaging is based on showing little different pictures to the left and right eyes, that can be achieved by field sequential or time-parallel techniques. In the field sequential approach, two views are alternated on the display device, and a blocking mechanism in glasses prevents from seeing the opposite view. Images are delivered at a sufficiently high frame-rate (120Hz for example) to avoid flickering. The time-parallel method is based on showing two views simultaneously but images are separated with the help of color or polarized filters [3].

The level of viewer’s satisfaction depends on how close to natural viewing is the presentation of the stereo-images. The difference between natural watching of the real world and stereo performance can induce visual discomfort and fatigue [4]. Several factors have been identified as causing visual fatigue during or after watching stereo contents. One of the principal factors inducing visual discomfort during watching 3D content is the excessive binocular disparity. Since human eyes are horizontally separated, each obtains its own view of the surrounding world. Stereopsis gives the perception of depth reconstructed by the differences of retinal images in each eye. The brain extracts depth information by fusing images from left and right eyes. This difference until images can be fused correctly is quite limited by the structure of the retina. It is restricted by the Percival’s area of comfort and equals around 1 degree of disparity [5]. As soon as the difference between left and right images goes beyond this limit, it creates uncomfortable effects [6]. Also, visual discomfort can occur even within this limit induced by temporally changing demand of the accommodation-vergence linkage.

In order to obtain a clear binocular vision, the eyes converge and accommodate by a level that depends on the distance to the viewing object. When eyes converge at the object, the accommodation changes the eye’s lens to obtain and maintain the object in the area of interest. Accommodation and vergence processes are cross-coupled in such a way that stimulation of one produces responses by both of them. The mismatch between accommodation and vergence during 3D video watching can appear due to the conflict between accommodative and vergence stimuli. The focus of lens is fixed on the screen, where the displayed image is the sharpest, but the convergent point of eyes is changing in the depth depending on the value of disparity [5]. This dissociation induces even stronger uncomfortable feeling in motion, specially stimuli moving toward the viewers [7]. The temporal effect of this mismatch plays also an important role on the accumulation of visual fatigue and fast changes induce stronger feelings [8,9]. Despite these arguments, some studies give an opposite evidence. For instance Li et al. showed that vergence-accommodation conflict does not strongly affect the visual discomfort, although relative angular disparity between foreground and background might be more significant. They have shown that an increase of planar motion can cause higher visual discomfort. A model of visual discomfort based on the relative disparity and object’s velocity has been proposed. However, the latter is lacking in terms of correlation with subjective rating. This may inform that additional video characteristics have to be taken into account [10,11].

It is commonly known that even without the benefit of stereopsis, depth can be perceived by using monocular cues (perspective, interposition, occlusion and texture gradients) while the creation of depth in 3D content is based only on binocular cues. If artificial depth in 3D technology conflicts with these monocular cues, an uncomfortable feeling can appear [5,12]. To produce a stereoscopic 3D content, different views for left and right eyes are required. Depending on the technology of creation, delivery and display of 3D images, views asymmetry can appear. This disagreement can also induce uncomfortable feeling of visual fatigue and discomfort [13].

Depending on the evaluation methodology of visual inconvenience, terminology for visual discomfort and fatigue varies. One of the definitions for visual fatigue was proposed by Lambooij et al. and describes visual fatigue as a decrease in the performance of the human visual system as a consequence of physiological strain or stress resulting from excessive exertion 
                        [14]. From the same work, they determined visual discomfort as the subjective counterpart of visual fatigue. It is worth noting that visual discomfort is perceived instantaneously, while fatigue is characterized by an accumulation process. Measuring such visual functions as speed of constriction/dilation of pupil diameter and accommodation response, visual acuity, eye movement velocity, critical fusion frequency and blinking was done as the first attempt to evaluate visual fatigue [15]. This section provides more information about trials for measuring and evaluating visual fatigue and discomfort.

Visual fatigue is a personal sensation, and the most spread practice for measuring it, is to simply ask participants. Three subjective measurement methods can be distinguished: explorative studies, psychophysical scaling and questionnaires. Explorative studies and psychophysical scaling have not been widely used in the context of measuring effect from 3D video. The former can help to study the added effect of stereoscopic displays and define such overall feeling as visual discomfort, while the latter gives the opportunity to optimize and improve the systems based on perceptual parameters as video quality and discomfort.

One of the first questionnaires was proposed by Kennedy for simulator sickness (SS) assessing [16] and has been adopted for visual fatigue purposes [17,18]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no generally accepted questionnaire for measuring viewer’s feeling during or after watching 3D. Most of the studies used questionnaires adapted to their purpose. Hence, Sheedy et al. proposed a questionnaire to measure the level of asthenopia (eye strain), but not strictly tuned for measuring from stereo content watching [19]. The questionnaire of Shibata et al. contains information regarding eye-tiredness, vision clarity, neck and back-pain, eye-strain, and headache; it was used to evaluate visual discomfort from watching 3D [20]. A more detailed questionnaire has been already used by Yang et al. [7]. These authors conducted a long duration (1h30) experiment with commercially available movies, but the questionnaire was filled out only at the beginning and at the end of watching. From another point of view, the previous experience of 3D watching has been considered by Cho et al. as an important factor, that they explored in a 3D cinema theater [21]. However, no investigation has been proposed yet for 3DTV.

Accommodation response is explored as an indicator for visual fatigue measurement. The optometric devices have been used in pre- and post-experiments to measure the change in accommodation as a result of viewing stereoscopic content. One of the drawbacks of such measurements is the absence of measuring the accommodation-vergence couple simultaneously with observing the mismatch conflict between them. Following this direction, Yano et al. tried to evaluate visual fatigue and concluded that the accommodation response as a parameter to predict visual fatigue, can be taken into account as a part of a more complicated assessment method [22]. According to their findings, the accommodation response itself is not a precise enough parameter.

Another study of Yano et al. evaluated visual discomfort with the help of single stimulus continuous evaluation (SSCE) and accommodation responses [23]. The relationship between results of SSCE and video characteristics were investigated. Motion and correlation between left and right views were used as characteristics of the video. Low scores, informing about stronger visual fatigue feelings, were linked to large parallax and large amount of motion in stereoscopic sequences. They concluded that accommodation response could not be approved being the index for visual fatigue evaluation as it does not clarify the accommodation-vergence mechanism.

It is known that human eye can tolerate some level of dissociation without difficulty. The range of relative vergence that an individual can tolerate during a long time without having visual discomfort was named the area of comfort. This range is known also as the Percival’s area of comfort [24]. Fusional hysteresis is determined as a difference between the fusional vergence break point (point where viewer starts to experience double vision watching through prisms with increasing power) and the recovery one (point where viewer is again able to fuse images after a breakpoint). Since it reflects the fusion efforts used for perception of binocular disparity, the change of fusional hysteresis has been evaluated regarding the state of visual fatigue. Emoto et al. tried to assess and compare visual fatigue from watching conventional 2D and stereoscopic 3D video [25]. Fusional amplitude were measured after 1h of watching video and the significant decrease was revealed after watching stereo content, but not after 2D video. They also tried to evaluate visual fatigue by visual functions as viewer break point and recovery point. It was shown that discontinuous changes in parallax were one of the principal factors contributing to visual fatigue accumulation [26]. Although, fusional amplitude was proposed to be used as an index for fatigue evaluation, it can be only one of the parameters, because it does not give full explanation of the different stages of visual fatigue accumulation.

Blinking is the essential function of closing and opening eyelid that is responsible for eye moistening and protecting from irritations. There are multiple muscles that control reflexes of blinking and spread all around the eye. Blinking mechanism can be affected by the accumulation of fatigue, eye injury, medication, and disease [27,28]. Hence, such blinking characteristics as frequency and eye closure duration have been used to evaluate the link with visual fatigue [29]. Kim et al. made an attempt to evaluate visual fatigue from watching 3D using this approach. They have shown that eye blinks were more frequent for stronger feeling of visual fatigue [8]. A model has been even proposed in [30] for predicting visual discomfort based on eye blinking rate. Unfortunately, the proposed model is not accurate because of its simplicity and therefore additional parameters could be integrated. From this point of view, additional characteristics of blinking should be explored when dealing with visual fatigue from stereo watching. For instance, there is no doubt about the influence generated on the blinking mechanism by the parameters of video content itself like luminance and glare, or the conditions of subject.

Involuntary fixation eye movements prevent the adaptation of our neurons to an unchanging environment. The movement of the retinal images is what keeps stationary objects of interest. This stationary gaze is called eye fixation, and movements between these fixations are saccades. Being that, humans are not aware of these eye movements, they have been studied to understand the basics of visual awareness [31,32]. The activity of fixation is strongly linked to visual attention, and it is considered that points of fixation can form a zone of attention. Like this slowness in visual attention can result in a visual fatigue influence [33]. Consequently, changes in behavior of eye-movements can be used as a parameter.

The link between eye-movements and visual fatigue induced by watching stereo content was also examined. To reveal this relationship eye-tracking technology was used to follow the movements of eyes. By using this method, saccades behavior was analyzed by Kim et al., who showed that saccades movement was decreasing with visual fatigue growing. In the study of Vienne et al., visual fatigue was evaluated as the vergence error, and was correlated to the used vergence efforts [34]. Moreover, works on visual attention revealed the difference in eye-movements during watching 2D and 3D content [35,36]. Taking all this into consideration, the contribution of Choi et al. aims at predicting automatically the level of visual discomfort depending on the locus of interest [37]. The model is based on spatial and temporal characteristics of the disparity, but it can be significantly affected by artifacts and distortions. Since eye-movements highly depend on content, its bias should be avoided for visual fatigue estimation.

Cognitive and perception information is processed in the brain. The neuronal activity of the latter reflects visual fatigue resulting from watching S3D video. The examination of brain activity can provide a better understanding of the process running during visual activity. In visual fatigue evaluation research, Emoto et al. used electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure the visually evoked cortical potentials by sensory simulation of the visual field. Visually evoked cortical potentials reflect fatigue of the interrelated extra- and intra-ocular muscles, and central nerve of the brain. The positive component at approximately 100ms latency (P100) of the visually evoked cortical potential was used as a fatigue index [26]. This study suggested that the latency of evoked cortical potentials can reflect the state of visual fatigue. Similar experiments were conducted by Li et al. They used EEG at back scalp and event related potentials at the latencies 300 (P300) and 700ms (P700) for evaluation of visual fatigue. Their findings showed that P300 had delay for stressful situations, and P700 delay is influenced by the binocular parallax and presentation time [38]. Like this, delays in transmission of visual information measured with EEG could be a measurement of visual fatigue. The investigation of Kim et al. was dedicated to the relationship between visual fatigue and binocular disparity by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging [39]. They found strong neuronal activities in frontal eye field (FEF) if the disparities of shown stimuli were beyond the comfort zone. Making an assumption that FEF is linked to eye movement control, they concluded that it correlates with visual fatigue induced by watching stereoscopic content.

Exploration of the influence of 3DTV watching on mental fatigue was done by Chen et al. [40]. They used physiological detectors in order to record EEG of 10 participants before and after watching 2D and 3D television. Using regression of five studied parameters and subjective evaluation, they proposed a model for 3DTV visual fatigue evaluation. Unfortunately, the influence of such indicators as gravity frequency and power spectral have not been explored.

More and more researchers try to assess and measure changes in brain activities, however, this approach continues to be complicated and sensitive to the personal state of subjects. Furthermore, it is difficult to design an experiment with a large number of observers for the sake of generalization.

So far, most of the studies aimed at finding a measurement which would accurately indicate the state of the visual system. Numerous measurable visual characteristics are used as indicators of visual fatigue. However, none of them is precise enough. Moreover, measuring at the beginning and at the end of the experiment does not give a full representation of the gradual growth of visual fatigue.

Another important drawback of existing studies is linked to the use of artificial stimuli. They are either still images or very short movie clips, less than 2min in duration, that make them lacking in story telling and other main reasons to watch movies in general. Taking all these into consideration, we propose to evaluate visual fatigue with the help of measuring a few characteristics at once such as change of pupil diameter, eye-movement and blinking.

In this paper, we propose to explore and confront the visual fatigue for 2D and S3D content with the help of eye-tracking methodology. One of the goals of the proposed work is to investigate whether visual fatigue is generating the same symptoms for 2D and S3D watching. Thereby, we concentrate our work on highlighting the possible impact of visual fatigue on such visual functions as eye-movement, i.e. fixations and saccades, and blinking. This choice can be justified by previous studies and findings suggesting that these characteristics can be affected by visual discomfort and have different behaviors for 2D and S3D content.

The second goal of our study is to model the process of visual fatigue accumulation by using the results obtained from our experiment. Regarding the nature of 3D imaging, we consider its characterization through three dimensions, i.e. space, time and depth. In the proposed work, we suggest to investigate the impact of each dimension on visual fatigue accumulation and visual characteristics. In order to perform this examination, each dimension is characterized by its own parameters. Thereby, this work covers not only perceptual human features but also particularities of stereo 3D video.

This paper is an extension of our initial investigation on this topic described in [41]. Besides its wider scope, it contains an almost exhaustive review of the literature of visual fatigue caused by S3D content. Moreover, It describes our further work on visual fatigue generated by 2D content in addition to a deep statistical comparison and analysis of the difference with S3D. Also, an objective model, relying on three different features that are essential for binocular vision, is proposed and deeply analyzed.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is dedicated to the experimental setup and the design of the experiment (stimuli and procedure). The obtained results, the statistical analysis and associated discussions are given in Section 3. The exploration of visual fatigue and visual characteristics regarding S3D video features in Section 4. Finally, this paper ends with some concluding remarks and gives ideas about future works.

Two separate experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare visual fatigue induced by watching 2D and S3D video. They took place with a sufficient time gap to avoid some uncomfortable effect. The same content was used for video evaluation in both experiments. In order to use the same video with the same characteristics only the mode (i.e. 2D and S3D) of the screen was changed. A video of different content with overall duration of 1h was displayed to several participants to evaluate their visual fatigue. The video represents a diversity of content including documentary, cartoon, action and adventure. The selected 10-min sequences have motion of different types and avoid as much as possible direct speech of actors. The presentation order of the test sequences has been randomized for each participant in each experiment to avoid position bias. Subjective evaluation was performed as a succession of questionnaire about visual fatigue and associated symptoms after every 10-min sequence. During the session, eyes characteristics are measured using an eye-tracker.

Six commercially available movies with HD resolution (1920×1080) have been selected (“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” – adventure movie, “Garfield’s Pet Force” – animation, “Clash of the Titans 3D” – action movie, “The Universe: 7 Wonders of The Solar System 3D” – documentary, “Avatar” – action, “Underwater World” – documentary) in order to evaluate visual fatigue as close as possible to conditions in real-life. A sequence of 10min was selected from each video, trying to preserve logical start and end of scenes. Conversational scenes have been avoided when possible. The same video sequences have been used both in 2D and S3D modes, and only screen mode was changed. 2D mode corresponds to showing only one view to the observer, and S3D is using a passive polarization.

In the proposed experiments, we tried to reproduce conditions close to watching movies at home or in cinema theater. The same apparatus was used for experiments in 2D and S3D, except during 2D watching participants did not wear polarized glasses. The room, where experiments have been conducted, has a diffuse lighting and was noise-isolated. The averaged illumination of the room was equal to 65lx. The used monitor was a calibrated Hyundai TriDef S465D with 60Hz progressive scanning. This display has the possibility to work in 2D and S3D modes. To follow participant’s eye-movements during watching, an eye-tracker Tobii TX-120 with capability to work with 3D glasses and large freedom of head movement has been chosen. The latter allowed tracking both eyes simultaneously which offers a better robustness to head motion tracking. Therefore, tracking continues even if one eye is hidden from the field of view of the eye-tracker. Data has been collected every ∼8ms (120Hz).

The distance between eye-tracker and display was 64cm, which was calculated according to the requirements of the eye-tracker’s manufacturer. The eyes of participants were located no more than 70cm from the eye-tracker, in such a way that the distance between them and monitor was of 2H, H being the height of the displayed images as described on Fig. 1
                        . In order to achieve the same viewing conditions for all participants, an adjustable chair has been used to fit their individual characteristics.

Twenty healthy subjects (18 male, 2 female) were recruited from the University of Poitiers. Before starting the experiment, they have been asked about previous eye-diseases and experienced injuries. The age of viewers ranged between 22 and 30. They have a stereo acuity better than 40s. of arc, that was checked using a RANDOT® stereo-acuity test before the experiment [42]. All subjects passed Ishihara compatible color vision test for detecting color blindness [43]. Visual acuity was checked by FrACT (Freiburg Visual Acuity Test) [44] and overall visual acuity was around 1 with or without correction.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

In order to avoid the influence of working on computer, experiments were conducted in the morning before work or just after the lunch break. Psychophysical test started with a questionnaire about health state and previous experience with 3D. After that, detailed explanations of symptoms and sensations of visual fatigue were given to each observer in experiments with 2D and 3D video equally. Individual rating of visual fatigue and sickness symptoms was asked at the beginning of the experiment where normally participants did not have any claim.

Observers watched six video sequences separated by the questionnaire about visual fatigue and sickness symptoms. The questionnaire was proposed in two languages (English and French) to be as close as possible to participants understanding. The order of sequences for each participant was different. Eye-tracker was following the eye-movements during watching video. A calibration of the eye-tracker device was performed before every sequence to avoid changes caused by the questionnaire step. A summarized description of the procedure is given in Fig. 2
                        .

Data about binocular tracking of eye movement are extracted from the eye-tracker records. Only information obtained when both eyes are open was selected. Eye-blinking was calculated according to the suggestions of the eye-tracker manufacturer, and it was defined as a period of non-detecting eyes within a specific time limit. For the needs of analysis, averaging windows have been used, depending on the studied visual characteristic, in order to decrease the sampling effect. A statistical analysis is performed on the processed data in order to study the effect of the aforementioned visual characteristics on visual fatigue on the one hand. On the other hand, this study aims at finding the influence of time, content and order on the obtained data. For this, we used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) where the null hypothesis has been defined as: ‘There is a dependency between the visual characteristic and visual fatigue’. From the ANOVA analysis, the null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is greater than 0.05 [45]. Moreover, the strength of the effect is characterized using 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    η
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         provided by the same analysis with values 0.09, 0.14, and 0.22 corresponding to slight, medium and strong effect respectively.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Eye-movements information was obtained every 8–10ms for both eyes by using the eye-tracker. After an adapted filtering, only valid values were used for statistical analysis. The bias of order has been minimized by using a random stimuli order for each participant. Thereby, the content and time were considered as factors in the ANOVA to analyze their influence on visual fatigue and visual characteristics. Subjective evaluation of visual fatigue and symptoms was done using questionnaires in two languages. Pearson coefficient correlation was also used to analyze the data.

Self-evaluation of visual fatigue and its symptoms separately was done for 2D and S3D video. It was performed before and after each video-sequence in order to observe discomfort accumulation. Questionnaires with grades “None”, “Slight”, “Moderate”, “Strong”, “Severe” were proposed for all participants to evaluate their level of visual fatigue. It has been noticed that watching S3D video induced stronger visual fatigue sensation than 2D as presented in Fig. 3
                        .

A slight sensation of visual fatigue started to appear after 20min of watching S3D content for all participants and increased with time. At the same time it can be noticed, that 2D video visual fatigue reached a “Slight” value only at the end of the test. Fig. 3 shows average evaluation of visual fatigue for 2D and S3D watching. As it can be seen from Fig. 3, the sensation of visual fatigue from watching S3D video increased from “slight” to “moderate” value after 20min of watching. For some participants visual fatigue feeling achieved even “strong” values.

The questionnaire (general discomfort, eye strain, difficulty focusing, blurred vision, dizzy (eyes open and eyes closed), dryness of the eyes, eye irritation, vertigo, difficulty concentrating, fullness of head, nausea, headache, increased salivation, sweating, burping, stomach awareness) was also given during the experiment to evaluate visual fatigue symptoms. From the 16 proposed attributes a few have a strong contribution to the visual fatigue induced by stereo video. They were noticed by all participants. It can be also said that visual fatigue from 2D was mostly linked to eye-strain.


                        Fig. 4
                         presents the average value for the most frequent visual fatigue symptoms for 2D and S3D watching. As it can be observed from the plot, the feeling of general discomfort in S3D mode is increasing for all participants. Most of viewers had “slight” feeling of discomfort, but some of them also had “moderate” symptoms. At the same time, watching 2D created only “slight” feeling of discomfort at the end of the 60min watching.

Analyzing results from self-evaluation of visual fatigue symptoms, it can be said that eye-strain was the most often observed both in 2D and 3D modes. Its level is growing for both types of video, and reached the moderate value for S3D and only slight for 2D at the end of the test. Difficulty to focus is observed mostly for S3D video. This feeling can be connected with a changing demand of accommodation-vergence during watching S3D video. Regarding general discomfort, the level was comparable for 2D and S3D, with stronger influence for the latter. Difficulty to concentrate and fullness of head were also reported after watching S3D, which could be explained by an increased brain activity. Eye-irritation was noted only during watching stereo video. The remaining symptoms did not show specific trends, they were found for some observers and some sequences, and could have an individual character.

To analyze the association between symptoms and visual fatigue, Pearson correlation coefficient r has been calculated. The results for 2D and S3D watching are given in Table 1
                        . It shows a relatively high correlation between visual fatigue and eye-strain for both 2D and S3D. The correlation between general discomfort and visual fatigue is higher for S3D than for 2D. As watching 2D is more familiar and happens more often, experienced discomfort is much less. Taking into account the results of Pearson correlation, it can be said that eye-strain and general discomfort symptoms give the greatest contribution to sensation of visual fatigue for video watching.

One-way ANOVA was applied to evaluate the effect of time and content on self-evaluation of fatigue. Statistical tools showed that personal perception of visual fatigue was dependent on video features (p

                        ) for S3D video. An occurence of a slight sensation of visual fatigue for 2D video is connected more with time, as no dependency was found with content (p
                        =0.20 – content, p
                        =0.03 – time). The strength of time effect reflects that watching duration plays an important role in the growth of visual fatigue. This affirmation is more valid for S3D than 2D.

The strength of time effect reflects that this parameter plays an important role in the increase of visual fatigue. As a direct dependency between visual fatigue and time was revealed, dependency between visual characteristics and time is explored further. It is assumed that in case of such dependency, visual characteristic could be used to evaluate visual fatigue.

Data obtained from the eye-tracker is used to investigate the link between visual fatigue and eye pupil diameter. The behavior of pupil diameter has a similar character for 2D and 3D watching. Statistical results showed that there is no influence of time on the variation of pupil diameter (p

In order to explore the way content influences the pupil diameter, we used average luminance of screen as a feature. The average luminance for each frame of video sequence was calculated after a conversion to gray level. The pupil diameter of participant was also calculated for each frame separately. Fig. 5
                         represents the correlation between variation of pupil diameter and average luminance of the frame for right and left eyes respectively. It is easy to notice that they are inversely proportional. The pupil diameter increases with low luminance and decreases with increasing one. It proves that the change of pupil size is following naturally the illumination of the frame, and no trends connected with fatigue was shown. The effect of visual fatigue influence is probably masked by the dynamics of the luminance. In the condition of our experiment it is complicated to obtain only changes induced by fatigue. An experiment with limited range of luminance can be designed to explore this effect in a more detailed way and avoid changing pupil size depending on the light.

Eye-movements for left and right eyes were captured during video experiments. The number of saccades and fixations as well as their duration were obtained with the help of the eye-tracker. ANOVA statistical analysis was applied to investigate the effect of time and content on the behavior of eye-movements.

Fixation happens whenever a viewer maintains its visual gaze on a single location, that can be a point of interest. In our work, we investigate the behavior of two fixation characteristics, namely duration and frequency. Fig. 6
                            presents the averaged number of fixations and the associated duration for S3D and 2D content during watching the whole test sequence. Median filter is used in order to avoid the influence of outlier value. ANOVA was applied to study the effect of video content and time on the number of fixations. ANOVA results given in Table 2
                            prove the existence of a dependency between fixation duration and time for S3D video (p
                           =0.04). The statistical analysis did not show any effect in the case of 2D video (p
                           =0.39). It is important to recall that no significant accumulation of fatigue was found during 2D watching. The dependency between fixation duration and its number with time was also revealed by ANOVA for S3D video.

Saccades happen between fixation points so their behavior can complement the dynamic of fixation. Saccades are considered as abrupt movements of the eyes. Fig. 7
                           c and d show average changes of saccades number for video test-sequence in S3D and 2D modes. From Fig. 7c, it can be said that the number of saccades has the tendency to decrease at the end of the sequence, although its behavior is not stable. Results of ANOVA in Table 2 prove the effect of time on the number of saccades for S3D case and showed also the influence of content. At the same time, this effect is not noticed for 2D content. ANOVA does not reveal any relation between saccades and time for this specific case. One of the reasons can be that visual fatigue does not accumulate considerably during watching 2D content.

In this experiment, behavior of blinking rate with time and load was examined. In our experiment, we calculated the number of blinks using the data obtained by eye-tracker following the recommendation of the manufacturer. We selected the periods of closed eyes, and subsequently calculated number of blinks per minute and blink duration.


                        Fig. 8
                        a and b give information about the behavior of blink duration for 2D and S3D. The average duration was similar for 2D and S3D video, and was approximately equal to 200ms as it is shown in Fig. 8a and b. For S3D watching a slight tendency to grow can be observed from Fig. 8a. The statistical analysis pointed out, that blink duration depends on characteristics of video content (p

                        Fig. 8c and d show the number of blinking during watching 3D and 2D test-sequences. It can be observed that the blinks were overall more often in the case of watching S3D, that is up to 50 blinks per minute for stereo video and less than 20 blinks per minute for 2D. It can be seen that the range of blink number varies significantly for S3D, and it stays under the level of 20 blinks per minute for 2D. In order to find a general trend of blinking behavior for all participants ANOVA was applied. The results show that blinking number does not depend on time neither in S3D (p
                        =0.16), nor in 2D (p
                        =0.80). However, it is influenced by the content of the video, which is stronger in the case of S3D watching (p

In order to study the similarity of behavior of the visual characteristics for 3D and 2D content, we conducted a correlation analysis presented in Table 3
                        . We compared the behavior of every visual characteristics per minute respectively. Statistical analysis showed low correlation (less than 0.16) between visual characteristics during S3D and 2D watching. The highest correlation was found for blink duration and was equal to 0.1594 and the lowest values were found for fixation and saccade number and was around 0.02. The low correspondence between human reaction for 2D and S3D can be considered as a demonstration of the difference in perception. Moreover the difference in sensation from watching 2D and S3D content was shown by subjective assessment (see Fig. 9
                        ).

In our work, we evaluated the sensation of visual fatigue by using questionnaires and eye-tracking to study the changes of visual characteristics. In order to find the link between visual fatigue and visual characteristics, we used statistical analysis: ANOVA. It showed that all visual characteristics and visual fatigue have been strongly affected by the type of content. Following these results, in this section we present the relation between visual fatigue and characteristics of video. From the perception point of view, any stereoscopic 3D video content can be characterized by three dimensions, i.e. space, time and depth. In our investigation we propose to follow this idea, and explore the visual fatigue accumulation corresponding to each dimension. As a spatial dimension, we present the semantic load. This parameter is defined by the spatial saliency of each frame. The temporal dimension is considered as a motion intensity; it is obtained by using MPEG-7 descriptor. Since depth is an additional dimension in comparison to 2D, two parameters are explored regarding disparity information (see Fig. 10
                     ).

Since commercial movies were used in our work and in order to avoid creating a direct link between movies and obtained results, names of movies will be omitted in this part. The term Video N will be used instead and correspond to the same movie in the whole section.

One of the aims of our experiment was the evaluation of visual fatigue accumulation. It was performed by filling questionnaire every 10min. In order to evaluate the speed and strength of fatigue growing and give its mathematical presentation, linear regression was applied. By using this mathematical tool, it was found that averaged visual fatigue can be described by Eq. (1), where t represents time in seconds. The multiple regression has been obtained with a quality factor of

In video content, scene objects change their position from frame to frame. Depending on how rapid these displacements are, viewers are able to characterize motion from slow to fast. To categorize the used video content according to its motion activity, MPEG-7 motion descriptor was used [46]. It gives information about overall intensity or pace of the motion in video sequence, that is represented by its attribute Motion Activity. According to this parameter all motion can be divided in five categories (Table 4
                        ). In order to evaluate each video test-sequence according to this range, automatic measurement of motion-activity was applied. Thereby, the intensity of motion was measured using the statistical properties of the motion vector magnitude. Following the work in [47], the standard deviation of the motion-vector magnitude was calculated and compared with the thresholds in Table 4.

In such way, each frame is characterized by its coefficient of motion activity. Visual fatigue value at each frame is obtained using the formalization given in Eq. (1). Since the effect of content was found for all visual characteristics, its link with motion activity is investigated. In order to find this relationship, the results of eye-tracking data were processed for each frame and each participant. As the duration of visual characteristics is normally longer than one frame presentation, each frame is characterized by visual characteristic in a bi-level way. Visual characteristic is either active, or inactive (for example, frame 358 – fixation – no saccade – no blink; frame 2587 – no fixation – no saccade – blink). In order to follow the general behavior, limit the individual influence and keep this paper readable, we generalized these results for each frame for all participants. If more than half of viewers has fixation at this certain frame, it is characterized by fixation, and no blink or saccade. This operation was performed for each frame of all video test-sequences. Afterwards, statistical analysis was applied to find, if there is an effect between video parameters and visual characteristics.


                        Table 5
                         presents the results of statistical analysis for coefficient of motion activity and visual characteristics. It can be noticed, that the strongest impact motion has is on fixations. P-value shows the correlation for all video-sequences. It can be explained by features of video that demand gazing or surfing on the objects. Although saccades are considered complementary eye-movements, the link between motion and saccades are revealed only for two videos, that are characterized by medium and high motion activity (Table 6
                        ). The interpretation of these results goes to the existence of a third type of eye-movements, smooth pursuit movements [48], that have not been considered in this work. Such movements are under voluntary control in the sense that the observer can choose whether or not to track a moving stimulus. These movements are closely linked with motion and following the objects. Pursuits are the prolonged version of saccades, since eyes move from one position to another but with a lower speed. These movements can replace saccade rapid changing of the position and cannot be detected.

As it is given, blinking does show the link with motion only for one video sequence, that cannot be generalized for other types of content. It can be remarkably seen the strong relation between visual fatigue and motion activity for all sequences. It is important to mention that depth motion is considered as one of the reasons for visual fatigue. Thereby, the motion category and its variation has an impact on visual fatigue accumulation.

With the aim to characterize the impact of spatial information on visual fatigue accumulation, we propose the use of the semantic load of content [49]. Depending on the salient information level gathered by the video content, different level of visual discomfort can be induced. Hence, in order to evaluate the semantic information of the scene, spatial saliency is proposed to be used. It is closely connected with the attention, hence with the semantic information provided by the scene. In our work, saliency maps based on interest points were chosen [50]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information about scene classification according to its semantic load. Thereby, we propose a simple and efficient approach, similar to motion classification.

It is accepted, that salient area are the regions appearing for the observer to stand out relatively to its neighboring parts. The scene saliency can be distributed differently, from a few slightly prominent regions to single strongly salient area. Our classification is based on how strong the region of interest is conspicuous. In such a way, categorization is using a threshold. For each frame, a spatial saliency map was calculated by using a threshold equal to 15%. Then, the number of pixels below the threshold was calculated, starting from the most salient pixels. The latter were considered the ones among 0, 8, and 1. If the number of such pixels reaches 15% of the frame, it is defined as highly salient. If not, the frame goes to another level. At the next level, the amount of pixels between 0, 6, and 1 is calculated, and if it achieves the level of 30%, this frame is characterized as above average, or it goes to the next lower category. This process is performed for each frame and provides five classes of semantic load: high, above average, average, below average, low. The used thresholds have been determined experimentally as providing the most stable results.

Afterwards, statistical analysis is conducted to investigate the link between parameter of semantic load and visual characteristics and fatigue. The latter is obtained as described in Section 4.2. The results of analysis are presented in Table 7
                        .

It has been noticed from Table 7 that there is an influence of semantic load on visual fatigue accumulation. Value 
                           
                              p
                              ⩽
                              0.05
                           
                        , for six test video sequences, shows that there is an impact of the amount of saliency on fatigue accumulation.

The link between semantic load and fixations is revealed for four video test-sequences. It is noted, that the link between eye-movements (fixations and saccade) and visual complexity is revealed for Video 4 and Video 6. On the contrary, blinking was impacted by the semantic load only for two video-sequences, there eye-movements did not have impact.

From conducted experiment it was found that watching S3D content generates stronger visual fatigue and discomfort than watching 2D. Since depth is a principal difference between 2D and 3D images, its influence on visual fatigue and visual characteristics has been investigated. To explore the effect of depth dimension, three parameters have been investigated [51,52].

The disparity maps were calculated for each frame following the algorithm proposed at [53]. This approach bases on calculation of the tree graph by using dynamic programming. The method is characterized by dense stereo correspondences and high computational efficiency. These advantages make it attractive for using with video in HD format (14,403 frames per each video).

Before the end user enjoys the video, it passes through various stages of production and delivery. A processing or presentation can modify one or both views. If mismatch between views is very strong, HVS is not able to fuse both views. Thereby, in this work the strength of such mismatch is represented by the histogram correlation between two views, that is calculated for each frame. After performing this procedure with frames of tested sequences, it was found that the correlation between left and right view was perfect and was equal to 1. This could be expectable since high quality video sequences were used.

Since accommodation-vergence conflict is claimed to be one of the main reasons of visual fatigue from watching 3D video, the goal of any 3D content is to place left and right images into Panum’s fusion area. One of the methods to describe the comfortable viewing zone is the ratio between minimum and maximum disparity of an image (
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       RNG
                                    
                                    
                                       disp
                                    
                                 
                              
                           ). This value approximately should not exceed 2–3% of screen width. In our case, for 40in. screen size and used resolution 1920×1080 the difference between minimum and maximum disparities should not overpass 64px. This ratio for tested video sequences does not go beyond 40px. Although excessive level was not found, the interrelation between visual characteristics and disparity range was explored and its result is given in Table 8
                           .

From statistical results at Table 8, it is seen that the influence of disparity range on visual fatigue has a high significance (p
                           ⩽0.05). It means that visual fatigue accumulation depends on the disparity range of the displayed image. Oppositely, the behavior of visual characteristics does not show any trend. Fixations have correlation with disparity range for three video sequences (Video 1, 2 and 4), saccades – for one video sequence 2. Blinking also link with disparity range for two test sequences 5 and 6.

Temporal change of disparity level (

                           ) was also highlighted as the cause of visual fatigue. Rapid depth changes at the place of scene cuts are considered as reasons for visual discomfort. In order to find their influence, disparity change for video test sequences was calculated. Histogram correlation is one of the methods for scene cut detection, thus a similar method is adopted in this approach. A histogram of the disparity map is computed for every video frame.

The Pearson correlation is used between the disparity histogram of the current and previous frame. In this way, disparity change index is obtained for each frame of sequence according to Eq. (2), where

                            is a result of Pearson correlation. ΔD is a final coefficient of disparity changing and it is suggested as an indicator of depth effect.

Changing of disparity level impacts the visual fatigue accumulation process, that can be noted from Table 9
                           . P
                           ⩽0.05 for all six sequences shows that this parameter has significant importance on fatigue accumulation. The impact of disparity change on fixation is found for video sequences 1, 2 and 4. The effect on saccades is found in three test video (Video 2, 3 and 6). The influence of blinking was found for video sequences 2, 4 and 5. From results in Table 9, disparity change has an effect on visual characteristics for video sequence 2 and no effect was found for video 1.

Regarding the obtained results, the main features of disparity changes are investigated. It was revealed that the most often (10,946 times) disparity was changed in Video 1 and the least often in Video 2 (4849 times). The parameter Δ

                                       mean
                                    
                                 
                              
                            shows how strong the changes were, if its value is high, the changes are significant. The most considerable changes were observed in Video 1, where Δ

                            reaches the value 0.6847, and the least strong ones are observed in Video 4 (Δ

                           =0.3472). Analyzing the results, presented in Tables 9 and 10
                           , it can be concluded that rapid and significant changes of disparity do not influence strongly the behavior of visual characteristics. One of explanations can be that frequent changes of scenes keep the interest high, feeding the cognitive demand. On the contrary, Video 2 has the lowest number of disparity changes, so less scene cuts, that possibly create boring effect. Repeated change of accommodation-vergence demand seems to not affect the visual characteristics, when the video sequence has a high semantic value.

Our final goal is to propose a model based on video characteristics that can predict level of visual fatigue accumulation. As it has been found, visual fatigue accumulation depends strongly on the duration of watching stereo content and it is impacted by the characteristics of video. Therefore, four parameters have been considered in order to build our visual fatigue model.

First, it has been demonstrated in the previous study that the level of visual discomfort depends considerably on the disparity value and its variation. Hence, we used visual disparity changes (

                                    disp
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) and visual disparity range (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    RNG
                                 
                                 
                                    disp
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) in order to represent the disparity in the final model. Then, as motion partially generates changes in depth, the value of motion activity σ is considered as an important factor for visual fatigue and its value has been taken into account. Finally, semantic load (SL) parameter, introduced in our paper, can reflect the activity of the cognitive process, linked to visual attention mechanism.

Visual fatigue is a phenomenon growing with time. Its initial value has a direct impact on the process of visual fatigue accumulation. In other words, having already fatigue at the beginning of stereo movie watching, makes the progress of visual fatigue faster. So far, we incorporate in the proposed model the previous state of visual fatigue (

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This work presents the results obtained using eye-tracking experiment and analyzing interaction between video and human perception. In this study, we examined and analyzed visual fatigue generated by watching 2D and S3D video in as close as possible to real life conditions. Two independent eye-tracking experiments have been conducted with naive participants. The eye-movements and blinking have shown different behavior for S3D and 2D watching. Investigation on visual fatigue and its symptoms showed that the visual characteristics are different for both cases. The statistical analysis revealed that accumulation of visual fatigue depends on time and content for S3D and only the content for 2D. Thereby, the nature of S3D video plays a significant role on fatigue accumulation.

The analysis of visual characteristics showed that eye-movements strongly dependent on content, but also vary depending on time for S3D video. Blinking also was impacted by the video content, and its duration was influenced by time. From another side, no effect of time was revealed for 2D watching. Comparison of eye characteristics and visual fatigue showed a significant difference in behavior during watching 2D and S3D video.

Following the previous results, we proposed a model for predicting visual fatigue relying on three video features having shown an effect on visual fatigue accumulation: (1) Motion activity descriptor MPEG-7 has been used as an index to evaluate the speed of content changes, (2) semantic load is used to examine the video complexity and (3) depth range and changes are used to assess the quality of depth.

The developed model opens the floor to further investigations such as the link between visual fatigue and quality of experience by exploiting the different video characteristics used in this study.
