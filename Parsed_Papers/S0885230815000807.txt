                  Stridence as a form of speech disorder in Serbian language is manifested by the appearance of an intense and sharp whistling. Its acoustic characteristics significantly affect the quality of verbal communication. Although various forms of stridence manifestation are successfully diagnosed by speech therapists, there is a need for the automatic detection and evaluation of stridence. In this paper, an algorithm for stridence detection using Patterson's auditory model is presented. The algorithm consists of three processing stages. In the first stage spectral analysis and masking effects are applied using Paterson's auditory model. In the second stage a contour of spectral peaks that best fits characteristic features of the stridence is selected in the time-frequency (TF) representation of the signal obtained by Patterson's auditory model. In the third stage hypothesis testing is performed with three decisions: D
                     0 – no stridence, D
                     1 – stridence, and D
                     2 – unable to decide. The reliability of stridence detection is tested on the speech corpus of 16 speakers without stridence (with correct speech), 16 speakers without stridence but with some other speech sound disorders, and 16 speakers with stridence. Test results show high correspondence of subjective measures and automatic detection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fricatives and affricates are groups of phonemes with common problems in pronunciation. Fricatives are articulated by forcing air through a narrow constriction in the vocal tract, resulting in a steady friction noise, while affricates are articulated by forming a complete constriction, which release is accompanied by the friction noise. Like affricates, oral stops are also formed by a complete constriction situated in the vocal tract, but they differ in the manner of the release of the confined air. Oral stops are characterized by abrupt release, while affricates are released with the constricted vocal tract creating the friction of the air passing through. Our study is focused on irregularities in the articulation of fricatives and affricates related to the friction control and synchronized movements of articulators. In the case of normal speech and language development, fricatives and affricates are acquired at the age of 6–7. During the developmental phase, irregularities in the articulation of some fricative speech sounds may occur. These irregularities may be the result of the normal speech development, or may be caused by pathology in sound production. Types of deviations occur depending on the pattern of speech sound groups, and can be language dependent. These deviations manifest themselves as different types of sigmatism, duration, intensity and friction quality impairment (Jovičić et al., 2010). Sigmatism or lisp is an articulatory disorder characterized by defective sibilant sound. Speech therapists recognize five types or lisps: frontal or interdental, lateral, occluded, nasal and strident (Riper and Erikson, 1996). In the case of the Serbian language, strident lisp or stridence is one of the specific forms of deviations that occur in the articulation of fricatives and affricates.

Stridence is an acoustic phenomenon that is generated in the mouth when the position of the tongue in relation to the palate and teeth is irregular. This position creates constrictions of various forms. When the airflow reaches a certain speed while passing through constrictions a tone of a certain frequency or a very strong narrowband resonant noise is generated. These sounds are generated simultaneously with the pronunciation of a speech sound, typically fricatives and affricates, and they change the acoustic characteristics of the target phoneme. Perceptually, the stridence is experienced as an unpleasant, whistling, squeaky or coarse sound that influences the quality of the pronounced phoneme.

Stridence is also considered to be an abstract phonological distinctive feature (Chomsky and Halle, 1968) and is a phonological feature of many languages. In addition, the term strident lisp is used in order to describe the sibilants characterized by piercing, whistling sounds (Riper and Erikson, 1996). While in some languages whistling fricatives (stridency) are considered as normal pronunciation (Shosted, 2006), in Serbian (Jovicic et al., 2008), Czech (Honova et al., 2003) as well as some other languages it is considered to be an irregular (pathological) pronunciation.

In the Serbian language, stridence is most commonly manifested in the articulation of fricative /ʃ/ (according to the IPA classification we used /ʃ/ as most similar to Serbian initial fricative in word “ʃuma”) as: narrowband stable over time and very intensive resonant occurrence in the diffuse noise spectrum, or a twofold stridence with one stable resonance and one very changeable resonance in the time-frequency representation, or a very short stridence with high variability of the resonant frequency (see Fig. 1
                     ). As noted in Jovicic et al. (2008), a strong resonant stridence with an intensity over 20dB above the envelope of the surrounding spectrum with a minimal duration longer than 10ms is a necessary condition for resonant occurrence to be perceived as stridence.

The algorithm for automatic stridence detection in the Serbian language (Jovicic et al., 2008) uses Burg's maximum entropy method for calculating stridence measure. This algorithm is accurate in cases where stridence is prominent, with no doubt as to its presence. However, in boundary cases, the algorithm's detection differs from the assessment obtained by the speech therapist. The reason can be found in the fact that the algorithm does not exploit psychoacoustic effects.

In past decades, a variety of computational models of cochlear processing have been developed to provide representations of complex neural activity patterns that arise in the auditory nerve in response to broadband sounds like speech and music (Hohmann, 2002; Patterson and Allerhand, 1995; Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996; Patterson, 2000; Slaney and Lyon, 1993). All of them simulate processing in cochlea using the following: (a) auditory filter-banks which simulate the basilar membrane motion (BMM), (b) some form of compressive adaptation and nonlinearity, for instance a half wave rectifier (HWR) which simulates neural transduction, and (c) temporal integration (Patterson and Allerhand, 1995; Patterson, 2000) or correlogram calculation (Slaney and Lyon, 1993; Slaney et al., 1994) used for generation of the auditory image.

In this paper, a new method for stridence detection based on Paterson's auditory model (Patterson and Allerhand, 1995; Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996; Patterson, 2000) is proposed. Contrary to the original Paterson's auditory model in which strobed integration is applied on each channel independently, we calculated the auditory image along the selected spectral peaks contour. The reason for this is that the central frequency of the signal that represents stridence varies in time across channels of the filter bank.

To optimize tracking of the spectral peaks contour, we modified the nonlinear processing in Paterson's auditory model by replacing the half wave rectifier (HWR) with a calculation of the magnitude of the channel signals. Finally, we simplified Patterson's auditory model by omitting the adaptation in the time domain. This is done because stridence detection is applied to the isolated phonemes whose duration is relatively short compared to the relaxation time of the adaptive threshold. The proposed algorithm was tested in an appropriate database of Serbian words with and without stridence and compared with the algorithm proposed in Jovicic et al. (2008).

Stridence detection is implemented through three processing stages, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . In the first stage, two time-frequency (TF) representations of the signal are generated in two parallel branches (A) and (B) using the original and modified Patterson's auditory model (Patterson and Allerhand, 1995), respectively. In the second stage, the smooth TF representation obtained by the modified Patterson's auditory model is used for the selection of the spectral peaks contour that can be perceived as stridence. The decision on the presence of stridence is made in the third stage by using Paterson's TF representation from the first processing stage and the selected spectral peaks contour from stage 2. In the following subsections the stages of the algorithm will be explained in detail.

Filtering by gammatone filter bank (GFB) in step (i), models the transmission of the acoustic wave to corresponding points on the basilar membrane performing spectral analysis of the sound. Central frequencies and the channel bandwidths are assigned according to the ERB scale (Hohmann, 2002). In this algorithm, the gammatone filter bank is implemented using the fourth order complex filters (Hohmann, 2002). The reason for this is the ability to more precisely determine the envelope of the channels signal, which is important for the spectral peaks contours detection. The multichannel signal at the output of GFB is denoted by s(t, j), where j
                        =1,…,
                        Nch is channel index and Nch is number of channels in the filter bank.

The processing step (ii) in branch (A) is a half-wave rectifier (HWR) which is used to model the processes that occur at the inner hair cell receptors (stereocilia). The half-wave rectifier is applied to the real part of the complex signal s(t, j), by

                        (A)(t, j). Apart from the information about instantaneous power it also contains the information about the phase of the channel signal. The onset of each pulse corresponds to zero phase of the channel signal. The stability of the pulse repetition period affects the shape of the signal in the auditory buffer, which will be discussed in Section 2.3.

                        >0 defines the compression level (Feldbauer et al., 2005; Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996). A typical value of β is 0.4 (Feldbauer et al., 2005). This step is similar to the logarithmic amplitude compression schemes in ordinary waveform coders (e.g., μ-law).

As the spectral peaks carry information about the presence of stridence we applied spectral peaks enhancement in step (iv) in the same way as it was applied in the algorithms (Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996; Taplidou and Hadjileontiadis, 2007). Spectral peaks enhancement is performed in two steps. First, the smoothing of the compressed spectrum

However, stridence may be masked by other spectral components particularly in the case of fricatives with strong friction. As a consequence of the natural process of masking, perception of stridence may be absent. The model of the masking effect is implemented in step (v). Spectral components in the Δ vicinity of the resonant frequency f(j) reinforce the impression of stridence. The power of these spectral components is denoted as in-band power

                        . On the other hand, the spectral components outside of this frequency band “decrease” the impression of stridence, playing the role of masking noise. The power of these spectral components is denoted as out-band power

In step (i) for each instance in time given by the time index t, all spectral peaks are found and denoted. In the next step (ii), the spectral peaks are associated to contours using the following rule: if (t, j) is the last point of a contour at time instance t in channel j, and if there is a local maximum along frequency axes in any of three channels with indices j
                        −1, j, j

                        +1, then the contour extends to the point (t

                        +1 that are not covered by any of the contours of the time instance t, represent the beginning of the new contours.

All contours cannot represent stridence. The selection of contours that could be perceived as stridence is done in step (iii). These contours should meet the following two constraints:
                           
                              (c
                                 1) Their duration must be greater than the minimum time interval – T
                                 min. Duration of the minimum time interval is determined experimentally and equals T
                                 min
                                 =9ms. The contours of shorter duration than T
                                 min cannot be perceived as stridence.

(c
                                 2) A quasiperiodic stridence signal must have a stable resonant frequency, which is either a constant (the examples displayed in Fig. 1a and b, the first resonance line) or linearly changing in time (the example displayed in Fig. 1c and b, the second resonance line). Otherwise, that part of the signal will not produce the impression of stridence but friction. Each spectral peak contour may be modeled by a simple regression model. The sum of squared residuals of the model is a measure of the resonant frequency stability. In the first approximation we assume that resonant frequency is constant over the short time interval T
                                 min. In this case, the stability measure is the standard deviation over the sliding window having a width of T
                                 min. Hence, the standard deviation of the resonant frequency on the sliding window with the width of T
                                 min has to be less than the previously defined threshold σ

Unlike the original Patterson's model in which strobed temporal integration is applied in each channel independently (Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996), in our algorithm the auditory strobed temporal integration is applied on the selected contour p
                        max. The auditory image is created in several steps. In the first step (i) we form a series of points S

A series of points S

Similar to the process of the auditory imaging by the strobed temporal integration (STI) (Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996; Patterson, 2000), in the next step (ii) trigger pulses T(k), k

                        (A)(t), see Fig. 3a. N
                        
                           tr
                         is the number of trigger pulses generated on the series S

                        . Local maxima are detected with respect to the adaptive threshold α(t), marked in Fig. 3a with a thin line. Threshold α(t) decays exponentially with time, and when the trigger pulse occurs, it is set to the value of the local maximum of the signal (Patterson and Holdsworth, 1996; Patterson, 2000). The positions of local maxima are marked by diamonds in Fig. 3a. At the locations of the trigger pulses, the accumulation of the signal in the auditory buffer is activated. The accumulation is calculated by pseudo code:

@&#RESULTS@&#

The performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed on speech records taken from the database of normal and pathological pronunciation of the Serbian words recorded in Life Activity Advancement Center, Belgrade (http://www.add-for-life.com/projekti/shuma/path-speech-db.htm). Data collection was performed according to the test protocol approved by ethical committee of the Institute for experimental phonetics and speech pathology (Belgrade, Serbia). List of stimuli consisted of thirty 2-syllable words which included all phonemes of the Serbian language. Each pronounced phoneme was assessed by a trained speech therapist according to the quality of its pronunciation and the type of speech distortion if it was present. The number of assessed phonemes was nine thousand. The proposed algorithm was tested on a subset of speech records obtained from school children aged 10–11 years. Children of this age should be considered to have acquired all phonemes in the Serbian language and pronounce them correctly in all phonological positions. However, in this population there were a significant number of children with irregular pronunciations of one or more phonemes, predominately from the group of fricatives. Analyzing the acoustic characteristics of stridence it was observed that it occurs at frequencies above 1000Hz. Voicing of phonemes which occurs at lower frequencies does not affect the performance of the algorithm, and the proposed method can be successfully applied to the voiced and unvoiced consonants. Therefore, we decided to test the algorithm on fricative /ʃ/, it being the most frequent incorrectly articulated phoneme in the tested population.

We selected 48 examinees and divided them into three separate groups of subjects: Group (a) 16 subjects with stridence as the only pathological feature in the pronunciation of phoneme /ʃ/ (stridence was of varying degrees, from mild to very strong), Group (b) 16 subjects with the correct pronunciation of phoneme /ʃ/, and Group (c) 16 subjects without stridence; instead their pronunciation of phoneme /ʃ/ was characterized by other forms of speech pathology.

Often, in experiments where trained experts assess the quality of speech or voice, their competence and ability to detect specific acoustic details is justifiably questioned. There are conflicting opinions in the literature about the reliability of the results obtained by one or more experts (Kent, 1996). In this experiment, assessments made by the experienced expert are assumed as reference (correct). We have chosen this approach bearing in mind that experience can play a significant role in the ability of assessors to detect subtle differences in the pronunciation quality of a phoneme. We opted for an expert from the Institute for Experimental Phonetics and Speech Pathology, Belgrade, for the following reasons: engaged in speech and language therapy more than 20 years, estimates on a daily basis the articulation of patients of different ages and pathology (annual rate between 600 and 800 different examinees), showed the highest reliability in different psychoacoustic tests for articulation quality assessment.

Speech stimuli database was recorded with a sampling frequency of 44,100Hz. In preprocessing, it is decimated by a factor of 2. The gammatone filter bank contained 111 filters with central frequency channels allocated according the ERB scale in the range of 900–7940Hz, which completely covers the resonance phenomenon caused by stridence.

For each subject from groups (a), (b) and (c), the stridence measure d
                        
                           str
                         is calculated by using pseudo code (2) and (3). The distribution of the stridence measure for the subjects of group (b) and (c), (those without stridence), are calculated as the number of subjects without stridence with a measure of stridence d

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier is used for the classification of the subjects. Given that the decision obtained by this classifier is based on all samples except the sample that is to be tested, it can be said that this procedure is similar to the well known leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method (Cawley and Talbot, 2003). The number of neighbors, k
                           =3 is experimentally determined. The presence of the stridence we denoted as hypothesis H
                           1, while the pronunciation without stridence we denoted as hypothesis H
                           0. Applying the proposed classification method, the false stridence detection error was

Application of the k-NN classifier in this test case defines two areas: D

                           λ
                           
                              H0/H1), the area for acceptance of the hypothesis H
                           0, and D

                              H0/H1) the area for acceptance of the hypothesis H
                           1. However, setting up such sharp boundaries between acceptance of the hypotheses H
                           0 and H
                           1 in the case of stridence detection is not in accordance with the process of categorical perception and categorization of speech (Holt and Lotto, 2010). Decisions about affiliation to one or another class can be seen as the probabilistic approach (Nosofsky, 1992) in which the probability of recognition in the areas of clear separation between classes is close to 1. Between these two zones there is a transition area, or area of uncertainty, where the probability of classification is by chance. The width of this area depends on the experience of the examiner (Livingston et al., 1998). With this in mind, two threshold decisions are used λ

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A false detection for the subject with initials K.B. is shown in the Fig. 5(A). There are two non-overlapping segments A and B in the cochleagram of the fricative /ʃ/ displayed in Fig. 6
                        . Segment A, located from 30ms to 46ms, contains a spectral peak contour around frequency of 2700Hz that is approximately 20dB above the surrounding spectral components. As the measure of stridence calculated on segment A, d
                        
                           str
                        
                        =64.3, is greater than threshold λ
                        
                           d2
                        =30, the algorithm detected stridence. Despite this, the expert didn’t recognize segment A as stridence because segment B, being a friction, masks segment A. To confirm this assumption, we processed the whole fricative /ʃ/ by band stop filter from 4000Hz to 7000Hz with attenuation of 40dB and gave once more the processed signal to the expert for evaluation. In this case, the expert noted the presence of stridence, thus confirming our assumption of the masking effect of segment B. In this test case we have temporal or non-simultaneous masking because the masker and masked signals do not overlap in time. This is backward masking, because the signal is terminated 9ms before masker starts (see Fig. 6). According to the diagram displayed in Fig. 10.16, page 198 (Moore, 1997), the backward masking threshold at 9ms is around 12dB. As the necessary condition for stridence perception is that resonance-to-noise ratio is greater than 20dB (Jovicic et al., 2008), the stridence is not perceived in this case.

The second error was the missed detection in subject G.P. shown in the Fig. 5(A) for which the expert determined the existence of stridence. Fig. 7
                         shows the cochleagram of the fricative /ʃ/ in which the dominant segment A (34–156ms) is marked. This segment should be characterized as strong friction. It consists of several isolated spectral contours whose durations are not sufficient to be recognized as a stridence by the proposed algorithm. The most intense sub segment B has duration of 4ms. On the other hand, the expert perceptually detected stridence. This phenomenon can be explained by “Perceptual restoration of missing sounds” (Warren, 2008). Namely, between the sub segments (characterized) with stridency there are sub segments of intense friction enabling the enhanced perceptual restoration of stridence. This continuity illusion illustrates the constructive nature of perception that made it possible for an expert to perceive stridence. This psychoacoustic effect is not included in this version of the algorithm.

To evaluate the improvements in stridence detection by using the auditory model, we compared the proposed algorithm with the algorithm proposed in Jovicic et al. (2008) which does not use the auditory model. In the following we will refer to this algorithm as ALG_2008, while the algorithm proposed in this paper, will be denoted as ALG_2014. Table 1
                         summarizes the obtained results. Both algorithms provide the same number of missed and false detection. The main difference in performance of those algorithms is the number of samples that fall into the area of uncertainty. The algorithm ALG_2014 in Test Cases 2 and 3 has 3 examples that cannot be classified. On the other hand, ALG_2008 in Test Case 2 has 5 and in the Test Case 3 has 9 examples that cannot be classified. It can be noticed that the difference in performance of algorithms ALG_2014 and ALG_2008 is even higher when tested subjects have speech pathologies other than stridence. This imposes the conclusion that ALG_2014 algorithm is more robust and less sensitive to the presence of other pathologies in comparison with the algorithm ALG_2008. The reason for this is that the algorithm ALG_2014 better mimics auditory perception of stridence compared with the algorithm ALG_2008 and is therefore sensitive only to those components of the signal that contribute to the auditory perception of stridence.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The main idea in the implementation of the algorithm for stridence detection was to bring the results of automatic detection closer to the perceptive assessment of speech and language experts. For this purpose, Patterson's auditory model is used, and experimental results for the detection of stridence with fricative /ʃ/ show significant improvements. The method is applicable to other phonemes from the group of fricatives and affricates where stridence occurs, regardless of whether they are voiced or voiceless. In order to use this algorithm for stridence detection in case of other phonemes, it is necessary to adjust all the parameters of the algorithm according the particular phoneme. The analysis of the errors showed the need for expanding the psychoacoustic effects in the proposed algorithm for stridence detection. Therefore, additional studies are necessary regarding the characteristics of stridence, psychoacoustic effects that contribute to the stridence perception, modeling approaches to individual psychoacoustic effects and their integration.

The proposed method for automatic detection of stridence is meant to be implemented as part of a reliable, accurate and non-invasive automatic system for general pathological speech assessment. Such a system could be efficiently used for large scale screening tests for early detection and recognition of speech disorders as well as support in therapy sessions, evaluation of therapy strategies in clinical trials and therapy control.
