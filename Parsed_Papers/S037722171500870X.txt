                  This study considers a mean-variance (MV) framework for managing disruption risk in a two-echelon supply chain with a risk-averse buyer and multiple unreliable suppliers under newsvendor (NV) setting. An MV objective function is designed to maximize the buyer's expected profit while minimizing its variance. Study of the structural property of the problem proves the existence of a global maxima and a set of efficient portfolios consisting of dominating mean-variance pairs. We demonstrate the effect of model parameters through comparative statics analysis. An algorithm is developed to overcome the computational complexity of the higher dimensional problem. Numerical studies on model behavior show that the proposed algorithm gives the exact optimal solution while being tractable.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Managing and mitigating disruption risk has become an important research issue in the recent past (Christopher & Lee, 2004; Kleindorfer & Saad, 2005; Schmitt, Snyder, & Shen, 2010; Silbermayr & Minner, 2014; Tang & Tomlin, 2008; Yu, Zeng, & Zhao, 2009). Supply disruption may occur in the form of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes; or man-made havocs such as terrorist attacks, and strikes. Examples include the earthquakes in China and Japan that caused major disruption to many global and local supply chains, and the fire in Ericsson supplier's semiconductor plant that resulted in a loss of 400 million Euros (Norrman & Jansson, 2004). Oke and Gopalkrishnan (2009) classify such events into three categories: high likelihood-low impact, low likelihood-high impact, and medium likelihood-moderate impact. One of the most common strategies to hedge against supply disruption is multi-sourcing. Traditionally, academic literature considers the buyer to be risk-neutral, and the decision-making involves either maximizing the profit or minimizing the cost. In reality, however, this decision depends on the risk-taking behavior of the buyer who wishes to make a trade-off between maximizing the profit while minimizing the risk. Markowitz’s (1952) mean-variance (MV) theory is increasingly used for conducting risk analysis in stochastic supply chain models (Chiu & Choi, 2013), where MV theory maximizes expected return for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given expected return. Our model is another effort in this direction considering supply disruption and demand uncertainty to complement multi-sourcing decision.

Many techniques originally proposed on investment theory such as MV analysis, MAD, semi-variance, VaR and CVAR used by various researchers for supply chain risk analysis. For example, Tomlin (2006) considers both MV and CVaR approach for managing disruption risk. As suggested by him, CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) approach better handles the risks associated with low probability of high impact events, i.e., very rare but severe disruptions. However, as suggested by Markowitz (2014), MV analysis is a better approach when the deviation is large. Consider disruptions due to cyclones and related floods that are likely to occur during the monsoon period (typically July–October) in Indian subcontinent. Though such disruptive events occur with low probability and have high impact, their occurrences are not as rare as earthquakes. They are expected to occur during a specific period that accommodates medium probability and moderate impact events. Therefore, the mitigation strategies for such events must be different from other disruptive events that do not give clue of their occurrences and MV approach is appropriate in such cases.

There are numerous applications of MV analysis under standard newsvendor (NV) setting. For example, Choi, Li, and Yan (2008) use MV approach to investigate the NV problem by considering different risk attitudes with and without stockout cost. Similarly, Wu, Li, Wang, and Cheng (2009) apply MV method to analyze the risk-averse problem with stockout cost and found that a risk-averse buyer orders more than a risk-neutral one under stockout situation. Though, there is some scope for applying MV analysis to manage disruption risk in an NV setting, to our understanding, almost no literature exist in this area. In the earlier work (Ray & Jenamani, 2014) we have developed multi-sourcing decision-making models with disruption risk considering both risk-neutral and risk-averse buying behavior. While in the previous work, we have modeled risk-averse buying behavior by introducing a service level constraint following the work of Xanthopoulos, Vlachos, and Iakovou (2012); in the present work, risk-averseness is represented in the mean-variance framework following Wu et al. (2009).

To our understanding, this is the first work in the literature that applies MV analysis to manage disruption risk in NV setting. The case of both risk-neutral and risk-averse buyer is considered; while the former maximizes only the expected profit, the later does so considering both expected profit and its variance. Structural characteristics of the problems are investigated to highlight on two special portfolios: (i) maximizing expected profit and (ii) minimizing profit-variance. In between the two extremes, there exists a set of MV efficient portfolios. Though the problem is complex, existence of global maxima is established. To show the effect of various input parameters, comparative statics analysis is performed. The model is demonstrated through a numerical study, and sensitivity analysis is carried out under different setting of the model parameters. An algorithm for MV objective is proposed to reduce the time complexity, which also gives the optimal solution to the problem. Contrary to the result of Wu et al. (2009), current finding shows that when disruption risk is considered, the risk-neutral decision maker orders more than the risk-averse one. Thus, disruption risk has significant effect on buyer's optimal ordering policy, and stockout cost plays a major role in buyer's expected profit, its variance as well as MV objective.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the review of the relevant literature. Section 3 discusses the problem and sets the framework. Section 4 presents formulation of the model and its analysis. Section 5 shows the comparative statics analysis and
Section 6 shows the solution approach. Section 7 takes up a numerical study to illustrate the model. Finally, the last section summarizes the work and discusses about future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

This study is related to three streams of literature. First, we discuss the literature on NV models with MV objectives followed by order allocation and supplier selection under disruption risk, and MV analysis with disruption risk.

As a fundamental problem in stochastic inventory theory, the NV model has been studied for a long time (Dada, Petruzzi, & Schwarz, 2007; Yang et al., 2007). Readers are referred to Khouja (1999), Silver, Pyke, and Peterson (1998) and Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011) for NV problem and its extensions. Such models have the goal of either maximizing the profit or minimizing the cost. Recently, many authors have covered several alternative objectives to maximize utility functions instead of expected profit or cost (Chen, Sim, Simchi-Levi, & Sun, 2007; Eeckhoudt, Gollier, & Schlesinger, 1995; Lau, 1980; Rubio-Herrero, Baykal-Gürsoy, & Jaśkiewicz, 2015; Van Mieghem, 2007), of which MV objective is of our interest. For example, Chen and Federgruen (2000) discuss several basic inventory models using MV approach. They model a quadratic utility function for the decision maker, study the NV problem with cost and profit models and show the variance to be an increasing function of order quantity. However, when stockout cost is considered, variance is no more a monotonically increasing function (Choi, Li, & Yan, 2008; Wu et al., 2009). Martínez‐de‐Albéniz and Simchi‐Levi (2006) study MV trade-offs faced by the buyer, while signing a portfolio of long-term contracts with its suppliers while having access to spot market. Choi et al. (2008) examine the issue of channel coordination in the supply chain when individual decision makers take the MV objective.


                     Berger, Gerstenfeld, and Zeng (2004) classify disruptive events into three types: Super event (failure of all suppliers), semi-super event (failure of a subset of suppliers) and unique event (failure of a single supplier). They use decision-tree approach to find the financial loss and operating cost of working with multiple suppliers considering only two events: super event and unique event. Their work is further extended by many authors (Ruiz–Torres & Mahmoodi, 2007; Sarkar & Mohapatra, 2009; Ray & Jenamani, 2013). While some authors observe sole sourcing method to be the lowest cost approach (Ruiz-Torres & Mahmoodi, 2007), other authors show that selection of multiple suppliers from a different location is more advantageous than selecting multiple suppliers from a single location (Sarkar & Mohapatra, 2009). For an extensive review on supply chain risk management readers may go through Snyder et al. (2012), Tang (2006) and Fahimnia, Tang, Davarzani, and Sarkis (2015)
                  

The application of MV analysis considering supply disruption is a relatively unexplored area. As discussed earlier, Tomlin (2006) considers risk aversion in the order allocation decision using MV analysis with small probabilities of severe events. Gaonkar and Viswanadham (2007) propose a strategic level disruption management model under deterministic inventory setting adopting ideas from MV model. They use a mixed integer programming formulation to minimize supply shortfall under disruption through optimal partner selection. Shu, Wu, Ni, & Chu, 2015 study the procurement/inventory problem of a risk-averse retailer with unreliable supplier and stochastic demand under MV setting. They develop an optimal strategy that can manage the retailer's supply risk effectively. For a comprehensive review of supply chain risk with MV models, please refer to Chiu and Choi (2013).

We consider a two-echelon supply chain with a buyer and multiple unreliable suppliers. The buyer orders a single product from her suppliers to meet random customer demand. The suppliers differ in price, as well as disruption probabilities and its consequences. In this situation, the buyer's problem is to decide how to allocate order, so that the expected profit is maximized, and the variance is (risk) minimized. We develop a model for the above problem in the classical NV framework. The buyer makes sourcing decision to satisfy total demand ‘x’ which is uncertain with probability density function f(x) and cumulative distribution function F(x). The buyer's unit selling price is ‘s’; unit salvage value is ‘r’ for the unsold stock and unit purchase cost from supplier ‘i’ is ‘ci
                     ’. In case of shortages, the associated loss of goodwill per unit is ‘k’. Before the period starts, the buyer, as the decision maker, needs to decide the order quantity ‘Qi
                     ’. When disruption occurs at supplier ‘i’ with probability ‘pi
                     ’, only a proportion of order quantity ‘yiQi
                     ’ is delivered. The standard assumptions associated with an NV model, including s > c > r and k > 0, are held for our analysis. Besides, we also assume that disruption probabilities are different for all the suppliers and percentage of the actual order supplied ‘yi
                     ’ is deterministic. To model this situation, we first calculate the expected profit for a risk-neutral buyer who is interested only in maximizing the expected profit. The model is further improved by incorporating the variance of profit as a measure of risk with risk-averseness parameter ‘A’. Here, Markowitz model maximizes expected profit for a given level of risk as variance or minimizes variance for a given expected profit.

The behavior of the variance function can be found by applying first and second order conditions to Eq. (4). However, the variance of profit behaves in a more complicated way due to the inclusion of different parameters (Choi et al., 2008; Martínez-de-Albéniz & Simchi-Levi, 2006; Wu et al., 2009).

                        Proposition 2 gives the sign of the first order condition of the variance function under different situations. Proposition 2 is used to characterize the nature of the variance function in Proposition 3. It turns out that, though variance function is quite complicated, there exists a global minimum, which can be found by using any gradient search procedure.


                        
                           Proposition 3
                           
                              The lower level sets of the variance of profit are connected, and there exists a unique global minimizer, which minimizes the profit-variance.

For proof of Proposition 2, illustration of a two-supplier case, and proof of Proposition 3 refer Sections A.2, A.2.1 and A.3 in Appendix A of the supplementary material respectively.

From Proposition 2, we can also show that the global minimum belongs to a bounded region under the assumption that the random demand ‘x’ has a finite second moment. The following proposition guarantees the boundedness of the variance function (Wu et al., 2009).

                        Propositions 1–4 study the structural property of the problem and justify the existence of global maxima in case of mean-variance problem (Theorem 1) as explained in the next section.

Under MV analysis, the buyer considers maximization of the expected profit under risk expressed as minimization of the variance of the profit. Combining the objective function of Eqs. (2) and (4) and associating a risk aversion parameter A, the buyer's objective function under the MV framework is given by problem PV.

The parameters such as selling price s, salvage value r and shortage cost k are independent of suppliers. Hence, their effect on the objective functions can be studied through comparative statics.

While studying the effect of selling price s on the expected profit (Eq. (2)) from the first order condition, we find that if

                        . Once again, this term is always less than one and very small compared to the mean demand. Therefore, without loss of generality it is equivalent to saying that, expected profit increases with respect to k when effective order quantity is higher than mean demand. Therefore, in the event of disruption the total order quantity must be sufficiently higher than the mean demand such that its effective value is higher than the mean demand. Detailed derivations for the first order conditions of effect parameters on expected profit is given in Section B.1 of Appendix B.

While considering the effect of the parameters s, r and k on the MV function from the first order condition, it is observed that the complexity increases. However, under certain condition we can find the sign of the MV function. The MV function is positive if,

In the RHS, the first and second terms in the square bracket are positive and greater than the third term (which is negative as r < s). After algebraic manipulation, we can show that RHS > LHS which makes the function negative. It implies that with increase in the selling price, MV function decreases. Similarly, considering the effect of salvage value on the MV function from the first order condition, the function is positive if,

                         and the third term is positive. After algebraic manipulation, we can show that the last term is smaller than the first two, which makes the RHS negative. As r > 0, the MV function is positive and increases with r. Similarly, under the following condition, it can also be shown that MV function decreases as shortage cost k increases.

The detailed derivation of the comparative statics of the MV function is given in Section B.2 of Appendix B, and the results of comparative statics of expected profit, and MV objective are summarized in Table 1
                        . As shown in the table, it may be observed that as selling price increases, the expected profit increases but MV objective decreases. Similarly, if salvage value increases both the expected profit and MV objective increase. However, when stockout cost is considered, the expected profit increases, if

The problems defined in Eqs. (2) and (5) have been proved to ensure unique global maximum. Hence, they can be solved using gradient search algorithms available in most commercial optimization softwares. However, the problem is computationally complex as the number of sub problems increase exponentially with supplier base size. In fact, for ‘n’ number of suppliers, the algorithm has to explore 2
                        n
                      − 1 combination making it impossible to explore the solution space computationally. In our earlier work (Ray & Jenamani, 2014), we suggest an algorithm for risk-neutral case, where the suppliers are sorted based on the decreasing order of expected purchase cost. Instead of solving for n supplier case in one go, we solve the problem for individual suppliers, then iteratively increase the number of suppliers starting from lowest expected purchase cost (equivalent to highest expected profit). In this line, we devise an algorithm for the MV problem. Our algorithm capitalizes the structure of the problem and is intuitive in nature. We deal with a set of suppliers who are not capacity constrained. Therefore, had there not been the case of disruption, the buyer would have bought the whole volume from the supplier who, if considered alone, can maximize the mean-variance objective (hereafter MVO) for each.

The intuition behind this is, if we place an order of one unit with a supplier with disruption probability pi
                     , percentage of actual supply under disruption yi
                     , and purchase cost ci
                     , then the best possible combinations of low ci
                     and pi
                      with high yi
                      will lead to highest MVO. The algorithm (Fig. 1) eliminates the ineffective suppliers at each stage and finds the list of effective suppliers following the principle of optimality.

As shown in Fig. 1, algorithm MVA uses vectors to store a set of selected suppliers and allocated order quantities for the respective suppliers. Both the vectors are set to null initially. All the suppliers are stored in the base list. For each supplier, PV function is solved and allocation vector is updated accordingly. The set is updated with the supplier with highest MVO and positive order quantity. A temporary list is prepared which consists of the suppliers other than the selected one. From the temporary list, the suppliers are added individually to the vector of selected suppliers. For each temporary set, order quantity and MVO are calculated. The suppliers assigned with zero order quantity are eliminated from the set, and the one with highest MVO from the remaining set is selected. The suppliers who are not in the set of selected suppliers and have not got zero order quantities in the previous iteration create sets of prospective suppliers by adding them individually to the set of selected supplier. If MVO in this set is same as that of its value in the previous iteration, then the algorithm is stopped and the previous allocation vector is returned which gives the optimal solution to the MV problem. In a multiple supplier order allocations problem, without capacity constraints, the one with low cost, low probability of disruption, and high availability maximizes the MVO and can satisfy the total demand, resulting in single sourcing. Due to disruption, if this supplier is unable to fulfill the total order quantity, then the next best supplier combination from the sorted list is selected, and so on, which results in multi-sourcing.


                     
                        Proposition 5
                        
                           Algorithm MVA gives the exact optimal solution.
                        


                     
                        Proof
                        The algorithm eliminates supplier getting no order in a specific stage. At this stage, call the supplier in the supplier base as effective supplier and those eliminated as ineffective group of suppliers. As long as the supply base contains these groups of effective suppliers, following the Principle of Optimality, at a later stage, the effective suppliers set is capable of replacing the ineffective ones. Hence, adding ineffective suppliers will not improve the solution. After elimination, the algorithm searches for the entire combination of effective suppliers exploring the entire solution region systematically in a sequential manner, which gives the exact solution.

The worst-case complexity of the proposed algorithm is much higher than the exact algorithms. However, selective elimination of ineffective group of suppliers with effective ones reduces the search space; thereby decreases the computational time. Our experience with numerical exercise in the next section shows that the algorithm stops after a few iterations that ultimately results in the reduction of execution time.

We conduct two numerical studies to illustrate the model and its solution approach. We first consider two supplier cases for its simplicity and visualize the results. Next, ten-supplier case is deliberated to understand the complexity of the problem. Table 2
                      gives typical values of unit selling price, salvage value, loss of goodwill due to product shortage, mean and standard deviation of demand faced by the buyer and risk-averseness parameter set by her. First, we illustrate the order allocation problem considering expected profit, variance of profit and mean-variance for a two-supplier case. Next, sensitivity analysis is performed to study the impact of various parameters on the order allocation and objective function. Each problem is solved by using optimization toolbox of MATLAB 8.0(R2012b) software on windows 8, 64-bit OS with 4 gigabyte RAM.

                         and demand is normal with mean 400 and standard deviation 130. The color bars alongside the figure show the correspondence between the function value and the color code. As proved in Proposition 1, the expected profit function is concave (Fig. 2(a)) with the global maximum at the top (see color bar). Profit-variance (Fig. 2(b)) though not exactly convex, appears to be pseudo-convex, and has the global minimum (blue region extreme bottom) as suggested in Propositions 2 and 3. The MV objective (Fig. 2(c)) is rather complicated but still has a global maximum.

In Fig. 2(d), the curve represents the portfolios under optimal MV trade-off (Theorem 1). This efficient frontier is the curve with order quantity intervals [9.33, 0] and [484.38, 120.99] for suppliers 1 and 2 respectively, i.e.,

                         are for the variance criterion for suppliers 1 and 2 respectively. To construct this curve, we take a specific value of Q
                        1 in the range

                         and solve problem (PV) to obtain the value of Q
                        2 that maximizes the objective function in Eq. (5). Every point on solid line part of this curve gives a set of optimal MV order allocation portfolios. Since expectation and variance of the profit are continuous, we can find a continuum of MV pairs.

Similarly, contour plots for order allocation pairs Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 for both the suppliers are shown in Fig. 3(a), (b), and (c) respectively. All the figures use the parameters specified in Table 2. As the functions are relatively flat for several combinations of Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 at the neighborhood of optimal 
                           
                              Q
                              1
                              *
                           
                         and 
                           
                              Q
                              2
                              *
                           
                        , the proposed ordering policy appears to be robust and economically insensitive to minor changes on the optimal value of decision variables.

Further observation reveals that in Fig. 3(a), when the decision maker (buyer) is risk-neutral, i.e., does not consider MV trade-off; order quantity allocated to the first supplier is always more than the second for a specific profit level is. This is justified as the former's probability of disruption is less and cost is low compared to the latter. Fig. 3(b) shows the effect of Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 on profit-variance. It is optimal to take order from the second supplier to minimize the risk as variance. This result is corroborated by the fact that even under disruption, the second supplier is able to supply up to 90 percent of the order quantity, while the first supplier supplies only 60 percent. This fact is also reflected in Fig. 3(c). Comparing Fig. 3(a) and (c) we can see that a risk-averse buyer tends to order more from supplier 2 as compared to supplier 1 even if the later's probability of disruption and price is comparatively low. In this case, the buyer can enjoy a large amount of reduction in variance of profit by sacrificing a small amount of expected profit.

Depending on the value of purchase cost, disruption probabilities and consequences of disruption, one of the suppliers may dominate the other one. Sometimes it may lead to single sourcing. Generally, the source with a low purchase cost, low disruption probability, and high availability will attract more orders. For different combinations of the values of probability of disruption, its effect, and purchase cost, dual sourcing may perform better than single sourcing. To explore these scenarios we carry out the sensitivity analysis of the model with various input parameters.

Typically, in the absence of any uncertainty if the profit is to be maximized, the supplier with lowest purchase cost ci
                         gets the order. However, in our case, due to disruption and supply uncertainty, considering the purchase cost alone will not solve our purpose. As suggested in Ray and Jenamani (2014), if we consider the effective cost 
                           
                              c
                              i
                              eff
                           
                         (per unit expected purchase cost) instead of the actual, the supplier with lowest effective cost will get the order under profit maximization criterion (Eq. (2)). Here, the effective cost defined as

                         is the expected supply received for unit order placed with the supplier. Referring to the two-supplier data, in Section 7.1, effective cost for suppliers 1 and 2 turns out to be 20.58 and 23.76 respectively. Table 3
                         shows the case of single and dual sourcing scenarios for expected profit maximization, variance minimization and mean-variance criterion. In each case the order quantity QE
                        , effective supply considering disruption Q
                        eff, expected profit, and profit variance calculated from Eqs. (2) and (4) are presented.

From Table 3, we observe that when both the suppliers are considered individually, supplier 1 with lower effective cost generates higher profit than supplier 2 under expected profit criterion. Consequently, when both the suppliers are considered together, supplier 1 gets the entire order. However, when we compare the profit variance in single sourcing case under expected profit maximization criterion, it may be observed that supplier 2 has the lower variance. But, he does not get any order, as the buyer is risk-neutral. However, in case of variance minimization (Eq. (4)) in single sourcing case supplier 2 has lower variance. Therefore, when both the suppliers are considered together, supplier 2 gets more order in case of variance minimization. A risk-averse decision maker maximizes profit while minimizing risk. Hence, order is splitted between both the suppliers; expected profit is higher compared to variance minimization case and variance is lower than the expected profit maximization case. The actual order for each supplier depends on risk aversion parameter A, which is 0.1 in this case. Lowering it further can increase the order quantity for supplier 1 and for A = 0, the result becomes equivalent to risk-neutral case. It is also to be noted that when two suppliers are considered the variance decreases due to diversification in all the cases.

During comparative statics analysis, we have not taken care of the parameters pi
                         and yi
                         as it would have been complicated for n supplier case. Tables 4
                        
                         and 5 show the impact of an increase in parameters pi
                         and yi
                         on the order quantity and objective function. The first row in the table indicates the level of the parameter. The second, third and fourth rows show the optimal order quantities with mean as the optimal criterion (QE
                        ), variance as the optimal criterion (QV
                        ), and MV criterion (Q
                        MV) respectively. The fifth to seventh rows indicate optimal values of the objective functions in case of maximum expected profit, minimum variance and MV objective respectively. In each case, besides the parameter under consideration, all other parameters remain unchanged (Table 2). To consider the impact of probability of disruption (pi
                        ), we alter pi
                         from 0.05 to 0.20 (step 0.05) keeping the value of all other parameter fixed for both the suppliers in Tables 4 and 5 respectively. We make four observations from Table 4. First, as expected, the order quantities Q
                        MV lie within QE
                         and QV
                         respectively (Theorem 1). Second, as the probability of disruption of the supplier increases, the total order quantity increases in both expected profit and variance criterion, but decreases in case of MV with the rate of change being highest in the expected profit criterion as risk is not taken care of. Third, the individual order quantities of both the suppliers change in variance and MV criterion with a decrease in case of the first supplier and an increase in case of the second as uncertainty increases at the end of the first supplier. Fourth, the optimal value of the objective function in expectation criterion (GE
                        ) decreases while order quantity increase due to increase in uncertainty and buyer's inability to handle risk. Whereas, the corresponding MV criterion (G
                        MV) decreases while total order quantity does not change considerably due to buyer's risk-averseness.

In Table 5, we alter the consequence of disruption, i.e., y
                        1 from 0.3 to 0.9 (step 0.3) and observe that the order quantities Q
                        MV lie within QE
                         and QV
                         respectively. As the availability in supplier 1 increases, the total order quantity increases in expected profit, variance, and MV criterion respectively. The total order quantity is allocated to supplier 1 in the expected profit criterion, whereas it is splitted among many suppliers in both variance and MV criterion. As the availability y
                        1 increases, supplier 1 attracts more order quantities than supplier 2. The optimal value of the objective function (GE
                         and G
                        MV) increases with increase in the order quantities (QE, Q
                        MV), whereas, the variance decreases. We have an equivalent scenario considering the impact of disruption probability and its consequences for the second supplier as well and for brevity we do not show the result.

The results of impact of disruption probability (Table 4) and its consequences (Table 5) are summarized in Table 6
                        
                        
                        
                        . As shown in the table, the expected profit and MV objective decreases with increase in parameter p
                        i, except when the supplier does not have lowest effective cost.

In Tables 4 and 5, it is observed that risk-averse decision maker orders less than the risk-neutral one. This is contrary to the results of Wu et al. (2009), where they claim that consideration of stockout cost makes risk-averse decision maker to order more. To ensure this result we try with a range of k values (Table 7) and observe that the results of Wu et al. (2009) is not valid when disruption risk is considered. This may be because the risk-averse decision maker is conservative and does not want to procure unnecessary additional units, which, while protecting her from stockout situation under disruption, increases the purchase cost and forces her to salvage the items in a price lower than the purchase cost.

The impact of risk aversion parameter (A) is given in Table 8. As shown in the table, it is observed that the total order quantity and mean-variance objective (MVO) decreases with increase in risk-averseness. This is due to the fact that, when A = 0, the risk-averse buyer becomes risk-neutral and orders more, whereas, when A > 0, the buyer becomes more risk-averse and order less. (This result is similar to Eeckhoudt et al., 1995, and Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000 without considering disruption risk and Ma, Xue, Zhao, & Zeng, 2015 with supply uncertainty.)

We consider a ten-supplier case (Table 9) to understand computational complexity of the problem and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Columns 2–4 in the table give the value of probability of disruption, consequences of disruption, and supply cost (i.e., purchase cost of the buyer). Considering single supplier case, the expected profit and MV objective value (MVO) are given in Table 9, columns 5 and 7 respectively. Referring to the discussion in Section 6, the suppliers are first sorted based on the decreasing order of the objective values. The corresponding sorted index for each supplier is depicted in columns 6 and 8 respectively. For example, in expected profit criterion, supplier 5 has sorted index 1 in column 6 as he generates the highest expected profit, whereas supplier 8 has the sorted index 1 in the MV criterion. All other parameters for each supplier in the above calculation are same as that of Table 2.
                     

Since both expected profit and MV criterion function have unique global maxima (Proposition 1 and Theorem 1), it is possible to solve both the problem using gradient search procedures present in MATLAB. Table 10
                        
                        
                         shows the result of exact optimization algorithm taking the top j (j = 1,…,n) suppliers from the sorted list for profit maximization criterion (Table 9, column 6). As shown in the table, it is observed that the CPU time increases with increase in the supply base. The supply base is upgraded by adding the next best supplier each time from the sorted list. Both the order quantity and expected profit increase with the supply base and remain constant after 2nd row onwards. It is interesting to observe that, even though the supply base increases, the order allocation vector and the objective values remain unchanged demonstrating that top two suppliers are sufficient to manage disruption risk in case of risk-neutral buyer (Ray & Jenamani, 2014).


                        Fig. 4 shows the execution path of MVA algorithm in a tree diagram form for n supplier case, where S0 denotes the starting node. In stage 1, MVO values for each supplier is calculated and the supplier with maximum MVO (S8) is selected. Next, S8 is paired with remaining suppliers. The MVO and corresponding order quantity are obtained for each two-supplier combination in stage 2. The highest MVO from the combinations is selected and the suppliers having zero order quantity (S1, S6, S7, S9 and S10) are eliminated from further consideration. Similarly, in stage 3, the MVO and optimal order quantity are obtained for each three-supplier combination by adding S2, S3 and S5 respectively together with S8 and S4. The last node in Fig. 4 shows the end of the search process and the star marked suppliers on path with red line are the optimal set of selected suppliers. If we directly solve the n supplier case, using any exact optimization algorithm, it is required to solve 2
                           n
                        
                        −
                        1 combination, and computational time would be very high. For example, 2000 minutes is required for solving 1 six-supplier case. However, if we will consider MVO tree diagram (Fig. 4), for a ten-supplier case, we have to solve 10 single-supplier, 9 two-supplier, 3 three-supplier, 2 four-supplier and 1 five-supplier cases leading to total time 1520 minutes which are substantially less than the time taken by exact optimization algorithm.


                        Table 11 shows the result of exact optimization algorithm taking the top j (j = 1,…,n) suppliers considered in the execution path of MVA algorithm (Fig. 4). As shown in the table, it can be observed that the order quantity and objective value increases as the number of supplier increases and remains constant after 5th row onwards. In the sixth row, we deliberately add one supplier who has been eliminated at the second stage itself. Addition of this supplier does not change the result. Thus ten-supplier case can be solved by the proposed algorithm in lesser time than that is taken by six-supplier case (>2000 minutes) using exact optimization algorithm.

Order allocation decision brings enormous risks for a buyer, especially when disruption is likely to occur, and stock is limited. Thus, there is a need to take decision in this scenario considering both the expected profit as well as the associated risk. For this purpose, we propose mean-variance (MV) trade-off model for optimal order allocation in multi-sourcing setting for a risk-averse buyer. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed work is the first attempt to apply the concept of MV trade-off with disruption management in newsvendor (NV) setting. The concavity of the expected profit function, and pseudo-convexity and boundedness of the variance function ensure existence of the optimal order quantities in MV trade-off. Though the MV function is complex, we prove the existence of a global maximum. Since expectation and variance of profit are continuous, we find a continuum of MV pairs that make the efficient frontier bounded by the maximum expectation and minimum variance order allocation portfolios.

To show the effect of input parameters such as selling price, salvage value and stockout cost on the objective function, we perform comparative statics analysis. Through sensitivity analysis, we observe that risk-neutral NV orders more than the risk-averse one, even when stockout cost is considered, which is contrary to the earlier literature. Therefore, disruption has a major impact in buyer's attitude as well as the ordering decision. Different decision makers do have different degrees of risk aversion. In this context, our finding is that, as the degree of risk aversion increases, total optimal order quantities decreases, but the supplier with lower supply variability gets more order. An algorithm is proposed for the MV problem to overcome the computational complexity, which gives the same solution as that of the exact algorithm in the reasonable time. It can assist practitioners in multi-sourcing decision-making situations under disruption risks.

Future research on this work can be extended in several ways. Single period, single product model for a two-echelon supply chain proposed here can be extended to multi-product, multi-period or multi-stage environment. We have considered the consequence of disruption to be deterministic, but in real world, it is uncertain. Therefore, the model can be extended by taking stochastic consequence of disruption. Another approach to extend the current model includes disruption correlation, as suppliers are correlated through their customers, sub-suppliers, and geographic proximity. Finally, development of supply contract under spot market risk in case of supply disruption is an interesting future direction.
