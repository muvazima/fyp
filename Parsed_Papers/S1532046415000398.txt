                  One of the challenging problems in drug discovery is to identify the novel targets for drugs. Most of the traditional methods for drug targets optimization focused on identifying the particular families of “druggable targets”, but ignored their topological properties based on the biological pathways. In this study, we characterized the topological properties of human anticancer drug targets (ADTs) in the context of biological pathways. We found that the ADTs tended to present the following seven topological properties: influence the number of the pathways related to cancer, be localized at the start or end of the pathways, interact with cancer related genes, exhibit higher connectivity, vulnerability, betweenness, and closeness than other genes. We first ranked ADTs based on their topological property values respectively, then fused them into one global-rank using the joint cumulative distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic to optimize human ADTs. We applied the optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. Results demonstrated that over 70% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20%. Furthermore, the performance for mercaptopurine was significant: 6 known targets (ADSL, GMPR2, GMPR, HPRT1, AMPD3, AMPD2) were ranked in the top 15 and other four out of the top 15 (MAT2A, CDKN1A, AREG, JUN) have the potentialities to become new targets for cancer therapy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The identification of novel drug targets is a major challenge in medicine and biology. Traditionally, most studies have focused on the identification of particular families of “druggable targets” and achieved significant success [1,2]. However, genes rarely function in isolation in a complex biological system, especially when a patient undergoes drug treatment (such as the anticancer therapy). A growing body of evidence indicate that drug design should focus on all the drug-affected genes simultaneously from the genome-wide perspective [3]. Recently, with the development of high-throughput biological experimental technologies, a large collection of gene expression profiles with drug treatments is available, such as the Connectivity Map (CMap) [4]. Many expression-based approaches have emerged for further understanding of drug mechanisms in the whole genome [5–7]. These methods have primarily focused on single drug target without considering the interactions among them. Studies have demonstrated that the drugs affect not only their intended targets but also other genes that interact with them or trigger the downstream molecular events [8]. The increasing use of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) allowed for network-based approach to predict novel drug targets [9–11]. These studies showed that some topological properties, including betweenness, closeness and connectivity, within protein–protein network could distinguish known ADTs from other genes significantly. Thus, the topological properties within protein–protein network can be used to better assess the potentiality of a node as a novel drug target [9–11].

Biological pathways that belong to more accurate network-based data have superior properties that naturally suited to discover novel drug targets [12,13]. Firstly, the pathways were reliable because they were curated manually from scientific literature, such as the KEGG PATHWAY Database [14]. Secondly, it was convenient to consider a pathway in isolation as a particular function module [15,16]. Thus, it was feasible to map the drug targets into certain pathways to elucidate the mechanisms of action of the drug. Finally, the biological pathways were directional. So, it was practical to assess the importance of the potential drug targets according to its position or interaction [16,17]. For example, the insulin receptor (INSR), which was involved in the insulin pathway and the adherens junction pathway, plays a more important role in insulin pathway due to its terminal position and high connectivity compared to its role in adherens junction pathway [18]. Taken together, the biological pathways are highly valuable and powerful for optimization of the drug targets.

In this study, we carefully analyzed the topological properties of human ADTs in the context of biological pathways and found seven topological properties that could distinguish known ADTs from other genes significantly. We proposed an optimization approach for human ADTs through integrating all seven pathway-level topological properties to rank the candidate ADTs. Our pathway-based method can help solve some limitations of PPI-based methods, including (1) the lack of consideration regarding the functional module in which several genes carry out a specific function together, (2) the difficulty in understanding the global importance of any gene in one module or across all of these various functional modules, (3) the directionless assessment of information transfer across the genes in functional module. We applied this method to 13 anticancer drugs respectively, and achieved good optimization, particularly for the drugs mercaptopurine and methotrexate. In conclusion, the optimization strategy we developed, which was based on pathway-level topological properties, offers a new sight and could aid in the discovery of novel anticancer drug targets.

The drug targets dataset was downloaded from the KEGG and DrugBank database [14,19]. We extracted all the anticancer drugs and their targets according to the disease and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) information. Finally, we obtained 573 “anticancer drug–target” relationships and 155 targets.

To test whether the known ADTs interacted with the cancer related genes, cancer genes (CGs), cancer hallmark genes (CHMGs), known anticancer drug target genes (KADTGs) and genes encoding the nuclear membrane proteins (NMPGs) were used as four types of special neighbor genes, which were important for cancer initiation, progression and therapy in the following analysis.

766 CGs were obtained from the report by Li et al. [20]. CHMGs in the study were defined as genes functionally involved in the six cancer hallmarks, including self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis [21]. We obtained 1320 genes as CHMGs, which were functionally annotated with “DNA repair”, “cell growth”, “cell proliferation”, “angiogenesis”, “cell migration”, and “locomotion” from Gene Ontology (GO) [22]. KADTGs mean genes known as anticancer drug targets, we obtained 155 KADTGs from KEGG and DrugBank. NMPGs mean genes that encode the nuclear membrane proteins. In particular, we selected 149 NMPGs with a nuclear membrane subcellular location from the Uniprot Knowlegebase (UniprotKB) [23].

Information regarding the biological pathways was obtained from the KEGG PATHWAY database [14], including metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. We used the R-based software package SubpathwayMiner to reconstruct all pathways graphically [15]. This type of reconstruction retains the raw information of the pathways, particularly the structures, and provides detailed and reliable information for analyzing the ADT topological properties based on these biological pathways.

In order to optimize the targets for anticancer drugs from the whole genome, we utilized transcriptional data for cultured human cancer cells treated with anticancer drugs obtained from CMap (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/). The library contains 6100 instances of 4 cancer cell lines treated with 1309 distinct small molecules [4]. We downloaded all the instances, gene expression profiles and their associated annotation file “cmap_instances_02.xls” from the CMap website. According to the annotation information, 42 among the 1309 bioactive small molecules were anticancer drugs. The instance information that these drugs corresponded to were used to extract the anticancer drug gene expression data.

To validate that the candidate targets with prior rank have closely correlation with cancer patients’ survival time, we downloaded 9 gene expression profiles of cancers with the survival time information from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/): 3 lung adenocarcinoma profiles (GSE13213, GSE3141, GSE8894), 3 breast cancer profiles (GSE2990, GSE4922, GSE1456), and 3 colon cancer profiles (GSE12945, GSE17536, GSE14333).

@&#METHODS@&#

We identified the candidate targets for each anticancer drug according to its expression profiles from the CMap database [24]. For each instance of drug, we matched perturbation and control pairs of expression profiles according to descriptions of the instances in the file “cmap_instances_02.xls”. Then we used fold-change analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each instance with |log2fold-change|>log21.5 (gene expression up-regulated or down-regulated 1.5 folds) between the corresponding treatments and control gene expression profiles. The DEGs were merged if the corresponding instances belonged to the same drug, these genes were considered to be anticancer drug affected genes. As a result, of 42 anticancer drugs in CMap, we obtained the corresponding 13,082 DEGs which were significantly affected by at least two anticancer drugs. An anticancer drug can correspond to 1345 genes on average. They were considered as the candidate targets for anticancer drug and were used to identify the cancer related crucial pathways.

The pathways that satisfied the following three rules were considered to be CRCPs: associated with cancer initiation and progression; important for cancer therapy; and prone to be affected by the anticancer drugs. Subsequently, we performed pathway annotated analysis for three gene sets: cancer gene set (766 genes), known ADT gene set (155 genes), and anticancer drug affected gene set (13082 genes). The concurrently annotated pathways for these three gene sets were regarded as the CRCPs and used for analyzing the topological properties of the known ADTs.

For each gene in CRCPs, we calculated the following seven pathway-level topological properties: (1) the number of CRCPs influenced; (2) the positional tendency: We divided each CRCP into three kinds of positions: start, median and end. According to the degree distribution of all nodes (genes) in CRCP, the nodes with 0 in-degree and their immediate neighbors were defined as the nodes located at start position, the nodes with 0 out-degree and their immediate neighbors were defined as the nodes located at end position, and the remaining nodes were defined as the nodes located at median position; (3) the extent of the four types of special neighbor genes (CGs, CHMGs, KADTGs, NMPGs) simultaneously existed; (4) the average connectivity across all CRCPs; (5) the average betweenness across all CRCPs; (6) the average closeness across all CRCPs; (7) the average vulnerability across all CRCPs: For each CRCP, the vulnerability was calculated based on the global efficiency characteristics [25] which denotes the efficiency of the CRCP in sending information between the nodes. We calculated the average vulnerability for each gene across all CRCPs which it influenced. The corresponding formulas and short descriptions are listed in Table 1
                            and the detailed descriptions are shown in Supplementary Information.

The selection of a prospective ADT is a complex balance in which numerous conditions were considered. We compared all of the seven pathway-level topological properties simultaneously to rank the candidate ADTs like the method of Endeavor [26]. Specifically, we used the order statistics to combine the seven different ranks from the seven pathway-level topological property values. A “M” statistic was computed from all seven rank ratios using the joint cumulative distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic.

                           =7).

For each anticancer drug, we selected top 20% candidate targets as the biomarkers to perform the survival analyses. For a gene expression profile of cancers with the survival time information, the cancer patients were clustered into two groups according to the biomarker genes’ expression using the k-means clustering method [27]. Then, according to the survival information of the cancer patients, we created the survival curves for the above two groups. The survival curves were compared with the log-rank test and got a p-value [27]. The smaller the p-value the more closely correlated with the cancer patient survival time for the biomarkers (top candidate targets). Here, we used the survival package for the R statistical computing platform.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The biological pathways themselves provide valuable information in drug targets identification and optimization. Our current aim is to optimize the targets for anticancer drugs. So, we focused on the biological pathways associated with cancer. We selected the cancer related crucial pathways (CRCPs). The pathways that satisfied the three rules were considered as CRCPs: they are associated with cancer initiation and progression; important for cancer therapy; prone to be affected by anticancer drugs (see details in Section 2.2). Totally, we identified 119 CRCPs, including purine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, etc. Most of them are closely associated with the cancer initiation, progression, and therapy [28–30]. We then characterized the topological properties of the known ADTs in the context of these CRCPs, including: the number of CRCPs they influenced; their positional tendency; their interactions with cancer related genes; their betweenness, closeness, connectivity and vulnerability. We used the following seven measurements to quantify the above topological properties respectively, called CRCPN, APS, ASNS, AB, AC, AD, and AV (see Table 1 and Supplementary Methods for detailed formulas and descriptions). As shown in Table 2
                        , the CRCPN of known ADTs was significantly higher than that of control set (all genes in all CRCPs) (P-value=1.98e−08, the significance was calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test unless otherwise noted). On average, the CRCPN of the known ADTs was two times as much as that of control set, and over half of known ADTs participated in over three CRCPs. This suggests that the ADTs tend to influence a greater number of pathways associated with cancer. Ille et al. also reported that multi-pathway proteins presented to be good potential drug targets [11].

For one gene, its function and importance may vary according to its location in the pathway. To test whether the ADT positional tendency differed from other genes, we divided each CRCP into three kinds of positions: start, median, and end. We quantified them by the measurements of APS, called: APS_start, APS_median, and APS_end. The results demonstrated that, compared with control set, the known ADTs tended to be localized to the start or end of CRCPs (P-value=0.02; P-value=8.52e−3). This implied that the ADTs were prone to be localized to the gate of the biological pathways where the biological signals influx or efflux. We combined these two kinds of positions into one category, called “terminal” and utilized the measurement of ATPS to quantify it (see Table 1).

Genes rarely perform their function in isolation underlying the pathways; the neighboring interactions potentially determine their importance to a certain extent [18]. We investigated whether there is a special relationship with the neighbors in proximity to the known ADTs. To test this, we chose four types of genes important for cancer initiation, progression, and therapy: CGs, CHMGs, KADTGs, NMPGs [20–23]. We used ASNS_cgs, ASNS_chmgs, ASNS_kadtgs, and ASNS_nmpgs to quantify them, respectively (see Supplementary Methods for detailed formulas and descriptions). As shown in Table 2, compared with control set, it was more likely that the known ADTs interacted with other known ADTs (P-value=6.34e−76) and the cancer genes (P-value=0.04). In addition, the known ADTs tended to regulate the downstream cancer hallmark genes to a greater extent than control set (P-value=8.93e−10). Hanahan et al. reported that the anticancer drugs, which could target each of the cancer hall-mark (CHM) capabilities, were required [21]. Therefore, if the CHMs were regulated by the ADTs it would help prevent incipient cancer from progressing. Moreover, the known ADTs also tended to regulate the downstream NMPGs more likely than that of control set (P-value=1.87e−05). Nuclear membrane proteins play key roles for the signals transferred into the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Thus, it will be helpful for the information dissemination of the cancer therapy if the NMPGs were regulated by the ADTs. Taken together, it could be potentially helpful for cancer therapy if these four types of special neighbors are simultaneously present around the ADTs. Thus, we considered the four types of neighbors that could be simultaneously present and used the measurement of AFSNS to quantitate this analysis (see Table 1).

Additionally, we analyzed four other basic topological properties that reflected the importance of a certain gene or protein across the CRCPs: betweenness, closeness, connectivity and vulnerability. As shown in Table 2, the betweenness and connectivity of the known ADTs were much greater compared to the control set (P-value=1.50e−05; P-value=7.55e−08). This suggests that the known ADTs are more likely to be the hub-bottlenecks in CRCPs; previous studies have also shown that the known drug targets tended to have more neighbors [9] and to bridge two or more clusters in PPIs [31]. Moreover, we found that the known ADTs had the tendency to have higher closeness (P-value=0.028), indicating that the known ADTs may potentially influence other molecules more rapidly in the CRCPs. The significantly higher vulnerability (P-value=1.34e−05) of known ADTs also suggested their critical roles in sending information in the whole CRCP, of which the deletion would result in a lower level of communication.

Selection of prospective ADTs is a delicate balance in which numerous conditions should be considered. In order to optimize the human ADTs systematically, we considered all above seven properties that the ADTs shared in the level of biological pathways simultaneously to rank the candidate ADTs. Ultimately, using the method of Endeavor [26], seven distinct prioritizations were generated for each candidate ADT and then fused into one global-rank (see Section 2.2 for detail optimization pipeline). We applied this optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively, and affected genes of each anticancer drug that mapped into CRCPs were considered as its candidate targets. As shown in Fig. 1
                        , over 70% of known ADTs on average were ranked in the top 20%. Specifically, for 10 of the 13 anticancer drugs, half of their known targets ranked in the top 20%. Moreover, 6 of these 10 drugs (azacitidine, carmustine, gefitinib, methotrexate, nilutamide, thalidomide) exhibited a good performance that all of their known targets were ranked in the top 20%. We analyzed the top 30% candidate ADTs for each anticancer drug. Result showed there were 12 drugs having over 50% known ADTs appeared in the top 30%. Furthermore, there were 8 drugs having all known ADTs also appeared in the top 30%. Over 50% of known ADTs for each of these 12 drugs and all known ADTs for these 8 drugs appeared in the top 30% suggesting that most of the known ADTs can be efficiently recalled according to our approach. To quantify the probabilities of the known ADTs appeared ahead, we calculated the ratio of the observed to expected number of known targets (called OER) for the 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2
                        , the OERs were significantly increased along with an increase in global-rank. In particular, the maximum probability of known ADTs in the top 10% was 5.3 times as much as expected indicating the potency of candidate ADTs with prior global-rank to exhibit a greater likelihood of being novel ones.

Furthermore, based on the expression, a potentially useful ADT should be able to aid in the determination of cancer patients’ survival time. Thus, to validate if the genes with prior global-ranks have a strong association with cancer patients’ survival time, we downloaded nine gene expression profiles of cancer cases with patient survival time information from the GEO database: three lung adenocarcinoma profiles, three breast cancer profiles, and three colon cancer profiles (see details in Datasets). For each anticancer drug, we selected the candidate targets with high ranks (top 20%) and performed the survival analysis (see details in Datasets). We found that the candidate targets with prior ranks were closely associated with the survival time (p
                        ⩽0.05, log-rank test) (Fig. 3
                        a). In addition, a survival analysis was constructed for the bottom 20% of candidate targets, but the associations with survival time were not as strong as for targets ranked ahead, and the difference was significant (Fig. 3b and c). This finding indicated that priorization of the candidate targets based on the pathway-level topological properties is reliable. In order to further illustrate the effect and power of our method in optimizing ADTs, we analyzed the next two anticancer drugs: mercaptopurine and methotrexate.

Mercaptopurine, a purine analogue interfering with nucleic acid biosynthesis by inhibiting purine metabolism, is used to prevent the formation and spread of cancer cells. According to the records in Drug Bank and KEGG, it has 12 known targets. We identified 108 candidate targets which were mapped into 96 CRCPs according to our method. Eleven of 12 known targets were ranked within the top 30 among the list of 108 genes. Moreover, six of 12 known targets were ranked within the top 15 (Table 3
                        ). Other 9 candidate targets were also reported as potential novel targets for mercaptopurine. The top ranked known targets, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), was involved in the purine metabolism pathway and its direct neighbors were crucial for the success of cancer therapy. For instance, the known targets adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS) was an upstream neighbor and AMP deaminase was a downstream one; the cancer gene deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and the cancer hallmark gene adenosine kinase (ADK) were in downstream (Supplementary Fig. 1). Methionine adenosyltransferase II-alpha (MAT2A), ranked second, was not described as a known target for mercaptopurine according to the Drug Bank and KEGG databases. This suggested that MAT2A may be a new target of Mercaptopurine. We found that MAT2A was reported to play an important role in facilitating cancer growth. Its expression was increased in cancer cells such as liver and colon cancer and it may hold potency as a new target for antineoplastic therapy [32,33]. Liu et al. suggested that the down regulation of MAT2A potentially inhibited the liver cancer growth [32]. Interestingly, according to the CMap, MAT2A was significantly down-regulated by the stimulus of mercaptopurine. This indicated that MAT2A exhibited strong potential as a novel target for mercaptopurine. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, p21), amphiregulin (AREG), and jun proto-oncogene (JUN) ranked sixth, tenth and eleventh, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4
                        , were involved in the ErbB signaling pathway simultaneously, and all of them were located in terminal positions (inlet or outlet of the signals fluxing through the pathway). The dysregulation of the ErbB signaling pathway has a strong association with multiple cancers [34,35] and Shah et al. proposed that targeting the ErbB signaling could potentially serve as a therapy for management of prostatic cancer [36]. The AREG, one of the ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), participates in five hallmarks of cancer, including self-sufficiency in growth signals, evading apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis [37]. Due to its multiple functions in tumorigenesis, AREG exhibits a promising target for cancer treatment. Furthermore, Busser et al. suggested that it was required to target the expression or activity of AREG in cancer treatment [38]. According to the CMap, AREG was significantly down-regulated under the stimulus of mercaptopurine. This indicated that the ErbB signaling might be partly inhibited by the treatment of mercaptopurine against AREG. Additionally, the other two candidate targets, JUN and p21, were also implicated in a variety of human cancers [39,40]. Their positions in the ErbB pathway were crucial: they have the special upstream neighbors such as known targets and cancer genes, and they were the outlets for the signals across the whole pathway. Thus, their disturbances directly correlated with the angiogenesis, adhesion, and cell cycle progression associated with oncogenesis. In summary, our optimization approach was reliable and significant, and the candidate targets ranked highly in our study could be potential novel targets for mercaptopurine.

Methotrexate helps to inhibit the growth of cancer cells by preventing the synthesis of DNA and RNA using folate. According to DrugBank and KEGG databases, there was only one known target, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), that participated in tetrahydrofolate synthesis [41]. This means that our method can rank candidate targets based on an almost blinded information of the known drug targets. Since our method is effective for the drug with known targets, it can be applied to new drugs lacking known targets as well. According to the CMap, we identified 307 differentially expressed genes which mapped into 115 CRCPs as the candidate targets of methotrexate. We optimized the 307 candidate targets based on our pipeline, and DHFR was ranked fifth (Table 3). The top four candidate targets were not described as a known target for mercaptopurine according to the Drug Bank and KEGG databases. Cystathionase (CTH) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), ranked first and second respectively, participated simultaneously in the selenocompound metabolism pathway. These two genes encoded the critical enzymes for biosynthesis of the L-selenomethionine and methylselenol, which suppress cell growth of several human cancers [42–44]. According to the CMap, we found that CTH and MTR were significantly up-regulated by the stimulus of methotrexate. This indicated that methotrexate potentially inhibited the growth and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells by heightening the concentration of L-selenomethionine and methylseleno through up-regulation of CTH or MTR. Thus, CTH and MTR may be potential new targets of methotrexate. Another top-ranked candidate, phospholipase C-delta 1 (PLCD1), as a potential novel target [45], was mapped to three CRCPs: phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway and inositol phosphate metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 2). But its importance was different in these three CRCPs due to its different position. It was located in three critical positions in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway and it was the essential mediator for the signal flux in this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The entire phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway might be heavily perturbed if PLC (encoded by the PLCD1) were absent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol signaling network may contribute to carcinogenesis, and PLCD1 was one of the most significantly down-regulated genes in it [46]. According to Xiang et al., PLCD1 could inhibit cancer cell migration and induce the cell cycle G2/M arrest [47]. Therefore, the up-regulation of PLCD1 could potentially contribute to cancer therapy. Interestingly, PLCD1 was also up-regulated by the treatment of methotrexate. Thus, PLCD1 exhibits the strong potential for being a novel target for methotrexate.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The selection of prospective targets for an anticancer drug involves multiple considerations. In this article, we characterized the pathway-level topological properties of ADTs and found that some topological properties could significantly distinguish them from other genes. The ADTs tend to influence more cancer related crucial pathways; they tend to be localized to terminal positions; they have a greater number of interactions with other known ADTs and cancer genes; they tend to regulate the cancer hallmark genes or genes encoded nucleus membrane proteins; they play key roles in keeping the pathway structure and the information transfer because of the higher closeness, betweenness, connectivity, and vulnerability. Therefore, we suggest that these pathway-level topological properties should be considered when optimizing the ADTs.

Based on these pathway-level topological properties, we provided an optimization method for human ADTs. Nearly 72% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20% on average, and almost 80% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 30%. In addition, we found that the top ranked candidates displayed a close correlation with the cancer patients’ survival time. Furthermore, we applied the optimization method to mercaptopurine and methotrexate. For mercaptopurine, six known targets were ranked in the top 15 candidate targets. Almost all of the other nine were found to be potential new targets for cancer therapy. For mercaptopurine, the several top candidate targets ranked by our method were found to be potential new targets for cancer therapy, although the drug has an almost blinded information of the known drug targets. Our results demonstrated that the pathway-level topological properties we used were informative and practically useful for human ADT optimization. The optimization method we proposed potentially offers a global insight into the underlying mechanisms of anticancer drug actions and it could potentially be applied to other kinds of drugs without prior targets information.

The PPI-based approaches for optimizing anticancer drug targets has mainly focused on topological features, including betweenness, closeness and connectivity to assess the potentiality of a node as a novel drug target. However, they ignored the importance of a functional module and the direction assessment of information transfer across the genes in a functional module. Our method, a pathway-based approach for optimizing anticancer drug targets, naturally suited to use information of a functional module because a pathway is naturally considered as a particular function module. More importantly, the biological pathways are directed and thus can be used to assess the importance of the potential drug targets according to its position. We found that the ADTs tended to influence more cancer related pathways and be localized at the start or end of the pathways and to interact with cancer related genes. These further suggested that our pathway-based approach for optimizing anticancer drug targets are highly valuable for the optimization of drug targets.

We also noted that there were several limitations in our study due to the uncompleted knowledge of human gene function and biological pathways. Because our method was based on the quantitative structures of pathways, the optimization could not be performed for the candidate ADTs if it was not annotated in any pathways. These issues will be improved with the development of integrated biological molecular networks with multi-dimensional information; and an optimization pipeline based on human biological pathways will be expanded. The pathway-based strategy we reported in this study offers insight toward the discovery of more reliable and effective targets for the anticancer drugs.
