                  This paper presents a novel control approach of hybrid neuro-fuzzy (HNF) for load frequency control (LFC) of four-area power system. The advantage of this controller is that it can handle the non-linearities, and at the same time it is faster than other existing controllers. The effectiveness of proposed controller in increasing the damping of local and inter area modes of oscillation is demonstrated in four area interconnected power system. Area-1 and area-2 consist of thermal reheat power plant whereas area-3 and area-4 consist of hydro power plant. Performance evaluation is carried out by using fuzzy, ANN, ANFIS and conventional PI and PID control approaches. The performances of the controllers are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink package. The result shows that intelligent HNF controller is having improved dynamic response and at the same time faster than ANN, fuzzy and conventional PI and PID controllers.
