                  An innovative procedure for characterizing thermo-mechanical behavior of superalloy using the Eigenfunction Virtual Fields Method (EVFM) was proposed. First, the principle of EVFM for thermo-mechanical constants identification was developed based on the principal components analysis. Then, the strain fields were extracted from finite element (FE) simulation of a superalloy plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension and uniform temperature increment. In addition, the virtual fields were constructed using the eigenvectors of augmented strain matrix. Finally, the thermo-mechanical constants were inversed from the strain fields, and the effect of mesh size and noise on the inversion results was analyzed. The results show that the thermo-mechanical constants of superalloy inversed from EVFM using these eigenvectors as virtual fields are in excellent agreement with the true values.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Superalloy materials are widely used in aviation and aerospace fields as engine materials due to its excellent high temperature thermo-mechanical behavior [1,2]. However, how to characterize the thermo-mechanical constants of superalloy materials correctly, accurately and simply is an important and difficult problem. Virtual Fields Method (VFM), which was proposed by Grédiac and Pierron [3,4], provides an effective tool for high temperature parameter identification of materials. VFM brings the advantage of full-field and non-contact of optical measurement into play.

VFM has been commonly applied in many areas since it was proposed. Among these applications, the elastic stiffness identification is one of the most interested fields. Grédiac et al. applied VFM to the identification of hyperelastic parameters [5], elasto-plastic constitutive parameters [6], bending rigidities of anisotropic plates [7]. Pierron et al. extended the virtual fields method to elasto-plastic material identification with cyclic loads and kinematic hardening [8] and identification of elasto-visco-plastic parameters [9]. Rahmani et al. used VFM to mechanical properties identification of 3D particulate composites [10] and proposed a Regularized Virtual Fields Method (RVFM) to characterize mechanical properties of composite materials [11]. Xie et al. applied VFM to elastic stiffness identification of composite materials [12] and 3D printing material [13]. Ma et al. [14] used VFM to inverse and decouple thermo-mechanical deformation of anisotropic materials under high-temperature environments. Furthermore, Gao and Shang [15] proposed a Deformation-Pattern-based Digital Image Correlation (DPDIC) method to measure directly residual stresses by digital image correlation using hole drilling. The deformation pattern that was governed by the residual stresses was used to affine transform the image captured after the object was deformed. Liu and Gao [16] extended DPDIC to measure coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of film, and the results of CTEs from DPDIC and conventional DIC methods were compared with the actual CTE, showing an improved accuracy.

Recently, Subramanian et al. [17] proposed an Eigenfunction Virtual Fields Method (EVFM), which systematically identifies virtual fields by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the strain field measured from experiments. The virtual strain components to be used in VFM are then chosen to be the eigenfunctions. In addition to being a physically meaningful set of virtual fields, such a choice exploits the orthogonality of the computed eigenfunctions while simultaneously eliminating computation of a large number of coefficients that define the virtual fields in prior approaches. They applied EVFM to homogeneous linear elastic property evaluation [17], computation of elastic constants of functionally graded materials [18] and identification of orthotropic elastic constants [19,20].

In the present work, the EVFM was extended to thermo-mechanical parameters identification of superalloy materials under high temperature environment. The principle of EVFM for thermo-mechanical parameters identification was presented firstly. Then, a finite element simulation was carried out on a superalloy plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension and uniform temperature increment. The eigenfunctions calculated from the strain fields were selected as virtual fields to inverse thermo-mechanical parameters. Finally, the effect of mesh size and noise on the inversion results was analyzed.

EVFM is based on the eigenfunctions of strain field, and the strain field usually calculated from full-field optical method, such as digital image correlation, on a grid of m×n points. Two augmented matrices Er
                         and Ec
                         of sizes 3m×n and m×3n respectively are constructed from the strain component grids as follows [17]:

                        where the columns of Lr
                         and Lc
                         contain the left eigenvectors of Er
                         and Ec; Sr
                         and Sc
                         are diagonal matrices that contain the singular values of Er
                         and Ec
                        ; the columns of Rr
                         and Rc
                         contain the right eigenvectors of Er
                         and Ec
                        , respectively. A significant advantage of this decomposition is that each group of eigenvectors is a complete orthonormal basis; therefore, the right eigenvectors are orthonormal basis for the row space of each augmented matrix, as well as the left eigenvectors are orthonormal basis for the column space [17].

It is proved that full-field strain data are highly redundant and only a small number (p) eigenvectors are dominant. Thus, it is adequate to reconstruct the strain matrices in terms of the p-dimensional subspace of the row and column spaces spanned by these p dominant left and right eigenvectors.

Since the primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of EVFM for thermo-mechanical properties, strain fields from a FE solution to the plane-stress deformation of a plate made of superalloy materials with a hole, subjected to remote tension and uniform temperature increment (ΔT=100 °C) were generated. The material parameters used in this study are listed in Table 1
                         (GH4169 superalloy) and the geometry and boundary conditions for this problem are shown in Fig. 2
                         and Table 2
                        . A converged mesh of 4244 quadratic plane stress elements and 4390 nodes were used in this study. Each of the strain components ɛ1, ɛ2, ɛ12 obtained at the centroids of the elements in the region of interest (ROI) form a 20×100 matrix and these were used in the EVFM computations described below. The variation of displacements and strains in the region of interest are shown in Figs. 3
                         and 4.
                     

As explained in Grama and Subramanian [21], Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify the p dominant eigenfunctions of Ec
                        ; in this case, p=6 dominant eigenfunctions were identified from the knee in the plot of the singular values (SV) of Ec
                         and the first 6 are shown in the Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Next, virtual fields were constructed from these dominant eigenfunctions; here, left eigenfunctions (of the length m) were used as virtual strain fields.

Before the actual virtual fields are described, the following piece-wise continuous versions of the discrete eigenvectors obtained in the previous section are defined [19]:

To evaluate the right-hand side of Eq. (18), it is noted that although the true distribution of tractions over Su
                         are not known, their net resultant along the 2-direction is known to be P. Since the virtual displacements are uniform over this segment, it can be obtained

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The first three left eigenvectors of the strain field were used to inverse the thermo-mechanical parameters of GH4169 superalloy. The three unknown material parameters were derived and solved based on a compact system of three equations in Eq. (25). Three temperature environments were simulated using FEM, and the identified material parameters using EVFM are shown in Table 3
                        . It is evident from Table 3 that the errors between inversion value and reference value are less than 0.5% in all three conditions.

The mesh size of ROI is considered to be an important parameter for the inversion of the thermo-mechanical constants of materials. Four different mesh sizes are considered in this simulation, and the effect of mesh size on SV is shown in Fig. 7
                        . It is clear that the mesh size have a distinct influence on SV. Moreover, the shapes of eigenvector are also influenced by the mesh size, which are shown in Fig. 8
                        . It can be deduced from the principle of singular value decomposition and principal component analysis that the variation of strain matrix is a comprehensive results of SV and eigenvector. Therefore, mesh size have a distinct influence on SV and eigenvectors, which affect the inversion results of the thermo-mechanical constants of materials.

It can be concluded from Eq. (25) that the thermo-mechanical parameters are comprehensive results of the first three left eigenvectors. The inversion results of the thermo-mechanical constants using different mesh size are shown in Table 4. It is evident from Table 4 that the effect of mesh size on E is more obvious than other two parameters, and the errors increase with the mesh size enlargement. Moreover, if the mesh size is smaller than 0.2 mm, the maximum error is less than 0.5%, and the effect of mesh size on the inversion results can be ignored. Therefore, unless stated, the mesh size of 0.2 mm was used in other conditions.

A full validation of EVFM must also take into account the effect of noise, which is inevitable in experimental measurements; no significant noise is present in the strain matrices obtained from FEM. To address this issue, Gaussian white noise of specified amplitude was added to the finite-element strain matrices and these are used as inputs to the EVFM procedure.

SV plots for noisy strain fields Ec
                         with SNR values of 50 dB, 60 dB, 70 dB, 80 dB, 90 dB, 100 dB and noise-free are shown in Fig. 9(a). Also, the effect of different amplitudes of noises on the 1st left eigenvector are shown in Fig. 9(b). It is evident from Fig. 9 that the white Gaussian noises has little influence on the SV and 1st left eigenvector. Fig. 9 shows that the SV and 1st left eigenvector are less sensitive to noise. This is mainly because experimental noise usually corresponds to lower order eigenvectors, eigenvector orthonormality automatically reduces the effect of noise on the virtual work equations, and therefore, on the computed material parameters [19–21].

Using the special virtual fields in Eq. (25), three unknown parameters (E, μ, α) can be determined. The results of the inversion of the thermo-mechanical elastic constants with the noise are shown in Table 5
                        
                        . It is shown that Young's modulus is more sensitive than Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion coefficient. The error of Young's modulus increases from 0.2% in noise-free to 5.5% in SNR values of 50 dB. Also, the error of thermal expansion coefficient increases from 0.4% to 4.9%. The effect of noise on Poisson's ratio can be ignored.

The EVFM has been formulated and applied to the problem of estimation of thermo-mechanical properties of superalloy materials from full-field strain data. Some important conclusions are as follows:

                        
                           (1)
                           The EVFM has been successfully applied to the computation of thermo-mechanical properties of superalloy materials using three virtual fields based on eigenfunctions of the strain field, which has potential applications in thermo-mechanical parameter measurements and full-field deformation analysis under high-temperature environment.

The computed material properties are in excellent agreement with the true values. The effect of mesh size on the inversion results was analyzed, and the results show that this influence is less than 10% in the simulation.

The effect of noise has been studied by adding Gaussian white noise to the synthetic strain data. It is shown that the material parameters are less sensitive to noise when computed by the present method. This is mainly because experimental noise usually corresponds to lower order eigenvectors, eigenvector orthonormality automatically reduces the effect of noise on the virtual work equations, and therefore, on the computed material parameters.
