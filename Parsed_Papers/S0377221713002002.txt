                  Production ramp-up is an important phase in the lifecycle of a manufacturing system which still has significant potential for improvement and thereby reducing the time-to-market of new and updated products. Production systems today are mostly one-of-a-kind complex, engineered-to-order systems. Their ramp-up is a complex order of physical and logical adjustments which are characterised by try and error decision making resulting in frequent reiterations and unnecessary repetitions. Studies have shown that clear goal setting and feedback can significantly improve the effectiveness of decision-making in predominantly human decision processes such as ramp-up. However, few measurement-driven decision aides have been reported which focus on ramp-up improvement and no systematic approach for ramp-up time reduction has yet been defined. In this paper, a framework for measuring the performance during ramp-up is proposed in order to support decision making by providing clear metrics based on the measurable and observable status of the technical system. This work proposes a systematic framework for data preparation, ramp-up formalisation, and performance measurement. A model for defining the ramp-up state of a system has been developed in order to formalise and capture its condition. Functionality, quality and performance based metrics have been identified to formalise a clear ramp-up index as a measurement to guide and support the human decision making. For the validation of the proposed framework, two ramp-up processes of an assembly station were emulated and their comparison was used to evaluate this work.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Today, most production systems are highly complex one-of-a-kind systems which are custom engineered to meet specific production requirements. This combined with the frequent need to integrate new technologies and processes to respond to product innovations and market pressure, makes ramp-up a very complex and non-repetitive process which is difficult to plan and structure in advance. Consequently, bringing these complex systems up to the desired operational performance characteristics requires a lot of effort and knowledge. The process is not well understood and often driven by trial and error rather than an overall systematic strategy. This can lead to big delays before the product reaches the market due to costly repetitions and less than optimal decisions. The focus during ramp-up is primarily on achieving the required production volume to enter the market and maximise the likely profit. Hence, the ramp-up phase is often being described in terms of production volume over time, while achieving the desired product quality objectives. Ramp-up is constantly being highlighted by industry as one of the production phases with large potential for further improvement and has gained a lot of attention from the research community (Ceglarek et al., 2004; Fjällström et al., 2009; Haller et al., 2003; Terwiesch and Bohn, 2001; Terwiesch and Xu, 2004).


                     Terwiesch and Bohn (2001) have defined ramp-up as follows. “The period between the end of product development and full capacity production is known as production ramp-up”. Following this definition, the ramp-up phase can be more precisely defined as the process of bringing a production system up to its required operational characteristics after it has been designed and build and before it is taken into full operation. In reality there is rarely such a clear separation between the phases and product changes and system build adjustments take place while the system is being already ramped up. Equally, the system will often be taken into operation before it has reached its full production capacity. In Fig. 1
                      ramp-up is shown in the context of the manufacturing system development and production phases.

A lot of the current research highlights the significance of knowledge capturing during the ramp-up phase and the human knowledge loss in order to reduce the time spent (Fjällström et al., 2009; Terwiesch and Bohn, 2001; Terwiesch and Xu, 2004). Knowledge capture aims to harness and improve the expertise of the engineers involved in the ramp-up process. Measurements are required to contextualise good and less desirable practise and strategies during ramp-up. It has also been identified that goal setting and feedback based on clear metrics can affect the performance of humans (Locke and Latham, 2002). Stansfield and Longenecker (2006) study the implication of feedback to the productivity of a manufacturing company and they prove an improvement of 10% in those cases where feedback is provided.

This paper proposes a new framework for the systematic measurement of ramp-up performance in order to support a decision making process which will eventually lead to ramp-up time reduction. The focus is placed on the definition of an accurate and comprehensive measurement which captures all the relevant aspects of the ramp-up process and does not solely focus on a singular objective.

The structure on the rest of this work is as follows. In part 2 a review of current ramp-up approaches is carried out, followed by a brief survey on performance measurements and their application in manufacturing, as well as performance measurements design methodologies and formalisation of performance indices. Part 3, defines a framework for capturing the dynamics of the ramp-up phase, along with the requirements that should be taken into consideration for measuring performance. In part 4 a mathematical model for measuring performance during ramp-up is presented and illustrated in part 5 with the example of an industrial demonstrator. Finally in part 6 the potential of the proposed approach and future work is discussed.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In the literature, the references towards ramp-up time reduction are relatively limited. Currently, the effectiveness of ramp-up largely depends on the experience of shop floor engineers who use their knowledge to guide the decision making process (Terwiesch and Bohn, 2001). Literature reflects this practice and current approaches (Fjällström et al., 2009; Haller et al., 2003; Terwiesch and Bohn, 2001) for ramp-up time reduction, can be summarised as a need to understand the production system’s behaviour, in order to support decision making and deliver an efficient system in the shortest time.


                        Fjällström et al. (2009), identify the lack of knowledge capturing and sharing, as the main cause for prolonged ramp-up times, in a case study of a Swedish automotive company, by focusing on the role of information. Carrillo and Franza (2006), highlight the lack of an explicit framework to achieve an optimal ramp-up time. They conclude that ramp-up time minimisation will be achieved through knowledge accumulation based on which, they develop a profit maximisation model. Terwiesch and Xu (2004) suggest that process changes should be delayed during ramp-up since they lead to disruptions and systematic learning cannot be achieved. The need to carry out systematic experiments to understand the process during ramp-up has also been highlighted in Terwiesch and Bohn (2001) and Haller et al. (2003). Terwiesch and Bohn (2001), emphasise the need for learning during ramp-up and support the idea of reducing the output in early production stages regardless the increased demand, and focus on the learning process. Most of the work regarding ramp-up indicates the need for a better understanding without though proposing a framework for capturing or measuring the progress of the process.

Most of the current ramp-up models in the literature, are built from a financial perspective Carrillo and Franza (2006), Terwiesch and Xu (2004), Terwiesch and Bohn (2001) and do not accommodate the aforementioned trends and a multidimensional approach. The designed financial models are targeting cost minimisation by minimising time and resources. This approach seems to target ramp-up from a single dimension and limits its effectiveness. Other approaches target the performance characteristics of the ramp-up. The simplest metric of ramp-up performance is the ramp-up time. Alternatively, effort (Terwiesch and Xu, 2004) could be measured to compare overall ramp-up process performances. While both of these metrics are well suited to describe the overall ramp-up performance they are ill suited on their own to support decisions during the ramp-up process. Target times or effort levels can be set but it is very difficult to relate the current condition of a system during ramp-up to the a prediction of how much effort/time remains until completion, without any additional metrics to characterise how far the system is from meeting its technical and operational target requirements. To overcome this limitation, the ramp-up phase is often presented as increasing output volume over time (Fjällström et al., 2009; Terwiesch et al., 2001). Technical actions and decisions can be related to the improvement of the system using such a framework; however they still do not reflect other aspects of the system’s performance but its result.

Although a lot of criticism in the literature has been on the single dimensionality of financial measurements, a multidimensional approach for the ramp-up phase has not yet been established and one can argue that a performance measurement does not exist. However, since production ramp-up is composed of manufacturing processes, certain aspects have been taken into consideration in current practices. Several measurements and design frameworks have been developed for different manufacturing processes based on which the proposed measurement is build.

A mechanism for capturing and evaluating the progress of a system is heavily depended on the ability to measure its condition and how this reacts to changes. A substantial amount of work has been reported focusing on performance measurements within the manufacturing domain. The need of quantifying every aspect of a system, has gained a lot of attention and significant work has been published, on methods for defining and designing the right performance measurements (de Ron, 1995; Hon, 2005; Kaplan and Norton, 1992; Neely et al., 1995). Neely (2005) emphasises the significance given on performance measurements by researchers, and highlights the recent attention on the feedback effect. Hon (2005) in an exhaustive review study on performance measurements presents different approaches based on the measurement’s focus and evaluates them based on their variation within the last 50years. Kaplan and Norton (1992) identify the large number of measures and metrics and correlate them to the negative effect and complexity of decision making. They propose a score board which balances metrics with different perspectives, in order to reduce the final number taken into consideration while still reflect the complexity of the system. However, it has been a common view that multidimensional measurements must still be used.

Significance has also been given to the method of designing a measurement. Within different approaches in the literature, a requirement for measurement implementation, is the level of process understanding that needs to be reflected in the design process (Kaplan and Norton, 1993). However the measurement still needs to incorporate common process characteristics in order to define generic design frameworks. Bourne et al. (2000) are defining guidelines for the design, implementation, and update techniques of a measurement. They distinguish measurements into two sub-categories; those which are derived from a strategy, with the role to measure the success of the strategy implementation and those which are defined in order to challenge the strategy. Based on this distinction they state that the purpose of the measurement should guide its design and implementation. Within the same scope, Lohman et al. (2004) conduct a case study and define a framework in which the measurement should be designed. Another aspect highlighted by de Ron (1995) is that more important than the design of the measurement is its ability of implementation and such measurements must incorporate information availability, reliability and responsibility. These are characteristics that should be reflected on the design of a ramp-up measurement.

Finally, performance metrics are defined as a concept that should be periodically reviewed and updated, since the targets are frequently changing. Along the same lines, Medori and Steeple (2000) propose a framework which frequently audits currently used metrics and supports their update by comparing their potential performance. Different approaches have been followed in order to propose the right metrics. Hon (2005) refers to a report which has identified 442 different metrics in the literature. The reason for such a large number comes from the fact that metrics are mainly case specific designs. Hon (2005) states that the latest trend in manufacturing systems, is to define measurements that cover the aspects of cost, time, quality, flexibility and productivity. Although financial metrics have been widely used, for making decisions, latest studies show that they have become restrictive (de Ron, 1995; Gomes et al., 2011; Hon, 2005; Uyar, 2009). In Lohman et al. (2004) they highlight the importance of combining metrics under one number and normalising the measurement in order to reduce its complexity. However, it is presented as a non-crucial aspect of the measurement, but of the process requirements. In Choudhury et al. (2010) a relative weighing method is used for designing a performance measurement for industrial robots.

A substantial amount of work on performance evaluation in manufacturing has focused on the development of appropriate indices. A range of different indices have been proposed for the evaluation of performance metrics such as quality, flexibility, and capability (Hölttä and Koivo, 2009; Ke et al., 2009; Lin and Pearn, 2005). A currently well-established approach in manufacturing is the performance process capability index. It defines a statistical way of evaluating the capability of a process, provided its specifications are defined. Variations have been developed and applied in manufacturing on higher level performance measurements. Pan and Kuo (2010) based on a non-normal capability index, are proposing a new Key Performance Index for quantification and evaluation of progress in service quality. Lin and Pearn (2005)) are using the capability index for measuring progress performance in normally distributed processes and propose a program for parameter estimation. One of the limitations of capability indices is its poor performance for processes which are not described by normal distributions (Clements, 1989), and different approaches have been proposed to overcome this limitation (Ke et al., 2009; Wu et al., 1999).

Another approach has been developed based on the “assessment of control loop performance” by Harris (1989). Although the approach was developed in order to ascertain the performance in a process level, it has also been applied to combine process performance indices in a higher level index (Hölttä and Koivo, 2009; Paulonis and Cox, 2003; Xia and Howell, 2003). This approach could be linked to the ramp-up process, by combining measurements on a higher level index. Indices have also been developed based on the nature of the measurement and not on a statistical analysis (Mansouri and Ouali, 2011) which highlights that a measurement needs to accommodate for the individual domain specific characteristics. Another aspect mentioned in the literature, is the normalisation of the index values, to support comparison and make it more intuitive for humans to use (Hölttä and Koivo, 2009; Huang et al., 1997).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It has been a common view in the literature that monitoring the ramp-up progress is a way to understand and affect its performance. Some of the reported work touches on strategies for improving ramp-up, without thought focusing on its early stages which cause most of the delay. A systematic framework has not yet been reported to comprehensively measure ramp-up progress. Performance measuring approaches in manufacturing have been reviewed to support the design of a ramp-up performance measurement. Literature highlights two main directions of research. One is inspired from the managerial perspective, which aims to define and correlate those metrics that will provide a performance measurement of operational processes and enable the right decisions at a high level of a company’s control. The other comes from the need for low level performance based process control. The underlying approach for developing representative performance measurement is quite similar across the literature; identify the most relevant metrics, design the measurement framework, and finally evaluate its implementation. This work focuses on identifying the most relevant performance metrics based on actual sensor feedback from the machine, and observations from the operators and translate it into a representative performance measurement for the ramp-up process. In the proposed performance measurement, a generic framework is followed, indicating that a manufacturing measurement should cover the aspects of cost, time, quality, flexibility and productivity as proposed in Hon (2005). Finally, it was also identified that feedback mechanisms and clear goal setting can support decision making within ramp-up and hence are expected to reduce the required time.

This section discusses the specific characteristics of the ramp-up process and outlines the requirements for a performance measurement framework. The framework has been developed based on both literature review of reported performance measurements and inputs from industrial studies conducted as part of the EU FP7 project FRAME (2011).

This work targets ramp-up from a technical perspective and focuses on the actions taking place in the shop floor. The current established representation of ramp-up as production volume can be effective only on the late stages when the system is stable and a minimum performance has been reached. Similarly quality based measurements require large test runs and time before they become meaningful, which has limited applicability on the early stages. This work aims to support the early stages when output might not even exist while also incorporating a holistic view of the ramp-up process.

The contribution of this work is not only to formally capture the system’s performance but to also provide a feedback mechanism. Within this aim a ramp-up index is introduced for every single metric. The index can provide an indication of how far the system is from the target state and also provide the traceability of the followed path and the taken actions, to get there. It can also provide a way of evaluating the followed strategy by comparing the different actions taken in each different ramp-up case. An index should provide significant support to an operator to understand the system’s behaviour.

For the design of the measurement three main aspects have been targeted, namely the data capturing, ramp-up formalisation and the performance measurement.


                     Data Capture: In order to define a performance measurement that will allow someone to understand the ramp-up process and the effect of an action, it is important to be able to capture the condition of the system before and after a change. Hence, a formal definition of the state of a system during ramp-up is required which defines a clear data structure for the observable conditions and what this will include. The classification of observations and their interpretation needs to be context independent to allow the framework to be applicable in a wide range of largely custom engineered production systems. Hence, a careful balance needs to be achieved between the expressiveness and complexity of such a classification. Such a data structure for the observable characteristics of a system will also help formalising the ramp-up process.


                     Formalisation: Ramp-up is characterised by several different aspects and problems which should be catered for in a complete model. The complexity of ramp-up time reduction is a result of the large number and the diverse nature of the parameters which can influence performance and stability of the system. However, actions taken in order to solve specific problems without taking into consideration the overall station, can lead to collisions between the targets of ramp-up and take the system to a worst state. The approach needs to be holistic in order to treat the problem as one, and at the same time transparent enough to identify key targets during different ramp-up stages. Hence, there is a need to formalise the ramp-up phase in a model which incorporates all of those parameters and their correlations.


                     Performance Measurement: The use of production volume as a benchmark measurement does not fully capture the characteristics of a system particularly during its early ramp-up stages. It provides at best a high level perspective of the later ramp-up stages even though production yield is a more representative value as it combines production volume with the output quality of the system. Production volume and yield do not well reflect the technical availability of the system which is more important during early stages of the ramp-up where a complete production cycle cannot even be completed or the achieved quality is still so low that one cannot realistically measure volume or even yield yet. Creating a robust and complete functional foundation for a system as well as reliably fulfilling its quality objectives are however critical for achieving the full potential of a system. Hence it is desirable to incorporate metrics that can describe functionality and quality into any performance measurement for ramp-up. A performance measurement should combine all of the traditional aspects and emphasise on the magnitude of disturbances which is one of the main issues in ramp-up. The proposed measurement should remain applicable and simple, while established paradigms should be followed. Additionally, a technical approach must be followed in order to capture the technical requirements of ramp-up and target the limitations of current approaches. Industrialists (FRAME, 2011) have also highlighted the significance of processes where human involvement is crucial and performance measurements should incorporate it.

The ramp-up process can be defined as a sequence of adaptations and adjustments applied to a system. Each adjustment results in a change of the system’s condition. It has been assumed that the observable conditions of the system are representative of its state and that the state remains stable between adjustments, as this time is normally relatively short. The conditions of the system can hence be defined as a stable state. There are expected to be some exceptions, for example when longer breaks occur between working days and over weekends, or if the system is being moved to a different location. The state of the system would have to be re-determined after such an event. A schematic overview of the ramp-up process is given in Fig. 2

                         present sub-states reflecting internal state transitions until a state becomes stable.

The definition of ramp-up as a finite state-transition process does not preclude the consideration of random factors. It is important to link the state definition to a measureable time unit in production. The cycle time of a production station is a clearly definable period of time in production. Hence the state of a station has been defined as the sum of its observed conditions over a finite number of cycles. This could be one or more cycle time states (ck
                         to ck
                        
                        +1). Generally the number of cycles considered to determine a state, increases over the duration of the ramp-up process and takes the form of system tests. Any random variations can therefore be captured and considered over a number of cycles. The objective of a performance measurement is ultimately to relate any adjustment, to the systems change towards the final state. The magnitude and direction of the change can then be used to evaluate its appropriateness. In order to capture the relationship between states and changes the ramp-up process can be formally defined as a set of change sessions which will be called experiences. These experiences will take place in a sequential order, provided that a production station will be ramped-up by only one person. Hence the ramp-up process PR
                         can be defined as a set of experiences.

                        where A is the set of all changes (actions), S is the set of all system states. Following such an approach reduces the vagueness of the systems status during its ramp-up. Furthermore, by relating performance to a ramp-up state and the implications of a change will provide understanding of the system’s progress and dynamics while it also will support the proposed measurement and its representation. The state-transition model will provide a robust model of the ramp-up process and its states.

The state of a system during ramp-up can be defined as the combination of all parameters which are used to define the condition of the system, at any time point. Two are the main sources of parameters during ramp-up, the sensory equipment but even more importantly the human operator and its observations. A state si

The transparent capture of all the different type of information requires a clear parameter classification based on the coming source and type. This work classifies the types of parameters under functionality, quality and optimisation information. A parameter-based state definition can result an increasingly large number of unique states. For a system with n parameters and m discrete values for each parameter p, the dimensionality of the state-space model can be derived from (4). For non-discrete values the state-space will be infinite.

                        The aim of formalising the ramp-up phase can be lost if a state-space is too large and becomes intractable. In order to define a valid state space it is therefore proposed to discretise the system’s specific parameters. This will keep the state-space concise and focused on the requirements of ramp-up. Additionally, the discretisation will define the resolution of the capturing mechanism.

Ramp-up is a multidimensional problem with several interrelated aspects which need to be treated as a whole. The literature review indicated the metrics of cost, time, quality, flexibility and productivity as the dominant for performance measurement in the field of manufacturing (Hon, 2005). Although this paper shares this view, it is argued that cost and flexibility are not required to be considered as separate metrics during ramp-up. Both measures are defined at the design phase and are met once the system is fully running. In the ramp-up phase, while most of the costs have been defined, additional cost can be added only if additional resources are used to support the phase. That makes the cost factor a controllable parameter and defines a restrictive framework in which ramp-up will take place. Cost metrics are not directly connected to performance and are mainly used for management support and not for technical decisions. The longer the ramp up takes and the more and higher skilled personnel is required the more expensive the system becomes. Ramp-up time becomes the most critical parameter assuming a fixed set of people is being involved in the process. Finally, being able to ramp-up a system for different products, provides an indication of the system’s flexibility.

The proposed ramp-up measure is relating the progress of ramp-up, to how close a system is to meet its objectives over time. During ramp-up, time reduction is the driving parameter and the benefits of having a faster system ramp-up are assumed to be significant. After observing and studying ramp-up, and taking into account industrial practices (FRAME, 2011), three metrics are proposed to capture the key aspects of a system’s ramp-up. These are the equipment functionality, output quality and performance optimisation and target the aspects of productivity, quality and time.

Although an overall measurement for ramp-up performance is desirable, it is important that the proposed three individual metrics are also defined separately in order to allow decision makers to prioritise their decisions based on more detailed targets that are usually followed during ramp-up. The proposed sequence presented in Fig. 3
                      is derived from the logical fact that during ramp-up three aspects are targeted. Although Fig. 3 presents the phases in sequence and independent, overlaps do exist. The sequence reflects the followed practice by an operator and the individually treated issues. Initially, the functionality of the station is taken into consideration, until this starts performing in a minimum level and an output exists. During that phase any other performance aspect is not considered and that should be reflected in the performance measure. However, quality performance is still important even when the system is not functioning properly and hence is considered in the overall performance measure. Finally, the third phase of ramp-up is in regard to the optimisation of a station, its time and its ability to produce as fast as possible. It is very probable that unexpected problems and disturbances will occur, since tuning and changes are taking place in several aspects of the production process while optimisation is trying to be achieved. Hence the three phases will occur more than one time during ramp-up. The shift of objectives is reflected in Fig. 3 (left) while the overall performance measure (right) does not give the same level of transparency. Although the three phases are defined as discrete, they are characterised by their interrelation. The three proposed performance metrics can be measured separately but can only be considered in combination at any time during ramp-up.

Functionality is an aspect of an assembly process that has not been directly targeted in the literature and technical metrics are not defined. Currently, during ramp-up, malfunctions are identified by the operators or equipment specific signals. This work aims to formalise this information under a measure which will combine information coming from an operator and the system’s sensors. The operator’s input is considered important for the equipment’s functionality and hence the measure incorporates observations regarding the system’s functionality. The term “observation” is introduced to capture cases that cannot be identified by sensors but an operator can observe. Those parameters are introduced by an operator and are case specific. Additionally, functionality is defined as the state of a process that its cycle time has been exceeded by a certain percentage of the desired value Tc
                        . The functionality threshold must be defined specifically for every case. With those two proposed definitions of functionality it is aimed to capture on one hand the unexpected disruptions that cannot be measured but an operator can identify (e.g. a broken valve in the air supply unit) and on the other hand, those cases where the equipment still performs but delivers a very slow process and requires rapid response. In most of the cases in assembly stations the used equipment does not produce signals that can indicate such non-functional operation. However, when alarm signals exist they should be taken into consideration. Those three sources of information will be assessed to define a functionality measure during ramp-up.

Functionality is a concept that is difficult to define since it depends not only on the actual task or process but also on their interaction. That makes it independent of a process model and hence difficult to measure directly. However, the direct effect, which can be observed by the use of signals and not through semantic information, is the cycle time of every monitored process and task. This work proposes the metrics of phase and duration of a cycle time as an addition to the overall cycle time, in order to capture different sources of the problem and their interrelations. An overview of the metrics for a workstation with two tasks is presented in Fig. 4
                        . In Fig. 4 three examples of the deviation of the phase and the duration of a cycle time are presented along with the effect in the overall cycle time.

The three examples intend to show the significance of the metrics regarding the source of the problem, since all of the cases generate similar effect to the overall cycle time although the root cause is different. It also proves the statement regarding the definition of functionality within the interaction of tasks. In summary, the functionality measure is defined as the weighed sum of all the metrics following the above description and defined as disruptions.

                         is a weighing factor for each disruptions which allows different importance to be associated to each one depending on their significance. For instance a disturbance that identified through a large phase will be normally considered as less important than an alarm or an observed valve breakdown. The function in Eq. (5) will return a negative value and will indicate how far the system is from achieving its full functional scope which is denoted by the maximum value of zero. The functionality function defined in (5) can only capture failures for one operating cycle. However, the interest during ramp-up is to assure that functionality remains stable throughout extended periods of operation. Hence the concept is extended to average the functionality over multiple operating cycles (6). The functionality metric is calculated as a weighed sum of functionality in the last few cycles.

                         can be used in different ways such as a time unit (i.e. cycle time) in time i in order to take into account the cycle times passed, with different significance. Another option is to use si
                         as a state unit and average instances or consider them equally. That would only reflect the system’s stability within the measure. Eq. (6) takes into account the literature by being able to incorporate both approaches based on the application.

The second aim during ramp-up is identified as the need to achieve the required quality of the system output. The output quality is defined as a set of quality objectives which can vary from product to product. Each quality objective is represented as a Boolean variable where 1 identifies that the objective has been achieved and 0 that it has not. The negative sum of the quality objectives indicates how far a system is from reaching its quality targets similar to the functionality metric. Additionally, every qualitative objective can be weighed according to its significance. The quality metric generates a negative value equal to the weighed qualitative objectives and becomes zero once the output meets the quality requirements. The metric is defined as a weighed sum of all the qualitative objectives as this is presented by

                        . As it was argued with functionality, the quality metric can be also captured over a number of production cycles (Eq. (8)). The reason for that is because in ramp-up, the consistency of the output is of more significance than a one-off good result. The individual quality metric fq
                        (j) for each cycle is weighed, based on time, to define the representative quality status of the system similarly to Eq. (6) where si
                         can be used highlight more recent cycles if the system has long cycle times or larger number of cycles have been recorded.

                        This approach contrasts with the more commonly used yield as indicator of quality performance during operation. Yield only accounts for the percentage of good components or products and does not give an indication of partial quality achievement. During ramp-up it is important to identify whether progress has been made towards achieving the quality requirements of the system consistently. System states which consistently achieve more of the quality objectives than others should be recognised.


                        Fig. 5
                         illustrates the quality status of two system states which have been recorded over 10 cycles each. Although in the first state, the system achieves the desired quality in two of the cycles (Tc5 and Tc8); all the other cycles are much worse than in the second case. The stability of the second case is much higher and should hence be preferable for ramp-up. This is well reflected when applying Eq. (7) and without considering time weighing, where the value for the first state is −0.733 and the second state is −0.431.

Performance optimisation and process control is a very wide and well defined field. Classical approaches incorporate process modelling and very powerful control algorithms. For the process of ramp-up, performance needs to be captured outside the process control and within the aspect of time. A process is assumed to be optimised when the cycle time, the cycle time phase and duration are within the acceptable range. The proposed metric is combining them under a weighed sum presented in Eq. (9).

                         is the set values by which metrics regarding the cycle time have exceeded the target value. The proposed cycle time parameters are the cycle time and the duration of the individual tasks as these were defined for the functionality metric in Fig. 4. However for the metric of performance optimisation, the continuous values will be used in order to present the level of the progress. Although cycle time related parameters are used to both functionality and optimisation metrics, there is a very clear distinction on their use. When a cycle time parameter exceeds a predefined threshold of the desired value, it is only considered as a functionality parameter and can only generate a disruption for the functionality metric. Additionally, βj
                         are providing the weighting factor, indicating the importance of every parameter. On the same manner as with the two previously defined measures, the optimisation metric is extended within time in

                        ] is the performance metrics vector. In order to generalise the measurement and being able to compare performances for individual systems, the measure is scaled to the unit. All three metrics of functionality, quality and optimisation are normalised to the unit and then weigh accordingly with the weighting vector w. The three metrics are weighed through vector w and reflect the different followed strategy during ramp-up and the significance of the three proposed metrics. Different strategies might place the focus on the fast delivering output and not on the highest quality features or the opposite. Alternatives could consider all of the phases equally important. Another aspect of the proposed measurement is that when a functionality parameter is captured, the performance optimisation should not be considered. This reflects the significance of functionality and the correlations between the three phases. Hence, while the system is not functional, the performance optimisation metric is assumed to have the maximum negative value. On the other hand the quality metric will still be measured sine the products could be produced even if the station is considered non-functional.

In this section, the proposed framework has been applied to an illustrative case study to validate the logical consistency of the developed measurement and discuss its expected impact. A real life assembly system was used with some simplifications to reduce its complexity for the purposes of this paper.


                        Equipment Description: The equipment used was provided as part of the EU project FRAME (2011) as an industrial demonstrator. The demonstrator is a fully automated station delivering a gluing process and incorporating five different operations. An overview of the station is presented in Fig. 6
                        .

The station is comprised of two conveyor belts to bring the pallet in and out of the process, two lifts to place the pallet in and out of the process area, and finally the glue dispenser, connected to a SCARA-type robot to carry out the gluing operation. The station is controlled by a single programmable logic controller.


                        Parameter Description: In order to apply the proposed concepts, the parameter types are presented based on the classification in Section 3 and directly related to the experience structure in Table 1
                        . The table follows the proposed experience structure as introduced in Eq. (1).


                        Functionality Parameters (F.P.): Are parameters which can be captured from an operator as an observation of system malfunctions and all the cycle time parameters which exceed the expected value by a certain percentage. In this example, the threshold is set to 20%. The process is composed of five operations; six durations (including the overall cycle time) and five phases. They define the functionality parameters coming from the sensors. In addition, three different types of observations were defined to capture malfunctions identified by the operators. These observations are: “pallet jam”, “pallet misaligned” and “component drop” (Ob1, Ob2, and Ob3 respectively). Eq. (6) is used to calculate the functionality metric and define its index.


                        Quality Parameters (Q.P.): Two qualitative parameters were used. One parameter represents the result of the gluing process using a vision system to count the number of glue dots. The other captures the consistency of the result based on the amount of glue. These were directly linked to the quality index as this was presented in Section 3 and Eq. (8).


                        Status Parameters (S.P.): The status parameters used for the illustrative example are all the cycle time related metrics. This creates six performance parameters, in order to define the level of diversion from the target state. The level of optimisation is calculated using Eq. (10) and generates the optimisation index.

In this part explains the experimental scenarios for the illustrative test case. Initially, a ramp-up phase was emulated in order to calculate the proposed metrics and the overall performance measurement. A second ramp-up phase was also emulated assuming knowledge of the indices. The data from the first case was captured as part of a ramp-up process. The data capture did not take place in the same sequence as presented, but as individual cause effect actions. The generation of the data is based on the acquired knowledge for the equipment and the data capturing. Additionally, the actions and the data sets for the second ramp-up phase were generated based on the observation of the equipment and the ramp-up process. In the first case, an operator ramps-up the system without any support. The process is assumed to be carried out in 40 steps while three different disturbances occurred. In the second case another operator is assumed to ramp-up the same system with the support of the performance indices. The operator was assumed to have access to the ramp-up index and every individual sub index.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this part the individual indices are presented based on the generated data. These can be seen in Table 2
                        . Fig. 7–10
                        
                        
                        
                         present the functionality, quality, optimisation metrics, and the overall performance index of both cases. The indices are generated based on Eqs. (6), (8), (10), and (11). Parameter si
                         is chosen to equally average the five cycles assuming the system to be stable over such short runs The output metrics were not normalised, while to the overall measure was linearly normalised in the range of [0–1] with the value of 0 to define an optimal state and a state of −1 to reflect the worst system condition. The weighting factor W of the overall measurement is chosen to equally weight every individual metric. In Fig. 10 it can be observed that the system converges to a desirable state four steps faster when the feedback is provided. Faster convergence is observed on the other indices as well with the highest reduction of 10 steps out of 42 on the overall index.

Looking closer at the functionality index, it can be observed that a different path is followed when feedback is supplied. In step 15 the operator seems to identify the instant drop in the systems performance and link it to the current adjustment. After that a different path is followed which delivers a functional system 6 steps faster. Similarly, in the quality index actions which generated wrong paths according to the index are corrected. In step 16 an action is taken to improve the system’s performance, however the effect on the quality of the product takes the system to a worse state. The advantage the index provides in such cases is the instant reflection of the action on the system’s performance. Comparing the two cases in Fig. 8 both paths reach the same performance. However, when feedback is provided the wrong action is corrected instantly in step 16 while in the case without the operator only corrected the action in step 22. Note that the performance optimisation index never reaches zero. This is because the station never reaches the ideal target value but just reduces the difference. The current performance was considered by the operator as acceptable. However, the improvement from the worst un-functional state (−8.43) to the accepted state (−2.11) is only 5.24% worse than the desired state. This is also reflected in the performance measurement with a lower effect. Overall, ramp-up is considering time as a very critical factor and hence cases like the one in this example where the system is considered ramped-up without reaching the predefined target values is a common practice. Furthermore, in the performance optimisation index (Fig. 9), a faster improvement in the last steps is observed. This comes from the fact that the operator better understands the effect of actions and enhances the adjustment in certain values. The indices have to be used in combination in order to efficiently support the operator by capturing the correlations between them. The overall index is also reflecting such correlations. In step 20 the operator decides to take an action in order to make the process faster. As it can be seen in Fig. 10, the process becomes faster while the quality of the output drops down. Part of the used data set is presented in Table 2.

In a more detailed analysis it was observed that, although initially for both cases there are a lot of large variations in performance, the second case converges faster. This can be justified since the operator gains experience with the system and hence avoids those actions which would lead the system to a worst state. This process is accelerated with the use of the ramp-up index since it provides an instant response indicating the effect of an action. The operator can react accordingly. Additionally, the metrics very clearly presents the condition of the system while in the first case the operator has to assume the condition. The results of the case study indicate that the individual metrics focus the attention of the operator on the most pressing issues to be resolved and by doing so supports the right decisions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper proposes a new framework to measure the ramp-up progress of manufacturing systems. The framework is based on a formal state-transition model of the ramp-up process. Three performance metrics have been identified to measure the progress and step-by-step status of a system during ramp-up; functionality, quality, and performance optimisation. They correspond to the three main objectives during ramp-up; ensuring that the systems achieves its desired function, ensuring the quality characteristics of the product are met, and improving the performance to the expected level. The new measurement with supporting metrics has been developed following a well-established design methodology and considering the requirements and feedback from industrial experts in the field.

The proposed measurement is the first reported approach to support step-by-step decision making during the whole ramp-up process. The inclusion of function and quality focused metrics makes the proposed measurement suitable even for the early ramp-up stages when traditional performance (production volume) focused metrics are still infeasible and impractical to use. It has been demonstrated with the help of a case study that the measurement helps to reduce ramp-up time by providing instant feedback during the process. In addition, the measurement allows a more detailed analysis of ramp-up processes as it links adjustments actions to improvements, ultimately allowing more effective ramp-up strategies to be discovered.

Further case studies will be required to more specifically determine the time reduction potential of the proposed metrics when applied during ramp-up. More complex cases will be considered to further validate the proposed framework. Future studies will also consider the impact of different normalisation technics and variation of weights on different ramp-up strategies.

Furthermore, one of the key challenges of a discrete state space used to formalise the ramp-up process is its balance between the dimensionality and its level of completeness. The proposed framework provides sound foundation for the better understanding of ramp-up. This can be further extended and be correlated to variations of other key performance indicators such as time, cost or number of steps required to ramp-up a system. Hence additional performance indicators can be associated to the proposed measurement to guide the user during ramp-up.
