                  The main aim of this paper is to measure the social welfare loss for a continuous moral hazard model when a set of minimal assumptions are fulfilled. By using a new approach, we are able to reproduce the results of Balmaceda, Balseiro, Correa, and Stier-Moses (2010) pertaining to the social welfare loss for discrete and continuous models respectively. Previous studies rely on the validity of the first-order approach at the expense of strong assumptions, in particular the convexity of the distribution function condition while we do not make such a restrictive assumption in our developments. In addition, we obtain new bounds for the social welfare loss that are both tight and easy to compute.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The principal-agent model is an asymmetric information game of the Stackelberg type where the principal (the leader) hires an agent (the follower) to perform a task on its behalf. In the present paper, we consider the ‘moral hazard’ version. The aim of the principal is to devise an incentive scheme with respect to the possible outcomes, striking the right balance between wages (linked to outcomes) and revenues, knowing that the agent maximizes its own utility, which is expressed as the difference between the wage and the cost associated with a given effort level. Throughout, it is assumed that the probability of observing a high outcome is positively correlated with the effort level. For more details concerning this classical framework, the reader is referred to Laffont and Martimort (2001), Liu (2008) and van Ackere (1993). Moreover, specific applications of the principal-agent model have been widely discussed in Laffont and Martimort (2001), Su (2005) and van Ackere (1993).

Since the principal-agent game is non-cooperative, a question that arises naturally is that to assess the loss of efficiency due to this behavior. Such an analysis has been performed in diverse areas such as game theory, computer science, transportation and economics. See for instance Acemoglu, Bimpikis, and Ozdaglar (2009), Acemoglu and Ozdaglar (2007), Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (2009), Moulin (2008); 2009), Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, and Vazirani (2007), as well as the references therein. In the present framework, the authors in Balmaceda, Balseiro, Correa, and Stier-Moses (2010) based their analysis on the worst-case social welfare loss, defined as the largest possible ratio between the social welfare achieved when both agents cooperate, and the non-cooperative social welfare (see Definition 2.1(vi) for the description). They obtained tight upper bounds and showed that the worst-case social welfare loss (price-of-anarchy) could be as large as the number of efforts. These bounds were obtained under a number of restrictive assumptions. The first one, the monotone likelihood ratio (MLR from now on and see Definition 2.1(vii) for the description), can be motivated by the natural intuition that more effort produces a higher outcome, and implies that payments must increase with outcome. The authors also require that the social welfare (see Definition 2.1(iii) for the description) is non-decreasing under increasing efforts, or that the distribution functions of the outcome random variable are convex (CDFC from now on and see Definition 2.1(viii) for the description). Note that this condition has been invoked by Liu (2008) and Rogerson (1985) to justify the first-order approach (FOA from now on and see Definition 2.1(ix) for the description). Although FOA significantly simplifies the study of the principal-agent model, CDFC is often viewed as a bad expedient to ensure validity of FOA, as very few distributions satisfy both MLR and CDFC (Jewitt, 1988). Moreover, CDFC does not comply with the standard diminishing marginal returns intuition (Conlon, 2009; Rogerson, 1985). This led researchers to investigate weaker assumptions that would yet imply FOA. In particular, Jewitt (1988) retained MLR but relaxed CDFC, while ensuring FOA and complying with the diminishing marginal returns conditions, at the price of overly technical assumptions (Conlon, 2009).

The main aim of this paper is to weaken the conditions under which the social welfare loss in the moral hazard model is obtained. In particular, our analysis does not require the restrictive CDFC. Moreover, we show that our new bounds for the social welfare loss are both tight and easy to compute and we prove that a ‘benevolent’ principal may force a socially-optimal outcome. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the moral hazard model, together with some of its properties, and introduce key definitions. In Section 3, the main theoretical results are developed and proved. Section 4 summarizes our findings and opens avenues for further research. Finally, the notation used throughout the paper is displayed in Appendix A.

The moral hazard model, a particular instance of a Stackelberg game, involves two players. At the upper level, a risk-neutral principal sets wages associated with the outcomes of a task performed by an agent, with the aim of maximizing its expected profit, expressed as the difference between the ‘value’ of the random outcome and the associated wage. At the lower level, the risk-neutral agent selects the effort level that maximizes its own expected profit, expressed as the difference between the wage and the cost of the associated effort level. The model rests on random variables that relate the probability of observing an outcome, for a given effort level. It is mathematically expressed as

The social welfare loss ρ, which is typically larger than 1, captures the inefficiency of a system when its players act selfishly instead of choosing a socially-optimal effort. When the principal-agent model is discrete, meaning that the set of efforts 
                        E
                      is finite, the authors in Balmaceda et al. (2010) obtained tight bounds, that can be made arbitrarily large in some specific situations, for instance by increasing the number of possible efforts, or by choosing the probability of the best state at the lowest effort level arbitrarily small. The same set of authors in Balmaceda et al. (2010) show that under MLR and CDFC, the analysis can be extended to a continuous case, meaning that the set of efforts 
                        E
                      is an interval.

In the present paper, we focus on the continuous principal-agent model, where 
                        
                           E

                           ,
                           b
                           ]
                        
                      with 0 < a < b. We assume that the social welfare takes positive values for every e ∈ [a, b]. We also make the following assumptions.

                              SW is single-peaked. More precisely, there exists some effort m ∈ (a, b] such that u

                     A2 and A3 are standard assumptions in this framework. Especially, A3 implies that the outcome is increasing with respect to the effort level. A4 is consistent with the diminishing marginal returns intuition. Actually, we will show that

                      is an increasing function, so that concavity implies that marginal probability gains decrease with the effort size. It is also interesting to note that A4 results from the popular CDFC.

                      is a concave function (see, e.g., Rogerson, 1985) which is stronger than the single-peaked property described in A1.

CDFC is often invoked since, alongside MLR, it ensures the validity of FOA, which in turn implies that the limited liability constraint of the agent is not tight. One can then set the derivative of the agent’s objective to zero to obtain a linear programming program which is simpler and more tractable. Under these conditions, plus twice differentiability of π, the authors in Balmaceda et al. (2010) obtain the tight bound

Our study in motivated in part by the fact that CDFC is a very restrictive condition, which is not satisfied by several probability distributions, and does not comply with the natural property of diminishing marginal returns (see Rogerson, 1985). Since our assumptions are implied by the conditions imposed in Balmaceda et al. (2010), all our results will hold in their more restrictive setting, without relying on FOA. After developing our theory in Section 3, we will provide examples of distributions that comply with A3 and A4, but not with CDFC, describing a real-world problem (see Example 5).

It happens that the distribution function

                      might not be available in practice. In this case, this paper suggests that

                     . In other words, it says that this upper bound does not change as long as the cost function and the set of effort are the same.

Next we introduce the class of relevant efforts which, under some conditions, include the optimal ones. Whether this is the case or not will influence considerably the nature of the social welfare loss. The definition will rely on the concept of balancing effort that will be described in the following.

                                    e ≥ d, where d is the balancing effort.

The set of relevant efforts is denoted by 
                              
                                 R
                                 E
                              
                           .

From this definition, we have that a relevant effort can be associated with an optimal wage schedule where the agent is only paid if the best state is achieved. While the wage increases with the effort, yet the effort d is the largest one allowing the agent to balance his/her revenue against his/her cost. In other words, d is the largest effort in 
                        E
                      at which the agent’s utility is zero or equivalently (IR) in (1) is binding.

Before addressing the heart of the matter, let us emphasize that, in the absence of the limited liability constraint, there is no welfare loss. Indeed (see Laffont and Martimort, 2001), the objective of the principal and the social welfare can be made equal for any effort level. We now begin with results that will be useful in the sequel.

Following Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970), it is easy to show that πS
                            is non-decreasing. Indeed, take

                           (e).

Now assume that πS
                            is not increasing. Therefore, there exists some β ∈ [a, b) such that πS
                           (β) = πS
                           (b), which in turn implies that πS
                            is a constant function on [β, b], because the concavity of πS
                            implies that πS
                            is continuous on its interior of domains (see Rockafellar, 1997). Next we prove that πi
                            is constant on [β, b] for each i = 1, …, S − 1 if πS
                            is so. To this end, let e, f ∈ [β, b] with e < f. From A3 we obtain

The following proposition shows that, without loss of generality, we can assume that πS
                      is increasing.

                        Proposition 3.2
                        Consider the model (1). If c is increasing, A3 holds, πS
                            is concave, and there exists β ∈ [a, b) such that πS
                            is constant on [β, b], then the feasible set of MPLP(e) is empty for each e ∈ (β, b], and therefore, the solution set of (1) is a subset of [a, β].

Using Proposition 3.1, we know that 
                              
                                 
                                    π
                                    →
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    e
                                    )
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    α
                                    →
                                 
                              
                            for each e ∈ [β, b], where 
                              
                                 α
                                 →
                              
                            is a constant vector in 
                              
                                 R
                                 S
                              
                           . Take e ∈ (β, b]. In this situation, (IC) of MPLP(e) reduces to c(β) ≥ c(e) which is impossible due to the fact that c is increasing. This proves that MPLP(e) has an empty feasible set.□

Now, let us consider the dual of the semi-infinite programming (2) whose dual function associated with the constraints (IC) is denoted by λ(f) . Following Shapiro (2005), we know that λ(f) is equal to zero, except at a finite number of points. This allows us to formulate the dual as

In the next theorem, we capitalize on this dual to identify relevant efforts and optimal wages. We first establish that the balancing effort d, introduced in Definition 2.2, is the smallest relevant effort. More precisely, one of the following three situations must occur:

                        
                           •
                           the balancing effort is the largest effort b, in which case b is the unique relevant effort;


                              d = a and every effort is relevant;


                              d is the unique root of g, defined at e as

To complete (iii), it remains to show that z(e) = c(e) for each e ∈ [a, d]. We have shown in (ii) that z(e) = c(e) for each e ∈ [a, b). One can use a similar argument to prove that z(e) = c(e) for each e ∈ [a, d].

The argument invoked in (iii) also shows that each e ∈ (a, b] is relevant. Therefore, it remains to show that a is relevant as well. Using Proposition 3.3, we have that

It is worthwhile to note that the program (11) is similar to the one that can be deduced from FOA, the only difference being that the second inequality becomes an equality. Therefore, FOA could be used to prove similar results, and has proved to be popular. It is for instance at the heart of Theorem 5.1 of Balmaceda et al. (2010) dealing with the worst-case social welfare loss in the case of a continuous set of efforts. However, the analysis remains limited, since CDFC is invoked as well. Our arguments allow us to bypass the contentious CDFC and keep the developments at a more general level.

It is also notable that the principal’s utility uP
                     , defined in (3) may not be differentiable at e = d, while it is differentiable on (d, b], where d is the balancing effort introduced in Definition 2.2. This non-differentiability results from the optimal wage schedules obtained in Theorem 3.4(iii)–(iv). Indeed, one gets

We now show that there is no incentive for the principal to implement an effort larger than m, the mode of u
                     SW. This is in line with Balmaceda et al. (2010), since CDFC implies the concavity, and therefore the single-peaked property, of u
                     SW. More precisely, we will prove that when g(d) = 0, defined in (9), with d < m, the principal implements a relevant effort in [d, m], where m is the socially-optimal effort introduced in A1. On the other hand, if d ≥ m, then an interesting case occurs. In this situation, (IR) in (1) is binding at e = m. Therefore, it is optimal for the principal to implement m, because he reaps the full social surplus u
                     SO, driving the agent’s profit to zero.

                        Theorem 3.5
                        Consider the model (1). Assume that A1, A2, A3 and A4 are satisfied. Moreover, assume that d is the balancing effort introduced in Definition 2.2. Then, the following statements hold.

                                     is differentiable, any optimal effort of the principal-agent model (1) is relevant.

If d ≥ m, m is the only optimal solution of (1).

                                    SW(f), contradicting the fact that u
                                    SW is increasing on [a, m]. This completes the proof of (i).

Using Definition 2.1(iv) and the fact that u
                                    SW is single-peaked, (16) shows that u

                                    SW(m) = uP
                                    (m). On the other hand, u
                                    SW(e) ≥ uP
                                    (e) for each

In Balmaceda et al. (2010), the authors suggest the possibility to replace CDFC by the requirement that the social welfare is not decreasing. This non-decreasing social welfare (NDSW) condition naturally implies that the social welfare is single-peaked, with a peak equal to the upper bound of the effort set. Our previous theorem also covers this alternative restrictive assumption, that rules out the possibility that an irrelevant effort could be optimal (see below).

                            is any number in [0, 2.5]. In this case, there is no welfare loss and the optimal effort is irrelevant.

We now turn our attention to the derivation of upper bounds for the worst-case social welfare loss defined in (5), for which we must first compute the quantity defined in (4). Note that, as a consequence of Theorem 3.5, there is no welfare loss if d ≥ m.

                                 By Definition 2.1(iv) and A1, we have that u

                                    SW(m), which proves (18).

Equation (19) follows from Theorem 3.5(i) and the fact that u
                                    SW is increasing on [d, m]. On the other hand,

According to (28), if the costs corresponding to the lowest and highest effort levels are known (the value of πS
                      is unknown), then

                      is an upper bound for the social welfare loss. On the other hand, if the optimal effort is larger than the mode of the social welfare utility, there is no welfare loss, a situation that often occurs, and that we will be illustrated later in the paper.

                        Example 3
                        The main aim of this example is to present a family of problems for which the probability of the highest outcome under the smallest effort is bounded away from zero. In this case, the worst-case social welfare loss is finite. Set

Finally note that a real-world scenario like that of Example 4 can be described to show that the recommended upper bounds in Theorem 3.8 for the social welfare loss can be as close as possible to the actual social welfare loss defined in (4).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The paradigm of the principal-agent model is a classical concept in economics, although several of its theoretical properties are still not well understood, including the welfare loss resulting from the non-cooperative behavior of the two players involved. Following the footsteps of Balmaceda et al. (2010), we address the issue of computing the social welfare loss (the price of anarchy) in the risk-neutral case, under weaker conditions than those considered by these authors. In particular, we do not assume the convexity of the distribution functions, or that social welfare is a strictly increasing function of effort, two conditions that are not met for natural families of distributions. Our results also indicate that bounds are highly dependent on the shape of the distributions, and on the effort sets. Social welfare loss is indeed bounded whenever the cost function is bounded. If large efforts are disallowed, it may be that the social-optimal effort may not be reached, and that the principal’s optimal strategy is to impose a wage schedule that only rewards the agent if the best state is implemented. If the latter is associated with a very small probability, i.e., the principal is simply betting on the outcome. The nature of the situation totally changes if the socially-optimal effort can be considered, resulting in the absence of the welfare loss. This has important practical results, suggesting that large efforts should be allowed, whenever it is relevant to the situation, in order to strike the right balance between the objectives of the principal and the agent. Some issues remain to be settled with respect to the social welfare loss. One of them concerns the class of distributions that are the most relevant to actual applications, and another the generalization of the analysis to continuous probability measures.
