                  Most of the worldwide standards used for furniture selection suggest the use of the Stature of the school children, assuming that all the other anthropometric characteristics will also be appropriate. However, it is important to consider that students' growth differ with age. The aim of this study is to determine if Popliteal Height can be used as a better, or more adequate, measure for classroom furniture selection when comparing with Stature. This study involved a representative group of 3046 students from the Valparaíso Region, in Chile. Regarding the methodology, eight anthropometric measures were gathered, as well as six furniture dimensions from the Chilean standard. After assigning the level of school furniture using Stature and Popliteal Height to each of the students, six mismatch equations were applied. The results show that when using Popliteal Height, higher levels of match were obtained for the two more important furniture dimensions. Additionally, it also presents a better cumulative fit than Stature. In conclusion, it seems that Popliteal Height can be the most accurate anthropometric measure for classroom furniture selection purposes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

School work requires students to spend long hours sitting down. Considering this, as well as the potential inadequate use of school furniture, it is likely that some anatomical-functional changes and problems in the learning process may occur (García-Acosta and Lange-Morales, 2007; Trevelyan and Legg, 2006; Milanese and Grimmer, 2004; Hira, 1980). This situation causes an increased concern about the school classrooms, particularly about the study and design of school furniture suitable to the needs of the students and the appropriate dimensions according to the students' anthropometrics characteristics. Worldwide, it is possible to observe a great number of studies regarding the students' anthropometric characteristics, with the aim of generating safer school furniture (Agha, 2010; Dianat et al., 2013; Evans et al., 1988; García-Acosta and Lange-Morales, 2007; Musa, 2011; Oyewole et al., 2010; Savanur et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is an increase in the number of standards regarding school furniture in different countries, such as: Chile (INN, 2002), Colombia (ICONTEC, 1999), the European Union (CEN, 2012), Japan (JIS, 2011) and United Kingdom (BSI, 2006).

Anthropometric information for chair design is mainly concerned with providing data on the Stature of the people for whom the seats are designed (Evans et al., 1988; Kayis, 1991). Furthermore, most of the standards that are published worldwide for furniture selection tend to use, as a reference, Stature (S) as the anthropometric dimension of the school children, assuming that all the other anthropometric characteristics are also appropriate. However, it is important to remember that student growth differ with ages. For example, before puberty, the legs grow more rapidly than the trunk and in adolescents, the growth spurt is largely in the trunk (Bass et al., 1999). Also, Lueder and Berg Rice (2008) recommended that for designing school furniture it may be useful to consider how children develop and mature, as well as to incorporate features that accommodate a wide range of ages in good postures. The body proportion, i.e., the proportions related to the S between different segments of the body, may be helpful for this situation since it is a scaling relation calculated with a ratio of one body dimension to a specific reference dimension. The most common reference dimension is the Stature (Roebuck et al., 1975).

Some authors (Cho, 1994; Hibaru and Watanabe, 1994; Molenbroek et al., 2003; Noro and Fujita, 1994) suggest that the furniture selection can be done more efficiently if the Popliteal Height (PH) is used instead of S. Molenbroek et al. (2003), demonstrated, by using ellipses, that the seat height proposed in the standard PrEN 1729 is too high for most of the children with S of 1200 mm. Hibaru and Watanabe (1994) found that the chair size selection was strongly correlated with the PH in 124 students from 4th grade. Another, more complex system was also developed to allocate school furniture by Noro and Fujita (1994). This system is based on the physical images of students and it considered the different variables like PH, S, school grade and physical condition (slim, average and obese). However, there is a controversial point raised between the authors that proposed PH for allocation to the school furniture, namely the fact that, as reported by Noro and Fujita (1994), there is the need to make accurate measurement of PH and this requires experience and skills. On the other hand, Molenbroek et al. (2003) suggested that current knowledge about the use and the measurement of PH in a school class is absent. Nevertheless, the authors assumed that this is not necessarily more difficult and/or time consuming compared to the measurement of S if some measurement strategies are applied, such as the example shown in Fig. 1
                      (Molenbroek et al., 2003).

The aim of this study is to determine if PH can be used as a better and most accurate measure for classroom furniture selection rather than using S.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

It is important to mention that, in Chile, growth seems to be clearly influenced by socio-economic aspects, where it has been observed that children from higher socio-economic levels are taller than those of lower and medium socio-economic levels (Castellucci et al., 2010; Muzzo, 2003). On this basis, the selection used a stratified random sample regarding the three types of elementary school administrations in Chile (public, semi-public and private), as well as the corresponding financial situation of the students.

The estimated student population of basic and secondary schools in the Valparaíso Region during 2010 was 243,490 students. Considering a 50% prevalence of school furniture mismatch (p = 0.5 to obtain the largest sample), with 3% accuracy, 95% confidence intervals, and 15% of loss, the theoretical sample size is 1251 students. However, based on the Chilean school education system, every school has 12 grades, with students ranging from the age of 6 to 18 years old. In order to cover all of them, it was decided to use a random sample of at least 20 students per grade, keeping the proportionality of each cluster. This cross-sectional study involved a representative group of 3046 participants (1382 female and 1664 male students), with ages ranging from 6 to 18 years old (11.7 ± 3.5), from 18 schools that were randomly selected from a list given by the Regional Ministerial Secretary of Education.

The study started after its approval by the Committee of Ethics at the School of Medicine from the Universidad de Valparaíso. Permission to conduct this research was obtained also from the Regional Ministerial Secretary of Education and from the headmaster of each of the considered schools. Additionally, written consent was obtained from parents and students before starting the measurement procedures.


                        Table 1
                         presents the furniture dimensions from the five levels of furniture dimensions indicated in Chilean Standard 2566 (INN, 2002), which were utilized in the current study. Also, Fig. 2
                         shows a representation of the furniture dimensions.

The anthropometric dimensions were collected from the right side of the subjects while they were sitting in an erect position on a height-adjustable chair with a horizontal surface, with their legs flexed at a 90° angle, and with their feet flat on an adjustable footrest. During the measurement process, the subjects were without shoes and were wearing shorts and T-shirts (ISO, 2008).

All measurements were taken with a portable anthropometer (Holtain), with an exception made to subjects' Stature, which was measured with a stadiometer.

The anthropometric measures considered and collected during this study are presented and defined in Table 2
                         and Fig. 3
                        .


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the procedure for assigning the level of school furniture and analyzes the level of mismatch. The level of school furniture was assigning using S – “Selection by Stature” (SbS) – as the Chilean standard recommend following different intervals for example. For example, if the student's stature is 167 cm the school furniture level will be the 4th. The school furniture was also assigned using PH – “Selection by Popliteal Height” (SbPH) – it is important to mention that 2 cm were considered for SC, as an example if the same subject presents 43 cm of PH plus the 2 cm of SC the total value will be 45 cm and the students will use the 5th level. After having done this procedure to each of the participants in the sample, the mismatch equations proposed by Castellucci et al. (2014) were applied (Table 3
                        ).


                        Table 3 shows three one-way equations to test the level of mismatch of SW, UEB and SDC. For the one-way equations only two categories, or levels, were defined: ‘‘Match’’ and ‘‘Mismatch’’.

Equation (3) tests SW using HW considering only one limit, as mentioned by Pheasant (2003), and the cardinal constraints of anthropometrics considered in this equation are clearance since SW has to be higher than HW to avoid discomfort and mobility restrictions (Evans et al., 1988; Helander, 1997; Orborne, 1996; Oyewole et al., 2010). Following the same cardinal constraints of anthropometrics, Equation (5) shows that the SDC has to be 2 cm higher than TT to allow the students to push the chair under the table. Finally, Equation (4) shows that UEB need to be lower than SUH to generate enough free space for scapula mobility.

In Table 3, it is possible to observe three two-way equations (Equations (1), (2) and (6)), where both the minimum and maximum limits were considered. In this case, three categories were defined: (i) “Match” level, when the furniture dimensions are between the limits; (ii) “High mismatch” level, when the maximum limit of the equation is lower than the furniture dimension, indicating that the furniture dimension is higher than needed; and finally, (iii) “Low mismatch” level, when the minimum limit of the equation is higher than the furniture dimension – in this case, the furniture dimensions are lower than the recommended level.

In first place, the SH equation is based on the height of PH (Equation (1)). It also considers the biomechanics of the knee, where the lower leg forms a 5–30° angle relative to the vertical (Gouvali and Boudolos, 2006). This situation is reflected by the different values of cosines (cos). The formula shows that the SH has to be higher than cos30° of the PH plus the shoe correction (SC) to avoid and extension of more than 30° relative to the vertical. This is relevant, since with more extension, the feet will not be placed flat on the floor or the thighs would not be supported enough, causing discomfort. On the other hand, SH has to be lower than cos5° of the PH plus SC to ensure that the student will sit in a chair high enough so that both feet are placed entirely on the floor, but also avoiding the compression in the buttock region (García-Molina et al., 1992). In this study, 2 cm were considered for the SC. However, it is also necessary to consider that SC may naturally vary according to culture, fashion, and country. For example, other authors also recommend shoe corrections with values of 2 cm (Agha, 2010; Dianat et al., 2013; Gouvali and Boudolos, 2006), 2.5 cm (Herzberg, 1972; Van Niekerk et al., 2013) and 4.5 cm (Pheasant, 1984).

Equation (2) evaluates the SD by using the percentage of Buttock Popliteal Length (BPL). The support of at least of 80% of BPL is needed to avoid the extra-pressure on the back of the thighs, which could cause discomfort (Pheasant, 2003). However, the SD cannot be higher than 95% of the BPL because the student will not be able to use the backrest of the seat and, consequently, will not be able to support the lumbar spine without compression of the Popliteal surface (Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). To avoid this it is likely that the student will generally move their buttocks forward toward the edge of the seat, as suggested by Panagiotopoulou et al. (2004). This improper usage of the backrest causes kyphotic posture (Khalil et al., 1993; Pheasant, 1991).

Finally, the last two-way equations are the DH equation, which was used for the first time in the context of school furniture by Parcells et al. (1999) and considered that acceptable elbow rest height (AERH) depends not only on Elbow Height Sitting (EHS), but also on the shoulder flexion and abduction angles. To determine AERH it is necessary to know the SHS and EHS, since by subtracting these anthropometric measures the Upper Arm Length (U) can be calculated. Shoulder Flexion (θ) and Shoulder Abduction (β) need to also be considered in the following main formula:

Furthermore, considering Chaffin and Anderson's principles (1991) of acceptable shoulder flexion angles from 0° to 25° and shoulder abduction from 0° to 20°, the student's minimum DH is determined by the minimum shoulder flexion and abduction of 0° the corresponding cosines are 1. Given that the cosines are monotone functions of the angles, the minimum AERH is determined by the EHS, since:

On the other hand, the maximum AERH is calculated by considering the 25° of shoulder flexion and 20° of shoulder abduction, where the corresponding cosines are 0.9063 and 0.9397, respectively. The equation proposed is:

It is important to mention that Equations (8) and (9) only considered the distance from the seat to the table. Due to this, the minimum and maximum DH, presented in Equation (6), considered the SH and the backward slope of the chairs, since the elbow is aligned with the back of the seat and is lower than the front edge. Regarding the seat angle, the standard considered a 4° backward slope or negative seat angle.

All the anthropometric data were analyzed using MS Excel and SPSS (v22.0). The Pearson Correlation coefficient was applied between the anthropometric measures, since this is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. The dispertion graphics of S and PH with the others anthropometric measures are presented in appendice.

After the different equations were applied, categorical data (Low Mismatch, Match and High Mismatch) were analyzed. The Kappa Statistic was applied to measure the degree of concordance between the two anthropometric measures used for furniture selection (Stature/Popliteal Height).

Kappa is a good tool to assess inter-observer reliability, particularly for qualitative items (match/mismatch). In this study, it was used to determine the level of inter-observer reliability of the two anthropometric measures used for furniture selection.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The obtained values from the eight anthropometric measures of all the considered participants are presented by age and split by gender in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                         for female and male, respectively.

The Pearson Correlation coefficient result shows a strong positive correlation between S and the other anthropometric dimensions gathered in this study, with the following values: PH (r = 0.95), BPL (r = 0.93), TT (r = 0.74), HW (r = 0.76), EHS (r = 0.68), SUH (r = 0.90) and SHS (r = 0.93). These results are normally used as a justification to use S for school furniture selection. Furthermore, comparing with S the PH measure presents a weaker positive correlation with the following values: BPL (r = 0.89), TT (r = 0.68), HW (r = 0.69), EHS (r = 0.59), SUH (r = 0.82) and SHS (r = 0.86). However, as it was mentioned before, an important issue for school furniture selection is the consideration of the students' stage of growth. To analyze this situation, PH and SHS will be transformed in ratios, in relation to the S, to give indications of body proportions. Steenbekkers (1993) suggested that SHS might be used as a measure of trunk length. When SHS is divided by Stature, it yields a value for trunk length relative to whole body length.

In Fig. 5
                        , it is possible to observe, at first glance, that males present higher levels of proportion of PH than females, and that there are opposite results for the trunk length ratio. It also shows how the proportion of these dimensions varies with age.

In the case of females after six years old, lower limbs grow more significantly, with the highest value at the age of 10, after that, the values start to decrease faster until 15 years of age. The trunk proportion starts to grow faster at the age of 12, with values that go from 0.349 to 0.366 at the age of 18. Similar results were observed for males PH proportion with differences that had the highest values and who had peak growth that was reached one year later than females. This situation can be explained by the fact that males reach puberty at an older age than females (Burrows et al., 2004). The implications of these results in the anthropometric measure used for furniture selection and the level of mismatch will be explored later in this report.

Before the presentation of the results, it is important to mention that by using SbPH, 30 students will not find proper school furniture, since all of them present lower PH (with SC) than the minimum considered by the Chilean standard (30 cm). In the case of SbS, 12 students are considered to be out of the reference S range (Table 1), three of them below 110 cm and nine above 184 cm.

As expected, from the analysis of the data in Fig. 6
                        , when the furniture selection was done using PH, 100% of the students found a perfect fit regarding SH. However, when it was done using the SbS, 16.9% of students found that the chair is too high (High mismatch) and will be unable to rest their feet on the floor properly, thus causing compression of vascular and neural structures going along the Popliteal space (Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). Additionally, 1% of the students will use a lower than needed chair, which will increase the compression in the buttock region (García-Molina et al., 1992), while also increasing the degree of lumbar flexion involved in sitting (Pheasant, 2003). The result of Kappa Statistics shows a slight agreement (k = 0.01) between the two anthropometric measures used for furniture selection. It is important to highlight that SH should be considered as the starting point and the most important variable for the design of the classroom furniture (Castellucci et al., 2010; Molenbroek et al., 2003).

In Table 6
                        , it is possible to observe that females present a level of SH mismatch higher than males, this situation can be explain since the males presents higher levels of PH proportion (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the females in the age range of 8–12 years present the lower level of high mismatch – the age range that achieved the highest level of PH proportion (Fig. 5). Similar results are presented by the male population, with the lowest level of high mismatch in the age range of 10–13 years, where the levels of PH proportion exceeded 0.26. Furthermore, to strengthen these results, the average of PH proportion for high mismatch, match and low mismatch when SH was SbS were calculated. The results were 0.246 ± 0.008, 0.259 ± 0.008 and 0.279 ± 0.012, respectively.

Considering the previously presented results, it is possible to infer that PH is the most accurate anthropometric measure for SH dimension and is heavily influenced by proportion. This situation can be reflected by Reis et al. (2012), who indicates that at the different school phases until the beginning of puberty, one should pay more attention to the height of the seat and, during puberty, the height of the desk deserves more attention, since after six years old, lower limbs grow more significantly and continue to grow faster than other body segments until the onset of puberty, which, in turn, causes the trunk to grow faster again. Also, there are some facts that support PH as a good reference for defining the level of school furniture by using the technique of dividing the cumulative distribution of PH (Evans et al., 1988; Gutierrez and Apud, 1995; UNESCO, 2001), but this is not used for school furniture selection.

Finally, another point to consider is that not only age and gender are key factors for proportion, but also ethnic diversity. Lin et al. (2004) shows that most of the average dimensions and all of the bodily proportions have significant differences among four East Asian peoples (Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese).


                        Fig. 6 shows too shallow seats for 43% and 46% of the students using SbS and SbPH, respectively. This situation of mismatch shows that the students' thighs would not be supported enough and would generate discomfort (Pheasant, 2003). On the other hand, very low values of high mismatch are observed for SbS (0.4%) and SbPH (0.7%). For this furniture dimension, the Kappa Statistics show a substantial agreement between SbS and SbPH (k = 0.69).

Finally, Fig. 6 also presents the highest level of high mismatch for DH, with 82% and 79% when SbS and SbPH are used, respectively. In this situation the students will flex and abduct their upper arms, as well as raise their shoulders. This, in the opinion of García-Molina et al. (1992), may result in more muscle work load, discomfort and pain in the shoulder region. If this is the case for only one upper limb, it will result in an asymmetrical spinal posture. Notwithstanding the large number of students that will have to face this high mismatch, it is important to note that it is likely that the formulation of the applied equation (Equation (6)) may include some problems and thus needs to be evaluated in detail, both in the field and in the laboratory (Castellucci et al., 2014). After applying the Kappa Statistic test, it can be concluded that there exists an almost perfect agreement for DH between the two anthropometric measure used for furniture selection (k = 0.82).

Narrower seats were observed for 7.1% and 8.7% of the students using SbS and SbPH, respectively (Fig. 7
                        ). According to Helander (1997) and Orborne (1996), with such seats the school children will not be able to dissipate the pressure at the buttock, which will also cause discomfort and mobility restrictions. The Kappa Statistics between SbS and SbPH show an almost perfect agreement (k = 0.86).

After selecting furniture with SbS and SbPH, 2.1% and 3.9% of the students will find the backrest higher than SUH, respectively (Fig. 7). This type of mismatch will result in the compression of the scapula and in a reduction in the arm and trunk mobility (García-Acosta and Lange-Morales, 2007; Orborne, 1996), which can impair task performance and cause awkward postures in order to achieve task goals. In this furniture dimension, the Kappa Statistic indicates a moderate agreement between the two anthropometric measure (k = 0.56).

SDC mismatched 7.1% and 10.9% of the students, respectively, for SbS and SbPH (Fig. 7). In this situation, students will restrain mobility because of the contact of the thighs with the desk (Parcells et al., 1999; Sanders and McCormick, 1993) and because they will not be able to push the chair under the table. The result of Kappa Statistics shows substantial agreement (k = 0.73) between the two anthropometric measures used for furniture selection.

In order to improve the analysis, Fig. 8
                         shows the percentage of estimated “cumulative fit” by using the two compared selection approaches, i.e., the SbS and SbPH. The cumulative fit is defined as the match that takes into account the cumulative values of the different furniture dimensions in analysis (Castellucci et al., 2014). The obtained results shows that the higher level of cumulative fit (or match) can be reached by adopting the SbPH. The final results show that only 7% for SbS and 8% for SbPH of the students will fit in the different furniture sizes presented by the Chilean Standard N° 2566. However, these results should be interpreted with caution since, as mentioned before, there is a potential problem in the criteria formulation of Equation (6), which might well be impairing the final results.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that the Chilean students from the Valparaiso Region present differences in the proportion of Popliteal Height and Trunk Length when comparing it across the two genders and different ages. The levels of mismatch, especially for Seat Height, are also influenced by the different Popliteal Height proportions presented by the students during the different stage of growth.

Regarding the anthropometric measure used for furniture selection, it can be concluded that four out of six dimensions present the highest levels of match when the school furniture is SbS. However, for the most important furniture dimensions (Seat Height and Desk Height), it has obtained a better fit when SbPH is used. Furthermore, it can be stated that Popliteal Height is the most accurate, and therefore the most appropriate, anthropometric measure for classroom furniture selection since it presents a better cumulative fit (or match) than Stature.

It should be highlighted that it is somehow not clear why Popliteal Height is not used for furniture selection in the standards published worldwide, since it can be easier to measure this dimension than Stature. Finally, it seems that it will be also important to analyse the Chilean Standard recommended values, since it appears that there is high percentage of mismatch between children's characteristics and the furniture's recommended dimensions.
