                  This paper is concerned with the single-item inventory system with resource constraint and all-units quantity discount under continuous review where demand is stochastic and discrete. In most actual inventory systems, the resource available for inventory management is limited and the system is able to confront the resource shortage by charging more costs. Considering the resource constraint as a soft constraint beside a quantity discount opportunity makes the model more practical. An optimization problem is formulated for finding an optimal (r, Q) policy for the problem in which the per unit resource usage depends on unit purchasing price. The properties of the cost function are investigated and then an algorithm based on a one-dimensional search procedure is proposed for finding an optimal (r, Q) policy which minimizes the expected system costs and converges to a global optimum. Based on the properties of the partially conditioned cost functions, the presented algorithm is modified such that its search path to optimal policy is changed. Experimental results show that the performance of the modified version of the presented algorithm is much better than the original algorithm in various environments of test problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The (r, Q) policy also known as reorder-point/order-quantity policy is one of the most common practical policies in inventory control systems. The purpose of an (r, Q) inventory control system is to determine the values of r and Q which minimize system costs. Such (r, Q) inventory models under various practical assumptions and constraints have been extensively studied in the literature. In spite of a large number of heuristics, the first efficient algorithm for finding optimal (r, Q) policy in a discrete inventory system with backorders for shortages, was proposed by Federgruen and Zheng (1992). This algorithm is based on the unimodality of the cost function which is implied by the results of Sahin (1982). Federgruen and Wang (2013) have provided general conditions for monotonicity of the optimal policy parameters as a function of various model primitives and extended the results both to standard inventory models and to the models with general shelf age and delay dependent inventory costs. (r, Q) policies continue to be studied under various important extension of the base model. Olsson (2014) has considered an inventory system with continuous review (r, Q) policy under the assumption of Poisson demand and perishable items with fixed lead times and lifetimes. He develops a heuristic approach for finding near optimal values of reorder point and order quantity for different types of backordering cost structures.

Another important and practical extension of (r, Q) inventory models is considering the resource constraint in such models. In practice, the resource available in inventory system is usually limited. So, making a decision about a replenishment policy under the resource constraint is one of the most important issues in real inventory systems. Two types of resources in inventory systems as mentioned by Zhao, Qiu, Xie, and He (2012), are exclusive-separate resource and sharable-common resource. The exclusive-separate resource can be the storage-space in a warehouse for which different items have different characteristics in weight, shape and volume. The sharable-common resource can be the budget used by all types of inventory items. As described by Minner and Silver (2005), “Practical applications are budget constraints, where the total amount of capital tied up in inventories at any time is limited by corporate strategy in industry or by law/regulation in government/military applications”. Thus, in regard to practical concerns, considering a constraint on the budget used by all items is one of the most significant issues in inventory management. Nevertheless, and as mentioned by Zhao et al. (2012), yet studies on inventory systems with limited and sharable-common resource are limited. Minner and Silver (2005) have considered a continuous review inventory system with zero lead times and common budget or space limitation, in which backorders are not permitted. Thus, when the inventory level of a product drops to zero, the product is replenished. With such assumptions, the on-hand inventory equals the inventory position. They derive a semi-Markov decision formulation for the problem under Poisson demand, which can be solved optimally for small instances of the problem and propose heuristics to solve the problem by referring to the economic ordering quantity (EOQ). Fleischmann and Kuik (2003) have considered a special case in reverse logistics in which companies take recovery of used products into account in their material management. They have analyzed the impact inbound flow on inventory control in a single inventory point facing independent stochastic demand and item returns. By general results on Markov decision processes, they have shown average cost optimality of an (r, Q) policy in this model. They have presented a transformation of their model into an equivalent traditional (r,Q) model without return flows. In this way and under a more practical assumption, Pinçe, Gürler, and Berk (2008) have analyzed a model with stochastic demands and an independent return flow where disposal is allowed with fixed disposal costs and positive lead times under a continuous review replenishment–disposal policy. Via analytical expressions of the operating characteristics of the system, they have minimized the total expected costs of ordering, holding, purchasing and disposal per unit time subject to a fill rate constraint. Hariga (2010) has investigated a single-item continuous review inventory system with the stochastic continuous demand and a space restriction in which the over-ordered quantity is returned to the supplier at a certain cost. He has considered the approximate expression of the expected holding cost, which is affected by the storage space limitation. Kundu and Chakrabarti (2012) have considered a stochastic continuous review inventory model with budget constraint and mixture of backorders and lost sales in which the distribution of demand and lead time are unknown and purchasing costs are paid upon order arrival. The cost function is approximate and a Lagrange multiplier technique has been applied to solve the problem. Zhao, Fan, Liu, and Xie (2007) have studied an (r, Q) model with discrete stochastic demand and a constraint on storage-space for on-hand inventory. The solution approaches for finding an optimal policy in single-item system and undominated solution in multi-item case have been developed.

The literature on stochastic continuous review (r, Q) models can be separated into two categories: discrete and continuous demand models. There are major differences between the properties of discrete and continuous demand models. Ang, Song, Wang, and Zhang (2013) have presented a comprehensive study on the behavior of these two types of inventory models. Based on the discrete convexity concept, they have shown the non-convexity of a discrete (r, Q) system. Also they have shown that the significant properties which are applied to analyze the continuous models no longer hold in discrete counterparts. Hence, the analysis of the various extensions of inventory models with discrete demand is more complicated than the continuous demand models. This can partly explain why most of existing studies on (r, Q) models in the inventory literature are focused on continuous demand. On the other hand, it was shown that the cost function of continuous demand model is an adequate approximation of the cost function in discrete demand model only when the order quantity is large enough (Zheng, 1992). So, considering continuous cost function instead of discrete cost function is not efficient for all cases in systems with discrete demand.

Because of the resource limitation, most of the actual inventory systems may encounter resource shortage. Additionally, one of the common strategies to confronting the resource shortage in practice is that the inventory systems usually rent extra resource temporarily to provide the extra resource requirement more than the available resource. In this case, the resource constraint is applied as a soft constraint which makes the model more practical than models with hard resource constraint. Zhao et al. (2012) have studied an (r, Q) model with discrete stochastic demand and limited sharable-common resource for both single-item and multi-item cases. They have considered the resource constraint as a soft constraint and proved that an existing algorithm can be applied to find the optimal solution of single-item case. Also they have developed an algorithm for finding an optimal/near optimal replenishment policy for the multi-item case. We consider the same assumption as Zhao et al. (2012) did for the resource constraint. On the other hand, in many actual inventory systems (especially the ones with competitive supply market) usually several quantity discount opportunities are offered by suppliers. Katehakis and Smit (2012) have considered a single-item inventory system with continuous review (r, Q) policy and stochastic discrete demand under both all-units and incremental quantity discounts. They have proposed sufficient algorithms for computing the optimal policy. Feng and Sun (2001) have considered a single-item continuous review inventory system with stochastic demand and discount opportunities. They have proposed an algorithm based on a bisection search procedure to find the optimal replenishment policy. Munson and Hu (2010) have considered the multi-site organizations challenging with determining the appropriate degree of purchasing centralization. They have presented methodologies to calculate optimal order sizes and relevant costs via a scenario-based approach when products have quantity discount pricing under both all-units and incremental quantity. Shiue (1990) has considered an inventory system for perishable items with partially backlogging and partially lost saling. In his model which has been considered under quantity discounts, the demand is deterministic and the lead time is zero.

Though a limited resource and quantity discounts are two common characteristics in inventory management, very few works consider both in a continuous review model. Most of the existing literature on inventory systems which faces both a limited resource and quantity discount, have been devoted to inventory models such as newsboy models, e.g., Zhang (2010) or models with constant demand (see (Güder & Zydiak, 1997; Haksever & Moussourakis, 2008; Mousavi & Pasandideh, 2011; Moussourakis & Haksever, 2008; Moussourakis & Haksever, 2013)) which are different from continuous review models.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyze the single-item (r, Q) system with limited resource under all-units discount. In Section 3, based on the cost function properties a search region for the optimal policy is obtained. Section 4 presents an algorithm with its modification based on one-dimensional search procedure to find an optimal solution efficiently. Section 5 provides numerical evaluation of the efficiency and sensitivity of the presented algorithms. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

Consider a single-item inventory system consists of a supplier and customers which is controlled by applying an (r, Q) policy, where r is a finite integer and Q is a finite positive integer. Customer demands arrival occurs based on a renewal process with a mean λ per time unit and every customer demand requires a unit of goods. Demands arise discretely on a unit-by-unit basis. The demands that cannot be satisfied immediately are backordered. The replenishment goods are received from the supplier with a constant lead time L, after receiving an order from the inventory system. As a terminology in inventory literature, the inventory position, denoted by Ip
                     , is defined as the inventory level plus all outstanding orders, in which inventory level is equal to the amount of on-hand inventory minus the number of backorders and outstanding order refers to a replenishment order in transit. According to (r, Q) policy, Ip
                      is reviewed continuously and a fixed quantity Q is ordered to the supplier when Ip
                     drops to the reorder point r or lower. After a constant lead time, the ordered goods are received from the supplier. Because of the positive probability for a large demand at any time interval in Poisson demand distribution, it is possible to have any number of outstanding orders at a time. Therefore, more than one order can be outstanding at any time. Because of the Poisson demand arrival, Ip
                      is uniformly distributed on 
                        
                           {
                           
                              r
                              +
                              1
                              ,
                              r
                              +
                              2
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              r
                              +
                              Q
                           
                           }
                        
                      (Zhao et al., 2012). Furthermore, it is assumed that there is a limited sharable resource consumed by the ordering items which is not restricted but it incurs extra cost when exceeding specific value as Zhao et al. (2012) have assumed. In the other words, the system is able to confront the resource shortage by charging more costs and then the resource shortage costs is considered as a part of system costs. The resource is occupied when an order is placed and consequently the amount of resource occupied depends on the inventory position not the on-hand inventory. When a unit of goods in on-hand inventory or in outstanding orders is assigned to a customer, its corresponding resource is released and it is excluded from Ip
                     . Note that a unit of goods in outstanding orders can only be assigned to one customer. Hence, the resource is occupied only by the goods in on-hand inventory and the unassigned goods in outstanding orders which is given by

                           =

                                 ,
                                 
                                    I
                                    p
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                        
                     . To be more precise, let each unit of goods occupies s units of the resource to be ordered. Then, the amount of resource occupied is given by 
                        
                           s
                           ·
                           
                              I
                              p
                              +
                           
                        
                     . For a given (r, Q) policy the maximum amount of resource that may be occupied is equal to 
                        
                           s

                                 r

                                 Q
                                 )

                     . When the available resource, say B, is not enough to provide the resource requirement, it is possible to offsets the resource shortage via renting extra resource with renting cost rate a. Due to this act a resource shortage cost that is proportional to the amount of the rented resource is incurred and it is equal to

Here, we add the availability of all-units discount structure in purchasing to the existing assumption, by which the unit purchasing price depends on Q. We assume that the unit purchasing price conforms to the all-units discount structure with n discount levels

                     . Therefore, five types of costs are considered in the model: ordering cost, holding cost, inventory shortage cost, resource shortage cost and purchasing cost. For the given (r, Q) policy, the long-run average system cost per time unit is expressed as C
                     0(r, Q).To calculate C
                     0(r, Q)we need to define the following notations:

                        
                           
                              DL
                              : demand during a lead time with a mean λL
                           


                              K: ordering (set-up) cost per order (K > 0)


                              h: holding cost per unit of goods per time unit


                              p: penalty cost per demand backordered per time unit


                              y: inventory position

Now, we can present the long-run average system cost per time unit for a given (r, Q) policy under limited resource and all-units discount as follows:

                     0(r, Q). Therefore, for this special case of the problem, the algorithm presented by Katehakis and Smit (2012) obtains the optimal policy. Hence, we analyze the problem in case the limited resource is price-dependent which means that the per unit resource usage is linearly dependent to the unit purchasing price. Since the available budget is spent on purchasing items, the per unit resource usage is equal to the unit purchasing price. Therefore a clear instance of this type of resource is the available budget for purchasing. Considering the resource shortage costs especially when the amount of resource occupied by the purchased item is influenced by quantity discount is the main practical viewpoint of this model.

                      where η is a constant parameter and without loss of generality can be disregarded. Hence, we have 
                        
                           s
                           =

                     . In this situation the resource shortage cost is affected by Q in two different ways; at first Q determines the parameter of Ip
                      and Ip
                      specifies the resource shortage cost, secondly by the discount structure, Q specifies c
                     
                        j(Q)which is a key element in the amount of resource shortage cost. Therefore, resource shortage cost and purchasing cost both depend on the quantity discount parameters and they have different effect on finding the optimal policy. Consequently, for the given (r, Q) policy the long-run average system cost per time unit with a limited price-dependent resource under all-units discount can be expressed as follows:

C
                           1(r, Q).

Let (r*, Q*) denote the optimal solution of Problem 1. In the subsequent sections the properties of the expected system cost function C
                           1(r, Q) are analyzed and a solution approach is presented for finding
(r*, Q*) (Fig. 2).

This section contains all of the properties and results required to derive the optimization algorithm. Based on the analytical characteristic of the cost function the properties of the optimal solution are investigated and then a search region for the optimal policy is obtained. Using these properties a solution approach based on one-dimensional search procedure is presented to find the optimal policy of Problem 1. The idea behind this approach is breaking down the problem into at most n sub-problems which can be solved straightly. Therefore two major issues in this approach are (i) the definition of these sub-problems and finding optimal policies of these sub-problems (ii) using these optimal policies to solve Problem 1. The remainder of this section contains the responses for these issues.

In order to define the sub-problems, we first rewrite C
                     1(r, Q)as follows:

We conduct our experiments in two parts. In the first part, we calculate θ in various values of available resource and in various discount rates between two subsequent discount levels. In the second part, the sensitivity of θ upon various combination of demand, holding cost and amount of available resource is observed. We have the frameworks by which Zhao et al. (2012) and Mirmohammadi and Eshghi (2012) have performed their experiments. The value of parameters or the intervals from which the parameters values are generated for the first part of the experiment are listed in Table 3

First the relaxed version of the instance without discounted unit cost structure is solved and its optimal policy, named

                         as the initial value for the available resource and to tighten the resource constraint such that it becomes effective in searching process, it is multiplied by parameter α where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. The lower α leads to the tighter resource constraint.

For each combination of α and dp
                        , 5 instances are generated randomly and totally

                         instances are solved in the first part of the experiment. In each combination the average value of θ is calculated and the results are depicted in Fig. 5.
                        
                     

In the second part of the experiment it is investigated how θ changes in various levels of α and hwhen the demand rate increases. The values of parameters (except the ones listed in Table 4) and the way that the problem instances are generated are the same as explained above for the first part of the experiment.

In each combination of α and h (six combinations) for all demand rates, listed in Table 4, five instances are randomly generated to provide totally 270 test problems for the second part of the experiment. In each combination the average value of θ is calculated and the results are shown in Figs. 6
                         and 7
                        .

The following summarized conclusions are derived from the experimental results. It should be noted that all these conclusions are based on the results observed in tested intervals.

                           
                              (1)
                              For the test problems solved in the first part of the experiment, as depicted in Fig. 5, Algorithm 
                                    
                                       
                                          B
                                       
                                       +
                                    
                                  is superior to Algorithm B and this superiority is increasing when the available resource increases or when dp
                                  decreases. This property of θ over α intensifies when dp
                                  decreases. In other words, in the instances with higher available resource and smaller discount rate, Algorithm 
                                    
                                       
                                          B
                                       
                                       +
                                    
                                 obtains the optimal policy faster than Algorithm B.

In the second part of the experiment where 
                                    
                                       α
                                       =
                                       0.1
                                    
                                 , for all levels of h, θ is increasing over λ. This property of θ intensifies when h increases as shown in Fig. 6. In other words, for the instances with restricted available resource, the superiority of Algorithm 
                                    
                                       
                                          B
                                       
                                       +
                                    
                                  than Algorithm B increases when demand rate increases. This property becomes more highlighted for the items with higher holding cost.

Where the available resource is less restricted (
                                    
                                       α
                                       =
                                       0.9
                                    
                                 ), although the superiority of Algorithm 
                                    
                                       
                                          B
                                       
                                       +
                                    
                                  is increasing over demand rate for items with expensive holding cost, but it dwindles when the holding cost gets cheaper, such that for the small value of holding cost, not only it decreases from demand rate 30, but it also disappears after demand rate 65 and Algorithm B becomes superior. These results can be seen in Fig. 7.

From all the observed results obtained in the experiments, it can be concluded that the superiority of Algorithm 
                                    
                                       
                                          B
                                       
                                       +
                                    
                                  increases when the holding cost increases.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we investigated the (r, Q) inventory system under both all-units discount and a resource limitation which was considered as a soft constraint in the system cost function. It was assumed that the shortage of resource can be satisfied by renting extra resource and so a resource shortage cost that is proportional to the amount of rented resource is incurred. In the case in which the per unit resource usage is linearly dependent to the unit purchasing price, the problem was analyzed and based on derived properties of the cost function, an algorithm with a one-dimensional search procedure was presented to find an optimal policy of the problem via obtaining the partially optimal policies. To improve the efficiency of the presented algorithm, the sub-algorithm which obtains the partial optimal policies was modified and an improved version of the presented algorithm was presented. To evaluate the efficiency of the presented algorithms, they were compared experimentally. Numerical evaluations showed that the modified algorithm is superior to the basic one in most of scenarios of involved parameters. Also by the experimental results, the optimal system cost increases in the cases with small amount of available resource and large value of unit resource shortage cost.
