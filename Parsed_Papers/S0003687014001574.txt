                  Investigating new ways to deliver care, such as the use of self-service kiosks to collect and monitor signs of wellness, supports healthcare efficiency and inclusivity. Self-service kiosks offer this potential, but there is a need for solutions to meet acceptable standards, e.g. provision of accurate measurements. This study investigates the design and optimization of a prototype healthcare kiosk to collect vital signs measures. The design problem was decomposed, formalized, focused and used to generate multiple solutions. Systematic implementation and evaluation allowed for the optimization of measurement accuracy, first for individuals and then for a population. The optimized solution was tested independently to check the suitability of the methods, and quality of the solution. The process resulted in a reduction of measurement noise and an optimal fit, in terms of the positioning of measurement devices. This guaranteed the accuracy of the solution and provides a general methodology for similar design problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Worldwide, there are both immediate and far-reaching challenges to the provision of healthcare. For many countries, changes in demographic, growth in Long Term Conditions (LTCs) and changes in the ratio of caregivers to cared for is forcing a rethink in the way that healthcare is provided. Recently, a new kind of healthcare technology has emerged, based upon the use of self-service kiosks (PK, 2013; SoloHealth, 2013). These systems can be used to take physiological measures such as blood pressure, in order to provide healthcare advice.

When it comes to the design of such technology, the Human Factors and Ergonomics literature provides many classic and applicable design rules, relating to the physical characteristics of technology. Designers can also apply data relating to the statistical characteristics of the target population in order to fit a proposed solution to the characteristics of the user population (Yang and Chang, 2012; Vincent and Blandford, 2014). There are also guidelines relating to design methods (AAMI, 2009; Maguire, 2001; Salvendy, 1997), and user interfaces (Borchers et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2005; Maguire, 1999). All of the above can help match the design of healthcare kiosks with the properties of both users and environment, but doesn't necessarily guarantee accuracy of measurement.

Given the potential use of physiological measures in healthcare diagnosis, monitoring, and clinical decision-making, there is a need for accuracy. Measures need to be in compliance with clinical standards. This imposes challenges upon the design of the kiosk, because there is rarely a one size fits all solution. In addressing these challenges, it helps to break down the problem, consider the factors that impact on measurement accuracy, and control them. The kiosk measurement process can be considered as an interaction between human and machine, of which there are multiple components (e.g. physical, sensorimotor and psychological). They include traditional physical capabilities, as characterized by anthropometry and biomechanics. These factors contribute to the measurement accuracy and include aspects such as body posture, measuring device height, spatial arrangement of the equipment, etc. For instance, different postures can cause a variation of more than 20% in the measured systolic/diastolic blood pressure (MacWilliam, 1933). Another component relates to the psychological or mental state of the individual. This can result in a variation of more than 20% on cardiovascular measurements (Madden and Savard, 1995).

Getting an accurate measure is important, as almost two-thirds of hypertensive individuals would be denied morbidity preventing treatment if the diastolic blood pressure is underestimated by 5 mmHg. Conversely, the number of people diagnosed with hypertension would more than double if systolic pressure is overestimated by 5 mmHg (Campbell and McKay, 1999). Therefore, the design of an interactive self-service kiosk for the reading of vital signs needs careful consideration, including theoretical modelling of measurement accuracy and optimization across a number of factors.

When it comes to the user interface, although, researchers have frequently studied the ergonomics standards and efficiency of using different interactive components, to control equipment; comparatively few have investigated how to optimize the properties of equipment, to support the accuracy of measurement. Studies have proposed the ergonomics standards for user interactions (Maguire, 2014; Stewart, 1995), and contrasted the efficiency of various input modalities and interface structures, for example the use of touch screens versus manual controls and tangible elements (Rogers et al., 2005; Zuckerman and Gal-Oz, 2013), multimodal interaction techniques (Bergweiler et al., 2010; Kinen et al., 2002), intelligent presentation of user interfaces (UI) (Hagen and Sandnes, 2010), and alternative structuring of task instructions (Eiriksdottir and Catrambone, 2011). There are also studies focussing on the use of formal methods to improve interactivity, such as the use of model checking to verify safety properties (Bolton et al., 2012); nonlinear programming to calibrate and tune the properties of the design prior to implementation (Eslambolchilar and Murray-Smith, 2008), and optimization though the use of parametric design problem solving (Motta and Zdrahal, 1996) (examples from outside of healthcare). In addition, there are also studies optimizing the equipment integration from the perspective of communications, data exchanges and inter-operations (Lyu et al., 2014; Marcelli et al., 2007).

This paper focuses on the design of the physiological kiosk from the perspective of optimizing HMI and improving measurement accuracy. The proposed kiosk integrates several medical devices and sensors for reading the physiological characteristics of participants, including the blood pressure (BP), blood oxygen (SpO2), pulse rate (PR), electrocardiograph (ECG), blood glucose (BG), height and weight. These vital signs are useful for both ubiquitous (general) and clinical (specialist) applications. Furthermore, amongst the educated population, the origins and meanings of these terms are well known. The main contributions of this paper are:
                           
                              •
                              Structuring the design problem formally, stating the factors that might impact on the formulation and choosing an appropriate design methodology.

Stating the design method and linking it to a proposed implementation.

Implementation of a design to realise the methodology.

Conducting user trials to check the accuracy of the solution.

To do this, we formulated and analysed the design problem (Section 2); generated and applied a design methodology (Section 3); tested and analysed the implementation (Section 4) and made conclusions about the success of the overall process (Section 5).

In formulating the HMI design problem, we proposed a series of factors that could feasibly impact on physiological measurement. We then narrowed these down to create an approximate expression of the factors that could be considered and controlled during the design.

The value of a vital sign (y), as read from a sensor could be formulated as a combination of factors emanating from human (X
                        human) and machine (X
                        machine) as defined by the function Γ (Eq. (1)).

                                                machine
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

An example of a factor relating to the human would be the position of their arm, relative to a blood pressure monitor. An example of a factor relating to a machine would be the ability for an ECG monitor to determine the rate of the heartbeat from analysis of the input signal. One of the aims of designing the kiosk was to integrate multiple standard sensors, to obtain physiological measures. We therefore focused on the human factors (X
                        human) that had the potential to affect measurement accuracy, as the equipment we were using had already been assessed in terms of quality and performance (e.g. the effects from the machine, X
                        machine, were discarded).

So, given the vital sign set V = {BP, SpO2, PR, BG, ECG, Height, Weight}, the design goal was to minimize the total measurement error of each vital sign i, as a result of human factors, as described in the following optimization Eq. (2):

For Eq. (2), Γi
                        (X
                        human) is the measured value of vital sign i, as determined by the range of human factors (signal + noise). v
                        
                           i
                         is the reference value, believed to be the real value of the vital sign i when artifacts and noise are eliminated.

In order to decompose the range of human factors (X
                        human), we considered the range of possible influences that might impact on the vital signs. The kiosk was designed to measure vital signs, as derived from intrinsic factors (changes that occur within the body, such as cardiovascular diseases) as a result of the overall health of the user. We also needed to consider non-intrinsic inputs from either outside of the body (e.g. postural changes or environmental changes) as well as those from inside the body, but not relating to the general health of the user e.g. mood/emotions etc (Cacioppo et al., 2007; MacWilliam, 1933). The intrinsic inputs reflected the health status of the person using the kiosk. They determined the values of the vital signs, as denoted by reference value v
                        
                           i
                        . The non-intrinsic inputs determined the noise to the vital signs; they were the ones that we needed to control and optimize when designing and implementing the kiosk. We therefore defined the value of the vital sign y
                        
                           i

                        Table 1
                         shows a summary on the factors that could affect the vital signs, which are collected from the known physiological measurement guidelines (AAMI, 2009; Campbell and McKay, 1999; MacWilliam, 1933; Madden and Savard, 1995; Myrtek et al., 2000; Pickering et al., 2005).

Based on the summary, we developed a basic model of the range of factors that could impact on the vital sign measurements. This allowed us to decompose the optimization problem (Fig. 1
                        ). The human factors relating to exercise and food intake were difficult to control and optimize through the kiosk design and thus ignored in this model, although it is possible that they could be addressed through training and user instructions. From the perspective of the kiosk design, they were considered as background factors.

Regarding the black-box model, we needed to consider what was and wasn't likely to impact on the vital sign set (the output side). We formalized this in the following way:
                           
                              •
                              Let affecting factor set E = {
                                    B
                                 ody posture, 
                                    S
                                 ensory inputs, 
                                    P
                                 sychological activities, 
                                    T
                                 ime, Sp
                                    a
                                 ce, 
                                    E
                                 nvironment}.

For any vital sign i ∈ V, the measurement error δ
                                 
                                    i
                                 (X

                                 ) in Eq. (4) can be formulated as shown in Eq. (5), according to the black-box model (Fig. 1).

This provided the total error caused by all of the affecting factors (Fig. 1, left-hand side).

The subscript i of each affecting factor is ignored.

                           i

                        which is referred to as the affecting variable set.

In solving the optimization problem in Eq. (4), we came across several challenges. Firstly, not all of the vital sign functions were explicitly defined. Secondly, it may be that some of the factors influencing the vital signs, X
                        
                           i
                         (Fig. 1), overlapped with each other. For example, both the blood pressure and pulse rate could have been correlated with posture (X
                        
                           B
                        ). There were common variables, within the affecting factor set X
                        
                           i
                        . This made the problem in Eq. (4) difficult to solve. To address this we conducted further decomposition and simplification.

One way to do this was to consider the sequencing of the measurements; that is, the X
                        
                           i
                         for each vital sign could be distinguished by the time at which the measurement was taken. This made it possible to separate the factors, for example, the postural factor X
                        
                           B
                         in X
                        
                           i
                         was configured for blood pressure, and then configured separately for the ECG. As long as the optimal solution is achieved for each vital sign, the total measurement error will be optimal (see Annex A for the proof).

Furthermore, we could also determine which of the variables listed in Eq. (5) could be regarded as independent. For example, if we change body posture from sitting to standing, other variables (e.g. environment – temperature) are unlikely to change. At the same time, some variables were sufficiently related that they could impact on the measurement error either directly and/or indirectly. For example, disagreeable sights or sounds may affect measurements indirectly, by causing a change in mood as a result of a corresponding sensation; they may also impact directly, for example a loud noise causing a change in a measurement purely as a result of the sensation.

We needed to differentiate between dependent and independent sets (see Annex B for detailed definitions and the proof). The formal design optimization then became possible and could be solved using standard optimization techniques (see Annex C for the detailed analysis using nonlinear optimization methods).

@&#METHODS@&#

As the kiosk was designed for public use, we needed to generalize a solution (i.e. design for a population), based on our formulation (Section 2). Applying the optimization process for an entire population was not practical, but applying it for an individual and then generalizing to a population was. Validation was achieved using an inferential approach, whereby we checked that our generalized solution, met the needs of individuals, within a predefined “error tolerance” (Fig. 2
                           ):

Firstly, our population sample (the potential users of the kiosk) was divided into two groups; the training group and the testing group. For everyone in the training group, the optimized HMI design was achieved using the problem formulation (Section 2), e.g. in the “individual optimization” stage in Fig. 2.

We then took the sets of optimization parameters and balanced them for use across the population (population fitting). The process of population fitting needed to keep the individual measurement errors within a given significance. This was measured during the “testing group phase” that occurred after the population fitting had occurred. It provided an independent check of the fitting results. Each individual in the “testing group” was asked to try the design and measurement errors were recorded. We either accepted (submitted) the design solution, or repeated the overall process, (based on a 5% significance test) (Fig. 2).

The process of generalizing for the population was dependent upon the results of an individuals' optimization process (Fig. 3
                           ). This started by setting design parameters, to evaluate the functions in Eq. (C.1) (Annex C). This step required a model of the target design, including properties relating to the placement of devices.

The parameter identification process was not only used to specify the design, but also provided the basis for the optimization process. In solving this process, we got a design solution; although it was not always possible to do this explicitly (even if independent variables were established). In this case an iterative measurement process/analytical solver was used, which found the local optima in the KTT condition (as described in Annex C).

A search domain was defined, (i.e. a sub-domain of the variables), because the theoretical domain could have been infinite but the experimental measures were finite. The initial solution was assigned (for the iterative search routine), and the relationship between the variables/measurement accuracy derived by defining the turning (stationary) points. This process was robust to noise.

After the search routine was completed, the relationship between the variables and the measurement error was fitted. The formulation was solved based on the fit, e.g. through solving Eq. (C.1) (Annex C). In this way, the final design solution was achieved for the individual in question.

Although the solution should have been optimal, when the search was finished, an additional evaluation and verification process was used to check that the design was acceptable. If the solution was not reasonable, the design parameterization for the given individual was reanalysed, or the individual was excluded from the process.

We proceeded to the population-fitting stage when the (individual) solutions were accepted for the training group. In this step, the dominant characteristics of the individuals, relating to the optimal solutions were found, using correlation analysis. For example, the optimal solution of the blood pressure monitor was highly correlated with the shoulder-width and the height of the individuals, so the population-fitting curve of the optimal position could be based upon the should-width and height. We could provide a general solution, as long as such a relationship could be determined. If this wasn't the case, it meant that there was too much noise in the measurement data and we needed to review, collect more or restart the optimization process. The fitted curve for the population was then verified during the “testing group phase” that occurred after the population fitting. It provided an independent check of the fitting results (as per Section 3.1.1).

In order to minimize noise during the measurement process, we also:
                              
                                 1)
                                 
                                    Used clinical standards. e.g. (Pickering et al., 2005).


                                    Used statistical analysis e.g. use of confidence levels.

The formulae in Eqs. (B.1) and (C.1) provided the theoretical basis for the design of the kiosk. We went about a process of selecting independent sub-problems based upon the categories of factors that could potentially influence the vital signs (Fig. 1). We split these into insensitive factors (those where variation should be minimized), shielding factors (needing to be kept constant) and dominant factors (the focus of the optimization). For more information about how these sources of noise were defined and controlled see Annex D and Table 2
                           . The paper focuses on the dominant factors (postural factors), which were those that had a major effect on the measures taken by the self-service kiosk. We assumed them to be measurable and controllable.

There were 32 volunteers (12 female) recruited to participate during the design process; the training group consisted of 16 volunteers (6 female), the testing group consisted of 16 volunteers (6 female). There were two physicians who evaluated the participants, assigned the candidates to groups and then supervised the measurement process. Table 3
                               lists descriptive statistics for the training group. It should be noted that the characteristics of the training and testing groups impacts on the generalizability of the solution (e.g. the output of the optimization process), which means the properties of the final design related to the population selected. Regardless, the theory and methods in this paper can be employed for any other population.

The design optimization needed a series of measurements, for different vital signs, to be taken from both the training and testing groups. The series of measurements were organized into sessions. A session was defined as the period during which one participant carried out sequenced measurements of the same vital sign, across a given time duration. The use and organization of sessions was designed to provide for Theorem 1 (Annex A).

Measurements relating to 4 vital signs were chosen for optimization through the kiosk design, i.e. V
                              
                                 E
                               = {BP, SpO2, PR, ECG}. They were measured using clinically standard, commercially available equipment (Table 4
                              ). The four vital signs needed at least three sessions for each participant. We optimised the position for all devices, but only report results relating to the blood pressure monitor.

In order to calculate the error component of the vital sign, we needed to calculate reference values. The reference value for each vital sign was measured and recorded by a physician, according to clinical best practice (Pickering et al., 2005). Multiple readings were taken. Reference values were measured every day before the participants started their sessions; average values were then adopted and applied as described in Eq. (3).

The kiosk consisted of three medical devices, used to read vital signs (Table 4), selected for a “self-service” scenario.

We applied the design method to determine where best to place them in the kiosk “target model” or prototype. We were setting the final coordinates of the devices in the 3D Cartesian coordinate system to optimize the measurement accuracy. The user of the kiosk was defined as being seated, with upright posture. The origin (x
                              
                                 o

                              ).

The user's position was regarded as fixed (at the origin), and the device positions, i.e. the BP, oximeter and ECG, variable. The aim was to optimize the design solution within this problem space. The device positions were moved in the interval of 5 cm in each direction of X, Y and Z. The measurement error of a given vital sign on a given device was refined using Eq. (C.3) (Annex C). The following equation shows (the linear sum), similar to the independent sub-problems in Theorem 2 (Annex B):

                                     respectively.

The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2 (Annex B) and Theorem 1 (Annex A) and omitted here.

Based on the Lemma 1, the parameter identification can be carried out as follows.

According to the Theorem 1 (Annex A), the devices were arranged to be optimized separately, in sequenced sessions. This provided independence between the optimization processes conducted for each device.

For each device, the parameter identification process sought to address the optimization problem defined for the individual optimization in Section 3.1.2 (the Eq. (C.3) in Annex C). Variables were set up, with the functional form relating to the measurement error, as yet to be determined. The problem was then solved analytically using the pseudo code listed in Fig. 5
                              . The procedure takes any component of the device position (x, y, z) as the input, and records the measurement error accordingly. The interval d and the search directions are also shown in Fig. 4.

Procedure 1 was used to perform the main steps of the parameter identification (Fig. 3), and was composed of the following sub routines.
                                 
                                    1)
                                    Search domain definition

The domain of potential device positions (x, y, z) was constrained by the range within which the user could freely and comfortably take measurements.
                                 
                                    2)
                                    Initial design solution

The physicians suggested the initial design solution should be based upon a position that the user would find comfortable.
                                 
                                    3)
                                    Iterative search, optimization and definition of the final solution

The iterative search procedure consisted of three steps. The first step was to iterate a series of candidate design solutions within the domain of acceptable solutions. During this stage the measurement error was recorded. The second step was to fit the relationship (as outlined in Section 3.1.2) and set up an explicit function expression (if possible). The third step was to solve the optimal solution according to the nonlinear optimization problem for the individual (Annex C). If the functional expression could be fitted, it was; otherwise we manually selected local optima, through observation.

After the final solution was achieved (for each participant), the results were reviewed manually, with respect to how well the solution controlled/reduced noise. It was sometimes the case that measures taken on one day were inconsistent with preceding measures, in which case the data from the measurement session was discarded and another one was convened.

After the design was optimized for each individual, the solution needed to be generalized across the population. For each participant, the optimal solution for the “affecting factors” was determined through the design process, for example

                                          x

                                       ,

                                       ,

                                    )
                                 
                              
                            for blood pressure. In order to derive the fitting curve for the optimal solution across the population, we needed to know which characteristics of the individuals were implicated (e.g. height, should-width, arm-length and/or BMI). For example, analysis revealed that the optimal x-position of the blood pressure monitor was highly-correlated with the shoulder-width and the height of the individuals, so the population fitting curve over the x-position was based upon the should-width and height. If such a relationship could not be determined, it meant that there was too much noise in the measurement data and we needed to review the data, collect more or restart the measurement process.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Results and analysis are presented for the blood pressure monitor, but a similar process was used for the other devices (identified separately as per theorem 1 – Annex A).

There were three directions to optimize, i.e. x, y and z. The interval d was set to 5 cm, and 5 trials were conducted across each direction. Each participant performed one measurement session, comprising of the three directions within one day; where possible, the sessions were arranged continuously, e.g. day by day. Sessions were scheduled to minimize the variation of the vital signs caused by the time. More than one month was spent conducting the experiment, and there were 20 measurement results at each coordinate for each participant.


                           Table 5
                            provides the systolic and diastolic pressures measured for an arbitrary participant for a given position during the 20 sessions.

Overall data was compliant with the Normal distribution (Fig. 6
                           ).

The systolic and diastolic readings were compliant with the Normal distribution (p = 0.998 and 0.982) (Fig. 7
                           ).

Measurements taken from two of the participants contained outlying data for systolic (one case) and diastolic readings (one case) (Table 6
                           ). Fig. 8
                            provides a schematic of the outlying data (boxplot form), alongside Q–Q plots. The outlying data was filtered via the Grubbs' test (Ellison et al., 2009; Grubbs, 1950). There was 2.39% of outlying data across the whole measurement dataset.

After the outlying data was filtered, expectations were calculated for each of the coordinates (readings were compliant with the normal distribution). Table 7
                            gives an example, for one participant, of the mean and standard deviations for each trial coordinate. For this example, they were calculated for systolic readings (mean = 113, SD = 5.64) and diastolic readings (mean = 69, SD = 5.61). The standard deviation is a little bigger than the 5 (mmHg) recommended manufacturing error for clinical blood pressure monitors.

After expectations were calculated from the distribution of measurements taken for each position, the explicit form of the objective function f
                           
                              i
                           (X) (the error function of blood pressure) was fitted. X is composed of the Cartesian coordinate variables x, y and z. As per Eq. (C.1) and (C.2) (Annex C), the square form f
                           
                              2
                           
                           
                              B
                           (X) was employed to guarantee differentiability. An example is provided for an arbitrary participant. Systolic and diastolic fitting functions are shown in Fig. 9
                           
                            with explicit functions provided in the legend.

Following estimation of the curve functions, the KTT points and optimal solutions were solved and selected according to Eq. (C.3) (Annex C). There was inconsistency between the optimal solution (e.g. the best position) for the systolic and diastolic pressures (indicated by two triangles in Fig. 9). In these cases the measures were obtained via the same monitoring device, but the optima were different. Although we would expect the optima to be different, there was also potential for variation as a result of the positional interval being relatively coarse (5 cm). We decided that the optimal positions should be a range rather than a point. The optimal position for an individual was selected as the middle point of the range as indicated by the blue and red arrow heads.

After optimal solutions had been determined for each participant, the factors that were related to the blood pressure measurement data were determined, allowing for population fitting. The factors listed in Table 3 (age, height, weight, BMI, shoulder width and arm length) were tested for correlation over the optimal positions x, y and z.

Based upon the correlation tests, (Fig. 10) the measurement error for blood pressure readings across the x-direction was most correlated with the shoulder width (denoted as s, coefficient 0.72 with p = 0.002), then the height (denoted as h, 0.664 with p = 0.005) and then gender (denoted as g, 0.604 with p = 0.13). As one would expect, some of these factors were also correlated; for example, gender and shoulder width (0.917 with p = 0.00). A similar analysis was performed for the y and z directions (Table 8
                           ).

In the y direction, the most correlated factors (with measurement error) were the arm length and the height. In z direction, it was the gender and then the height. There were differences between the optimal positions for female (mean = 54.3 ± 1.5 cm) and males (mean = 64.6 ± 2.5 cm).

Population fitting was performed for three directions based on the affecting factors outlined in the previous section. The following equation gives the final fit functions in the three directions based on the affecting factor height (h), arm length (a), shoulder width (s) and gender (g), which was generated from a similar process like that in Fig. 9 (polynomial fitting).

There are actually two possible forms in fitting the function of the z-direction: one is the piecewise form upon the gender and the other is the continuous form based upon the height. A constant-based piecewise function was finally chosen for the z-direction function due to the minor standard deviation. The population-fitting functions provided high determination (R-square) and significance (p). After the population-fitting was conducted for the training group, the testing group was employed. The testing group consisted of 16 people (6 female). For each person, the optimal positions were calculated, according to the population-fitting function in Eq. (A.1). We then took three continuous measurements. The mean value of the readings was recorded and designated as the test reading for that person. At the same time, a physician took three continuous measurements using a clinical blood pressure monitor, to obtain the mean value of the readings for a reference blood pressure. The measurement error was calculated according to the test reading and reference reading. These results showed the average error was 3.94 ± 1.28 mmHg, which is in line with clinical standards (5 mmHg).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Although a design solution of the kiosk was achieved (based on the three devices), there was a need for compromise in creating a general solution. We know that different users had different optimal solutions (e.g. according to the population-fitting functions based upon the blood pressure monitor). It was hard to provide both a general and optimal solution when different users had different heights, shoulder widths and genders. There are two ways to resolve the issue: one is to provide a design that adapts for different users, the other is to use (published) data relating to population level anthropometry, biomechanics or ergonomics. In this study, we collected our own data from our target population. The anthropometric characteristics were as follows: height 169.31 cm, arm length 54.43 and the shoulder length 43.42 cm. Our blood pressure monitor was located at x = 33.74, y = 56.66 and z = 58.76 (cms). The prototype design and the corresponding implementation based on the anthropometric data are shown in Fig. 11
                     . Based on the population-fitting functions of the optimal device configuration, an automatic device adaption could be realized for any specific user. However, addressing the practicality of both obtaining the user parameters and automatically configuring the devices requires additional work.

This study proposes a methodology that allows for both the development and optimization of a self-service physiological kiosk. For this domain, very few design studies provide a formalization of the problem, means to optimize it, and demonstration using a general, and compelling design problem. The use of a dedicated design model and corresponding design and optimization methodology helps guarantee the accuracy of the implementation.

Accurate physiological measurements in ubiquitous scenarios are a challenging issue; we provide a demonstration of how formal mathematical proofs can be applied to support them. To extend these methods we need formulations with additional variables that take into account more factors. In future work there may be ways to decrease the testing burden by “smartly” controlling noise. For example, deciding whether to accept or reject multiple measurements based on variability in the data. Given a generalizable and sufficiently accurate solution, the self-service healthcare kiosk could offer accurate physiological measurement services that meet the medical standards and serve large populations efficiently. The system could allow users to engage with the system over a period of time, to help support long-term monitoring.

Before this can be realized, there are still a few practical issues to resolve. They form the basis for future work:
                        
                           1)
                           Population adaption. We implemented the kiosk design based on a restricted population (e.g. the training and testing groups recruited in a university campus). A more general solution would require additional testing. We need to find an appropriate balance between the wide population adaption and the cost of involving multiple user groups during the testing.

Maintenance. We need to consider the mechanisms for supporting the kiosk (e.g. training, cleaning, hardware and software support).

The Graphical User Interface (GUI). Irrespective of the device configuration presented in this paper, the GUI needs to be optimized separately. We considered some factors for controlling the measurement noise, but a well-designed GUI also plays a role in guiding the user to complete operations correctly (e.g. providing video based instruction on how to attach the sensors). The role of the GUI is important when it comes to preparing users (e.g. calming them prior to a measurement being taken). It can also be used to provide educational instructions e.g. tutoring on lifestyle options and healthy living.

Service. For the kiosk to be of maximum benefit, it needs to form part of a wider series of systems and services. For example, the kiosk could be used to collect data to support medical practice; it could provide the basis for telemedicine; it could support preventative medicine and community health initiatives; it could form the basis for wider social networks consisting of both community members and clinical professionals.

                           which results in the contradiction of the proposition that

                            is the optimal solution of the sub-problem for vital sign i (Eq. (A.1)).

So the supposition is false and the theorem holds.

The optimization problem relating to the error sum in Eq. (4) can be transformed to an equivalent series of optimization sub-problems for each vital sign (as per Eq. (A.1)).

                           (Independent set):
                        

A variable set X is an independent set ⇔ ∀X
                           
                              i

                              j
                            are independent with each other.

Although linear and nonlinear correlations can be revealed using statistical methods, for this paper, independent sets of variables (listed in Eq. (5)) are stated and assumed as follows:
                              
                                 •

                                       S
                                    , X
                                    
                                       P
                                    } are not an independent due to the strong linkage between sensory process and mental activity.

The set {X
                                    
                                       B
                                    , X
                                    
                                       T
                                    , X
                                    
                                       A
                                    , X
                                    
                                       E
                                    } is assumed independent.

Let X
                           SP = X
                           
                              S
                            ∪ X
                           
                              P
                           , so the independent set of the affecting variables can be written as a hyper-set X
                           Ind = {X

                           , X
                           
                              A
                           , X
                           
                              E
                           , X
                           SP} where the independence between X
                           SP and the rest are assumed. We can also write E

There are two properties on the independent set X

                           Proof: proof by contradiction is similar with that in Theorem 1 and omitted here.

The original optimization problem can therefore be transformed into a series of smaller optimization problems surrounding each set of affecting factors defined in the set X
                           Ind.

The objective function in Eq. (B.1) can result in issues of non-differentiability. In this case, it is possible to use the square form. There are also constraints relating to the domain of the function. So the finalized optimization problem takes these aspects into account (Eq. (C.1)):

When constrained, the function F
                     
                        i
                     (X
                     
                        i
                     ) can be a vector function and it can also cover situations of the unequal, such as “≤” and “≥”. In the case of unequal forms, the equation can be converted by introducing redundant variables, e.g. f(x) ≤ 0 can be converted to f(x) + x
                     
                        r
                      = 0, x
                     
                        r
                      ≥ 0.

Discrete models and functions of this type are often used when deriving biological models. There are many techniques that can be used to generate continuous functions based upon the use of discrete data and models, including smoothing and interpolating (Faires and Burden, 2012), fitting (Hauser, 2009), and stochastic process (Øksendal, 2003). Techniques such as piecewise derivatives and fractional derivatives (Podlubny, 1999) can also be used to convert the functions to ones which are differentiable. So we can make the assumption that all the functions in Eq. (C.1) are differentiable (or partially differentiable). We cannot judge how much approximation there would be at this point since we do not know ground truth. However, the approximation maintains generality and is provided on a theoretical basis.

For the system in Eq. (C.1), the Lagrange Multipliers method (Bertsekas, 1999) can be employed to convert the constraints into the objective function. This optimization problem can be converted to a Lagrange function as Eq. (C.2) shows:

The function may be a nonlinear function and the necessary condition of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) (Karush, 1939; Kuhn and Tucker, 1950). KTT points are often employed to give candidate optimal solutions in such cases; that is, to find out all the stationary points by letting the gradient equal to zero as Eq. (C.3) shows.

Some of the “affecting factors” contribute to biological systems but in a way that had little consequence for the measures that were taken. For example, vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse rate, even the height and weight can vary across different times (Stewart et al., 2009) or locations. However, such variations may be very slight when considered in a very short-time frame. For example, the vital signs in set V = {BP, SpO2, PR, BG, ECG, Height, Weight} can be approximated as invariant in a short time Δt, i.e.:

                        nvironment} are hence classified as insensitive factors. This implies 1) a minimal contribution to measurement error and 2) the optimization process can be replaced by specifying constants. For example, for environmental variables such as temperature and humidity, small changes will result in a negligible change to the measurement error. This assumes that the measurement process can be done before the constants are invalidated, say, the temperature changes a lot, too much time passes, the space changes dramatically, etc. The kiosk usage scenarios means that it is unlikely this type of constant will be invalidated. We approximated for several “insensitive factors” during the implementation.

In Section 2.4 it was assumed that factors relating to sensory input and psychological activity (e.g. mental state) were sufficiently related that they could be modelled as a common variable in independent set E
                        Ind. In our case, it was difficult to measure and quantify psychological activities (for example, emotions relating to happiness, sadness, anger, etc. (Ekman et al., 1972)), and difficult to elucidate a specification for the computational OCC categories (Ortony et al., 1998), which could be used to define and control these factors or variables. It was hard to establish their impact on measurement error.

We considered sensory input and psychological activities together, as shielding factors, where we wanted to reduce their impact on measurement error and maintain constancy as much as possible. We chose to do this in line with standard clinical practice, taking into account guidelines to reduce effects from the psychological activities, or keeping any effect constant. For example, a silent and clean space is required for ECG monitoring; at least 5-min rest is required before monitoring blood pressure, etc.

Another means to reduce the impact of shielding factors was via the GUI. There were two approaches that were used:
                           
                              1)
                              Making sure that the user knew what to do (e.g. using simple instructions).

Making sure that the user knew what was going on and what was about to happen (e.g. which measurement was about to be taken, giving them time to prepare).

The shielding factors affected the measurement results, but did not affect the optimization process. This was according to Theorem 2 (independent sub-problems). The reason why we needed to control the shielding factors is that the vital signs could not be divided into their ideal sub-parts (corresponding to the independent sets); they could only be read as a whole. For example, the blood pressure could be read from the monitor and the error component calculated (e.g. using the reference value), but the source of the error components could not be deduced. So the relationship between the dominant factors and the measurement errors could only be observed when other shielding factors were controlled (e.g. kept constant). Such control didn't seek to avoid the influence of the shielding factors, but instead aimed to keep them constant. The following control strategies were applied following reference to the guidelines in (Campbell and McKay, 1999; MacWilliam, 1933; Madden and Savard, 1995; Pickering et al., 2005):

As measurement of both height and weight is relatively straightforward in both ubiquitous (general) and clinical scenarios they don't form the focus of this paper. Measures of height and weight may be influenced by body posture but are easy to correct for. Measures of blood glucose (BG) were also assumed to be insensitive to any of the affecting factors described in this paper. For these measures the process and resulting accuracy was outside of our scope and so the measurements are considered as insensitive vital signs and ignored during the optimization process.

Conversely, collecting measures of blood pressure (BP), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate (PR) and ECG, was not straight-forward and could be influenced by position of the device relative to the user. Therefore postural factors that could influence the set of vital signs V

                         = {BP, SpO2, PR, ECG} in Eq. (B.1) were selected as the problems to optimize. Other aspects relating to insensitive factors and shielding factors were controlled/accounted for as described in the design plan. The final design solution was near-optimal due to the approximation required for shielding factors and insensitive factors. This situation could have been resolved through additional investigation and improvements in the methods used to measure and control factors relating to “psychological activity” or “mental state”.
