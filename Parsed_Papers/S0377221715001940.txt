                  Congestion is a widely observed economic phenomenon where outputs are reduced due to excessive amount of inputs. The previous approaches to identify congestion in nonparametric analysis only consider desirable outputs. In the production process, undesirable outputs are usually jointly produced with desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose an approach for measuring congestion in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously. The proposed approach can discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs, which are all efficient according to the scores calculated by the directional distance function. Finally, an empirical example is used to illustrate the approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The concept of congestion, first introduced by Färe and Svensson (1980), is a widely phenomenon where excessive amounts of the input cause a reduction of the output. Subsequently, it was extended and developed by Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1985), Cooper, Thompson, and Thrall (1996), and Cooper, Seiford, and Zhu (2000) in the context of DEA (data envelopment analysis). Since then, the treatment of congestion within the DEA framework has received considerable attention and several approaches have been proposed to identify congestion (Cherchye, Kuosmanen, & Post, 2001; Cooper, Gu, & Li, 2001a; Färe & Grosskopf, 2000; Kao, 2010; Khoveyni, Eslami, khodabakhshi, Jahanshahloo, & Hosseinzadeh Lotfi, 2013; Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2009; Tone & Sahoo, 2004).


                     Färe et al. (1985) proposed a radial-model approach in which congestion is measured as the difference between technologies under weak and strong disposability inputs. Cooper et al. (1996) proposed a slack-based approach, where the congestion effect is measured as the difference between the observed amounts and the expected amounts. Cooper et al. (2001a) compared the above approaches and claimed that the approach by Färe et al. (1985) can fail to identify congestion in some situations. See some debates on the subject of congestion (Cherchye et al., 2001; Cooper, Gu, & Li, 2001b; Färe & Grosskopf, 2000).

Further, Tone and Sahoo (2004) provided a theoretical linkage between congestion and returns to scale (RTS). Moreover, their approach can detect the strong and weak congestion status. However, Tone and Sahoo (2004) implicitly assume a unique optimal solution in the investigation on DEA-based congestion. In the presence of multiple solutions in the congestion measurement, the economic implications of congestion obtained by Tone and Sahoo (2004) are all problematic from both theoretical and practical perspectives. To deal with the issue, Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2009) proposed an analytical approach to handle an occurrence of multiple solutions and measure the degree of wide congestion.

However, all the previous approaches on congestion only consider desirable outputs. In the production process, undesirable outputs are usually jointly produced with desirable outputs. Therefore, a new framework for measuring congestion should be developed in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously. A pioneering paper by Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, and Pasurka (1989) considers undesirable outputs to be weakly disposable, which means that a reduction in the good outputs should result in an equiproportionate reduction of the undesirable outputs (Chung, Färe, & Grosskopf, 1997; Färe & Grosskopf, 2003, 2004, 2009; Kuosmanen, 2005; Kuosmanen & Kortelainen, 2005; Kuosmanen & Matin, 2011; Kuosmanen & Podinovski, 2009; Picazo-Tadeo, Beltrán-Esteve, & Gómez-Limón, 2012; Weber & Domazlicky, 2001; Zhou, Ang, & Poh, 2008). Treating undesirable outputs in their original forms with the assumption of weak-disposability is consistent with the physical laws and the standard axioms of production theory (Färe & Grosskopf, 2003, 2004, 2009). Based on the weak disposable technology, many empirical studies utilized the directional distance function model (Chung et al., 1997), which expands the desirable outputs and contracts inputs and undesirable outputs along the direction vector path to assess the efficiency.

In this paper, based on the directional distance function, we develop an approach to identify the occurrence of congestion (strong and weak) in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously. Different from the traditional circumstance with desirable outputs only, we find that even if a DMU is efficient by the directional distance function, it maybe evidences congestion when considering both desirable outputs and undesirable outputs. Through our proposed approach, we can discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs, which are all efficient according to the scores calculated by the directional distance function.

The remaining structure of this research is organized as follows: In Section 2, the concepts of strong and weak congestions in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs are defined. Section 3 proposes an approach to identify the occurrence of strong and weak congestions. Section 4 compares the proposed approach with the existing three representative approaches and applies the proposed approach to analyze an empirical dataset consisting of 20 power plants. Section 5 concludes the paper.

In the following, we use a simple example to illustrate the drawback of model (3). Table 1
                      shows the data set of five DMUs with two inputs (x
                     1 and x
                     2), two desirable outputs (y
                     1 and y
                     2) and two undesirable outputs (b
                     1 and b
                     2).

The inefficiency scores by model (3) are listed in the last column of Table 1. According to the inefficiency scores in the last column, all DMUs are efficient. However, from DMU2 to DMU3, a phenomenon of congestion has occurred because the desirable output decreases and both undesirable outputs increase as the input increases.

                        Remark
                        According to Brockett, Cooper, Deng, Golden, and Ruefli (2004), congestion is often referred to as a ‘‘particularly severe form of inefficiency’’ in terms of economics. A DMU evidences congestion if and only if it is not weakly efficient by DEA models when considering desirable outputs only (Wei & Yan, 2004). However, when considering both desirable and undesirable outputs, even if a DMU is efficient, it maybe evidences congestion.

In the real world, undesirable outputs such as smoke pollution or waste are unavoidably generated along with desirable outputs. Thus, in the above scenario, the outputs are divided into two categories, desirable and undesirable. For desirable outputs, the more the value is, the better the performance is while for undesirable outputs, the less the value is, the better performance is. Therefore, similar to Tone and Sahoo (2004), we first define the concepts of “strong congestion” in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs:

                           ) is “strongly congested” if it is efficient and there exists an activity

The above definition means that a DMU
                        k
                      (xk, yk, bk
                     ) is in the status of strong congestion requires that a proportionate reduction in all inputs can give rise to an increase in all desirable outputs and a decrease in all desirable outputs. From this viewpoint, Definition 1 is too restrictive in some cases. In the following, we define the concept of “weak congestion” by relaxing such stringent requirements.

                        Definition 2
                        A DMU
                              k
                            (xk, yk, bk
                           ) is “weakly congested” if it is efficient and there exists an activity that uses less resources in one or more inputs to produce more products in one or more desirable outputs and less undesirable outputs in one or more undesirable outputs.

Note that strong congestion implies weak congestion but not vice versa. In a single input, a single desirable output and an undesirable output case, there is no distinction between strong and weak congestions.

In this section, we proposed an approach to identify the occurrence of congestion. By making use of the duality theory of linear programming, the dual formulation of the direction distance model (3) is described as follows:

                     0 has weak congestion. Otherwise, it is not congested.

In the following, we demonstrate the proposed approach with the simple example in Table 1. From Table 1, we can see that all the DMUs are efficient. We applied model (15) to the data set and the results are displayed in Table 2. From α, we identified DMU3 and DMU4 as strongly congested. DMU1 and DMU2 have no congestion. For DMU5, we further solve model (16) and β* = 0.5. Hence, DMU5 is weakly congested.


                     
                        Remark
                        From the inefficiency score by the direction distance function (3), all the DMUs are efficient. However, it is obvious that DMU3 is dominated by DMU2 in inputs and outputs, which means that DMU3 is misclassified as an efficient DMU. The contribution of our paper is that our proposed approach can further discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs. This finding shows that it is cautious for the decision-maker to use the directional distance function to evaluate the efficiency in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs.

In this section, we first use a numerical example to make comparisons between our proposed approach and the existing approaches in the traditional scenario. According to the review in the introduction section, the congestion approaches for the traditional scenario only consider the desirable outputs. For comparison, we extend Färe et al.'s (1985) approach to include undesirable outputs by considering the following two models:

According to Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2009), if the optimal objective value of model (19) is negative, then the k
                     0th DMU suffers from wide congestion.

In addition, we compare our approach with the following slacks-based approach that is widely used among the DEA models with undesirable outputs (Barros, Managi, & Matousek, 2012; Fukuyama & Weber, 2010).

In this section, we use the example in Table 1 to compare our proposed approach with the above modified three approaches. Table 3
                        
                         summarizes the status of congestion measured by four different approaches.

From Table 3, we observe that the modified Sueyoshi and Sekitani's (2009) approach (19) cannot identify the congestion. The reason is that the shadow prices for the inputs and undesirable outputs are unconstrained, which indicates that the modified version of Sueyoshi and Sekitani's (2009) approach is be inappropriate for the case with undesirable outputs. The modified version of Färe et al.'s (1985) approach produces a different result regarding congestion from the other two approaches. For example, the modified Färe et al.'s (1985) approach only identifies the congestion on the fourth DMU. In contrast, the other two approaches have the same results that DMU3, DMU4 and DMU5 are under congestion, which indicates that the slacks-based approach and our proposed approach are more sensitive.

According to the inefficiency scores in the last column in Table 1, all DMUs are efficient by the direction distance function (3). Both the slacks-based approach and our proposed approach can discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs. However, the approach proposed in this study has the advantage over the slacks-based approach that has the separation capability between strong and weak congestion. The slacks-based approach always identifies the DMU as the weak congestion if the DMU is under congestion. The reason is that at least one

In this section, to illustrate the use of the proposed approach, we analyze an empirical dataset consisting of 20 power plants from Sueyoshi and Goto (2012a). The data set consists of two inputs (nameplate capacity and fuel consumption), one desirable output (net generation) and three undesirable outputs (SO2, NOx and CO2). Table 4 lists the input and output dataset for 20 power plants.

We use the model (15) to evaluate the efficiency and identify the congestion of 20 plants. The results of the inefficiency scores (δ*) are reported in the second column of Table 5
                        . As observed from Table 5, 15 plants are efficient. As presented in Table 5, congestion can be identified by α, which are shown in the third column. The results show that only five of the 15 efficient plants are truly efficient, and the other 10 plants have strong congestion. For the five inefficient plants, we make a projection according to Eq. (4), and all the projected points are identified as strongly congested.

The above case demonstrates that it calls for a careful inspection to use the directional distance function in the actual efficiency analysis in the presence of undesirable outputs. Through our proposed approach we can further discriminate the congested DMUs from the truly efficient DMUs.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Congestion is a widely observed economic phenomenon. Many previous approaches to identify congestion in nonparametric analysis only consider desirable outputs. In the actual production process, undesirable outputs are usually jointly produced with desirable outputs. Chung et al. (1997) developed the directional distance function model, which expands the desirable outputs and contracts inputs and undesirable outputs along the direction vector path.

However, different from the traditional circumstance with desirable outputs only, we find that even if a DMU is efficient by the directional distance function, it maybe evidences congestion when considering both desirable outputs and undesirable outputs. This paper makes a novel attempt to propose an approach for measuring congestion in the presence of desirable and undesirable outputs simultaneously. Through the proposed approach, we can discriminate between the congested DMUs and the truly efficient DMUs, which are all efficient according to the scores calculated by the directional distance function. Furthermore, we compare our proposed approach with the existing three representative approaches with a numerical example. The results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of identifying strong and weak congestion in the presence of desirable outputs and undesirable outputs.

For future extensions, how to develop the new model to evaluate their efficiencies for the congested DMUs will be an important research issue. In addition, the congestion and returns to scale are closely connected to each other (Sueyoshi and Sekitani, 2009). To explore the economic scale concepts for dealing with undesirable outputs, Sueyoshi and Goto (2012b, 2013) proposed the concept of damages to scale. Thus, a theoretical linkage between congestion, returns to scale and damages to scale is an interesting topic for future research. We note that all variables are assumed to be continuous and discretionary in this paper. How to dispose the non-discretionary and integer variables is another issue for future study.
