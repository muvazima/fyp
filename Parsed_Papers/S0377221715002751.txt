                  Camanho and Dyson (2005) extended Shephard's (1974) revenue-indirect cost efficiency approach to a cost-effectiveness framework, which helps to assess the ability of a firm to achieve the current revenue (expressed in the firm's own prices and quantities) at minimum cost. The degree of cost-effectiveness is quantified as the ratio of the minimum cost to the observed cost of the evaluated firm where the minimum cost is computed by simultaneously adjusting the output levels at the current revenue. In this paper, we develop two cost-effectiveness approaches based on convex data envelopment analysis and nonconvex free disposable hull technologies. The objectives of this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a convex cost-effectiveness (CCE) measure which is equivalent to the Camanho–Dyson CCE measure under the constant returns-to-scale assumption. Secondly, we introduce three nonconvex cost-effectiveness (NCCE) measures which are shown to be equivalent with respect to each returns-to-scale nonconvex technology. Finally, we apply our framework to a real data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The convex data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is a set of nonparametric linear programming techniques that have been successfully used to assess the technical efficiency of firms or decision making units (DMUs) characterized by multi-inputs and multi-outputs. DEA was introduced by Farrell (1957) and was further extended by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978). Technical efficiency evaluates the ability of a DMU to produce the current outputs at the minimal amounts of inputs. Cost efficiency measurement is another method for performance assessment that evaluates the ability of a DMU to produce the current outputs at the minimal cost given its input prices. Cost-effectiveness assesses the ability of a DMU to produce outputs at the minimum cost by simultaneously adjusting the output levels at the current revenue expressed in terms of the assessed DMU's own prices and quantities (Shephard, 1974; Färe, Grosskopf, & Lovell 1994; Camanho & Dyson, 2005; Thanassoulis, Portela, & Despic, 2008).

Examples abound for the studies that emphasize the importance of output revenues as well as input costs. Huang's (2000) finding is that output revenues exceed input spending in Taiwanese banking. Camanho and Dyson (2005) emphasized the importance of taking into account both the input and output sides of financial institutions’ activities in cost efficiency measurement. Fukuyama and Weber (2009) stated that the estimates of bank efficiency with the incorporation of output earnings should give a more accurate representation of the Japanese bank performance. Taking these studies into account, therefore, we investigate the convex cost-effectiveness (CCE) measure proposed by Camanho and Dyson (2005).

The Camanho–Dyson CCE measure has several attractive features as an output-adjusted cost efficiency assessment methodology. Camanho and Dyson (2005) argued that their measure, which simultaneously adjusts inputs and outputs given a fixed level of revenue, may better reflect the competitive nature of the market of, for example, banking business products. It is common to use the profit function when the simultaneous input–output targets are needed to be obtained given the prices of inputs and outputs. However, the observed inputs and outputs can be substantially different from the target inputs and outputs obtained from the profit maximization procedure, because profit maximization requires simultaneously cost minimization and revenue maximization, whereas cost-effectiveness only requires cost minimization at the current revenue of the evaluated DMU. In other words, cost-effectiveness can be more relevant from the perspective of firm managers because the targets based on cost-effectiveness may be reached with less effort. Furthermore, if the prices of inputs and outputs are the same across all DMUs and an unconstrained profit maximizing solution is unique, then they must operate at the same optimal inputs and outputs and hence the profit-maximizing sizes of all DMUs need be the same. In contrast, the CCE approach can overcome these limitations by restricting target output levels to reasonable ranges by using the evaluated DMU's current revenue. In addition, CCE decompositions can be developed similar to Farrell's (1957) multiplicative cost efficiency decomposition, where each efficiency component takes a value between zero and one. Importantly, the CCE decompositions have interpretations similar to Farrell's decomposition of cost-efficiency. These are desired features of the CCE approach.

The CCE approach is developed based on Shephard's revenue-indirect cost function. Kuosmanen (2003) formally established the duality theorem for, among others, the revenue-indirect cost function, which contains production information on both input requirement sets and output possibility sets. More precisely, Kuosmanen's (2003) theorem indicates that convex monotone input requirement sets and output possibility sets can be recovered from the revenue-indirect cost function, while convexity of the production possibility set is not imposed in his theorem. The standard DEA formulation requires that the production possibility set be convex, needless to say convexity of the input requirement sets and output possibility sets (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper 1984), and hence the convexity property of DEA is stronger than what the duality theorem of the revenue-indirect cost function requires. But, the convex DEA approximation of production possibilities is a reasonable one if the technology is truly convex (note that the true production possibility set is usually unknown).

Well-known in economics, however, is the existence of production systems with non-substitutable or incomplete substitutable inputs and outputs (with nonconvex production possibilities). For example, sunk costs, indivisibilities, scale economies, and externalities can violate convexity (Farrell, 1957). In fact, Barnum, John, and Gleason (2011) identified DEA applications employing inputs and/or outputs that are likely to exhibit non-substitutability or imperfect substitutability. Theoretical studies dealing with nonconvexity include Petersen (1990), Bogetoft (1996), Bogetoft, Tama, and Tind (2000) and Cherchye, Kuosmanen, and Post (2002).

DEA is inappropriate in the examination of nonconvex technologies. In this study, therefore, we consider a nonconvex free disposal hull (FDH) approach
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        The concept of FDH was introduced by Afriat (1972) for a single-output, multiple input setting. This fact, is stated for example in Keshvari and Kuosmanen (2013).
                      developed by Deprins, Simar, and Tulkens (1984) to be an important alternative to DEA. Based on FDH, we develop nonconvex cost-effectiveness (NCCE) measures that exhibit various returns-to-scale properties.

The first purpose of this paper is to develop an alternative CCE measure to the Camanho–Dyson CCE measure, which is defined relative to the convex, constant returns-to-scale DEA technology. While the Camanho–Dyson CCE measure, whose choice variables are inputs and outputs given the prices of inputs and outputs, the developed measure named the radial CCE measure minimizes the ratio of the considered DMU's target aggregate cost to the observed aggregate cost evaluated at its own prices of inputs and outputs. The radial CCE measure is less restrictive than the Camanho
–Dyson CCE measure with respect to the numbers of constraints, variables, required multiplications, and required additions.

The second objective is to extend the CCE approach to the NCCE approach with different returns-to-scale specifications: constant, nonincreasing, nondecreasing and variable returns-to-scale, and then to show that the corresponding measures are equal. The most fundamental NCCE method is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. We call it MILP NCCE measure. In this study, we develop another MILP measure, which has less constraints and choice variables than the MILP NCCE measure. Then, following Kuosmanen and Post (2001, 2003), Kuosmanen, Cherchye, and Sipiläinen (2006) and Leleu (2006), we extend the MILP NCCE method to a linear programming problem.

The final but not the least objective is to provide the economic rationale of the cost-effectiveness approaches by means of data on Japanese banking. We statistically examine the possibilities of constant returns-to-scale and convexity, and then we employ the most relevant decomposition of cost-effectiveness among reasonable decompositions.


                     Kuosmanen and Post (2001) stated that the DMUs under investigation may differ with respect to both their objectives and operating environments, and hence alternative measures and decompositions will help practitioners and researchers for meaningfully assessing the economic efficiency of different DMUs. We believe that our decompositions for and discussions on the CCE and NCCE approaches provide additional insights into Camanho and Dyson's analysis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we focus on the convex DEA constant returns-to-scale technology. Section 2.1 provides the production-theoretic basics. Section 2.2 describes some preliminaries on DEA. Section 2.3 gives the DEA-based Camanho–Dyson CCE measure. Section 2.4 provides its alternative CCE measure. While Section 2.5 discusses a computational aspect of the CCE approach, Section 2.6 introduces a DEA-based decomposition of overall (constant returns-to-scale) cost-effectiveness into three efficiency components.

In Section 3, we introduce nonconvex FDH technologies with respect to four returns-to-scale assumptions and their corresponding NCCE measures. Section 3.1 defines the conventional FDH-based technical efficiency and cost efficiency measures under the different returns-to-scale technologies. Section 3.2 gives three NCCE measures and Section 3.3 provides an enumeration algorithm for the CCE measure and compares the optimal scores for the convex and nonconvex technologies. The algorithmic results are instrumental in proving the equivalence among cost-effectiveness measures. Here we also show that the CCE and NCCE measures are equivalent under constant returns-to-scale. Section 4 provides an empirical example to show how cost effectiveness is calculated and analyzed. Section 4.1 describes the data and the input--output specification and Section 4.2 tests hypotheses related to returns-to-scale and convexity. Section 4.3 proposes an appropriate decomposition for the bank cost-effectiveness analysis. The last section concludes with a summary. All proofs of lemmas and propositions are relegated to Appendices B1 and B2, respectively.

                         is the total cost and cm(A) is the convex monotonic hull of the set A. The significance of (8) is that the production technology retrieved from IC(r/ξ, c) is characterized by convexification and monotonization of the input requirement set L(y) and the direct output possibility set P(x).

Finally, with respect to the conceptual technology T, we define four kinds of returns-to-scale: CRS (constant returns-to-scale), VRS (variable returns-to-scale), NIRS (nonincreasing returns-to-scale), and NDRS (nondecreasing returns-to-scale).

(1978) under the CRS assumption, is a fractional linear programming (LP) problem and can be solved by transforming it into an LP problem. The DEA-CRS measure is represented by the following pair of dual linear problems:

The two equivalent measures in (9) are constructed based on the DEA-CRS production possibility set defined by

                         incorporates the current revenue of the evaluated DMU in performance measurement. In order to obtain (11), we need to assume that the prices of inputs and outputs as well as input and output quantities are known exactly. LP formulation (11) has

In the next section, we develop an alternative CCE formulation and then prove that it is equivalent to formulation (11) in the sense that the measures, denoted by the respective objective functions, are equal. We introduce an alternative form of radial CCE measure, which is similar to the radial DEA (Charnes et al. 1978) measure given in (9). The first measure is:

By calculating the total cost and total revenue for all DMUs from the prices of inputs and outputs at the evaluated DMU, we obtain the cost aggregate and the revenue aggregate which are used as an aggregate input and an aggregate output, respectively. Eq. (12) can be transformed into the following model:

Formulation (13) has two constraints and J + 1 choice variables. The behavioral goals and/or assumptions of the two measures in Lemma 1 are as follows. The Camanho–Dyson CCE measure assumes that the evaluated DMU chooses target inputs and outputs. On the other hand, the radial CCE minimizes the ratio of the evaluated DMU's target aggregate cost to the observed aggregate cost evaluated at the DMU's own prices of inputs and outputs.

To establish the equivalence of the two CCE measures represented in Sections 2.2–2.6, we assumed that DMUs operate under constant returns-to-scale that is consistent with long-run zero-profit situations. Adapting the terminology of Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1985), we refer to CRS-based cost-effectiveness as overall cost-effectiveness. To deal with both convex and nonconvex approaches, we first denote the overall convex cost-effectiveness (overall CCE) as follows.

In the CRS optimal size perspective, if a DMU is operating at decreasing or increasing returns, then there is a social cost to be borne because scale inefficient inputs and outputs arise from a non-zero-profit long-run competitive equilibrium situation (Färe et al., 1985; Briec et al., 2004).

Indirect allocative efficiency refers to the ratio of the ray distance from the convex indirect input CRS-frontier to the hyperplane yielding the minimal cost of attaining the current revenue. The indirect allocative efficiency measure is obtained as the ratio of the indirect cost efficiency,

                        C, CRS defined in (10) is convex. Kuosmanen's (2003) duality theorem (8) indicates that indirect cost function contains information on the convex monotonic envelopment of the input requirement sets and the output possibility sets. Hence, the DEA-based decomposition (17) can be justified from a theoretical point of view. It should be noted that DEA-based technical efficiency and scale efficiency measures are constructed based on the DEA-based convex production possibility set, of which assumption is stronger than that of Kuosmanen's (2003) framework based on convex input requirement sets and convex output possibility sets, i.e., Kuosmanen (2003) does not impose convexity of the production possibility set in his theorems.

The original nonconvex free disposal hull (FDH) approach was formally developed by Deprins et al. (1984) under the assumption of free input–output disposability but without convexity of production. Briec et al. (2004) introduced a nonconvex cost function along with enumeration algorithms based on the FDH technology. FDH was originally developed as a mixed integer linear (MILP) program. Agrell and Tind (2001) showed that FDH can be expressed as a linear program (LP). Kuosmanen and Post (2001), Kuosmanen, Cherchye, and Sipiläinen (2006) and Leleu (2006) presented a nonconvex cost efficiency method and its extension to include the alternative returns-to-scale assumptions: CRS, VRS, NIRS (non-increasing returns-to-scale), and NDRS (nondecreasing returns-to-scale).

                         for different returns-to-scale technologies. Using Definition 1, one can obtain (20). Agrell and Tind (2001) and Leleu (2006) discussed the interpretation of (20).

The dual formulation of the method consisting of (19) and (20) is obtained by Leleu (2006) as follows:

                           
                              (21)

If we calculate the cost aggregate and the revenue aggregate for each DMU, then the dimensionality of the full input--output space is reduced to two (=1 + 1). Consequently, we have the following equivalence relationship.

In this subsection, we present an enumeration algorithm for computing nonconvex cost-effectiveness. One of the most important advantages of our algorithm is that nonconvex cost-effectiveness scores can be obtained without solving MILP problems or LP problems. Consequently, these enumeration results will be used to prove our main propositions. Adopting the VRS dominance concept presented by Tulkens (1993), we define the following.

Since we have established the equivalence relationship in Proposition 3, we denote the nonconvex cost-effectiveness as NCCE for simplicity. For the convex cost-effectiveness (CCE) approach, the nonincreasing and nondecreasing returns-to-scale properties can be accommodated with the replacement of

                         in (27). Due to the relationship between the convex and nonconvex cost-effectiveness technologies, it is clear that CCE ≤ NCCE for each returns-to-scale specification. That is, CCE and NCCE are a lower bound and an upper bound, respectively, with respect to each returns-to-scale characterization. The following proposition establishes the relationships between the CCE and the NCCE approach under constant returns-to-scale.

                           Proposition 3
                           
                              Under the CRS assumption, the CCE measure is equal to the NCCE measure, i.e., CCE-CRS = NCCE-CRS.

See Appendix B2.

Under CRS, Briec et al. (2004) showed that in the single output, multi-input case, the convex and nonconvex cost efficiency measures coincide. Since Proposition 4 establishes that the CCE and NCCE measures in the multi-output, multi-input case are the same under CRS, we simply refer to CCE and NCCE under CRS as overall cost-effectiveness. Our overall cost-effectiveness decompositions are alternatives to Camanho and Dyson's (2005) CCE decomposition. Kuosmanen and Post (2001) investigated Farrell's (1957) cost efficiency decomposition for nonconvex technologies, and Kuosmanen, Cherchye, and Sipiläinen (2006) analyzed FDH technologies with respect to alternative returns-to-scale specifications.


                        Fig. 2
                         depicts the CCE and NCCE frontiers or boundaries where observations are labeled A, B, C, and D (evaluated in terms of the prices of the DMU represented by D) for the multi-input, multi-output case. The CCE-CRS frontier is given by the ray 0e. In Fig. 2, the NCCE-CRS measures coincide but the CCE-VRS and NCCE-VRS measures diverge. The NCCE-VRS technology is represented by the union of the three shaded areas, and hence it is nonconvex. This shows how nonconvexity occurs in NCCE. In contrast, the CCE-VRS technology comprises the convex monotone hull of the NCCE-VRS technology and hence the CCE-VRS frontier is c''CBAa'.

Before concluding this section, several remarks are in order. Firstly, similar to the decompositions for the CCE approach, we can develop nonconvex versions of decompositions that correspond to (17). Secondly, an enumeration algorithm for computing the indirect input distance function can be developed on nonconvex technologies with various returns-to-scale properties. Finally, we have presented the NCCE formulas based on the algorithmic procedure for CRS, NDRS, NIRS and VRS technologies. As stated earlier, these formulas help us develop various theoretical results documented in this paper.

As an empirical application, we use the data on Japanese banks for the fiscal year 2011 ending March 2012. The data were collected from Nikkei's Financial Quest database. Following the cost function study of Kasuya (1986) we view a bank as a financial organization that converts labor (x
                        1), physical capital (x
                        2) and deposits (x
                        3) into two asset-based outputs of loans (y
                        1) and securities investments (y
                        2). For Japanese banking efficiency studies, see for example Fukuyama (1993, 1995), and Fukuyama and Weber (2005).

Labor is the number of full-time employees, and physical capital is the fixed assets in the balance sheet. Deposits from customers are the sum total of current deposits, ordinary deposits, saving deposits, deposits at notice, time deposits, installment savings, and other deposits. The price of labor, c
                        1, equals the ratio of total wages paid to employees. The price of physical capital, c
                        2, equals the ratio of physical capital expenses to the asset value of physical capital. The price of deposits, c
                        3, equals interest expense divided by deposits. The two output prices, r
                        1 and r
                        2, equal the ratio of interest income divided by the appropriate asset. This study employs 101 joint-stock banks, consisting of four city banks (Mizuho, Mizuho Corporate, Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Sumitomo-Mitsui) and 97 regional banks. Table 2
                        
                        
                         provides descriptive statistics of produced outputs, output prices, employed inputs, and input prices.

For the recent bank efficiency analysis, the input-oriented modeling associated with cost and input reductions has been frequently used because controlling costs and input quantities is a major objective of banks. Note that quite a few bank efficiency studies have employed the cost efficiency and input-oriented DEA methods. For surveys, see Berger and Humphrey (1997) and Fethi and Pasiouras (2010). The long-term stagnation of the Japanese economy, called lost two decades, reduced its potential domestic growth. Under this circumstance, Japanese joint-stock banks are more concerned about improvements on the input side (i.e., reducing costs) than increases on the output side of banking business (i.e., increasing revenues). However, bank managers cannot ignore the shareholders’ interests which will be profits and revenues. In this situation, the cost-effectiveness approach is a reasonable one for bank performance assessment. Recall that the cost-effectiveness approach adjusts the output-mix provided that the current revenue remains unchanged. Therefore, we employ this approach for the analysis of recent Japanese bank performance.

To provide the empirical analysis of Japanese banks, we need to consider two issues beforehand: (i) CRS versus VRS characterizations and (ii) convexity vs. nonconvex technologies.

Whether or not the underlying technology exhibits CRS is an important question in any study of efficiency measurement and has significant economic implications. If CRS is assumed in efficiency analysis without clear evidence, then some DMUs may be considered either too large or too small. In this case, the resulting efficiency estimates are statistically inconsistent and will be less than the true efficiency values. On the other hand, if VRS is assumed when scale returns are constant globally, there may be a loss of statistical efficiency. Consequently, it is imperative to assess the returns-to-scale properties of bank activity before efficiency analysis. See Simar and Wilson (1996) and Camanho and Dyson (2005) on this point.


                           Banker (1996) and Camanho and Dyson (2005) suggested employing a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
                              2
                           
                           
                              2
                              
                                 Simar and Wilson (2002) proposed a bootstrap procedure for testing hypotheses regarding-returns-to scale. The procedure is developed for the DEA approach, but our cost-effectiveness methodology involves the prices of inputs and outputs and is a complicated framework. Note that bootstrapping was introduced into DEA by Simar and Wilson (1998).
                            to examine whether the DEA estimates calculated under alternative assumptions on returns-to-scale have different distributions. Therefore, we carry out the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for identifying the type of returns-to-scale underlying the banks’ activities. The two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistic gives the distance between the empirical distribution functions of two samples, and the null hypothesis states that the two distributions of efficiency obtained based on the CRS and VRS formulations are identical. Precisely, we test for the following eight hypotheses with respect to returns-to-scale:
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 T1:
                                 The distributions of DEA-CRS and DEA-VRS estimates are identical,

The distributions of FDH-CRS and FDH-VRS estimates are identical,

The distributions of CCE-CRS and CCE-VRS estimates are identical,

The distributions of NCCE-CRS and NCCE-VRS estimates are identical,

The distributions of CITE-CRS and CITE-VRS estimates are identical,

The distributions of NCITE-CRS and NCITE-VRS estimates are identical,

Since we rejected the hypotheses of CRS technology, we test for the following three hypotheses about convexity under the VRS assumption:

                              
                                 T7:
                                 The distributions of DEA-VRS and FDH-VRS estimates are identical.

The distributions of CCE-VRS and NCCE-VRS estimates are identical.

The distributions of CITE-VRS and NCITE-VRS estimates are identical.

Similar to the analysis of returns-to-scale characterization described above, we use the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov for the null hypotheses of convex technology. Each test statistic in Table 4 shows that we reject the convexity hypotheses with p < 0.0001. The result of Table 4 indicates that banks except one exhibit nonconvexity under VRS. Hence, we carry out our analysis based on the FDH and NCCE estimates in what follows.

According to Proposition 4, the CCE and NCCE measures are the same under CRS. However, Table 5 shows that the NCCE estimates diverge depending on the returns-to-scale characterization.

On the ground of statistical tests shown in Table 3, the CRS hypothesis was rejected. Therefore, it is of great interest to examine the nature of scale returns with respect to the three nonconvex measures: the NCCE, NCITE and FDH measures. Notice that these measures are obtained relative to the respective frontiers. The NCCE-VRS frontier is a subset of the NCITE-VRS frontier which is a subset of the FDH-VRS frontier.

Kerstens and Vanden Eeckat (1999) reported how to identify the nature of scale returns in the FDH approach. Kerstens and Van de Woestyne (2013, 2014)

                            extends it into the nonconvex cost functions. We adapt their methods to identifying the nature of returns-to-scale for our approaches. The qualitative information on returns-to-scale is obtained as:

Somewhat surprisingly, the nature of returns-to-scale is the same for all approaches with respect to the number of banks exhibiting each type of returns-to-scale. One city bank (Mizuho) exhibited CRS and the remaining three city banks exhibited decreasing returns, whereas all regional banks exhibited increasing returns-to-scale during the sample year. Since the regional banks are much smaller than the city banks, it is not surprising that each of the former banks exhibits scale economies.

The hypotheses of CRS and convexity are rejected in Section 4.2, and hence we develop a decomposition under the VRS assumption. Such a decomposition is obtained as follows:

                        where all efficiency components in (31) are the measures based on nonconvex VRS technologies. According to Table 7, the average pure cost-effectiveness is 76.5% (pure NCCE = 0.765). The banks, on average, can decrease their total expense to 76.5% of the current levels, without decreasing the current total revenue of each bank. Eighteen out of the 101 sample banks (17.8%) are purely cost-effective. The major source of nonconvex cost-ineffectiveness is primarily pure indirect allocative inefficiency with 0.784. This indicates that cost could be reduced by 21.6% if inputs were properly allocated. In contrast, indirect output-mix efficiency and technical efficiency are of minor importance with 0.99 and 0.985, respectively.

If inputs are nonsubstitutable, they cannot replace one another in producing a fixed level of outputs and must be utilized in a fixed proportion to produce the outputs (see Barnum et al., 2011). In bank efficiency studies, however, nonsubstitutable inputs are frequently used in applications of DEA which requires substitutable inputs and outputs. For example, a bank is assumed to produce loans and investments by utilizing deposits, physical capital, and labor as inputs by following Sealey and Lindley's (1977) intermediation approach. See Fethi and Pasiouras (2010) for a review of bank efficiency studies. In spite of the existing such studies, it is difficult to believe that physical capital is substituted for deposits (or labor) for the production of the outputs because input substitutability indicates that increasing physical capital results in a reduction of deposits other things being equal (Barnum et al., 2011). This theoretical implication as well as our empirical analysis indicate that nonconvexity and returns-to-scale characterizations matter in the analysis of Japanese bank efficiency.

In this paper, we first developed a nonparametric linear programming cost-effectiveness measure based on the convex constant returns-to-scale technology by extending Camanho–Dyson's convex cost-effectiveness (CCE) measure which can deal with revenue-constrained cost efficiency (=cost-effectiveness) measurement. We showed that the new measure is equivalent to the Camanho–Dyson CCE measure under the constant returns-to-scale.

Secondly, we extended the CCE approach into a nonconvex cost-effectiveness (NCCE) approach, which can deal with various returns-to-scale properties. Whereas the original FDH and cost efficient frontiers are formulated as mixed integer linear programs, we develop the NCCE approach based on linear programming by adapting the formulations of Kuosmanen and Post (2001), Agrell and Tind (2001), Kuosmanen (2003, 2006) and Leleu (2006).

Finally, we offered the economic rationale for the cost-effectiveness framework not only by discussing the duality theorems developed by Shephard (1974), Färe and Primont (1995) and Kuosmanen (2003) but also by decomposing overall cost-effectiveness into three efficiency components. This provides additional insights into Camanho and Dyson's cost-effectiveness analysis.

One may wonder whether the possibility of CRS and convexity might be empirically tested against the alternative hypothesis using the bootstrap or asymptotic inferences based on cost-effectiveness estimators. Kneip, Park and Simar (1998) showed that the DEA-VRS estimator converges at the rate

                      under constant returns-to-scale, where J, N
 and M are the numbers of observations, inputs, and outputs, respectively. Regarding the convexity vs. nonconvexity characterizations, whereas the convex DEA estimator is statistically consistent when the production possibility set is convex, the FDH estimator is statistically consistent irrespective of convexity of the production possibility set. However, the convergence rate of the DEA estimator is slower than that of the FDH estimator. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness estimator under various types of returns-to-scale and convexity/nonconvexity needs to be examined from the viewpoint of statistic theory. So far, theoretical investigations of convergence mainly focus on production models such as DEA and FDH rather than value-based methods such as cost efficiency and cost-effectiveness methods. Hence, covering this topic is beyond the scope of the present paper.

We have two suggestions for future directions: (a) to extend the cost-effectiveness framework into network and dynamic DEA/FDH analysis, and (b) to develop CCE and NCCE approaches which can deal with a situation where input prices and output prices as well as input-output quantities are simultaneously imprecise, along the line of, for example, Cherchye et al. (2002), Kuosmanen and Post (2002) and Kuosmanen, Cherchye, and Sipiläinen (2006).
