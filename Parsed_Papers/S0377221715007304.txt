                  We say that a polygon inscribed in the circle is asymmetric if it contains no two antipodal points being the endpoints of a diameter. Given n diameters of a circle and a positive integer k < n, this paper addresses the problem of computing a maximum area asymmetric k-gon having as vertices k < n endpoints of the given diameters. The study of this type of polygons is motivated by ethnomusiciological applications.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

There exist a number of significant links between music and Operations Research (OR) (Chew and Raphael, 2010). In fact, due its versatility in the mathematical modeling of optimization problems, operations researchers have tackled problems from many fields. Music (representation, analysis, composition, expressive performance, etc.) also presents rich application areas for OR techniques

                        1
                        We refer as example the special cluster of papers featured in the journal INFORMS Journal of Computing in 2006. http://pubsonline.informs.org/toc/ijoc/18/3
                        
                     . This article is an example of the opportunities that abound for operations researchers to make significant contributions in musicology.

Imagine that we are at a concert of salsa and we want to retain the intrinsic rhythmic pattern to dance appropriately. Then we should know the clave Son. The clave Son rhythm might be represented as the 16-bit binary sequence 1001001000101000 or, as usual for cyclic rhythms, by onsets represented as points on a circle as in Fig. 1
                     (c). In this geometric setting, the clave Son is associated to a pentagon whose vertices are selected on a circular lattice of 16 points. So, the clave Son is represented by a special selection of k points on the circular lattice. This pattern has conquered our planet during the last half of the 20th century. But, what properties does this particular selection have? Notice that the polygon that represents the clave Son does not contain two antipodal points on the circle and moreover, it is easy to prove that this configuration is just the pentagon of maximum area without antipodal vertices (this later property produces a certain kind of asymmetry). Musicians have showed interest in finding similar patterns. Ethnomusicology is the discipline encompassing various approaches to the study of music that emphasize its cultural context. More specifically, Ethnomathematics is a domain consisting of the study of mathematical ideas shared by orally transmitted cultures. Such ideas are related to numeric, logic and spatial configurations (Ascher, 1998; Chemillier, 2002). Related to spacial configurations, the area is a useful measure of evenness of scales and rhythms in music theory (Arom et al., 1991; Rappaport, 2007). Moreover, many musical traditions all over the world have asymmetric rhythmic patterns. For instance, the Aka Pygmies rhythmic pattern in Fig. 1(b) has the so-called rhythmic oddity property discovered by (Arom et al., 1991). A rhythm has the rhythmic oddity property if when represented on a circle it does not contain two onsets (the black points in the Fig. (1) that lie diametrically opposite to each other. Thus, the property asserts that one cannot break the circle into two parts of equal length, whatever the chosen breaking point, as there is always one unit lacking on one side. This property produces a kind of perceptual asymmetry. The asymmetry of the pattern is to some extent intrinsic, in the sense that there exists no breaking point giving two parts of equal length. Note that the oddity property requires that the circle is divided into an even number of units. The notion of rhythmic oddity has received different mathematical treatments; see (Toussaint, 2010) for more details.

An algorithm for enumerating all the patterns satisfying the rhythmic oddity property has been proposed in (Chemillier and Truchet, 2003). Asymmetric rhythmics can also be found in the flamenco music of Spain (Fig. 1(a)) and the clave Son in Cuba (Fig. 1(c)). See (Díaz-Báñez, 2013; Díaz-Báñez et al., 2004), and (Toussaint, 2005), for a detailed study on the preference of these rhythms in their cultural contexts.

Inspired by these ideas, we introduce the following geometric problem:

                        Problem 1.1
                        Given n diameters (not necessarily equally spaced) in a circle and a positive integer k < n, select k endpoints of these diameters, no two of the same diameter, in such a way that their convex hull defines a k-gon of maximum area.

An antipodal polygon (on S) is a sub-polygon whose vertex set contains exactly one endpoint from each diameter

                      of S (Aichholzer et al., 2015). An asymmetric polygon is a sub-polygon that contains no diameter. Therefore, an antipodal polygon is also an asymmetric polygon. Aichholzer et al. proved that an antipodal polygon of maximum area can be found in Θ(n)-time (Aichholzer et al., 2015). The linear time algorithms they proposed are strongly based on a simple characterization for the extremal antipodal polygons. Namely, that an antipodal polygon of maximum area has an alternating configuration (Aichholzer et al., 2015).

The problem however, is significantly different if we ask for an asymmetric k-gon of maximum area with k < n vertices in S. It is not difficult to come up with examples for which the simple characterization stated above does not hold if k < n. Aichholzer et al.presented an

                     -time algorithm to compute an antipodal k-gon of maximum area. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem was left as an open question (Aichholzer et al., 2015).

In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. We distinguish two cases: if we are given a circular lattice with an antipodal set of 2n points (induced by n evenly spaced diameters), we show how to solve Problem 1.1 in constant time by providing a characterization of the solution. Otherwise, if the diameters are given in a general configuration, we show that the problem can be solved in O(kn
                     4)-time using dynamic programming.

The problem studied here is related to other optimization problems in operations research and mathematics. A similar problem consists of finding the unit-diameter polygon of maximal area. The first progress was made in (Reinhardt, 1922) where the optimality of the regular polygon was proved for polygons with odd number of sides. The problem of determining the largest area a plane hexagon of unit diameter can have was solved in (Graham, 1975), the octagon was solved in (Audet et al., 2002) and finally, a family of nearly optimal polygons is given in (Mossinghoff, 2006).

In computational geometry, efficient algorithms have been proposed for computing extremal polygons with respect to several different properties (Boyce et al., 1985). Moreover, the so-called stabbing or transversal problems (see for instance Arkin et al., 2011) belong to the same family that our problem. Recently, it has been proved that the following problem is NP-hard (Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015): given a set S of line segments, compute the minimum or maximum area (perimeter) polygon P such that P stabs S, that is, at least one of the two endpoints of every segment s ∈ S is contained in P. In operations research, global optimization techniques have been extensively studied to find convex polygons maximizing a given parameter (Audet et al., 2007).

Now, let us consider a different interpretation of the problem, let P be the convex hull of the given diameters. In this case, the solution to Problem 1.1 can be interpreted as the asymmetric polygon with k < n vertices that has its area closest to that of P. Therefore, this problem is related to the approximation of convex sets. In this setting, the best inner approximation of any convex set by a symmetric set is studied in (Lassak, 2002). Moreover, if we consider the “distance” to a symmetric set to be a measure of its symmetry (Grunbaum, 1963), then our solution to Problem 1.1 provides the best approximation of a convex polygon inscribed in a circle by asymmetric sub-polygons.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that although there exist applications of operations research to music theory (see for example Schell, 2002), the research in music has illuminated problems that are appealing, nontrivial, and, in some cases, connected to deep mathematical questions. The problem introduced in this paper could be an example.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the constrained version of Problem 1.1 in which the endpoints of the diameters are evenly spaced on the circle. In this case, we provide a characterization of the maximum k-gon which yields a constant time algorithm to solve Problem 1.1. The general version of this problem where the endpoints of the diameters are distributed anywhere on the circle is studied in Section 3. In this case, we show that Problem 1.1 can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming.

The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.4. The sequence proposed, say Q, is a permutation of the sequence in Theorem 2.6. Therefore, its corresponding k-gon has the second maximum area. We show that it is also asymmetric.

(Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015) showed that the following problem is proved to be NP-hard: given a set of n line segments in the plane (or in a circle), find a maximum-area convex polygon having as vertices at least one endpoint from each segment. They also show that if the segments are pairwise disjoint, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. A constrained version in which each segment joins two antipodal points on a circle was recently studied by (Aichholzer et al., 2015). They showed that this constrained problem can be solved with a simple linear time algorithm and they asked about the hardness of the problem of selecting k endpoints instead of n. As a consequence of the hardness result of (Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015), this problem becomes NP-hard if we remove the antipodality constraint.

                           Lemma 3.1
                           
                              The maximum area asymmetric k-gon (k ≥ 3) on S is formed by the union of a double-wedge (i, j, l, t) and the triangles Opjpl and Opipt.
                           

Let Q be the maximum area asymmetric k-gon on S. Let pi
                               be a vertex of Q and let 
                                 
                                    p
                                    i
                                    ′
                                 
                               be its antipodal point. Let pj
                               (resp. pl
                              ) be the first vertex of Q found when walking counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) from 
                                 
                                    p
                                    i
                                    ′
                                 
                               along the boundary of the circle. Let pt
                               be the first vertex of Q found when walking counterclockwise from pi
                               along the boundary of the circle. See Fig. 3
                              .

We prove by contradiction that pj, pl
                               and pt
                               exist and are different from pi
                              . Let SQ
                              ⊆S be the set of vertices of Q and its antipodal points and the asymmetric k-gon Q of maximum area on S is a maximum area antipodal on SQ
                              . Suppose that pj
                               does not exist or matches with pi
                              , then all vertices of Q lie in the same semicircle of the two defined by the diameter 
                                 
                                    
                                       p
                                       i
                                    
                                    
                                       p
                                       i
                                       ′
                                    
                                    ,
                                 
                               then Q would not be a maximum area antipodal polygon on SQ
                               (Aichholzer et al., 2015), this is a contradiction. The proof that pl
                               and pt
                               exist and are different from pi
                               is analogous, note that pl
                               can matche with pt
                              . The union of the wedges (i, j) and (l, t) contains no diameter because Q is an asymmetric polygon. We now prove that 
                                 
                                    p

                               and pt
                               or

                               we are done, finally if

                               we obtain a contradiction because all vertices of Q would lie in the same semicircle of the two defined by the diameter

                              . Therefore, Q is not a maximum area antipodal polygon on SQ
                               (Aichholzer et al., 2015).□

When a double-wedge uses s points of S we say it is an s-double-wedge. For 3 ≤ s ≤ k, let f(i, j, l, t, s) be the area of the s-double-wedge of maximum area with anchors (i, j, l, t). Notice that for

Note that each triangle contains either two angles greater or equal than 2π/3, or two angles smaller or equal than 2π/3; we call such pair of angles the base angles of the triangle. A critical vertex is a vertex supporting a base angle. The following lemma is key to our algorithm.

                               as critical vertex. Let M be the triangle of maximum area with vertices in S. Then

                               as critical vertex for all pi
                               in S in linear time.□

Unlike the triangle, the quadrilateral of maximum area could contain diameters. However, we prove that the asymmetric quadrilateral of maximum area satisfies a property that allows us to find it in linear time.

                              Let a, b, c, d, a′, e, f and d′ be clockwise points in a circle, where aa′ and dd′ are diameters. If d is farther than c from ae, then d is farther than c from bf.
                           

Let m be the intersection point of bd and cf, let n be the intersection point of ad and ce. Because d is farther than c from ae, Aace
                               < Aade
                              . Because triangle ane is common for the triangles ace and ade, Aanc
                               < Adne
                              . Since the triangles anc and dne are similar, ac < de. Moreover, bc < ac and de < df as they are in the same semicircle, respectively. From these inequalities, we infer that bc < df. Because the triangles bmc and dmf are similar, we know that Abmc
                               < Admf
                              . Since triangle bmf is common for the triangles bcf and bdf, Abcf
                               < Abdf
                              . Therefore, d is farther than c from bf; see Fig. 10

Extremal problems on convex polygons have attracted attention of researchers from areas as Operational Research, Combinatorial Geometry, and Computer Science, among others. In this paper, we efficiently solve a special case, originated from the study of musical rhythms. Consider a circle with points spread out on its boundary. If the points are equally spaced, they represent onsets of beats in the clock diagram notation (Rappaport, 2007). In our optimization problem, the polygon has k < n vertices being the endpoints of n diameters of the circle but no two vertices are in the same diameter. A polygon with this property is called an asymmetric k-gon and we have showed how to compute the maximum area asymmetric k-gon for two cases depending on whether the n diameters are equally spaced or not. The first case can be done in constant time by using a characterization of the optimal solution and, the general case can be solved by dynamic programming. This solves an open problem posed in (Aichholzer et al., 2015). Moreover, the cases

                      can be solved in O(n)-time by using nice properties of a solution. These properties do not hold for k > 4 and we left as open problem to improve the O(kn
                     4)-time complexity for k ≥ 5 as well as to prove if the problem is 3-SUM-hard (Gajentaan and Overmars, 1995).
