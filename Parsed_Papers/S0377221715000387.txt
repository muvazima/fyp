                  In this paper we deal with fusion functions, i.e., mappings from [0, 1]
                        n
                      into [0, 1]. As a generalization of the standard monotonicity and recently introduced weak monotonicity, we introduce and study the directional monotonicity of fusion functions. For distinguished fusion functions the sets of all directions in which they are increasing are determined. Moreover, in the paper the directional monotonicity of piecewise linear fusion functions is completely characterized. These results cover, among others, weighted arithmetic means, OWA operators, the Choquet, Sugeno and Shilkret integrals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Aggregation of data into one representative value is an indispensable tool of majority of scientific domains which deal with quantitative information. The common framework for inputs and outputs of aggregation functions is usually the unit interval [0, 1] though other intervals can also be considered (Beliakov, Pradera, and Calvo, 2007; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, and Pap, 2009). One of the mandatory properties of aggregation functions is their monotonicity (i.e., increasing monotonicity in each variable). However, there are several other fusion techniques, which are frequently applied in real data processing, and do not satisfy the monotonicity constraints of aggregation functions, e.g., implications, which are characterized by a hybrid monotonicity (Baczynski and Jayaram, 2008; Klement, Mesiar, and Pap, 2000), or the mode function (Beliakov et al., 2007; Wilkin and Beliakov, 2015) (note that in the case of more modal values, the smallest one can be considered to get a well-defined function on the entire domain [0, 1]
                        n
                     ). Although both mentioned functions are not increasing in each variable, they have some kind of monotonicity. Several other fusion functions applied, e.g., in image processing, fuzzy systems, multicriteria decision support, etc., have some types of monotonicity on distinguished subsets of their domains. We recall a few of them only, namely, restricted equivalence functions and their complements, i.e., restricted dissimilarity functions (Bustince, Barrenechea, and Pagola, 2006; Paternain et al., 2011), bientropic functions (Bustince, Barrenechea, and Pagola, 2007; Bustince, Jurio, Pradera, Mesiar, and Beliakov, 2013) and ignorance functions (Bustince et al., 2010). Fusion functions which play the role of logic operators in fuzzy set theory were discussed in Pedrycz (2009).

The monotonicity of smooth (aggregation) functions is related to the sign of their first-order partial derivatives. A function F of n variables which has the first-order partial derivatives with respect to all variables is increasing (not in the strict sense) if and only if all these derivatives are non-negative. However, in several applications, e.g., in physics or economy, directional derivatives linked to a vector 
                        
                           
                              r
                              →
                           
                           ,
                        
                      which determines the considered direction, are used. Therefore, directional derivatives (and related gradients) have deeply been studied and the results on this topic can be found in any textbook of the advanced calculus. On the other hand, directional monotonicity was studied rarely, and moreover, in rather special situations only, see, e.g., Iwasa (1998). The lack of a general theory of directional monotonicity, together with the recent attempt of Wilkin and Beliakov to introduce the monotonicity of functions in the direction given by the vector

                      see Wilkin and Beliakov (2015), inspired us to start a deeper study of directional monotonicity. The aim of this paper is to generalize the theory of aggregation functions (Beliakov et al., 2007; Grabisch et al., 2009), which are usually introduced as increasing functions defined on [0, 1]
                        n
                      that satisfy the boundary conditions A(0, …, 0) = 0 and A(1, …, 1) = 1. Note that the unit interval can be replaced by any interval [a, b]⊆[ − ∞, ∞] and the boundary conditions by conditions A(a, …, a) = a, A(b, …, b) = b. We introduce the notion of fusion function, i.e., an arbitrary function assigning to any n inputs x
                     1, …, xn
                      ∈ [a, b] an output value in the same interval. Note that for any bounded interval [a, b], the linear function φ: [a, b] → [0, 1] given by 
                        
                           φ
                           
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 x
                                 −
                                 a
                              
                              
                                 b
                                 −
                                 a
                              
                           
                        
                      can be viewed as a genuine automorphism between fusion functions G: [a, b]
                        n
                      → [a, b] and F: [0, 1]
                        n
                      → [0, 1], G(x
                     1, …, xn
                     ) = φ−1(F(φ(x
                     1), …, φ(xn
                     )). Due to this fact, in this paper we will only deal with the unit interval [0, 1], both for inputs and outputs of fusion functions.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, fusion functions on the interval [0, 1] and their directional monotonicity are introduced and exemplified. Section 3 is devoted to the study of some properties of

                     -monotone fusion functions. In Section 4 we discuss the set

                      of all directions in which a given fusion function F is directionally increasing. Finally, in Section 5 we provide some concluding remarks.

In this paper, we will investigate the monotonicity (increasingness/decreasingness) of fusion functions in various directions. We will call it simply directional monotonicity. Directions will be determined by real vectors

Consider the function F: I
                           2 → I, F(x, y) = x − (max {0, x − y})2, i.e., F(x, y) = x if x ≤ y, and F(x, y) = x − (x − y)2 if x > y. F is a continuous fusion function, but not an aggregation function (its monotonicity in the first coordinate fails). F is, e.g., (1, 1)-increasing, (0, 1)-increasing, but it is neither (1, 0)-increasing nor (1, 0)-decreasing.

For showing that F is (1, 1)-increasing, it is enough to notice that for all points (x, y) ∈ I
                           2 and all c > 0, such that (x, y) + c(1, 1) = (x + c, y + c) ∈ I
                           2, it holds that F(x + c, y + c) = F(x, y) + c > F(x, y).

To see that F is (0, 1)-increasing, notice that for all (x, y) ∈ ]0, 1[2, its partial derivative

In the next example, which comes from a real decision problem, the notion of directional monotonicity is relevant.

                        Example 5
                        Let us consider the following situation. A person is detected to be ill with diabetes. There are four possible medicaments for him, m
                           1, m
                           2, m
                           3 and m
                           4. Each of these medicaments is evaluated according to the following criteria:

                              
                                 
                                    C
                                    1:
                                 Diffusion velocity in the body.

Effective reduction of the amount of sugar in blood.

Risk of heart attack.

Increasing of arterial tension.

Risk of liver complications.

Clearly, the first two criteria can be considered to be positive, since the more some medicament satisfies them, the more desirable that medicament is. In the same way, the other three criteria can be considered to be negative, since, the more they are fulfilled by a given medicament, the less advisable that medicament is.

To decide the specific treatment for a given patient, doctors build a decision matrix in which entries are values in the interval [0, 1].

The weighting vector 
                              
                                 w

                            depends on the characteristics of each particular patient. For instance, if a patient has a medical history which includes previous heart attacks, the value of w
                           3 will be near to − 1. This translates into a mathematical language the fact that the first two criteria are positive, so a fulfillment as high as possible is intended for them, whereas the three last criteria are negative, a fulfillment as small as possible is intended in this case. Moreover, if positive criteria dominate over the negative ones, the final outcome will be between 0.5 and 1, whereas if the negative ones dominate, the final result will be between 0 and 0.5. Note that in this setting, F is a function which is monotone increasing in the directions defined by the vector

                                 ,
                              
                            see below.

In this specific example, if we aggregate the values in each of the rows using the operator F and the weighting vector

                            we get

                           In particular, F is (1, …, 1)-increasing (in fact (1, …, 1)-constant) but F is not an aggregation function.

In multicriteria decision support theory, an important role is played by utility functions. Normed utility functions coincide with aggregation functions, and their monotonicity expresses the Pareto principle. In the case when some of the criteria are positive and some of them negative (see Example 5, where the criteria C
                           1, C
                           2 are positive and the criteria C
                           3, C
                           4, C
                           5 are negative), to apply an aggregation function it is first necessary to rescale negative criteria into positive ones. This step can be avoided when fusion functions which are 
                              
                                 r
                                 →
                              
                           -increasing in the direction of any 
                              
                                 r
                                 →
                              
                            with non-negative coordinates for positive criteria and non-positive coordinates for negative criteria are considered. So, for example, the fusion function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] that is given by F(x, y) = 1 − xy is

Now, we will investigate whether a fusion function F is

                                                      I
                                                   
                                                   n
                                                
                                                .
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        

Now, the result follows from Theorem 1. Similar arguments can be used in all cases when uj
                            ≠ 0.

On the other hand, if uj
                            = 0, i.e., arj
                            + bsj
                            = 0, again considering rj
                            > 0, first suppose that xj
                            < 1. Now, we can use similar arguments as above, only considering

If xj

In the framework of aggregation functions, the standard dual function to an aggregation function A is defined by Ad
                     (x
                     1, …, xn
                     ) = 1 − A(1 − x
                     1, …, 1 − xn
                     ). Define a dual to a fusion function F in the same manner, i.e., Fd
                     (x) = 1 − F(1 − x). Then we have the following property which is a consequence of Proposition 5.

                           -increasing.

Functions F and Fd
                            are 
                              
                                 r

                           -increasing with respect to the same set of vectors.

The claim follows from Corollary 2 and the property (Fd
                           )

                      is a self-dual function, which is 
                        
                           r
                           →

                     -increasing. This is a consequence of Corollary 2 and Proposition 3. On the other hand, the anti-self-dual function which is given by

                      need not be in general a fusion function. For example, for the function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], F(x, y) = xy, we have

                              2
                           
                           
                              (
                              x
                              ,
                              y
                              )

                           −

                                 y
                              
                              2
                           
                           ,
                        
                      and the value of this function at the point (0.5, 0.5) equals − 0.25∉[0, 1].

Finally, let us introduce the notion of 
                        
                           r
                           →
                        
                     -constant functions, and have a look at some properties of such functions.

                        Definition 3
                        A function F: I
                           
                              n
                            → I which is 
                              
                                 r
                                 →
                              
                           -increasing and also 
                              
                                 (
                                 −
                                 
                                    r
                                    →
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           -increasing will be called an 
                              
                                 r
                                 →
                              
                           -constant fusion function.

For example, as mentioned earlier, the Łukasiewicz implication is (1, 1)-increasing and also ( − 1, −1)-increasing, so it is (1, 1)-constant. Similarly, the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL
                     : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], given by TL
                     (x, y) = max {0, x + y − 1}, is clearly (1, −1)-increasing, and also ( − 1, 1)-increasing, i.e., TL
                      is a (1, −1)-constant fusion function. For 
                        
                           r
                           →
                        
                     -constant functions we have the following property.

As we have seen in Example 4, there are fusion functions F with empty set of directions of increasingness,

It is enough to mention that F has a strict local minimum (maximum) at x

                              n
                            if and only if there is an ε > 0 such that F(x) > F(x0
                           ) (F(x) < F(x0
                           )) for all x ∈ ]0, 1[
                              n
                            such that the Euclidean norm 0 < ‖x − x0

From Example 3, it follows that the Lehmer mean L
                     1/2 is (1, 1)-increasing (i.e., weakly monotone in terminology used by Wilkin and Beliakov, 2015), see also Wilkin, Beliakov, and Calvo (2014). We can also prove a stronger result. The notation L
                     1/2 will be shorten to L.

                     -increasing. Note that the notion of directional monotonicity, which was given in Definition 2, can be extended to functions with any domain E with positive volume and any real range.

In several applications, linear/piecewise linear fusion functions are considered. Recall that a continuous fusion function F is piecewise linear if and only if it can be obtained by the described patchwork technique with linear functions Bj, j = 1, …, k.

For continuous piecewise linear functions we have the following characterization of directional increasing monotonicity.

The continuous piecewise linear fusion function F: I
                           2 → I, F(x, y) = min {x, y, 1 − x, 1 − y}, was applied in several works, e.g., in Klement, Mesiar, and Pap (2005). F can be viewed as a fusion function obtained by a patchwork technique related to the projections P
                           1, P
                           2 and functions 1 − P

                           -monotone. Note that this result also follows from Proposition 8. Indeed, at the point x
                           0 = (1/2, 1/2) the function F attains its strict global maximum.

Note that OWA operators (Yager, 1988) and the Choquet integrals (Choquet, 1953; Grabisch, 1995) are special piecewise linear fusion functions. The Choquet integrals and their applications are the topic of several studies, e.g. Angilella, Greco, and Matarazzo (2010); Marichal (2007). Among many applications of OWA operators we only recall (Llamazares, 2004) and the recent monograph (Yager, Kacprzyk, and Beliakov, 2011). We first recall the definitions of an OWA operator and the Choquet integral. In what follows, [n] = {1, …, n} and 2[n] denotes the set of all subsets of [n].

Let us note that the Sugeno integral (Sugeno, 1974), Shilkret integral (Shilkret, 1971), hierarchical Choquet integral (Fujimoto, Sugeno, and Murofushi, 1995; Mesiar and Vivona, 1999), twofold integral (Torra and Narukawa, 2004) are also continuous piecewise linear functions, which allows to determine the set of all directions in which they are increasing. Consider, for example, the Sugeno integral. According to Couceiro and Marichal (2010), for any capacity μ this integral is either constant or it coincides with some argument xi
                      on each domain of linearity. Therefore, it is

By Lemma 1 and Proposition 11, it is not difficult to check that for each continuous piecewise linear fusion function F: I
                     
                        n
                      → I,

                      is a special cone in Vn
                     . For n = 2 we also have the opposite claim. Before stating the result we recall the notion of a cone.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have introduced and discussed fusion functions on the unit interval I and their directional monotonicity. Note that this property is related to the directional derivative (if it exists). To keep our approach independent of the smoothness of discussed fusion functions, we have not developed this connection in more details. Moreover, we have only considered the unit interval I for input and output values. We have mentioned that a generalization to an arbitrary bounded interval is trivial. All introduced notions can easily be rewritten for any subinterval of the extended real line. However, not all of our results have the same form when open or unbounded intervals are considered. The aim of this contribution is to open the theory of fusion functions and directional monotonicity, and thus a deeper study of directional monotonicity in all mentioned cases will be the topic of our next investigations. Another issue for the next study is the local monotonicity of fusion functions when the 
                        
                           r
                           →
                        
                     -monotonicity on subdomains of the studied fusion functions is considered, e.g., in the case of ignorance functions (Bustince et al., 2010), restricted equivalence or restricted dissimilarity functions (Bustince et al., 2006; Paternain et al., 2011). Note that our results generalize the results of Wilkin and Beliakov (2015) concerning the so-called weak monotonicity which in our terminology is (1, 1)-monotonicity. We expect that our results will initiate a rapid development of the theory of fusion functions and directional monotonicity, as well as applications of these theoretical results in several domains where directional derivatives play an important role.
