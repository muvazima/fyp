                  When natural disasters happen, relief logistic centers (RLCs) and the quality of their services become absolutely important. In other words, choosing proper locations for RLCs has a direct impact on operating costs and timeliness of responses to the rising demands. This paper aims at proposing a decision support system for prioritizing RLC’s locations to facilitate providing emergency helps when natural disasters occur. The present study, focuses on considering availability, risk, technical issues, cost and coverage in locating RLCs. It is assumed that applying analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can facilitate the problem of locating these centers. The most important step in this process is establishing pair-wise comparisons for the criteria and alternatives. As it is more logical to use interval comparisons instead of crisp ones in real-world problems due to some considerations, this paper has used two decision-making methods known as lexicographic goal programming (LGP) and two-step logarithmic goal programming (TLGP) to derive priorities from pair-wise matrices. To assess the proposed method, a case study of Tehran, the capital city of Iran has also been discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The term “disaster” is defined as a breakdown in the normal functioning of a community that has a noticeable adverse impact on people, their works, and their environment, and disrupts local response capacity as a result of a natural event such as a hurricane or earthquake or as the result of human activities [18].

Disaster management is the discipline of avoiding and dealing with risks [10]. Although disasters may threaten every community, it is possible to prepare for, respond to and recover from them and alleviate the destructions to a certain degree. Disaster management involves preparing for disasters before they happen, responding to them immediately, as well as supporting, and rebuilding societies following them. The purpose of disaster management is rapid provision of relief (emergency food, water, medicine, shelter, and supplies) so as to minimize human suffering and death.

Not only is it the responsibility of the governments to take pre-disaster and post-disaster actions to reduce destructions and casualties, but also non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should participate in different phases of disaster management [26].

The efficiency of relief operations has a close relation with distribution of RLCs. Response to disaster commences with post-disaster rescue and relief operations, continues with recovery and reconstruction, and is followed by preventive actions such as determining indexes for measuring preparedness for disasters [25].

In recent years, the number of catastrophic disasters has significantly increased and the resulting sufferings, casualties, costs and social problems highlight the importance of preparedness for them. An important factor in the effectiveness of post disaster relief operations is the locations of RLCs. RLCs are used for safeguarding the emergency commodities in the preparation phase of the disaster management. These commodities are used for securing injured people after a disaster happens. As a result, such commodities must be stored in properly located RLCs to remain safe. Therefore, there is a critical need to propose a decision support system for prioritizing RLCs for providing post disaster relief and minimizing sufferings and fatalities.

As the nature of disaster and its unpredictability implies, different attributes can contribute to determining the location of RLCs and multiple criteria should be taken into consideration. Hence, locating RLCs should be treated as a multi-attribute decision-making problem. However, previous studies in the area of humanitarian logistics have just taken some aspects of the problem of locating RLCs into consideration (mostly two or three factors). Moreover, there are a few papers which have proposed more factors for this purpose. The gap between real-world requirements of disaster logistics and previous studies motivated us to explore multiple criteria associated with locating RLCs.

The limited number of researches which have considered multiple factors in locating RLCs on the one hand, and the importance of location of RLCs in decreasing post disaster sufferings and casualties on the other, led the present researchers to establish a decision support system (DSS) for ranking the potential location of RLCs.

An important issue associated with multiple criteria decision-making is human judgment and formation of a decision matrix which reflects the relative importance of criteria and alternatives regarding each criterion. In real-world problems, it seems more logical to form interval pair-wise comparison matrices instead of crisp ones. As regards the natural uncertainty and vagueness involved in human judgments, the concept of interval pair-wise comparison would probably fit the case of the present study.

Many of the real-world problems are multifaceted and have conflicting natures. Therefore, it is essential to consider the trade-offs between them. Based on this, obtaining the relative weights of our criteria is of great importance. Interval comparison matrices are used as an effective framework for estimating weights of criteria. According to the uncertainty which is inherent in human judgments and the subjective nature of the judgments, it is not reasonable to make definitive judgments and it seems more logical to form interval judgments. Considering interval comparisons in the concept of ranking and in selecting RLCs can be regarded as one of the unique features of the present paper.

A number of techniques have been proposed and have been widely used for dealing with interval priorities. In this paper, two different methods including lexicographic goal programming and two-step logarithmic goal programming, which use interval pair-wise comparison, are employed to solve this problem. Apparently, these two approaches have never been used in determining the location of RLCs before.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: a literature review is provided in Section 2. Section 3 includes definitions of LGP and TLGP. The proposed decision support system is described in Section 4 In Section 5, a real world example from Tehran, capital of Iran is considered. Conclusion and future researches are provided in Section 6.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Emergency management requires a shared vision about the emergency zone and the availability of resources to encounter emergency situations. Emergency managers need to be sufficiently supported by knowledge-based systems to be able to make critical decisions [9].

Efficiency of disaster relief operations is close related to the location of RLCs [24]. RLCs are used for storing commodities to be used in the response phase of the disaster management cycle. They are important facilities which reduce risk and vulnerability of disaster relief supply chain through facilitating safeguarding of commodities [23]. With the help of RLCs, commodities and rescuing material will remain safe and would be used to help society regain its natural state. Hence, determining the location of RLCs has an integral relation with the security and protection of the society and improving the resilience of disaster management supply chain [24]. Many researches have only considered one criterion in locating RLCs. Some (for example, Balcik and Bemon [5] and Jia et al. [13]) have considered maximizing coverage. Still others have investigated minimizing the expected distance to RLCs (e.g. Mirzapour et al. [16]). While some have only considered minimizing the rescue time(e.g. Sherali et al. [22]). A number of papers have suggested two criteria for locating RLCs. For example, Yushimito et al. [30] have explored minimizing human loss and maximizing coverage, Seifbarghy et al. have investigated minimizing transportation cost and maximizing demand coverage. Hu and Zhao [11] have studied minimizing the total cost of rescue centers and maximizing the effect of resource. Zhan and Liu [31] minimized the expected travel time and the proportion of unmet demands. A number of papers have considered three criteria in locating RLCs. (For example, Abounacer et al. [3] considered minimizing the number of medical agents, total uncovered demand and the sum of all trips.)

Even though the above-mentioned studies have tried to satisfy disaster management necessities, the nature of this problem implies more criteria to be considered for locating RLCs. Furthermore, all these papers have optimized locations of RLCs through multiple objective decision-making (MODM) models. MODM methods deal with quantitative criteria while MADM approaches consider both quantitative and qualitative ones. However, disaster logistics has such a complicated nature that necessitates taking both qualitative and quantitative criteria into consideration.

Some papers have considered multiple attributes (more than three) for location problems in emergency logistics and have used MADM approaches for ranking and selecting RLCs. Degener et al. [8] have considered cost, time, distance, environmental aspects and climate in prioritizing alternatives for stocking relief supplies. Awasthi et al. [4] have mentioned accessibility, security, cost, quality of service and so forth in locating urban distribution centers. Roh et al. [19] proposed location, logistics, national stability, cost and cooperation for locating logistic warehouses. They determined the relative importance of each of these criteria by AHP. Zhang et al. [33] categorized criteria into three main categories: response/support function, position, and resources. These main criteria were then divided into many corresponding sub criteria, and fuzzy group decision-making technique was used to evaluate the emergency management system. Omidvar et al. [17] have considered accessibility, water supply, size, security and protection, climate condition, soil condition and economic condition for selecting shelter areas. They investigated ranking of shelter areas by applying different methods including AHP, ELECTERE, SAW and TOPSIS. Moreover, they indicated that a DSS for the area of humanitarian logistics must consider multiple rather than a limited number of criteria. Turgut et al. [27] considered cost, transportation, infrastructure, geographic location and suitability of climate. They highlighted the difference between business logistics and disaster logistics as a considerable vagueness and uncertainty is involved in disaster logistics. Hence, they proposed application of fuzzy AHP for dealing with uncertainty. Zhang et al. [32] investigated safety and reliability, transportation condition, the situation of area and natural environment. They used fuzzy AHP and information entropy for deciding on the location of RLCs. The most prevalent method used in decision making papers is fuzzy hierarchical decision making. This method is used in a variety of subjects. For instance, Lu et al. [15] used this concept for evaluating new product development. The most significant weakness of these researches is that they have not considered the inherent uncertainty of human judgments and have used crisp comparisons. Although some of these papers have used fuzzy approaches, the application of interval approaches is more reasonable, for in interval approach there is no need to identify a membership function as in fuzzy approach. Identification of a membership function is a complex task especially for experts who are not familiar with fuzzy theory. Since most of the experts who take part in determining criteria and alternatives are non familiar with fuzzy theory and determining a fuzzy membership function, the usage of fuzzy theory does not seem proper in this context. Thus, using interval comparisons instead of fuzzy comparisons seems more logical. Moreover, these MADM techniques that have been used in previous papers lack OR-based models, while the approaches proposed in this paper are OR-based and use mathematical programming for deriving priorities. OR-based approaches use mathematical modeling to formulate the problem and employ established techniques to solve these models and find the optimal values of the variables.

This paper aims at proposing a decision support system that considers factors like availability, risk, technical issues, and cost and coverage.

In classic methods, the value of each cell of pair-wise comparison matrix in AHP is considered to be crisp, but in real-world problems it is rare to have crisp priorities. Instead, it is more frequent to have pair-wise comparison matrices with interval priorities. There are two approaches for facing interval comparison matrices. The first approach is to calculate alternative weighs as crisp numbers and the second one is to consider them as intervals.

Saaty and Vargas [20] proposed interval pair-wise comparison in AHP for modeling uncertainty and used Mont Carlo simulation for deriving interval weights from pair-wise comparison matrix. Arbel [1] considered pair-wise interval comparisons as linear constraints and formulated a linear programming for eliciting priorities. Kress [14] demonstrated that Arbel’s method was improper for inconsistent pair-wise comparison matrices since in such a situation no feasible solution space would exist for the linear programming model. Salo and Hämäläinen [21] generalized Arbel’s approach to AHP and determined minimum and maximum levels for each interval and used the maximum and minimum limits in final prioritization.

All these approaches are based on mathematical calculations. Some of them have problems related to inconsistency, but their biggest problem is the complicated calculations inherent in them.

Arbel and Vargas [2] formulated the hierarchy process as a non-linear model and considered all priorities in hierarchy as decision variables. They also made a connection between Arbel’s approach and Mont Carlo simulation. Islam et al. [12] has also used LGP for deriving weights from inconsistent pair-wise matrices.

Methods which are used in this paper are applicable for interval pair-wise comparison matrices, for which AHP is not applicable. Moreover, they can be used when the pair-wise comparison matrix is inconsistent. More importantly, mathematical calculations are less complicated in these approaches. Both LGP and TLGP are OR-based models and use mathematical programming for deriving priorities.

In this paper, selection of RLCs for interval pair-wise comparisons is conducted by using LGP and TLGP method.

The proposed approach for determining the location of RLCs consists of three phases discussed below:


                     Phase I: Identification of criteria and potential locations
                  

In this step, a panel containing experts from related organizations (e.g. disaster management organizations and municipal members) convene to determine the appropriate criteria for decision system which are then categorized in two groups: quantitative criteria and qualitative ones. When the process of identifying the criteria is completed, another panel composed of construction professionals convene to identify potential locations for establishing service centers.


                     Phase II: Establishing pair-wise comparison matrices
                  

Pair-wise interval comparison matrices are derived from expert views. They show the importance of alternatives regarding each criterion as well as the importance of the criteria in achieving the goal.


                     Phase III: Prioritization of alternative locations by applying LGP and TLGP
                  

Interval pair-wise comparison matrices are derived at the end of step 2. In this step, two different approaches can be applied: LGP or TLPG. If LGP is chosen, derivative variables will be minimized and crisp weights can be derived. But, if TLGP is chosen, derivative variables will be minimized and then feasible interval for each weight can be found and upper and lower limits for the final weights would be determined. At last, alternative locations can be ranked in each of these two approaches.

The proposed decision system is shown in Fig. 2
                     .

This section includes the application of the proposed approaches in prioritizing potential locations for RLCs in the metropolitan city of Tehran, the capital of Iran. This section includes the definition of the case study, the application of proposed approaches and finally analysis of the results.

Tehran is one of the densely populated metropolitan cities around the world. Recent investigations have revealed that, this city is in an earthquake zone and nearly 8 million residents of this city live in hazardous areas. Predictions show that 80% of casualties take place in the early days following the earthquake. Based on this, when an earthquake happens, large amounts of relief supplies are needed to help the survivors.

According to municipal and political policies, some emergency response centers must be established in each country. These centers which are referred to as RLCs, are facilities used for storing relief aids such as medicines, first aid kits, blankets, tents, dry foods and water.

These centers will be launched and mostly remain inactive until an earthquake takes place. As it is unreasonable to build many RLCs in a metropolitan city, we are faced with the problem of selecting the potential locations for RLCs in every city. In this study, 22 potential locations for RLCs were taken into consideration and ranked using the proposed methods.


                        Phase I: identification of criteria and potential locations
                     

In this study, the expert panel consisted of 10 experts: 2 senior managers, 4 civil engineers and 4 urban planners. In doing so, we aimed at taking advantage of broad views of different groups of experts on the problem of locating RLCs. Since determining the location of RLCs is an inter-disciplinary task, experts from different fields should take part in the decision-making process. These 10 experts were in charge of determining the location of RLCs in the municipality. Based on this, a collective decision-making approach was used to assure that the criteria were determined thoroughly and that all potential locations for RLCs were taken into account. Moreover, as the opinions of these experts are aggregated into one interval-valued comparison for each pair-wise comparison, the number of these experts does not affect the computational complexity of the aforementioned methods. Finally, five criteria were identified based on expert views and literature review (presented in the literature review section) following which 22 regions were considered as potential locations for RLCs. Different criteria were identified for locating RLCs, but to avoid complexity and loss of effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, these criteria were clustered into five main criteria with each criterion divided into some sub-criteria. These criteria are presented in Table 1
                        . The identified criteria are availability, risk, technical issues, and cost and coverage. The hierarchy structure contains three levels. The overall goal at the topmost level is “locating disaster logistic centers”. The five criteria are in the middle level and 22 potential locations as alternatives are in the lowest level. The hierarchical structure for this study is depicted in Fig. 3
                        .


                        Phase II: deriving pair wise comparison matrices
                     

Interval pair-wise comparisons were performed according to the 3-level hierarchy structure obtained in the previous step. The criteria were compared to each other with respect to the overall goal and the alternatives were compared to each other regarding each criterion. The interval comparisons for criteria are shown in Table 2
                        . Interval comparisons of alternatives according to the availability criterion are shown in Table 3
                        .


                        Phase III: Prioritization of alternative locations by applying LGP and TLGP
                     

This step includes a choice of solution method. This prioritization problem can be solved either using LGP or TLGP. LGP uses interval comparison matrix to find crisp priorities, whereas TLGP results in interval priorities from the same interval comparison matrix. Both methods were used to solve this problem and the results were compared.

This method uses the pair-wise interval comparison matrices described in the previous section to derive weights of criteria and alternatives using linear programming formulation (6). Results were obtained using GAMS23.6 and presented in Table 4
                           . According to LGP method, alternative 22 with the score 0.182 was ranked first among 22 alternatives and others were ranked according to their total scores.

The method uses a simple linear programming formulation with only three blocks of constraints. For example, when the model was run for comparing criteria, it resulted in only 25 constraints and was solved in 0.0017s in an Intel® core™ i5,2.67 GHz CPU personal computer with 4GB RAM. Since the criteria or alternatives compared in MCDM techniques are not numerous and the model is linear, LGP does not have any computational complexity.

For deriving interval weights the consistency of interval comparison matrices should firstly be considered. According to the model (9), all comparison matrices for criteria and alternatives are inconsistent. Hence, interval weights and combinatorial weights for criteria and alternatives were derived using the model (11) and demonstrated in Table 5
                           . Priorities of alternatives are given in Table 6
                           .

When TLGP was used to derive the weights of criteria, there were 25 constraints in the model (10), 35 constraints in model (11) and 6 constraints in model (13). The solution time for each problem was respectively 0.00251s, 0.00267s and 0.00386s on the aforementioned PC. Since the number of criteria and alternatives compared using this method is always limited (according to the nature of MCDM techniques), and models (10) and (11) are linear formulations, TLGP does not seem to lead to computational complexities.

There are some doubts about the interval-valued decision techniques. Cao [7] suggests that many of the interval-valued decision techniques can be reduced to crisp ones by considering midpoint or end point of the interval. To demonstrate the significance of LGP and TLGP methods, and to show that they take real advantage of interval-valued comparison, the weights of criteria were calculated using LGP, TLGP, midpoint of the interval pair-wise comparisons (the mean of the upper and lower bound of the interval) and end point of the interval pair-wise comparisons. Expert choice 11 was used to derive the weights of criteria for midpoints and end points. The results of these comparisons are shown in Table 7
                           . It’s noteworthy to add that the weights obtained from LGP, TLGP, midpoints and endpoints differ greatly. LGP and TLGP take the real advantage of interval comparisons and cannot be reduced to midpoints or end points of the interval-valued comparisons.

Although the LGP method has many advantages in dealing with interval pair-wise comparisons, such as using linear programming model and dealing with inconsistent judgments, it has been indicated that, this method is defective in theory. As interval comparison matrix is reciprocal in nature, the information from the upper triangular comparison matrix provides exactly the same information about the preferences as the information in the lower triangular comparison matrix does. For instance, if criterion one is between two and three times more important than criterion two, it means that criterion 2 is between 0.33 and 0.5 times more important than criterion one.

                         have the same meanings and provide the same information about preferences. The pair-wise comparison matrix is mostly an upper triangular matrix, but the comparisons can also be stated in the form of a lower triangular matrix or a complete matrix which is a mixture of upper and lower triangular matrices.
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              LGP results in different weights and priorities when upper triangular matrix, lower triangular matrix or a combination of both is used.
                           

According to the reciprocal nature of interval comparisons, the same priorities and weights for criteria and alternatives using upper triangular comparison matrix, lower triangular comparison matrix or a mixture of both is expected. Despite this fact, it has been proved that LGP method does not yield such a result. Wang [28] demonstrated that using upper triangular interval comparison matrix, lower triangular one and the mixture of both can lead to totally distinctive weights and priorities. He provided mathematical proof for this behavior of LGP and demonstrated this phenomenon through three different numerical examples. However, he did not mention which of the three resulting rankings is more reliable and should be considered. Çakır [6] proposed a post-optimality analysis to determine the most reliable priority vector derived from LGP. The proposed method was based on violations in the orders of preferences among the resulting priorities. This method can determine which of the resulting rankings and weights are more reliable by employing the fact that the most reliable ranking is the one in which the resulting weights have the least deviations from interval comparisons gained from experts.

In this section, the numerical example is used to show how LGP method leads to different weight estimates using upper triangular judgments, lower triangular ones or a mixture of both. Weights gained using each of these three matrices and related rankings are demonstrated in Table 8
                        .

As it is clear from Table 8, scores and rankings gained from using upper triangular comparison matrix, lower triangular one and the mixture of both, differ widely. Using upper triangular judgments, alternative 1 is ranked 13 with the weight 0.029, while using lower triangular matrix the same alternative is ranked 22 with the weight 0.015 and using upper and lower comparisons together it is ranked 19 with the weight 0.024. These differences in resulting rankings and weights indicate great weaknesses of LGP method.
                           Proposition 1
                           
                              TLGP results in the same weights and priorities no matter whether the upper comparison matrix, the lower comparison matrix or a combination of both is used.
                           

Previous researches have not indicated to such a contradiction in the results gained by TLGP method. To investigate whether the results obtained by TLGP have the same problem or not, the analysis is also performed by TLGP. TLGP is used for deriving interval scores for alternatives using upper triangular judgments, lower triangular ones or the mixture of both. Resulting scores for TLGP in these three cases are shown in Table 9
                        .
                           Proposition 2
                           
                              The weights and priorities gained using TLGP are more reliable than those obtained by LGP.
                           

As it is clear from the results presented in Tables 8 and 9, results gained using TLGP differ slightly considering upper triangular matrix, lower triangular matrix, and mixture of both. However, results obtained by LGP method differ widely according to the usage of each of these three matrices and lead to different priorities. Based on this, it can be concluded that, TLGP can lead to more reliable and robust results.

In this paper, the problem of ranking and selecting Relief Logistics Centers has been considered. As the nature of disaster relief necessitates, multiple criteria should be considered in ranking RLCs. This paper considered availability, risk, technical issues, and cost and coverage from among the available criteria. Twenty-two alternative locations were determined by the researchers, which were compared according to expert views. As there is inevitable uncertainty in human judgments, it is more reasonable to form interval pair wise comparisons rather than crisp ones. Based on this, to compare alternatives and derive weights and priorities, two approaches known as Lexicographic Goal Programming (LGP) and Two-Step Logarithmic Goal Programming (TLGP) were used. These two methods are used to determine weights and priorities through interval comparisons, however; they have never been used in the context of determining the locations of RLCs.

The main advantage of the proposed methods is that they are OR-based mathematical approaches and are suitable for interval pair-wise comparisons, especially when the comparisons are inconsistent. Moreover, LGP uses a linear programming formulation which is easy to solve.

Despite these advantages, LGP is defective in theory. Although upper triangular comparisons and lower triangular comparisons in an interval pair-wise comparison matrix provide the same information about preferences of criteria and alternatives, using each of these matrices in LGP may result in different weights and ranks. Moreover, there is a need for a post-optimality analysis to determine which of these rankings and weights are more reliable.

More importantly, it is indicated that TLGP results in more reliable rankings and using either upper or lower triangular pair-wise comparison matrices result in similar priorities and rankings. Therefore, TLGP is more appropriate for ranking RLCs.

A real world example of Tehran, capital of Iran, was provided to demonstrate the application of proposed decision support system 22 alternatives were ranked using either LGP or TLGP. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the performance of two proposed methods. It was shown that TLGP has more robust results and seems to work more properly.

Future research on the present topic can include investigating other methods of dealing with interval comparisons such as interval SAW and interval TOPSIS. The results from application of these methods can be compared with that of this paper and the best DSS for ranking RLCs can be chosen.

Moreover, analysis can be performed to determine which of the three different rankings gained by LGP using upper triangular matrix, lower triangular one or a mixture of both, are reliable and which rankings should be considered inefficient.
