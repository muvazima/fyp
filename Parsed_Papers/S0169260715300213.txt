                  In this paper, the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic blood flows through porous arteries concerning the influence of externally imposed periodic body acceleration and a periodic pressure gradient are numerically simulated. Blood is taken into account as the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid. Besides the numerical solution, for small Womersley parameter (such as blood flow through arterioles and capillaries), the analytical perturbation method is used to solve the nonlinear governing equations. Consequently, analytical expressions for the velocity profile, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate are obtained. Excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical predictions is evident. Also, the effects of body acceleration, magnetic field, third-grade non-Newtonian parameter, pressure gradient, and porosity on the flow behaviors are examined. Some important conclusions are that, when the Womersley parameter is low, viscous forces tend to dominate the flow, velocity profiles are parabolic in shape, and the center-line velocity oscillates in phase with the driving pressure gradient. In addition, by increasing the pressure gradient, the mean value of the velocity profile increases and the amplitude of the velocity remains constant. Also, when non-Newtonian effect increases, the amplitude of the velocity profile.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Blood is known as one of the most important heterogeneous multi-phase mixtures in nature that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. Generally, blood is composed of plasma (contains water, glucose, dissipated proteins, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide), blood cells (red blood cells ‘RBCs’ and white blood cells ‘WBCs’), platelets, etc. In spite of the fact that plasma behaves as a Newtonian fluid, it is commonly accepted that the hematocrit (the volume percentage of RBCs in blood, which is normally 45% for men and 40% for women) exhibits shear-thinning behavior and therefore, must be modeled as a non-Newtonian fluid [1].

Some numerical studies in blood flow simulation, such as Ogulu and Bestman [2], Ogulu and Amos [3], and Ellahi et al. [4] have considered blood as a Newtonian fluid. For example, Ellahi et al. [4] performed a theoretical study for Newtonian blood flow of nanofluid through composite stenosed arteries with permeable walls. They simplified the highly nonlinear momentum equations of nanofluid model by considering the mild stenosis case. The hypothesis of Newtonian blood is valid for large blood vessels (arteries and veins), but when the diameter of the blood vessel is the same order of magnitude as the red blood cells and corpuscles (such as arterioles and capillaries), it is widely accepted that the non-Newtonian nature of blood has to be taken into account. Using non-Newtonian model for blood can be seen in the works of Majhi and Nair [5], Haldar and Andersson [6], Prakash and Ogulu [7], Moyers-Gonzalez et al. [8], Massoudi and Phuoc [9], Cherry and Eatona [10], Alimohamadi and Imani [11], Moawed et al. [12], Ellahi et al. [13–15], Akbar et al. [16], Caballero and Lain [17], and to name but a few. For example, Ellahi et al. [13] presented mathematical models for blood flow of Jeffrey fluid (a non-Newtonian fluid having shear thinning property) via nanoparticles in the tapered stenosed atherosclerotic arteries. In their studies, the effect of catheter and the influence of heat and mass transfer of nanoparticles on blood flow behaviors were revealed. Ellahi et al. [14] investigated the unsteady and incompressible arterial blood flow of non-Newtonian fluid (micropolar fluid) through composite stenosis. They developed analytical solutions of velocity and volumetric flow flux in terms of modified Bessel functions. Ellahi et al. [15] examined the heat and mass transfer on blood flow of non-Newtonian fluid (micropolar fluid) through a tapered stenosed artery of permeable walls. They evaluated the exact solutions for velocity, temperature and concentration profiles. And Akbar et al. [16] performed a theoretical study on the unsteady blood flow of a Williamson fluid (which represents the behavior of pseudo-plastic materials, particularly of polymer solutions and powder suspensions in Newtonian fluids) through composite stenosed arteries with permeable walls. They simplified the highly non-linear momentum equations of the Williamson fluid model by considering the mild stenosis case.

Also, the physical properties of the non-Newtonian blood have been presented in many published papers such as Fowkes et al. [18], Baieth [19], Ghasemi et al. [20] and so forth. One of the approved non-Newtonian models, in simulating the blood flow is the third-grade non-Newtonian model. There are a lot of numerical studies on blood flow simulation in which, the researchers utilized the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid in the blood modeling such as Majhi and Usha [21], Majhi and Nair [5], Hayat et al. [22,23], Zeeshan and Ellahi [24], Hatami et al. [25], Ghasemi et al. [20], and to name but a few. For example, Hayat et al. [22] carried out an analysis for MHD flow and heat transfer characteristics in a third grade fluid between two porous plates (with the application of blood flow in the coronary arteries). Zeeshan and Ellahi [24] studied the fully developed flow of an incompressible, thermodynamically compatible third-grade non-Newtonian MHD fluid in a pipe with porous space and partial slip (by considering the application of blood flow in the arteries). And Ghasemi et al. [20] simulated the steady-flow of a third-grade non-Newtonian blood in porous arteries in presence of magnetic field using analytical and numerical methods.

Blood flow in the human cardiovascular system is caused by the pumping action of the heart. The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which produces a pulsatile pressure gradient throughout the system (popularly known as a pressure pulse which physicians check at the wrist). Pressure and flow rate are characteristic in pulsatile shapes that vary in different parts of the arterial system [26,27]. Thus, several researchers have studied the pulsatile flow of blood in blood vessels. Clark [28] presented the experimental results of the pulsatile flow in a laboratory model of aortic stenosis taking the Reynolds number appropriate to aortic flow. Chaturani and Palanisamy [29] proposed a mathematical model to study the pulsatile flow of blood (by treating blood as a Power-law fluid) through rigid circular tubes under the influence of periodic body acceleration. Majhi and Nair [5] studied the pulsatile flow of blood subjected to externally imposed periodic body acceleration by assuming blood as a third grade fluid. They investigated numerically the effects of the body acceleration on the velocity, the flow rate and the wall shear stress for femoral and coronary arteries. Sarkar and Jayaraman [30] studied the flow pattern of pulsatile Newtonian blood flow in a catheterized stenosed artery through a mathematical model. Their study took into account the effect of the movement of the flexible catheter influenced by the pulsatile nature of the flow. Elshehawey et al. [31] examined pulsatile flow of blood (Newtonian model) through a porous medium under the influence of body acceleration. Craciunescu and Clegg [32] investigated the influence of the blood pulsation rate on the temperature distribution and energy transport for four typical blood vessel sizes: aorta, large arteries, terminal arterial branches, and arterioles. In their numerical works, blood was considered as a Newtonian fluid. Long et al. [33] performed numerical simulations of 3-D pulsatile Newtonian blood flow in straight tube stenosis to investigate the post-stenotic flow phenomena by means of commercial CFD package CFX4 (AEA Technology). El-Shahed [34] studied pulsatile flow of Newtonian blood through a stenosed porous medium under the influence of body acceleration. He obtained analytical expressions for axial velocity, fluid acceleration, flow rate and shear stress. Khanafer et al. [35] conducted a numerical study to determine the influence of pulsatile laminar flow and heating protocol on temperature distribution in a blood vessel and tumor tissue receiving hyperthermia treatment. They modeled the arterial wall as macroscopically homogeneous porous media and the blood as an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Ogulu and Amos [3] modeled pulsatile Newtonian blood flow within a homogeneous porous cardiovascular system in the presence of a magnetic field and time-dependent suction. Their studies showed an increase in the wall shear stress when the porosity of the medium was increased. Nagarani and Sarojamma [36] developed a mathematical model of pulsatile blood flow (using the non-Newtonian Casson fluid) through small blood vessels. They used perturbation method to solve the governing equations by assuming that the Womersley frequency parameter is small. Massoudi and Phuoc [9] examined the unsteady pulsatile flow of blood in an artery, where the effects of body acceleration were included. They modeled the blood as a modified second-grade fluid where the viscosity and the normal stress coefficients depend on the shear rate. Siddiqui et al. [37] mathematically investigated the effects of non-Newtonian nature of blood and pulsatility on flow through narrow arteries by considering two types of non-Newtonian fluid models, i.e. Herschel–Bulkley fluid model and Casson fluid model. They reported that the mean and steady flow rates decrease as the yield stress increases. Shit and Roy [38] interrogated the effect of externally imposed magnetic field and body acceleration on pulsatile flow of blood (micro-polar fluid model) through an artery with no-slip velocity condition. Sharma et al. [39] studied numerically pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic arterial blood flow in the presence of double stenosis. They used the Newtonian incompressible fluid for blood modeling. Recently, Sharma et al. [40] attempted the study of pulsatile blood flow through axisymmetric stenosed artery subject to an axial translation with hematocrit concentration-dependent blood viscosity. In their study blood was considered as a viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid, flowing in a rigid walled circular artery.

The motivation of this paper is to study the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic flow of third-grade non-Newtonian blood through porous arteries influenced by externally imposed periodic body acceleration. The pulsatile flow is examined by taking into account a periodic pressure gradient. The third-grade non-Newtonian fluid is one of the constitutive model that can describe shear-thinning (or shear-thickening) and normal stress differences, which are characteristic of non-Newtonian/viscoelastic fluids. Beside the numerical approach, for small Womersley parameter (i.e. blood flow through small blood vessel size such as arterioles and capillaries), the analytical perturbation method is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing equations. Consequently, analytical expressions for the velocity profile, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate are obtained. The results of perturbation method are compared to those obtained by the numerical method. In addition, the effects of the governing parameters such as body acceleration, magnetic field, the third-grade non-Newtonian parameter, the pressure gradient, and porosity, on the velocity profile, the blood flow rate and the wall shear stress are examined. Application of such study includes magnetic drug delivery in blood, transport of complex bio-waste fluids and magnetic field control of gastro-intestinal disorders, magnetic endoscopy, control of blood flow rate during surgeries, etc.

The unsteady pulsatile laminar flow of incompressible non-Newtonian blood fluid through a porous artery in the presence of a magnetic field is considered. A schematic figure of the problem, including the mechanical physics in the cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, x) is shown in Fig. 1
                     . In this problem, blood flows in the x-direction through a fully porous vessel (or artery) of radius R with an axial velocity of u(r, t). It means that, the flow is assumed to be stable and axisymmetric with no radial and swirl components of velocity. It is supposed that, there is no-slip condition (u
                     =0) on the outer wall (r
                     =
                     R). Blood flow is caused by the pressure gradient (∂p/∂x) produced by the pumping action of the heart. It can further be assumed that

In many cases for example sudden movement of the body during exercises and traveling in fast speed airplanes or vehicles, the body (and blood flow) may experience external acceleration as well as the gravitational field. These cases certainly affect the normal blood flow which lead to physiological problems such as headache, decreased vision, abnormality in pulse rate, and so on. Therefore, due to the physiological importance of body acceleration, the body acceleration is assumed to be given by a harmonic formula as follows:

It should be noted that, the Womersley number (α
                     2) is a dimensionless parameter in bio-fluid mechanics. It is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile flow frequency in relation to viscous effects. Since the vessel diameters in the body differ up to three orders of magnitude, the Womersley number will depend predominantly on diameter [43]. The Womersley number of human blood flow can be estimated as according to Table 1

Analytical techniques for simulation of non-Newtonian fluids flow have been recently reported in many published researches. For example, Tripathi and Beg [45] studied the hydromagnetic peristaltic flow of non-Newtonian couple stress fluids through the gap between two concentric channels containing a Darcian porous medium, with the inner channel being rigid by using a semi-analytical method. Khan and Smarda [46] used the homotopy perturbation method with general form of linear operator to solve dimensionless nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the Hiemenz flow of a non-Newtonian fluid. Hatami and Ganji [47] presented the analytical solution of heat transfer for a non-Newtonian nanofluid flow (sodium alginate fluid with titanium dioxide) in the porous medium between two coaxial cylinders. Later, they also investigated analytically the natural convection of a non-Newtonian nanofluid flow (sodium alginate fluid with copper and sodium nanoparticles) between two vertical flat plates [48]. Eldabe et al. [49] studied the peristaltic motion of non-Newtonian fluid with heat and mass transfer through a porous medium in the channel under the effect of magnetic field via a perturbation series’ method. Abdulhameed et al. [50] employed an analytical perturbation transform method for solving the transient flow of third grade fluid in a porous channel generated by an oscillating upper wall. Ghasemi et al. [20] utilized three semi-analytical methods namely collocation method, optimal Homotopy asymptotic method, and fourth order Runge–Kutta method, to solve the differential equations of blood flow containing nanoparticles through porous arteries in presence of magnetic field. In this clause, the analytical perturbation method is used to solve a special case of the nonlinear governing equation (7), i.e. small Womersley parameter and neglecting the porosity and magnetic field parameters (M

In order to check the validity of the present study, the results obtained by the numerical and perturbation methods are compared together for the governing parameters selected based on Refs. [29,51]. The governing parameters are presented in Table 2
                     . The non-dimensional velocity (u) in arterioles and capillaries is plotted in Fig. 2

                     1. Here, t
                     1 is the time when the maximum velocity is attained on the center-line of the blood vessel during one time cycle. Fig. 2a and b are for arterioles and Fig. 2c and d are for capillaries. The results show an excellent agreement between the numerical and perturbation solution methods, especially for small values of Λr

                     ) and the blood flow rate (q) in arterioles are illustrated in Fig. 3
                      for 2βR
                     2/μ

                     1. The results depict a good agreement between the numerical and analytical (perturbation) solution. Therefore, it is concluded that the results obtained by the numerical calculation which are presented in the later sections are accurate.

Here, the second way to ensure the validity of the present numerical calculation is introduced. By considering Λ→0, the blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid (see Eq. (7)). For this condition and by setting the other blood vessel's parameters as, f
                     
                        g
                     
                     =

                        p
                     
                     =1.2Hz, φ
                     =0°, A
                     
                        g
                     
                     =−9.8m/s2, and γ
                     =0.2; the calculated amplitude of

                              w
                           
                        
                      and q for different values of R (and consequently α
                     2) are compared to those obtained by Chaturani and Palanisamy [51] in Table 3
                     . Good agreement between the present study and the results of Chaturani and Palanisamy [51] is evident. Therefore, it is deduced that the results of the numerical calculation which are illustrated in Section 6 are accurate. It should be noted that the reported wall shear stress and the blood flow rate in Ref. [51] are in dimensional form while they are presented in Table 3 in dimensionless form.

As mentioned before, the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic flows of blood (as the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid) through porous arteries concerning the influence of externally imposed periodic body acceleration and a periodic pressure gradient are numerically simulated.

The first analysis in this section is related to the effects of Womersley number (α
                     2) on the flow characteristics (u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q). The Womersley number is defined as the ratio of transient inertial forces to viscous forces. When Womersley number is large (around 10 or greater), it shows that the flow is dominated by oscillatory inertial forces and that the velocity profile is flat. When the Womersley parameter is low, viscous forces tend to dominate the flow, velocity profiles are parabolic in shape, and the center-line velocity oscillates in phase with the driving pressure gradient. These facts can be seen in Fig. 4a for α
                     2
                     =0.005, 1.0, and 13.2. In addition, Fig. 4b and c depict that by increasing the Womersley number, the wall shear stress (or velocity gradient on the solid wall) and the blood flow rate oscillates with lower amplitudes and the quasi steady-state conditions are achieved later. These are due to more flatness of the velocity profile and weakness of the viscous forces as discussed.


                     Fig. 5 projects the effect of body acceleration parameter (B
                     2 or A
                     
                        g
                     ) on the flow specification (u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q) when the other governing parameters are fixed. Here, B
                     2 is chosen as 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0. The figure shows that for small values of B
                     2 or (A
                     
                        g
                     ), the velocity profile, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate fluctuate with small amplitudes and for large values of B
                     2, they oscillate with large amplitudes. However, as shown in the figure, the amplitude of body acceleration (A
                     
                        g
                     ) has zero effect on the mean values of the wall shear stress and blood flow rate (at steady-state condition). This deduction is in agreement with finding of Sud and Sekhon [52] who reported the same study for a Newtonian blood flow in arteries. It is observed from Fig. 5a that for small value of acceleration parameter, the velocity profiles are nearly parabolic and positive but for large values of B
                     2 the velocity profiles fluctuate between their positive and negative values. Also, for any value of B
                     2 or (A
                     
                        g
                     ), the values of u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q oscillate with the same frequency and in phase with the driving pressure gradient.

The third examination belongs to the effect of the pressure gradient (B
                     1 or A
                     0) on the flow parameters (u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q). The results are presented in Fig. 6. Here, B
                     1 is considered as 1.0, 2.5, and 4.0. As expected, Fig. 6a (the non-dimensional velocity profiles in one complete time cycle at the quasi steady-state condition) illustrates that by increasing the pressure gradient (which acts as a driving force), the mean value of the velocity profile increases and the amplitude of the velocity remains constant. Hence, as seen in Fig. 6b and c, by increasing the pressure gradient, the mean value of the wall shear stress and the total flow rate increase albeit their amplitudes remain constant.

The next analysis belongs to the effect of the third-grade non-Newtonian parameter (Λ) on the blood flow characteristics (u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q). In order to remain in the admissible range, Λ is taken smaller than 2 for blood fluid (i.e. Λ=0.1, 1.0, and 2.0). As predicted, it is clear from Fig. 7a, when non-Newtonian effect increases (as Λ increases), the amplitude of the velocity profile decreases (the velocity profile tends to be flat). This pattern and behavior can be seen in many references such as, Refs. [20] and [25] for flows in hollow vessels and Ref. [53] for flows in pipe. Therefore, by increasing Λ (and consequently flattening the velocity profile), the amplitude of the wall shear stress and the blood flow rate decrease as shown in Fig. 7b and c, respectively.


                     Fig. 8 is depicted for showing the effect of the porosity parameter (P) and the magnetic field (M
                     2) on the flow parameters (u, 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              w
                           
                        
                     , and q) as the fifth analysis. Here, M
                     2
                     +P is taken as 0, 2.5, and 5.0. As observed in Fig. 8a, by increasing M
                     2
                     +P, the amplitude of the velocity profile decreases. This is because for a specified pressure gradient, when the porosity increases, fluid cannot easily move through the porous media and consequently the velocity profile decreases. Hence, by increasing M
                     2
                     +P (and consequently decreasing the amplitude of the velocity profile), the amplitude of the wall shear stress and the blood flow rate decrease as displayed in Fig. 8b and c, respectively. It thus turns out that under the action of a magnetic field, volume of blood flow can be controlled. This issue can be useful during surgeries.


                     Fig. 9 displays the effect of the frequency ratio (ω) on the dimensionless center-line velocity (u(0, t)), wall shear stress, and blood flow rate. For this purpose, the frequency ratio is set as 0.5 and 2.0. The figure shows that, changing the frequency ratio has no influence on the mean values of the center-line velocity, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate (at steady-state condition). This is clear, because the frequency ratio does not change the driving or resistance forces. However, it is interesting to observe that the smaller the frequency of excitation (or the frequency ratio), the greater are the peak flow rate, center-line velocity, and wall shear stress, even though the level of the body acceleration (φ) is kept constant. This conclusion is in agreement with finding of Sud and Sekhon [52] who reported significant information of a Newtonian blood flow in arteries.

The last simulation belongs to the effect of the lead angle of the body acceleration (φ) on the dimensionless center-line velocity, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate. The results are obtained for φ
                     =0.0, π/4, and π/2 and they are plotted in Fig. 10. The results demonstrate that, the mean values of the center-line velocity, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate (at steady-state condition) are not change when the lead angle of the body acceleration changes. But, the amplitude of the center-line velocity, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate reduce when φ increases. This trend is in agreement with finding of Chaturani and Palanisamy [51] who simulated the pulsatile flow of blood (Newtonian model) with periodic body acceleration in blood vessels.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic blood flows through porous blood vessels considering the effect of externally imposed periodic body acceleration are numerically examined. Blood is modeled as the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid. The pulsatile flow is analyzed by considering a periodic pressure gradient. Besides the numerical solution, for small Womersley number (such as blood flow through arterioles and capillaries), the perturbation method is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing equations and consequently, an analytical expression for the velocity profile is obtained. The results of perturbation method are compared to those obtained by the numerical method. The results show an excellent agreement between the numerical and perturbation solution methods, especially for small values of Λr

In addition, the effects of different values of the governing parameters such as body acceleration, magnetic field, the third-grade non-Newtonian parameter, the pressure gradient, and porosity, on the velocity profile, the flow rate and the wall shear stress are examined.
