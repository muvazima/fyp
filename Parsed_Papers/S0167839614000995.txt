                  A swept surface is generated from a profile curve and a sweep curve by employing the latter to define a continuous family of transformations of the former. By using polynomial or rational curves, and specifying the homogeneous coordinates of the swept surface as bilinear forms in the profile and sweep curve homogeneous coordinates, the outcome is guaranteed to be a rational surface compatible with the prevailing data types of CAD systems. However, this approach does not accommodate many geometrically intuitive sweep operations based on differential or integral properties of the sweep curve — such as the parametric speed, tangent, normal, curvature, arc length, and offset curves — since they do not ordinarily have a rational dependence on the curve parameter. The use of Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) sweep curves surmounts this limitation, and thus makes possible a much richer spectrum of rational swept surface types. A number of representative examples are used to illustrate the diversity of these novel swept surface forms — including the oriented-translation sweep, offset-translation sweep, generalized conical sweep, and oriented-involute sweep. In many cases of practical interest, these forms also have rational offset surfaces. Considerations related to the automated CNC machining of these surfaces, using only their high-level procedural definitions, are also briefly discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Sweep operations provide an intuitive approach to constructing surfaces from two parametric curves, a profile curve 
                     
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      and sweep curve 
                     
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     . The points of the sweep curve determine a family of transformations acting on the profile curve, such that the continuum of its transformed instances generates a swept surface 
                     
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                     . In addition to the profile and sweep curves, a swept surface construction requires a precise specification of the nature of the geometrical transformation associated with each point of the sweep curve.

Two familiar cases are the surface of extrusion and surface of revolution. In the former case, the sweep curve is a line segment, whose points specify a family of translations of the profile curve. In the latter case, the sweep curve is a circular arc, whose points specify a family of rotations of the profile curve about an axis orthogonal to the plane of the circle. Ruled surfaces, quadrics, and cyclides are further elementary surfaces that can be defined by intuitive sweep operations. These are just the simplest examples of the diverse surface types that can be constructed using generalized sweep operations.

Although many current commercial CAD systems incorporate some swept surface capability, it is often of limited scope or incurs approximation of the precise surface geometry. The universal reliance of CAD systems on rational parametric surface representations limits the swept surface types that can be exactly generated, and necessitates the use of data-intensive approximations for those that cannot. The intent of the present study is to illustrate how the family of exact rational swept surface constructions can be greatly expanded by employing Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves (Farouki, 2008) as sweep curves. The PH curves possess rational differential and integral properties — parametric speed, arc length, tangent and normal, curvature, and offset curves — that facilitate the construction of a rich variety of rational swept surfaces in which the geometrical transformations of the profile curve are explicitly dependent on these properties of the sweep curve, not just its point coordinates.

Perhaps the earliest systematic approach to swept surface constructions was proposed in the late 1970s by Hinds and Kuan in two little-known papers (Hinds and Kuan, 1978, 1979) (see also Section 13.8 of Farouki, 2008). In their methodology, an elegant matrix algebra is employed to directly construct the swept surface 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      from the profile and sweep curves 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      and 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     . Assuming that they are both rational cubic curves, they can be represented by 
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                      matrices in which one index is associated with a homogeneous coordinate component, and the other with the cubic basis functions. Similarly, 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      can be represented as a rational bicubic surface through a 
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                      matrix, in which one index is associated with a homogeneous coordinate component, and the others with cubic basis functions in u and v. The 
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                      matrix that defines 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      is generated by contracting the 
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                      matrices defining 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      and 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                      with a 
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                        ×
                        4
                      
                     selector matrix, that serves to specify the nature of the geometrical transformations of the profile curve 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      associated with each point of the sweep curve 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     .

The essence of this approach lies in judicious choice of the selector matrix elements, so as to implement the desired sweep operation. The coordinates of the sweep curve points may be used to define translations, scalings, rotations, and perspectivities of the profile curve — but only in certain combinations, determined by linear dependence of the homogeneous coordinates of 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      on those of 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      and 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     . For example, if the profile and sweep curves are planar, it is not possible to define a translational sweep of 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      along 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     , such that 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      always lies in the normal plane of 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     , since the orientation of this plane does not ordinarily have a rational dependence on v. However, if 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                      is a PH curve, it has a rational unit normal vector, so a rational surface 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      defined by the above sweep operation becomes possible.

The approach proposed herein may be considered a generalization of the rational swept surface constructions introduced by Hinds and Kuan (1978, 1979) to accommodate geometrical transformations dependent on certain differential and integral properties of a Pythagorean-hodograph sweep curve 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     . This opens up a much richer class of swept surface constructions amenable to exact representation within the prevailing geometry data types of CAD systems. As in Hinds and Kuan (1978, 1979) a key motivation is the ability to fabricate such surfaces on CNC machines, using only a high-level procedural definition of the surface. In this context, the ability to efficiently compute certain surface properties, such as the unit surface normal vector, is essential. However, the focus of this paper is on the construction of swept surfaces and computation of their geometrical properties. Since the CNC machining application incurs additional technical considerations, it will be deferred to a subsequent study.

The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews some preparatory material on the homogeneous-coordinate representation of rational curves and surfaces, the construction and properties of planar PH curves, and some basic principles for the construction and machining of swept surfaces. Section 3 describes the scaled-rotation sweep, a representative case of the “traditional” swept surface types defined by bilinear forms in the profile and sweep curve homogeneous coordinates, and some intrinsic limitations of these forms are identified. The generalization to sweep operations dependent on differential or integral properties of a (PH) sweep curve yields a remarkable variety of new possibilities. The goal of this paper is to introduce these novel surface types through illustrative examples of practical interest, rather than to attempt an exhaustive categorization. Consequently, Sections 4–7 present basic definitions, constructions, and examples for several important cases — the oriented-translation sweep, offset-translation sweep, oriented-involute sweep, and generalized conical sweep. For simplicity, these cases all employ planar sweep curves, but Section 8 briefly describes a type of swept surface that addresses the additional orientational freedom associated with a spatial sweep curve: the rotation-minimizing sweep. Finally, Section 9 summarizes and assesses the key contributions of this study, and identifies some promising directions for further extending and applying them.

The term swept surface (or swept volume) is often used to refer to the region defined as the union of the instances of a rigid body that executes a general spatial motion — such surfaces are of great importance in modeling material removal in CNC machining, collision avoidance in robotics, and related fields (Blackmore and Leu, 1992; Chiou and Lee, 2002; Chung et al., 1998; Crossman and Yoon, 2001; Li et al., 2012; Martin and Stephenson, 1990; Wang et al., 2000; Wang and Wang, 1986). A closely related concept is the generalized cylinder (or cone) that has seen widespread application as a basic shape primitive in computer vision and biomedical applications (Behrens et al., 2003; Delibasis et al., 2013; Gansca et al., 2002; Nevatia and Binford, 1977; Raghupathi et al., 2004; Semwal and Hallauer, 1994; Ulupinar and Nevatia, 1995).

In the present context, we are interested in the process of using two curves to intuitively design a smooth surface, by imposing a continuous family of transformations on an “initial” (profile) curve, parameterized by the points of the other (sweep) curve. The emphasis is on achieving greater flexibility in the types of the allowed transformations, subject to the requirement that the outcome must be a rational surface. Before we introduce this generalized family of rational swept surfaces, we must review some basic facts concerning the homogeneous coordinate representation of rational curves and surfaces, the advantages of employing PH curves in sweep transformations, and key principles governing the construction and machining of such surfaces.

A point in three-dimensional projective space is specified by its homogeneous coordinates 
                        
                           (
                           W

                           Y
                           ,
                           Z
                           )
                        . If 
                           W
                           =
                           0
                        , these homogeneous coordinates identify a point at infinity. If 
                           W
                           ≠
                           0
                        , they identify a finite point, with the Cartesian coordinates 
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           ,
                           z
                           )
                           =
                           (
                           X
                           /
                           W

                           W
                           )
                        . Note that only the ratios of the homogeneous coordinates matter — i.e., 
                           (
                           W

                           ξ

                           W
                           (

                        . Unlike polynomial curves, the set of rational curves of given degree is closed under general projective transformations. Rational forms are essential for an exact specification of basic curves, such as conic sections (the parabola is the only conic that can be exactly specified as a polynomial curve).

                         is a PH curve. This approach facilitates the development of many algorithms for constructing and analyzing planar PH curves. PH quintics, for example, can be constructed as interpolants to first-order Hermite data (Farouki and Neff, 1995); as

For simplicity, we typically assume that the profile and sweep curves are both planar. This is not an essential assumption, but it makes the sweep operation easier for the designer to formulate and interpret. To obtain a rational swept surface through transformations of the profile curve 
                           p
                           (
                           u
                           )
                         that depend upon certain differential or integral properties of the sweep curve 
                           s
                           (
                           v
                           )
                        , the latter must be a PH curve but the former may be any polynomial or rational curve.

                         opens up a vast array of rational swept surface types, we do not attempt a systematic categorization of them at present. Instead, the versatility of this approach is illustrated by several representative examples that are of the primary interest in practical design problems.

The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a methodology for designing and machining a wide variety of rational swept surfaces. The intent is to drive a computer numerical control (CNC) machine from the high-level procedural swept surface definition, rather than voluminous part programs comprising short linear/circular G code segments. We defer details on the machining to a future study, and consider here only some basic geometrical considerations arising in the context of the swept surface constructions.

Spherical (ball-end) tools are typically preferred for machining free-form surfaces, since they can cut any surface whose least concave principal radius of curvature is not less than the tool radius. The machine drives the center of the tool along a path displaced by the surface normal (11) at each point along the contact curve with the surface 
                           R
                           (
                           u
                           ,
                           v
                           )
                        , i.e., the tool center executes a path on the offset surface (12). The surface normal (11) is explicitly evaluated for each of the rational swept surface forms described below.

For simplicity, we initially choose the isoparametric curves 
                           u
                           =
                           constant
                         or 
                           v
                           =
                           constant
                         on the surface (10) as toolpaths. However, to ensure a given speed (or feedrate) of the tool contact point with the surface, it is necessary to compensate for the non-uniform nature of the parameterization. This is the function of the real-time interpolator algorithm (Farouki and Tsai, 2001; Shpitalni et al., 1994; Yeh and Hsu, 1999). The simplest (first-order) real-time interpolators, which are quite accurate for moderate feedrates and high sampling frequencies, need only the parametric speed (i.e., the rate of change of arc length with the curve parameter) along the toolpath. Hence, for each of the swept surfaces described below, the parametric speed along both sets of isoparametric curves will be evaluated.

To begin, we consider an example of the family of swept surfaces introduced by Hinds and Kuan (1978, 1979). For these surfaces 
                        R
                        (
                        u
                        ,
                        v
                        )
                      is a bilinear expression in the coordinate components of the profile curve 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      and sweep curve 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     , but does not depend on their differential or integral properties.

                        u

                        =

                        p
                        (

                      about the z-axis. However, for any other sweep curve, it is not possible to “decouple” the rotation and scaling aspects of this category of sweep operations. It is also not possible to construct a sweep operation that involves orienting the profile curve using differential properties of the sweep curve, such as the tangent or normal vector. To achieve this, it is necessary to formulate sweeps in terms of not only the point coordinates of the sweep curve, but also their derivatives, and to do so in a manner that ensures the resulting swept surface has a rational parameterization.

The swept surfaces introduced in Hinds and Kuan (1978, 1979) may be generalized by considering forms that are bilinear in the coordinates of the profile and sweep curves and certain differential/integral properties.

The generation of this swept surface through a continuous translation of the profile curve along the curve, coordinated with a continuous rotation so as to keep it within the sweep curve normal plane, is a geometrically intuitive design procedure with diverse practical applications. The ability to represent the outcome exactly as a rational swept surface eliminates the inaccuracy and data volume explosion incurred by prevailing approximation methods.

The offset (8) to a given plane curve is the locus defined by displacing each curve point by distance d in the local normal direction. Offsetting is a shape transformation that has important applications in specifying tool paths and tolerance zones about a nominal profile. We propose here a sweep operation that combines simultaneous offsetting of a planar PH curve with translation orthogonal to its plane, based on a user-specified relation between the offset distance and translational displacement. This provides an intuitive approach to smoothly “rounding” the sharp corners of a solid model.

                            This is identical to the PH quintic used in Section 4 as the sweep curve, but in the present context it is regarded as a profile curve. Fig. 3
                            illustrates the rational offset-translation surface (20) defined by this profile curve and the offset distance function

                           . As noted above, in this case the offset surfaces (12) at each distance r are also rational. The surface shape can be altered by choosing alternative offset distance functions

                        Although the offset-translation sweep (20) seems conceptually distinct from the oriented-translation sweep (17), it can actually be regarded as a special case of the latter. To see this, consider the modified formulation

A distinctive feature of a PH curve is that the cumulative arc length can be exactly computed by simply evaluating a polynomial. This is a consequence of the fact that the parametric speed is a polynomial, and hence its integral (6) is also a polynomial. The cumulative arc length of a curve is important in constructing the involutes of that curve, i.e., loci whose centers of curvature lie on the given curve. Involutes play a key role in defining gear tooth profiles that ensure conjugate action (i.e., an exactly constant angular velocity ratio) of meshing gears. Using a PH curve for the sweep curve

                      facilitates the construction of rational swept surfaces based on its involute.

                      in the first term, while the second term remains unchanged. Since

                        v
                        )
                      is the normal to the involute 
                        c
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     , these two terms amount to a re-orientation of the profile curve so it lies in the normal plane to 
                        c
                        (
                        v
                        )
                      for each v. The first term in (25) defines a displacement of the profile curve by 
                        c
                        (
                        v
                        )
                      for each v. Hence, the surface (25) may be considered as arising from a continuous translation of the profile curve along the involute to the sweep curve, while re-orienting it so it always lies in the normal plane to the involute. This is called an oriented-involute swept surface. To ensure that

To facilitate ease of interpretation, the swept surface constructions described above were restricted to planar profile and sweep curves. As previously noted, this restriction is not essential, but the generalization to space curves requires greater care in specifying the sweep process, and entails difficulties that are absent in the planar case. For example, to specify a spatial PH sweep curve, the quaternion representation (Choi et al., 2002; Farouki et al., 2002) must be invoked in place of the complex form for planar PH curves discussed in Section 2.

A thorough treatment of swept surfaces based on spatial PH sweep curves is beyond the scope of the present paper. Instead, the noteworthy case of a rational rotation-minimizing motion of a planar profile curve along a spatial sweep curve is used to briefly illustrate some of the issues encountered in this context. In Section 4, the oriented-translation swept surface was defined by translating a planar profile curve 
                        p
                        (
                        u
                        )
                      along a planar sweep curve 
                        s
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     , while orienting it so as to always lie in the sweep curve normal plane, spanned by 
                        n
                        (
                        v
                        )
                      and k. During this motion, the profile curve exhibits no instantaneous rotation within the normal plane, i.e., about the sweep curve tangent 
                        t
                        (
                        v
                        )
                     .

If a spatial sweep curve 
                        s
                        (
                        v

The polynomial curves that have this property are a subset of the spatial PH curves, called rational rotation-minimizing frame (RRMF) curves. The simplest non-trivial instances are the RRMF quintics, and are identified by a simple algebraic constraint on the coefficients of the quadratic quaternion polynomials that generate them (Farouki, 2010). The RRMF quintics have been used in the design of rational rotation-minimizing spatial motions, interpolating prescribed initial/final locations and orientations of a rigid body (Farouki et al., 2012).


                     Fig. 8
                      shows how the normal-plane orientation of a profile curve that is swept along a space curve can strongly influence the resulting surface shape. In this case, the profile curve is an ellipse and the sweep curve is an RRMF quintic. If the Frenet frame is used to specify the normal-plane orientation of the sweep curve, the result has an undesirable “twisted” shape and is not a rational surface. However, using the rational rotation-minimizing frame of the RRMF quintic yields a rational swept surface with a very natural shape (the variation of the profile curve orientation is the least possible, consistent with the constraint that it must always lie in the sweep curve normal plane).

The use of Pythagorean-hodograph sweep curves opens up a rich spectrum of rational swept surface constructions, arising from families of transformations of a profile curve that depend explicitly on differential and integral properties of the sweep curve. A number of representative examples have been presented herein, to illustrate the diversity of surface geometries that can be intuitively generated in a manner exactly compatible with the prevailing representation schemes of modern CAD systems. Preliminary considerations regarding the automated CNC machining of such surfaces, based only on their high-level procedural definitions, have also been presented (the technical aspects of this topic will be more fully addressed in a forthcoming study). The versatility of these generalized rational swept surfaces makes their complete categorization a non-trivial task, that is worthy of further investigation.
