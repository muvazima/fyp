                  The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to support group multicriteria classification. The approach is composed of three phases. The first phase exploits the knowledge provided by each decision maker to individually approximate the decision classes using rough approximation. The second phase seeks to combine the outputs of individual approximation phase into a collective decision table by using an appropriate aggregation procedure. The third phase uses the collective decision table in order to infer a set of collective decision rules, which synthesize the judgements and perspectives of the different decision makers and to permit the classification of all decision objects. The proposed approach relies on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), which is used at two different levels. First, the DRSA is used during the first phase to approximate the input data relative to each decision maker. Second, the DRSA is used during the third phase to approximate the collective decision table and generate the collective decision rules. This paper presents the theoretical foundation of the proposed approach, three case studies using real-world data and a comparative study of recent similar proposals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The multicriteria classification is a fundamental problem of multicriteria decision-making (Ishizaka & Nemery, 2013a). The multicriteria classification can be stated as follows: given a set of objects described by a set of criteria (attributes with preference-ordered domains), assign these objects to some pre-defined decision classes or categories, such that each object is assigned to exactly one class. In comparison to other classification methods and techniques (for instance in statistical, data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning), the multicriteria classification has two main characteristics (Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2011; Waegeman, De Baets, & Boullart, 2009): (i) the decision classes are defined in an ordinal way; and (ii) the decision objects are evaluated over a set of criteria meaning that the decision model should have some form of monotonic relationship with respect to the criteria. Due to the first point, the multicriteria classification is often referred to ordinal classification or sorting in the literature. In the rest of the paper, the three terms will be used interchangeably.

A large number of real-world case studies of multicriteria classification problems in different domains are reported in the literature (e.g., Kadzinski & Slowiński, 2013; Zopounidis & Doumpos, 2002). In practice, these decision problems often imply several decision makers having conflicting objectives and judgements. However, most multicriteria classification methods assume a single decision maker or a homogenous group of decision makers that acts as a single decision maker. Fortunately, several new methods and decision support systems for group multicriteria classification problems are now available in the literature, including Cai, Liao, and Wang (2012); Chen, Kilgour, and Hipel (2012); Damart, Dias, and Mousseau (2007); Greco, Kadzinski, Mousseau, and Slowiński (2012); Ishizaka and Labib (2011); Ishizaka and Nemery (2013b); Jabeur and Martel (2007); Labib, Read, Gladstone-Millar, Tonge, and Smith (2014); Liu, Liao, and Yang (2015); Lolli, Ishizaka, Gamberini, Rimini, and Messori (2015). However, most of existing proposals fail to resolve several group decision making problems shortcomings. Indeed, most of them use either input or output based aggregation strategy. These extreme strategies have some problems as discussed in Chakhar and Saad (2014). In addition, a large number of previous proposals assume that all decision makers have the same “power” and when “weights” are used, they often reflect the hierarchal levels of the decision makers. Another important issue that has not been correctly addressed in the existing works concerns the aggregation rules used to combine individual data and knowledge. In fact, the most used solutions to deal with this issue are either to combine these information informally based on discussion between the decision makers or, at best, using a weighted-sum as an aggregation rule that may lead to compensation problems. An additional problem concerns the definition of preference parameters as required by most of multicriteria methods. This is a very difficult exercise in practice which requires an important cognitive effort to the decision makers. Additionally, the elicitation of parameters is more complicated in a group decision context since involved decision makers may not agree on the values of the parameters. Finally, there is a lack of efficient tools to support sensitivity analysis in group decision.

The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to support group decision in multicriteria classification. The proposed approach contains three phases: (i) individual approximation, (ii) aggregation, and (iii) inference of collective decision rules. The individual approximation phase exploits the knowledge provided by each decision maker to approximate individually the collection of upward and downward unions of decision classes using the dominating and dominated sets. The aggregation phase seeks to combine the outputs of individual approximation phase into a collective decision table by using an appropriate aggregation procedure. The inference phase uses the collective decision table in order to infer a set of IF-THEN collective decision rules in order to synthesize the judgements and perspectives of the different decision makers and to permit the classification of all decision objects. The proposed approach relies on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) (Greco, Matarazzo, & Slowiński, 1999; 2001a; Slowiński, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2002), which is used at two different levels. First, the DRSA is used during the first phase to approximate the input data relative to each decision maker. Second, the DRSA is used during the third phase to approximate the collective decision table and generate the collective decision rules. The approach is illustrated in detail through one main case study relative to credit worthiness of 28 European countries and to two other case studies related to heat islands exposition in the Québec Metropolitan Community in Canada and the management of post-accident nuclear risk in the Southern France region. The paper also includes a detailed discussion and justification of the different concepts used in the aggregation procedure.

The approach proposed in this paper has several distinguishing characteristics. First, it adopts a mixed input-output aggregation strategy to combine the judgments and perspectives of involved decision makers. The mixed strategy allows taking advantages of both input and output aggregation strategies as explained in Chakhar and Saad (2014). Second, the “power” of the decision makers that measure the contribution of each one in the assignment of decision objects to decision classes is computed based on the input data. As stressed in Chakhar and Saad (2014), the use of input data to deduce the “power” of the decision makers seems generally to be more objective than the other weighting techniques. Third, the assignment of decision objects to decision classes is based on the use of the majority principle and veto effect. These notions are implemented through the concepts of concordance and discordance, which originated from Social Choice theory and are now well established in multicriteria analysis. Fourth, it uses a subset of data to extract and generalize the preferences of the decision makers. This idea has been proven to be very useful in practice (see, e.g., Guay, Joerin, Chakhar, Villeneuve, & Lavoie, 2011; Mercat-Rommens, Chakhar, Chojnacki, & Mousseau, 2015). Fifth, the approach is enhanced with several tools in order to permit the comparison of the final results obtained using different input parameters. This will substantially improve the effectiveness of the decision making process and the successful implementation of the final solution (see, e.g., Ishizaka & Labib, 2011).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 presents the background. Section 4 introduces the approach. Section 5 details the aggregation procedure. Section 6 illustrates the approach through a case study. Section 7 applies the approach to two additional cases studies. Section 8 provides rules to compare different final results. Section 9 concludes the paper.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In this section, we first comment on the main characteristics of the DRSA (Section 2.1). Then, we discuss the different extensions of DRSA to group decision making (Section 2.2).

The DRSA is a well-known multicriteria classification method that has been proposed by Greco et al. (1999, 2001a); Slowiński et al. (2002) to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional Rough Sets Theory (RST) (Pawlak, 1991) in multicriteria classification. The basic idea of DRSA is to replace the indiscernibility relation used in the classical RST with the dominance relation, which is more appropriate for multicriteria decision-making. The DRSA has been successfully used in different real-world decision problems including risk assessment (Chakhar & Saad, 2012), weed species identification (Guay et al., 2011), pollution risk assessment of drinking water (Legay, Cloutier, Chakhar, Joerin, & Rodriguez, 2015), nuclear risk assessment (Chakhar, Pusceddu, & Saad, 2012), knowledge management (Saad & Chakhar, 2012), service improvement (Liou, Tang, Yeh, & Tsai, 2011), bankruptcy risk evaluation (Greco, Matarazzo, & Slowiński, 2002), customer satisfaction (Greco, Matarazzo, & Slowiński, 2007), sustainable planning strategies for farms (Paolotti, Greco, & Boggia, 2015), location of undesirable facilities (Abastante, Bottero, Greco, & Lami, 2014), metabolomics (Blasco et al., 2015) and product mix (Greco, Matarazzo, & Slowiński, 2008).

The DRSA has some powerful characteristics that makes it attractive in real-world decision problems:

                           
                              •
                              there is no need of preference parameters, which reduces the cognitive effort required from the decision makers;

it produces IF-THEN decision rules, which are more simple and easily understandable by the decision makers, especially those with no background in multicriteria decision making (Blaszczyński, Greco, & Slowiński, 2012a);

it is able to deal with incomplete/missing attribute values (see Blaszczyński, Slowiński, & Szeląg, 2012b; Slowiński et al., 2002);

it is able to detect and deal with inconsistency problems (see Deng et al., 2013; Slowiński, Stefanowski, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2000);

it uses a subset of data (as a learning set) to extract and generalize the preferences of the decision makers, which minimizes the cognitive effort required from them.

The last point, concerning the use of a learning set as input, is adapted in several multicriteria classification methods, including (Bregar, Györkös, & Jurič, 2008; Dias, Mousseau, Figueira, & Clímaco, 2002; Figueira, Mousseau, & Roy, 2005). However, the main addition of DRSA compared to other multicriteria classification methods, that are based on the use of a learning set as input (such as (Almeida-Dias, Figueira, & Roy, 2010, 2012)), is the simplicity and the easily understandable IF-THEN decision rules provided as output, while other methods have no such straightforward interpretation (Blaszczyński et al., 2012a).

There are several extensions to DRSA in the literature. The DRSA has been extended to deal with multicriteria choice and ranking problems in Greco, Matarazzo, and Slowiński (2001a); Kadzinski, Slowiński, and Greco (2015). The Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (VC-DRSA) (Greco, Matarazzo, Slowiński, & Stefanowski, 2001c) is a variant of DRSA that enables the relaxation of the conditions for assignments of objects to the lower approximations by accepting a limited proportion of negative examples, which is particularly useful for large decision tables. The Stochastic DRSA, which allows inconsistencies to some degree, has been introduced in Dembczynski, Greco, Kotlowski, and Slowiński (2007). In Blaszczyński, Greco, and Slowiński (2007), the authors studied the classification of objects using decision rules in situation where it is covered by no rule, exactly one rule and several rules. A parameterized DRSA to deal with interval-valued information systems is presented in Yang, Qi, Yu, Yu, and Yang (2015) and an incremental approach for maintaining approximations of DRSA when attribute values vary over time is proposed in Li and Li (2015). The authors in Susmaga and Slowiński (2015) provide a formal and unified framework to define and compute inter-class reducts, intra-class reducts and constructs across the conventional RSA and the DRSA. Recently, the DRSA is combined with the robust ordinal regression paradigm in order to obtain robust conclusions (Kadziński, Greco, & Slowiński, 2014; Slowiński, Kadziński, & Greco, 2014). There are also several extensions of DRSA for group decision making, which will be briefly discussed in Section 2.2.

The DRSA is useful for dealing with ordered data or for ordinal classification problems with monotonicity constraints. However, in some real-world decision problems, we may not know a-priori if such an ordering exists. In this case, it may be necessary to use initially more traditional inference mechanisms in order to learn from the data before applying DRSA. This topic is further discussed in Greco et al. (2012); Slowiński et al. (2002). There is also another solution which consists in applying a transformation allowing to deal with non ordinal data in DRSA as in Blaszczyński et al. (2012a); Wang, Zhou, and She (2015).

There are several extensions of DRSA to support group multicriteria classification. In two previous research papers (Chakhar & Saad, 2012, 2014), we discussed and compared several proposals for group decision making with respect to several criteria, including aggregation strategy (at the input level, at the output level, or mixed input-output), aggregation rule (statistical, functional, rule-based techniques or by discussion), preference parameters requirement (criteria weights, parameters, etc.), preference parameters elicitation technique (direct, indirect, mixed), stakeholder weighting (by a mediator or an external person, based on the hierarchical levels of decision makers, using a dedicated method, based on input data) and support of robust assignment. In this paper, we discus some extensions of DRSA to support group decision-making.

The authors in Saad and Chakhar (2009) propose a three phase DRSA-based methodology for the identification of crucial knowledge. Using this methodology allows to take into account the preferences of decision makers that can be different or even contradictory while exploiting and managing their multiple points of view to evaluate knowledge, without using a quantitative measuring approach. The methodology proposed in Saad and Chakhar (2009) requires, when inconsistency situations are identified, that the analyst conducts an in-depth discussion with the different decision makers in order to solve the conflicts. This is a time-consuming and difficult task. For this purpose, the authors in Brigui-Chtioui and Saad (2011) enhance Saad and Chakhar’s 2009 methodology by proposing an argumentative multi-agent model based on a mediator agent in order to automate the resolution of conflicts between decision makers.

Another extension of DRSA to support multiple decision makers is reported in Greco, Matarazzo, and Slowiński (2006). In this paper, the authors extend the lower and upper approximations and boundary concepts of DRSA. More specifically, they introduce the concepts of downward and upward multi-union and mega-union. These new concepts are then used to define lower and upper approximations for unions of classes. In Wen-Jie and Xiao-Hong (2007), the authors present a rough set approach to group decisions-making very similar to the work of Greco et al. (2006). To deal with the decision of multiple decision makers they extend DRSA by introducing specific concepts related to dominance with respect to minimal profiles of evaluations given by multiple decision makers. In particular, the authors characterize the conditions for a consensus attainable by multiple decision makers considered as a whole. Such a perspective permits to handle interactions between the decision makers.

A system that aggregates case-based linguistic decision rules using a hybrid of the DRSA and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is proposed for multicriteria sorting implying multiple participant in Chen et al. (2012). The methodology proposed in Chen et al. (2012) can be organized in two phases. First, DRSA is employed to infer linguistic decision rules that estimate the preferences of a few participants by means of their evaluations of representative case sets. Next, Dempster-Shafer Theory is applied to aggregate the decision rules triggered by all participants’ evaluations of an alternative, thereby generating an overall decision recommendation for the alternative. One main shortcomings of Chen et al.’s 2012 proposal is its complexity in the sense that it requires a solid technical and mathematical background in rough approximation and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

In Chakhar and Saad (2012), the authors propose a two-phase methodology to support groups in multicriteria classification problems. The major addition of Chakhar and Saad (2012) is an aggregation procedure implementing the majority principle and veto effect—in terms of aggregation rules—thus it allows obtaining consensual decisions. Furthermore, the contribution of each decision maker to the collective decision is objectively measured by the quality of individual classification conducted by this decision maker during the first phase. The proposal of Chakhar and Saad (2012) has been adopted in Saad and Chakhar (2012) to the case of binary decision classes. In Chakhar and Pusceddu (2013), the authors refine the aggregation procedure proposed in Chakhar and Saad (2012) by replacing the aggregation rules by more simple and more advanced ones requiring only one parameter (namely, credibility threshold) instead of two parameters (namely, majority and veto thresholds) in Chakhar and Saad (2012).

The paper (Zhang, Ignatius, Lim, & Goh, 2014) proposes a two-stage dynamic group decision making method for aggregating ordinal preferences. The method permits to avoid two problems of group decision making in relation to ordinal preferences—namely, difficulty of managing conflicting opinions and neglecting the power relationships between the preferences provided by the decision makers. Although the proposal of Zhang et al. (2014) is not primary concerned by the extension of the DRSA to group decision making, it is fruitful to mention that the authors are inspired by the principle of the DRSA in order to define new support function associated with the Power Average operator used to combine the collective preference. As argued by the authors, the use of DRSA’s idea permits to better cope with ordinal preferences given by the decision makers. Additionally and as the support function is defined based on DRSA, the aggregation method can be easily extended to other quasi-ordinal preference relations. Furthermore, the non-parameterized definition of the support function (due to DRSA), provides a feasible method to determine the weights of each decision maker.

In Sun and Ma (2015), the authors present a generalization of the classical DRSA into multi-decision preference dominance-based rough set model supporting a set of condition criteria and a set of decision classes. The basic idea of Sun and Ma (2015) is to define two dominance relations, one on the condition criteria set and the other on the decision classes set, which are then used to define the lower and upper approximations. The authors propose four versions of their decision model, which are then applied to solve a multi-agent conflict analysis decision problem and improve the Pawlak conflict analysis model (Pawlak, 2005).

Finally, it is important to mention that the approach proposed in this paper enhances the one proposed in Chakhar and Saad (2012). First, this approach uses more advanced weighing system leading to more realistic and precise weights, as explained in Sections 5.1. Second, it replaces the two assignment rules in Chakhar and Saad (2012) by a single assignment rule, which reduces the number of required parameters and which is more appropriate for sensitivity analysis as illustrated in Section 6.4. Third, the paper provides a detailed justification of the concepts used including the definition of decision makers’ weights (Section 5.1), the definition of the concordance power (Section 5.2), the definition of the discordance power (Section 5.3) and the definition of assignment intervals (Section 5.5). Fourth, the paper includes new case studies that are relative to credit worthiness of 28 European countries (Section 6), heat islands exposition in the Québec Metropolitan Community in Canada (Section 7.1) and the management of post-accident nuclear risk in the Southern France region (Section 7.2). Lastly, a collection of well-known statistics (namely Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ, Cohen’s κ, Kendall’s W and Fless’s κ) is used to compare in a formal way the final classifications obtained using different input parameters (Section 8).

This section presents a brief introduction to the DRSA. More details are available in Greco et al. (1999, 2001a); Slowiński et al. (2002).

Information regarding the decision objects is often structured in a 4-tuple information table

                         for every q ∈ Q. Vq
                         is the domain of attribute q.

                              ,
                           
                         and f: U × Q → V is the information function defined such that f(x, q) ∈ Vq
                         for each attribute q and object x ∈ U. The set Q is often divided into a sub-set C ≠ ∅ of condition criteria and a sub-set D ≠ ∅ of decision classes such that 
                           
                              C
                              ∪
                              D
                              =
                              Q
                           
                         and 
                           
                              C
                              ∩
                              D
                              =

                        . In this case, S is called a decision table.

The domain of condition criteria are supposed to be ordered according to a decreasing or increasing preference. Such attributes are called criteria. The proponents of DRSA assume that the preference is increasing with a value of f( ·, q) for every q ∈ C. We also assume that the set of decision classes

The decision attribute induces a partition of U in a way that is independent of the condition criteria. Hence, a decision table may be seen as a set of decision rules of the form if [condition] then[consequence], where the condition part specifies the values assumed by one or more condition criteria and the decision part specifies an assignment to one or more decision classes. Three types of decision rules may be considered: (i) certain rules generated from lower approximations of unions of classes, (ii) possible rules generated from upper approximations of unions of classes and (iii) approximate rules generated from boundary regions.

An object x ∈ U supports a decision rule if its description matches both the condition and the decision parts of this rule. A decision rule covers object x if the description of x matches at least the condition part of the rule. Each decision rule is characterized by its strength, which is defined as the number of objects supporting this rule. If the consequence is univocal (i.e., contains only one decision), the rule is exact, otherwise it is approximate.

The objective of this section is to introduce the Dominance Rough Set Approach for Group (DRSAfG) multicriteria classification. First, we will briefly present the aggregation strategy adopted by DRSAfG. Then, we describe the different phases of DRASfG. Next, we discuss some practical issues. Lastly, we comment on the definition of decision classes.

As underlined in Chakhar and Saad (2014), we may distinguish two main strategies that may be used to combine judgements and perspectives of decision makers in group decision making: either at the input or at the output levels. These two strategies still apply to group multicriteria classification. The input oriented aggregation strategy seems to be technically and practically easier to implement and to use. However, it assumes that decision makers collaborate effectively and that there is not much conflict regarding the input data. The output oriented strategy seems to be more flexible since the involved decision makers can work independently. Hence, it is more suitable for decision makers that are geographically distributed and/or those that have time constraints. However, the output aggregation strategy is technically more complex.

The DRSAfG is structured according to a mixed input–output strategy that allows avoidance or reduction of the respective shortcomings of the input and output strategies. The mixed aggregation strategy proceeds as follows (Chakhar & Saad, 2014): (i) each decision maker generates his/her own output (approximations of decision classes); (ii) aggregating coherently the individual outputs into a collective input (collective decision table); and (iii) use the collective input in order to generate a collective output (collective decision rules). A detailed description of the three aggregation strategies is given in Chakhar and Saad (2014).

The DRSAfG is composed of three phases: (i) individual approximation, (ii) aggregation, and (iii) inference of collective decision rules. These phases should be mapped directly into the three phases of the mixed input-output aggregation strategy described previously. Let

In this phase, each decision maker uses the common information table I to construct her/his own decision table

We suppose that each decision maker i ∈ H has a preference order for U represented by a finite set of preference-ordered classes

For this purpose, we designed an aggregation procedure that will be detailed in Section 5. The basic idea of this procedure is to use the outputs of individual approximation phase to assign to each object x ∈ U an assignment interval

The collective decision attribute E induces a partition of U into a set of decision classes

The collective decision table S constructed in the previous phase can be approximated using the same principle given in Section 3, i.e., by applying conventional DRSA. On the basis of the approximations obtained, it is possible to induce a generalized description of the preferential information contained in the decision table, in terms of collective decision rules of the form if [condition] then [consequence]. The obtained rules are then used to classify all decision objects. The most popular rule induction algorithm for DRSA is DOMLEM (DOMinance-based Learning from Examples Module) (Greco, Matarazzo, Slowinski, & Stefanowski, 2001b), which generates minimal set of rules. The same algorithm is used here.

The approach is structured as an iterative decision-making process. Specifically, at the end of the third phase, a set of collective decision rules are generated. If the involved decision makers agree on these rules, then the decision-making process ends. Otherwise, the process can then be restarted by considering new input data.

The aggregation procedure requires the definition of two parameters. The first one is called credibility threshold. The latter represents the minimum value for the credibility index for assigning an object to a given class or union of classes. The second parameter is the interval reduction rule. This parameter will be used to reduce the assignment interval into a single value corresponding to the value of the collective decision attribute. These parameters should be fixed by the mediator but the decision makers involved should agree on them. In practice, these parameters will be of great importance since the mediator can use them in order to test different possible values and to select the ones that fit better to the decision situation.

In the description of DRSAfG, we assumed that the decision makers use the same set of decision classes. However, in practice, the number of decision classes may differ from one decision maker to another. There are (at least) four possible solutions to this issue:

                           
                              •
                              a first intuitive solution consists of the fact that the decision makers should first discuss and agree on a common set of decision classes before starting the assignment process;

a second simple solution consists of grouping some decision classes;

a third simple solution that consists of adding fictitious classes (without assigning objects to them);

a fourth, more established, solution consists of defining a set of common decision classes as the Cartesian Product of individual decision classes.

The implementation of the first solution is straightforward and does not need any modification in the proposed methodology. The second solution is also simple to implement, but it may lead to preferential information loss. For the third solution, we need only to re-arrange the assignments of the decision objects according to the new definition of the decision classes. Let for instance assume that the decision problem involves two decision makers with two sets of decision classes: Cla
                        ≺Clb
                        ≺Clc
                         and Clx
                        ≺Cly
                        . According to the third solution, we need to add a new decision class, say Clnew
                        , to the second set of decision classes, which leads to Clx
                        ≺Clnew
                        ≺Cly
                        . Then, we can define a new common set of decision classes Cl
                        1≺Cl
                        2≺Cl

                        2 and Cl
                        3 or Cl
                        4 and Cl
                        5. A possible solution is to merge the incomparable decision classes. Another possible solution is to use some additional information (such as the number of decision makers, the number of assigned decision objects or the quality of individual classifications) to order the incomparable decision classes. For the purpose of this paper, we assume that the decision makers use the same set of decision classes. We note, however, that the above cited solutions will be studied in a more formal way in our future work.

The objective of this section is to detail the aggregation procedure that is used in the second phase in order to construct the collective decision table

                           U

                        S
                      requires simply the specification of the values of the collective information function g in respect to the collective decision attribute E. First, recall that the collective decision attribute E induces a partition of U into a set of decision classes

                      such that each x ∈ U belongs to one and only one class

The definition of the weights of decision makers is a crucial step in group decision making (Zhang et al., 2014). The authors in Chakhar and Saad (2014) enumerated several techniques to specify the weights in group decision making: (i) weights are defined explicitly by a mediator or an external independent person as in Leyva-López and Fernández-González (2003); (ii) weights are defined based on the hierarchical levels of involved decision makers; (iii) weights are defined explicitly using a given method as in Herowati, Ciptomulyono, and Parung (2014); Yue (2011); and (iv) weights are inferred from input data using some form of regression as in Dias et al. (2002). Each of these techniques have some advantages and disadvantages and the selection of the technique to use is not obvious. The authors argue that the most important characteristic of weights definition method is the objectiveness of these weights. In this respect, it is advocated that the question is not how to use weights, but rather how to objectively quantify them (Cook, 2006). Another important characteristic of weights definition methods is the ability of these methods to objectively measure the expertise of the decision makers or experts, as discussed in Herowati et al. (2014); Shanteau, Weiss, Thomas, and Pounds (2002); Weiss and Shanteau (2003). Indeed and as pointed out by Herowati et al. (2014), more experienced decision makers will generally provide more consistent decisions. This is confirmed in different real-world applications in which the authors were involved, as e.g., Mercat-Rommens et al., 2015; Saad and Chakhar, 2009.

In the DRSAfG, the assignment of objects to decision classes requires the definition of an appropriate weighting system that reflects in the most objective way the role of each decision maker in the collective decision. In this paper, the contribution of each decision maker to the collective decision is measured by the quality of input data provided by the decision maker. More formally, we propose the following formula:

                         by decision maker k. This form of weights definition combines both the quality of classification and the accuracy of the rough-set representation of classes. It enhances the weighting system used in Chakhar and Pusceddu (2013); Chakhar and Saad (2012), which is based on the quality of approximation only. In fact, the accuracy of the approximation of an individual class, say Clt
                        , obtained by a given decision maker, say k, may be equal to 0 which means that decision maker does not support any assignment of objects to class Clt
                        . This fact is well supported by the proposed weighting system. Using just the quality of approximation as weights as in Chakhar and Pusceddu (2013); Chakhar and Saad (2012), it does not allow to take into account this fact (since the quality of approximation characterizes the whole classification rather than the approximations of individual classes). In the new form of weights definition, an accuracy of the approximation of class Clt
                         equal to 0 leads to a weight of zero meaning that the decision maker does not support the assignment of objects to the class Clt
                        . The main argument of using the accuracy of approximation is that a given decision maker may be able to define more precisely some classes than other ones. For instance, in a problem of assigning students to three decision classes designed as Bad, Medium, Good, it is expected that one can identify perfectly good students but it has more difficulty to identify bad or medium students.

It is very important to mention that the weights of decision makers as used in this paper should be interpreted as used in non-compensatory multicriteria methods, especially those based on outranking relations, where the weights play the same role as a number of votes in a voting procedure. This contrast with weights definition in compensatory multicriteria methods (the weighted-sum like methods) where weights are actually scaling constant (this means that if you change the unit in which is expressed a criterion, the weights change as well).

A final issue about weights definition concerns the controversial situation when a given decision maker provides fully consistent but controversial choices, where ‘controversial’ means different than the majority of decision makers. In such a situation the decision maker is more ‘powerful’ than the others, who are less consistent but also less controversial. This situation is realistic and can happen in real-world decision problems. However, the use of the majority/veto rule reduces largely the effects of the controversial assignments on the final outputs. In addition, the weights are specific to each class union. This means that the effects of a controversial assignment of a given individual class will concern only this class. Furthermore, the other decision makers still have the possibility to disagree on the final outputs and to end the decision process as briefly discussed in Section 4.3.

                        . The concordance power verifies some properties which are given in Appendix A.1. The concordance power is defined on the basis of lower approximation of classes, which contains objects that are assigned with certainty to a given class. In this sense, it can be seen as an argument that supports the assignment of objects to classes.

Let us now justify the definition of the concordance power as a sum:

                           
                              •

                                       L

                                  the concordance power will be equal to 1 (the maximum value). This will automatically inhibit the veto effect of the discordance power (as explained in Section 5.3) and leads to a full support for the assignment of the decision object x to decision class

                                  the assignment is confirmed only and only if: (i) a majority of decision makers supports this assignment; and (ii) there is not a high opposition to this assignment from the other (minority) decision makers. These two conditions hold if the credibility index (see Section 5.4) for assigning an object x to a given class Clt
                                  is greater or equal to 0.5.

We note that other ways to define the global concordance power may be used. For instance, the global concordance power may be defined as the product of partial concordance powers. However, this definition is not suitable since the global concordance power will be equal to 0 even if there is only one decision maker that does not support the assignment decision. The use of a constrained product of partial concordance powers (to avoid the multiplication by a zero) could be also used. However, this technique is not attractive in our context since the values obtained will still tend towards zero (but strictly positive) because all the weights are in the range of ]0, 1].

Finally, we should mention that the definition of the concordance power in this paper is inspired by the definition of the concept of concordance in the ELECTRE methods family (Figueira et al., 2005). Indeed, in both cases, the global concordance power is defined as the sum of the partial concordance powers. The main difference is that the global concordance power as defined in this paper measures the power of the coalition of decision makers that are in favor of the decision concerning the assignment of a decision object x to a given class Clt
                         while in ELECTRE methods, the concordance measures the coalition of criteria that are in favor of the outranking relation between two decision objects (or an object and a profile limit in the case of the ELECTRE TRI method).

                        . The discordance power verifies some properties which are given in Appendix A.2. The definition of the discordance power is based on the boundaries of classes, which contains objects that can neither be ruled in nor out as members of the class. In this sense, it represents an argument that opposes to the assignment of objects to classes.

We may distinguish two cases in the definition of the discordance power. The first case holds when

                                  is not strong enough, it will reduce the support level but not as much as required to reject the assignment. This is also an explicit form of veto effect but the veto is not strong enough to lead to the rejection of the assignment decision.

Finally, we should mention that the definition of the discordance power in this paper is inspired by the definition of the concept of discordance in the ELECTRE methods family (Figueira et al., 2005). Indeed, in both cases, the global discordance power is defined as the product of the partial discordance powers. The main difference is that the global discordance power as defined in this paper measures the power of the coalition of decision makers that are not in favor of the decision concerning the assignment of a decision object x to a given class Clt
                         while in ELECTRE methods, the discordance measures the coalition of the criteria that are not in favor of the outranking relation between two decision objects (or an object and a profile limit in the case of the ELECTRE TRI method).

Using the concordance and discordance powers, we may compute the credibility indices for assigning x to

                         where l(x) and u(x) with l(x) ⪯ u(x) indicate the lower and upper bounds to which decision object x should be assigned. The assignment of a decision object x ∈ U into decision class

                         will depend on the value of credibility indices values. The credibility indices range in [0, 1] where a value of 1 indicates a full support for assigning x to

Let λ ∈ [0.5, 1] be a credibility threshold. Then, based on the discussion above, we may distinguish two types of constraints for assigning objects to decision classes: (i)

                              ≥
                              λ
                           
                         (type ‘ ≤ ’ constraint). The lower l(x) and uppers u(x) bounds of the assignment interval I(x) can be defined based on the two types of constraints. This leads to four possible solutions for defining l(x) and u(x) (see Table 1
                        ). An appropriate assignment interval

                         should, however, verify the following conditions: (i) the lower bound l(x) should indicate the minimum class to which a given decision object x is assigned. Consequently, it should be defined based on a constraint of the type ‘ ≥ ’; and (ii) the upper bounds u(x) should indicate the maximum class to which a given decision object x is assigned. Consequently, it should be defined based on a constraint of the type of ‘ ≤ ’. Hence, Solutions 1, 3 and 4 cannot be used since: (a) Solution 1 fails to verify condition (ii), (b) Solution 4 fails to verify condition (i), and (c) Solution 3 fails to verify conditions (i) and (ii). Hence, only Solution 2, which has been used in this paper, is valid since it verifies both conditions.

                        . The assignment interval verifies several properties which are given in Appendix A.4. It is easy to see that our definition of the lower l(x) and upper u(x) bounds of the assignment interval I(x) apply even when N
                        1(x), N
                        2(x) or both are empty.

Let us now justify the definition of l(x) and u(x) as in Eqs. (9) and (10). There are four possible cases to specify the values of l(x) and u(x). These solutions are given in Table 2
                         and represented graphically in Fig. 1
                        .

Based on Fig. 1, we can conclude that: (a) Case 1 will lead to an assignment interval that concentrates on the left side of the possible assignments; (b) Case 2 will lead to the largest assignment interval; (c) Case 3 will lead to an assignment interval that concentrates on the right side of the possible assignments; and (d) Case 4 will lead to the in-between and smallest interval. In the proposed approach, Case 4 has been used. We mention, however, that the other three cases can be used. Case 4 has been selected because it leads to the smallest and intermediate assignment intervals, which we will be more easily accepted by the different decision makers, especially in the presence of controversial choices.

To finalize the construction of the collective decision table S, some simple interval reduction rules are used for reducing the assignment intervals I(x), ∀x ∈ U, to a single class representing the value to assign to the collective decision attribute E (as explained in Section 4).

                              (

                         be the assignment interval for object x ∈ U as previously defined. Two cases hold for the reduction of I(x). The first case holds when 
                           
                              l

                        . Here, object x is assigned to a single class and consequently we can set

                              E
                              )
                              =
                              l

                        . The second case holds when l(x)≺u(x). This corresponds to the situation where object x can be assigned to more than one class. To specify the value of g(x, E) when the second case holds, we may apply one of the following rules to reduce the collective assignment interval I(x) to a single class:

This section presents the application of the proposed approach using real-world data.

The problem considered here concerns credit worthiness for a set of 28 European countries. The credit worthiness is generally defined as the judgment of a country current and future ability, and inclination to honor debt obligations as agreed upon. The objective of this case study is to apply the proposed approach in order to construct a common ranking scale of the considered countries based on the ranking scales established by three rating agencies, namely Fitch, Moody and S&P. Unfruitfully, the rating agencies do not provide any information about the criteria that they use to establish the rankings. For the purpose of this paper, we considered a set of seven evaluation criteria, which are described in Table 3
                        . It is clear that other criteria may be included in the analysis but our objective here is mainly to illustrate the proposed approach. Table 3 also shows the three decision attributes corresponding to the agencies Fitch, Moody and S&P, respectively. Table 4
                         provides the description of the ranking scales of the different rating agencies. Based on these scales, we defined a common classification scale that is given in Table 4 (fourth column).

The data set used in this application is given in Table 5
                        . This table provides the assessment of the considered 28 European countries in respect to the seven criteria given in Table 3 and also the ranking of these countries as established by Fitch, Moody and S&P agencies. We note that these data has been collected from the Eurostat Website (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat). We also note that the data in Table 5 was accessed in March 2015.

The decision tables can be represented as a collection of upward and downward unions of decision classes and approximated in the same way as with the DRSA; see Section 3. The quality of the approximations and the accuracy of classes approximations are summarized in Appendix B.1.

We need first to quantify the contribution of decision makers into the assignment process using Eq. (3) and the data given in Appendix B.1. The result is given in Table 6

                              . Then, the assignment intervals can be computed using Eqs. (9) and (10). The application of these equations are detailed in Appendix B.5 and the obtained assignment intervals are summarized in Table 7
                              . Let us consider the definition of the assignment interval for object x

To construct the collective decision table, we need to use one of the different interval reduction rules in order to specify the values of the collective decision attribute E. Table 7 shows the collective decision attribute values for different interval reduction rules and for 
                                 
                                    λ
                                    =
                                    0.75
                                 
                              .

At this level, the mediator should apply DRSA on the collective decision table. Table 8
                            provides the list of decision rules obtained for 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 0.75
                              
                            and where the operator “floor” is used for interval reduction rule. Let briefly comment on some decision rules. According to Rule #8 in Table 8, the ranking of a given country is at most Cl
                           9 if (i) the Public Debt is greater or equal to 126.1 and (ii) the Inflation Rate is greater or equal to 0. This rule is supported by only one decision object (x
                           15) and its strength is equal to 9.09 percent. The last Rule #37 indicates that when (i) the GDP is greater or equal to 382,692, (ii) the Inflation Rate is lower or equal to 0.34, and (iii) the Unemployment Rate is lower or equal to 8.5, then, this country should be ranked at least Cl
                           13. Rule 37 is supported by two objects (x
                           2 and x
                           27) and its strength is equal to 15.38 percent. Finally, we observe that all these decision rules are exact.

The aggregation procedure requires the definition of the credibility threshold λ ∈ [0.5, 1] and the selection of an interval reduction rule. In what follows, we discuss some examples illustrating the role of these parameters and the way that they can be used in practice. Let us focus first on the credibility threshold λ. Table 9
                         shows the assignment intervals for different values of λ. In this table, we can easily see that the assignment intervals become larger by increasing the credibility threshold. This is a consequence of Properties (5) and (6) given in Appendix A.3. Indeed, the upper limit u(x) of the assignment interval I(x) is defined based on the values of

Let us now consider the benefits of proposing different interval reduction rules. The most important argument for proposing several interval reduction rules is the fact that these rules may apply to different decision-making situations. For instance, in decision contexts implying human health risk and human exposure to nuclear risks or other similar situations, the maximum rule (that picks the highest risk level here) is more appropriate. In other decision situations with a limited impact on human health, the minimum operator may be better justified. The median operator provides an intermediate value between the minimum and maximum values.

Finally, we present in Table 10
                         some statistics and output information. Here we just define the concepts of minimal cover, reduct and core. The minimal cover is a subset of non redundant decision rules. A reduct is a subset of attributes which can, by itself, fully characterize the knowledge in the decision table. The set of attributes which is common to all reducts is called the core. The analysis of Table 10 ensures the importance of the criterion GDP since it is often present in the core set. The next most important criterion is the Unemp

In this section, we provide two additional case studies illustrating the proposed approach. The first case study is related to the heat islands exposition in the Québec Metropolitan Community in Canada. The second case study concerns the management of post-accident nuclear risk in the Southern France region.

This case study was conducted as part of an action-research project whose purpose was to strengthen the resilience of the Québec Metropolitan Community (QMC), Québec, Canada, to climate change (Dubois, Bergeron, Potvin, & Adolphe, 2012; Legay et al., 2015). The objective of the second phase of this project is to assess the hot islands exposition risk at the QMC. A large set of criteria has been initially identified by the experts during this project. However, only a subset of seven criteria for which data were available for all the districts of the QMC were used to produce final risk maps. These considered criteria are: Built density (Built

                        Year).

The experts have also identified a subset of 15 spatial units in the QMC—each spatial unit corresponds to an average city quarter of 250m × 250m—that have been used as learning examples. Furthermore, they jointly designed an ordinal risk scale of four levels from the lower risk (1) to the highest risk (4) to compare the spatial units of the study area. The assessment of the selected spatial units with respect to all criteria is summarized in Table 12
                        . The experts have been organized randomly into two teams. Based on the scores of the selected spatial units with respect to all criteria and on their own expertise and knowledge of the territory, each team of experts categorizes each of the selected spatial units on the risk scale. The result of assignment process is given in Table 12 (the two last columns).

We applied the proposed approach to the data in Table 12. The assignment intervals and the collective decision attribute values for different interval reduction rules are given Table 13
                        . The list of the collective decision rules obtained for a credibility threshold λ equal to 0.5 and by using the ‘ceiling’ operator are given in Table 14
                        . The ‘ER’ in this table stands for ‘Exposition Risk’. The quality of approximation for this particular application is equal to 1. In addition, there are two reducts ({Built

The problem considered in this case study concerns the management of post-accident nuclear risk in the Southern France region. This evaluation was conducted during the PRIME project, which was supervised by the French Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety. A full description of the project is available in Mercat-Rommens et al. (2015). The studied zone covers a radius of some fifty kilometers around three nuclear sites in the lower Rhône Valley (the Cruas, Tricastin-Pierrelatte and Marcoule sites). The objective of PRIME is to develop—conjointly with the decision makers, the stakeholders and representatives of the territory—a multicriteria evaluation approach in order to permit the analysis and characterization of the contaminated territory, which will be useful for the risk managers. The evaluation approach should associate to each district of the study area a degree representing the risk on this district of a nuclear accident resulting in releases into the atmosphere. For this purpose, a scale of six levels (0: normal situation; 1: very minor impact; 2: minor impact; 3: moderate impact; 4: major impact; and 5: major and long-lasting negative impact) has been adopted by the PRIME working team.

For the purpose of this paper, only a subset of data is used for illustration. The problem discussed here involves 18 decision objects (corresponding to a subset of the districts of the study area) selected from 492 decision objects, 7 evaluation criteria and three decision makers denoted CM, PP and CAL, respectively. The criteria considered in this paper are: Radioecological vulnerability of agricultural area (Agri

                        . We note that the decision table given in Table 15 contains two inconsistent objects, namely #4, and #6. They are inconsistent, because #4 has better evaluations on all three attributes than #6 but a worse global score.


                        Table 16
                         shows the assignment intervals and the collective decision attribute values for different values of credibility threshold λ and different interval reduction rules. Table 17
                         provides the list of decision rules obtained for

                         and where the operator “floor” is used for interval reduction rule.

The final classifications generated by the DRSAfG may differ according to the input data and parameters. The objective of this section is to provide a formal way to compare the different final classifications using a series of well-known non-parametric statistics, namely Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ, Cohen’s κ, Kendall’s W and Fless’s κ.

The main input for the DRSAfG is the individual classifications specified by the different decision makers. Intuitively, we prefer that the final collective classification produced by the aggregation procedure reproduces perfectly these classifications. This is often unreachable since decision makers generally provide different assignments. A more reasonable objective is to obtain a final classification that reproduces “at best” the individual classifications. Let Ci

                         a final ranking generated by the aggregation procedure. The first possible comparison is obtained by a direct application of the Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ and/or Cohen’s κ coefficients to evaluate the agreement between the final rankings and each of the initial rankings.

The Kendall’s τ coefficient is a metric that counts the number of pairwise disagreements between two ranking lists. The Spearman’s ρ measures the statistical dependence between two variables and assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. The Cohen’s κ is a measurement of concordance or agreement between two rankings. There are two ways of calculating Cohen’s κ: unweighted and weighted. The weighted κ is more appropriate to variables having more than two categories. The Kendall’s τ, Spearman’s ρ and Cohen’s κ are designed to compare two given rankings. In addition, these three statistics accept ordinal data and can deal with ties. In the rest of this paper, we design by τ(Cj, Ci
                        ), ρ(Cj, Ci
                        ) and κ(Cj, Ci

The rule above applies for one final classification and one initial classification. It is more appropriate to compute the closeness of a final classification to all the initial classifications taken together. We can compute the closeness of a collective classification Cj

A more appropriate way to compare a given final classification in respect to all the initial rankings consists in the use of the Kendall’s W and/or Fleiss’s κ statistics. The Kendall’s W (also known as Kendall’s coefficient of concordance) is used for assessing agreement among multiple rankings. The Fless’s κ is an extension of Cohen’s κ to evaluate concordance or agreements between multiple rankings. The Kendall’s W and Fless’s κ are devoted to compare at least three different rankings. In addition, both of them accept ordinal data and can deal with ties.

                         for the initial and final classifications given in Table 5 and Table 9, respectively. The values of Kendall τ coefficient are computed using the Web-based and Free Statistics Software (Wessa, 2012), the Spearman ρ and the Cohen’s κ, Kendall’s W and Fleiss’s κ coefficients are computed using the Web-based StatsToDo Software (StatsToDo Software, 2015). In Table 18, the minimum values (corresponding to worst final classification) are underlined while the maximum values (corresponding to best final classification) are in boldface.

The Kendall’s τ coefficient is in the range [
                           −
                        1,1]. If the agreement between the two rankings is perfect (i.e., the two rankings are the same) the coefficient has value 1. If the disagreement between the two rankings is total (i.e., one ranking is the reverse of the other) the coefficient has value 
                           −
                        1. If two rankings are independent, then we would expect the coefficient to be approximately zero. The Spearman’s ρ coefficient is in the range [
                           −
                        1,1]. A positive Spearman correlation coefficient indicates that both rankings vary in the same direction. A negative Spearman ρ coefficient indicates a monotone decreasing relationship between the two rankings. A Spearman ρ coefficient of zero indicates that there is no tendency between the two rankings. Conventionally, a Kappa of <0.2 is considered poor agreement, 0.21–0.4 fair, 0.41–0.6 moderate, 0.61–0.8 strong, and more than 0.8 near complete agreement. As shown in Table 18, the values of Kendall’s τ and Spearman’s ρ coefficients all tend towards 1. We can conclude that there is a high level of agreement between initial and final rankings. The values of Cohen’s κ in Table 18 are all greater than 0.8, indicating a near complete agreement between each of initial and final rankings.

The Kendall’s W coefficient ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). Intermediate values of Kendall’s W indicate a greater or lesser degree of unanimity among the various rankings. A negative Fleiss’s kappa indicates poor agreement. A Fleiss’s κ in the range [0,1] indicates an increasing levels of agreement. A Fleiss’s κ greater than 0.8 indicates a near perfect agreement. The values of Kendall’s W coefficient in Table 18 tend towards 1. We can conclude that according to Kendall’s W coefficient, there is a high level of agreement between the initial and the final rankings. The values of Fleiss’s κ show a moderate agreement between the initial and the final rankings.

We conducted the same comparison exercise presented above with the two other case studies given in Section 7.1 and in Section 7.2, respectively. A summary of this comparison is given in Appendix C.

We proposed an approach, called DRSAfG, designed to handle multiple decision makers in a way that leads to one compromise solution. The DRSAfG is structured into three phases. Firstly, the individual approximation of the knowledge of each decision maker into lower and upper approximation sets. Secondly, the outputs of the first phase are aggregated into a collective decision table. Thirdly, the inference of collective decision rules. The approach is illustrated through a series of case studies relative to credit worthiness of a set of European countries, heat islands exposition in the Québec Metropolitan Community in Canada and the management of post-accident nuclear risk in the Southern France region.

The DRSAfG approach presented in this paper addresses appropriately the shortcomings of existing works that we mentioned in Section 1: (i) it uses a mixed aggregation strategy to combine the judgements and perspectives of involved decision makers, which avoids the problems of input or output strategies used alone; (ii) it measures objectively the “powers” of decision makers based on their preferences; (iii) it combines the preference and knowledge of decision makers based on the majority principle and veto effect, which leads to more consensual and fairer decisions; (iv) it uses a reduced set of decision objects in order to extract and generalize the preferences of the decision makers thus minimizing their cognitive effort; and (v) it is enhanced with several tools permitting to compare final results obtained using different input parameters, which substantially improve the effectiveness of the decision making process and the successful implementation of the final solution.

Three main directions of research should be investigated in the future. The first direction concerns the use of the VC-DRSA (Greco et al., 2001c) or the method of Blaszczyński et al. (2007) instead of the conventional DRSA. The second direction of research is to use the input oriented strategy to combine the judgments and perspectives of decision makers by using some appropriate rules (such as maxmin, minmax or leximax criteria) or a distance/measure function and then apply the DRSA to infer the collective decision rules. The third direction of research concerns the exploration of the decision rule-related information to collectivity classify the decision objects by collecting the individual decision rules obtained from different decision makers and then the use of some appropriate metrics to remove redundant and contradictory decision rules.
