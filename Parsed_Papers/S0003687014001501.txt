                  Despite epidemiological evidence for kneeling as an occupational risk factor for knee osteoarthritis, biomechanical evidence is lacking. Gait knee joint mechanics, a common measure used to study knee osteoarthritis initiation, were used in the present study to investigate the effect of sustained static kneeling on the knee. Ten healthy male subjects (24.1 years ± 3.5) performed ten baseline walking trials, followed by a 30-min kneeling protocol and a second set of walking trials. Knee joint moments and angles were calculated during the stance phase. Within-subject root mean squared differences were compared within and between the pre- and post-kneeling gait trials. Differences were observed between the pre-kneeling and post-kneeling walking trails for flexion and adduction knee moments (0.12 Nm/kg ± 0.03, 0.07 Nm/kg ± 0.02) and angles (3.18° ± 1.22 and 1.64° ± 1.15), indicating that sustained static deep-knee flexion kneeling does acutely alter knee joint gait parameters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Osteoarthritis is considered the most common joint disorder (Arden and Nevitt, 2006), with the weight-bearing joints of the ankle, knee, hip, and back being the most frequently affected. Knee joint osteoarthritis (KOA), in particular, affects a large portion of the population and is the leading cause of chronic disability in the middle aged and elderly (Felson et al., 2000).

While KOA can result from acute traumatic injuries to the knee joint it also develops as the result of years of chronic, cumulative, mechanical insults to the cartilage (Baker et al., 2002; Ezzat et al., 2013). One hypothesized cause of KOA onset and progression is that the constant abnormal loading of the knee joint during activities of daily living, such as one's occupation, results in cumulative stress to the cartilage that are beyond the cartilage's tolerance limits (Thambyah et al., 2005) such that the body cannot repair any damaged cartilage (Andriacchi et al., 2004). Over time, the repeated insults reduce cartilage integrity and degeneration occurs. However, there is little information concerning both the modifiable risk factors and the biomechanical mechanisms responsible for KOA initiation (Felson, 1993; Rossignol, 2004).

Occupational postures have been identified as risk factors for KOA (e.g. Baker et al., 2002; Coggon et al., 2000; Miranda et al., 2002; Fransen et al., 2011), particularly for manual laborers, such as farmers, construction workers, carpenters, floor layers, and general blue collar workers (Cooper et al., 1994). These workers have twice the incidence rate of KOA as their non-manual worker counterparts (Rossignol et al., 2003). These higher incidence rates may be because manual workers typically have low task diversity resulting in more repetitive tasks (Rossignol et al., 2005). Manual workers are also more likely to endure greater joint stress due to their need to adopt awkward working postures and their exposure to high physical demands, such as manually handling heavy loads (Felson et al., 1991; Jensen, 2008). Kneeling, squatting, and stair climbing have also been identified as high risk activities for the development of KOA (Baker et al., 2002; Cooper et al., 1994; Jensen, 2008). Not surprisingly, years of work in knee straining occupations (Anderson et al., 2012) and measures of occupational cumulative knee joint loading (Ezzat et al., 2013) have been linked to higher incidents of KOA. Despite the growing body of epidemiological evidence that certain occupations place workers at a greater risk of KOA, biomechanical support for the link between occupational postures and KOA is lacking (Vignon et al., 2006). Occupational biomechanists now have the responsibility of examining these tasks to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the onset of KOA in these workers.

Two potential mechanisms are hypothesized for the relationship between kneeling and the onset of KOA (Fig. 1
                     ). First, deep-knee flexion kneeling alters the location of tibio-femoral contact location and increases the contact pressure on the cartilage (Wang et al., 2014). The direct loading at a single non-conditioned location during kneeling may over time initiate the biological processes associated with cartilage degeneration (Andriacchi et al., 2004). Second, the posterior displacement and external rotation of the tibia relative to the femur during deep-knee flexion kneeling places additional stress on the knee joint ligaments, particularly the PCL and MCL (Hofer et al., 2011). Based on these kneeling mechanics, we propose that sustained static deep-knee flexion kneeling alters joint control that can be seen in changes in the joint kinematics and kinetics and that these changes alter the expected joint loading pattern thereby adversely affecting joint integrity during subsequent activities.

This hypothesized mechanism is supported by research showing that a constant tibial load (200 N for men and 150 N for women) for a period of 10 min, at knee flexion angles of 35 and 90°, induced ligament creep in the human ACL and associated neuromuscular disorders, as demonstrated by 3–5 mm of tibial displacement and quadriceps and hamstring muscle spasms immediately following the protocol (Chu et al., 2003). Although the duration of residual creep was not reported in the study by Chu et al. (2003), Courville et al. (2005) showed that three cycles of work-to-rest ratio of 2:1, with 10 min of static lumbar flexion in felines, resulted in signs of a neuromuscular disorder and ligament creep lasting over 7 h. Additionally, prolonged static loads on ligaments induce acute inflammatory responses that lead to acute neuromuscular disorders and the associated injury risks (as reviewed by Solomonow, 2006). Additionally, the proposed pathway connecting occupational kneeling to the onset of KOA via knee instability (Fig. 1) is supported by Sharma (2001) and Andriacchi et al. (2004), who reported that decreased joint stability, as caused by ligament laxity, proprioceptive deficits, or neuromuscular impairments, is a risk factor for KOA.

Therefore, the anticipated post-kneeling change in joint motion, seen in the altered kinematics and kinetics during walking, although temporary after a single bout of prolonged kneeling but becoming more chronic with daily bouts of prolonged kneeling such as that experienced by workers in trades with frequent kneeling (Gaudreault et al., 2013), may reduce the joint's adaptive mechanisms or cause abnormal tibiofemoral joint loading patterns. Either of these outcomes may lead to joint damage during load-bearing tasks performed within a window of time after rising from a sustained kneeling posture. Since altered loading patterns at the knee joint during ambulation are a known risk factor for KOA (e.g. Andriacchi et al., 2004; Andriacchi and Mundermann, 2006; Chaudhari et al., 2008), the present exploratory investigation was designed to test for an acute effect of static kneeling on changes in knee kinematics and kinetics. This was achieved by examining changes in knee kinematics and kinetics during gait after three 10 min bouts of kneeling. It was expected that the stance-phase kinetic (knee adduction and flexion moments) and kinematic waveforms (knee adduction and flexion angles) would be altered as a result of the kneeling protocol. Such a finding would support the proposed pathway (Fig. 1), thus providing biomechanical evidence to support the pathogenesis of KOA through deep-knee flexion postures.

@&#METHODS@&#

Ten healthy male subjects (age: 24.1 years ± 3.5, height: 1.80 m ± 0.06, weight: 77.66 kg ± 7.68) with no history of knee injury volunteered for this study. Subjects were provided with a verbal and written explanation of the study's protocol followed by a tour of the experimental set-up. After this briefing, those wishing to continue with the study signed a consent form approved by the Queen's University Research Ethics Board.

Subjects were equipped with motion tracking markers to track the movement of their dominant lower limb as they walked over a force plate that recorded the ground reaction forces. The walkway was ten meters long, with the force plate centered along the walkway. Participants were asked to walk barefoot using their normal gait. Prior to testing, practice walking trials were performed to identify the approximate starting location that would increase the likelihood that the dominant foot would fall on the force plate. Two walking sessions were performed during the experiment: one before and one after a static kneeling protocol (Fig. 2
                        ). Each walking session consisted of ten walking trials at a self-selected normal speed along the walkway. After the first walking session, subjects performed three ten-minute cycles of static heels-down kneeling. When kneeling, participants were asked to sit on their heels, with their buttocks in contact with their heels as much as possible, such that they would be in a posture with the greatest amount of deep-knee flexion (Fig. 2). A foam pad was placed under the ankle to reduce any discomfort to this joint. In order to achieve a kneeling-to-rest ratio of 2:1, as has been used in previous ligament creep research (Courville et al., 2005), a five minute seated rest period was provided after each of the first two kneeling cycles. Upon completion of the final kneeling cycle, an additional rest period was provided that included one minute of seated rest, followed by equipment verification. The final ten walking trials were performed immediately thereafter.

Each subject's dominant leg and pelvis were instrumented with non-collinear infrared-emitting diode (IRED) clusters on rigid discs, which has shown to be a more reliable system than fixing the markers directly to the skin surface (Cappozzo et al., 1997; Manal et al., 2000). The discs, with three IREDs each, were placed on the lateral side of the dominant foot, shank, and thigh, and over the posterior pelvis and secured using neoprene bands and adhesive tape. Practice walking trials were performed to ensure no marker movement or neoprene band slippage. Virtual markers representing anatomical landmarks were recorded as the subject stood in a neutral posture. The anatomical landmarks included the head of the first and fifth metatarsals, the medial and lateral malleoli, and the medial and lateral epicondyles, as well as bilateral heads of the greater trochanter and anterior superior iliac spines.

Subjects performed the walking trials over a force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) embedded in the floor. Kinematic data were sampled at 75 Hz using the Optotrak Motion Tracking System (Northern Digital Inc., Ontario, Canada). A 16-channel Optotrak Data Acquisition Unit (Northern Digital Inc., Ontario, Canada) was used to sample the force plate data at 1000 Hz.

The ground reaction force and motion data were processed using Visual 3D software (Visual 3D, version 3.9, C-Motion Inc., MD, USA). The virtual markers from the anatomical landmarks were used to define the proximal and distal ends of their respective anatomical segments, creating the lower limb model for each subject. A second-order lowpass Butterworth filter was used to filter the kinematic (6 Hz cutoff) and kinetic (25 Hz cutoff) data. Euler angles were used to calculate the knee flexion angle and knee adduction angle, and inverse dynamics was used to calculate the external knee adduction moment and knee flexion moment (normalized to body mass). Visual 3D's automatic gait detection function extracted the data from the gait cycle stance phase that occurred over the force plate. This function used a threshold value of 5% of the peak vertical ground reaction force over a window of eight frames to identify the start (i.e. heel-strike) and end (i.e. toe-off) of the stance phase. The stance-phase waveforms were time normalized to 100% (See Fig. 3
                         for sample graphs).

For each outcome measure (knee flexion and adduction angle, and knee flexion and adduction moment) the within-subject root mean squared difference (RMSD) was calculated. For each subject the RMSD was calculated between the mean of all their trials and each trial, giving 10 RMSD values that were then averaged to give one RMSD measure for each subject. This was done for each gait condition (pre-kneeling, Eq. (1) and post-kneeling, Eq. (2)). A paired t-test compared the RMSD values calculated for each condition. This comparison examined the change in variation across the trials within a condition. Additionally, the RMSD was calculated between the mean of the pre-kneeling trials and each of the post-kneeling trials (Eq. (3)). A paired t-test compared the RMSD values calculated within the pre-kneeling condition (see above) and the RMSD calculated between the gait conditions. This comparison examined the difference in the mean curves across the two conditions.

Paired t-tests were also performed on each of the total gait cycle and stance phase times to assess differences between the pre- and post-kneeling walking trials.

@&#RESULTS@&#

No statistical difference was found between the RMSD calculated in the pre-kneeling condition compared to that calculated in the post-kneeling condition for the knee adduction angle, knee flexion moment and knee adduction moment (Fig. 4
                     ). This suggests that the trial-to-trial variance was similar in the pre-kneeling and post-kneeling gait conditions. However, a significant difference was observed in the RMSD between these two gait conditions for the knee flexion angle (p < 0.05), with an increase in RMSD in the post-kneeling gait. This indicates an increase in knee flexion angle variance in the post-kneeling gait condition. It is important to note the comparison does not address the shape of the waveforms, only their variance within each condition. To test for differences in waveform amplitudes, the waveforms from the post-kneeling gait condition were compared with the average waveform of the pre-kneeling gait condition (Fig. 3). The RMSD increased significantly for all outcome measures (p < 0.05) as a result of the kneeling protocol (Fig. 4). This indicates a significant difference in stance phase waveforms of the post-kneeling gait condition trials from the pre-kneeling gait condition. Overall, the variation, with the exception of the knee flexion moment, remained the same in both conditions, but there was a change in the waveforms after the kneeling intervention.

All post-kneeling gait trials were collected within an average time of 6.17 min (±1.30) following the end of the final kneeling session, including a post-kneeling rest period of 3.08 min (±0.93). No difference in total gait cycle time (pre-kneeling: 1.11sec ± 0.08, post-kneeling: 1.13sec ± 0.02; p > 0.05) or stance phase time (pre-kneeling: 0.68sec ± 0.05, post-kneeling: 0.69sec ± 0.07; p > 0.0) were recorded between walking sessions.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The results of the present study provide evidence of changes in kinetic and kinematic gait parameters resulting from prolonged static kneeling. More specifically, acute changes in stance-phase knee flexion and adduction moment and knee flexion and adduction angles during post-kneeling gait indicate altered kinetic and kinematic ambulatory loading patterns, which are known causes of the initiation of KOA (Chaudhari et al., 2008). Although our study was only intended to show an immediate acute change in gait parameters as a function of a 30-min sustained static kneeling protocol, recent work by Gaudreault et al. (2013) provides evidence in support of a chronic effect of knee-straining work activities on knee joint kinematics during gait. Gaudreault et al. (2013) showed that workers who engaged in 30 min or more of daily knee-straining work for over five years, compared to similarly aged controls engaged in non-knee-straining work, exhibited different knee flexion, adduction, and rotational angles in their gait profiles in a number of gait parameters, including total range of motion, minimum and maximum angles, and event-specific knee angles. Thus, it is feasible to deduce that our findings, which are at the acute level, may infer gait abnormalities at a more chronic level following cumulative occupational kneeling. Given that gait abnormalities have been shown to lead to the onset and progression of KOA (e.g. Andriacchi et al., 2004; Andriacchi and Mundermann, 2006; Chaudhari et al., 2008), the feasibility of our proposed pathway (Fig. 1) for the link between occupational kneeling activities and the onset of knee osteoarthritis is supported.

We have shown that the within-subject waveform variance does not change within conditions, but that there is a change in the post-kneeling gait relative to the pre-kneeling gait. This finding implies that the kneeling protocol caused changes severe enough to disrupt the viscoelastic structures of the knee joint. Support for this inference is found in deep-knee flexion (Park et al., 2005; Thambyah et al., 2005) and kneeling (Hofer et al., 2011) research demonstrating that structures including the PCL, MCL, LCL, meniscus, and cartilage have increased stress and strain as knee flexion increases. Furthermore, given that just minutes of stress and strain to ligaments can alter their integrity for hours (e.g. Chu et al., 2003; Courville et al., 2005; Sbriccoli et al., 2005), it is conceivable that the kneeling protocol acutely altered the integrity of the viscoelastic structures within the knee joint, and that this was responsible for the observed altered post-kneeling gait in our study. Indeed, Chu et al. (2003) reported that all 20 participants subjected to a 10-min ACL creep-inducing protocol experienced self-reported knee instability while walking 30 m immediately following the creep protocol. Our results complement these participant experiences (Chu et al., 2003) by showing differences in kinetic and kinematic gait profiles before and after a sustained static kneeling protocol where viscoelastic tissues were likely under strain and stress.

The gait parameter changes observed support the hypothesized model for the biomechanical relationship between prolonged static kneeling and KOA (Fig. 1). In this model, we hypothesize that structural changes occur to the viscoelastic structures within the knee joint as a result of the sustained static deep-knee flexion kneeling posture, and that these changes cause functional joint instability that manifests during gait as changes in knee joint kinetic and kinematic profiles. The association between functional joint instability, resulting from structural changes such as reduced anterior cruciate ligament integrity following injury, or age-related declines in ligament stiffness, muscle strength, and muscle activation, and KOA initiation has been discussed by Andriacchi et al. (2004) and Andriacchi and Mundermann (2006). The authors highlight that the critical factor in KOA initiation is the chronic or traumatic abnormal knee joint loading to a location on the cartilage that is not conditioned to receive the load. For KOA to be initiated, the cartilage must adapt negatively by wearing down rather than by adapting positively by thickening. Abnormal ambulatory knee joint parameters associated with KOA have been widely published, including: knee adduction moment (e.g. Deluzio and Astephen, 2007; Hurwitz et al., 1998; Kumar et al., 2013; Lewek et al., 2004; Schmitt and Rudolph, 2007; Sharma et al., 1998) and knee adduction angle (e.g. Schmitt and Rudolph, 2007), and knee flexion moment and angle (e.g. Deluzio and Astephen, 2007; Schmitt and Rudolph, 2007). In our protocol, these variables were each identified as changing between our pre- and post-kneeling gait conditions. Future work will need to explore more specifically how both frequent kneeling and greater cumulative kneeling affect the gait abnormalities observed at the knee joint, and how these relate to the pathomechanics of KOA.

This study had several limitations. While the RMSD measures allow for the comparison of the pre- and post-kneeling gait conditions, the results showed no predicable trends in the direction of the changes for any outcome measure. While most subjects demonstrated deviations from the pre-kneeling condition, there was neither a well-defined overall change nor a trend in the change for any outcome measure. This may be due, in part, to the fact that precise mechanics of deep knee flexion postures are subject-specific due to their dependency on bone geometry and size (Yao et al., 2008). These subject-specific posture differences could result in different tissue straining patterns within the knee joint, which ultimately alter the functional ability of the knee joint in post-kneeling activities in a likewise subject-specific way. Future work should include an analysis of the kneeling posture in order to test for both clinical significance in specific directional changes of the gait parameters, as was done by Gaudreault et al. (2013), as well as test for specific gait events and waveform characteristics that may distinguish between pre- and post-kneeling gait. Additional measures such as clinical measures of instability and knee laxity might also be considered.

Nonetheless, the KOA initiation model that is based on abnormal ambulation (Andriacchi et al., 2004; Andriacchi and Mundermann, 2006; Chaudhari et al., 2008) is not concerned with a particular direction of the altered loading patterns as a precursor to KOA. Rather, the model proposes that KOA will initiate when an area of cartilage that is unconditioned to the applied abnormal chronic or traumatic load fails to adapt in a healthy manner and begins to breakdown. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we were interested in determining that a change in the knee joint loading patterns existed during post-kneeling walking; as this change, in accordance with the above described KOA initiation model, may eventually precipitate cartilage breakdown and the possibility of KOA if performed repetitively. In contrast, without being able to conduct an in vivo study on the cartilage, the authors note that the observed abnormal gait profiles may also lead to positive adaptions and the associated protective cartilage thickening. Further classification of the participants' likelihood to experience a positive or negative cartilage adaptation as a result of the kneeling protocol is beyond the scope of this study, but should be investigated in the future.

Given the relatively short duration of the kneeling protocol compared to that experienced by a worker who engages in daily kneeling, our study was not designed to identify clinically significant gait parameter differences, only differences in gait parameters that are commonly associated with the onset of KOA. Now that this exploratory study has determined that gait parameter differences exist between pre- and post-kneeling walking, future work is needed to explore what duration of kneeling will elicit the alterations in post-kneeling knee joint mechanics that would more conclusively result in the negative cartilage adaptation process associated with KOA onset. Additionally, the effect of recovery between bouts of kneeling and days of rest will also need to be considered in future studies in order to determine the cumulative effects of kneeling on the knee joint. Furthermore, a protocol that captured sequential gait cycles, rather than a single gait cycle along a 10 m walkway as was done in the present study, would enable the measurement of recovery following the kneeling protocol.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The results from the present study suggest that the sustained static kneeling protocol used compromises the integrity of the knee joint in such a way as to acutely alter the loading patterns at the knee joint during subsequent ambulation. In order for long-term deleterious effects on the cartilage to occur, chronic abnormal loading over the unconditioned areas must occur. This is one of the premises supporting our hypothesized model for the relationship between occupational kneeling and KOA (Fig. 1). In order to more accurately conclude that the results from the present study suggest a potential mechanism by which kneeling may be a risk factor for KOA, both the duration of the effects of the prolonged static kneeling protocol following a single bout of kneeling as well as the required cumulative threshold for daily kneeling would need to be quantified. Therefore, the applications of the current results are limited. They do, however, serve as a starting point for future investigations.

Finally, once we have a achieved a better understanding of the mechanisms by which occupational deep knee flexion postures are related to KOA, we can turn our focus towards designing ergonomic interventions to ensure that safe working postures are adopted by those in knee-straining occupations. With no long-term cures available for KOA and incidence rates on the rise, working towards preventing the disease is a much more efficient use of our resources. However, there is still much to be learned about the pathomechanics of KOA. This exploratory study has offered some insight into the occupational risk factors for KOA and suggests future investigations.
