                  Design of optimal filters is an essential part of signal processing applications. It involves the computation of optimal filter coefficients such that the designed filter response possesses a flat passband and up to an infinite amount of stopband attenuation. This study investigates the effectiveness of employing the swarm intelligence (SI) based and population-based evolutionary computing techniques in determining and comparing the optimal solutions to the FIR filter design problem. The nature inspired optimization techniques applied are cuckoo search, particle swarm and real-coded genetic algorithm using which the FIR highpass (HP) and bandstop (BS) optimal filters are designed. These filters are examined for the stopband attenuation, passband ripples and the deviation from desired response. Moreover, the employed optimization techniques are compared on the field of algorithm execution time, t-test, convergence rate and obtaining global optimal results for the design of digital FIR filters. The results reveal that the proposed FIR filter design approach using cuckoo search algorithm outperforms other techniques in terms of design accuracy, execution time and optimal solution.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Filtering is the most extensively used complex process in signal processing. Filters in digital signal processing allow reforming the spectrum of the input signal to achieve the desired spectral characteristics in the output signal. Digital filters are widely accepted due to their linear phase characteristics, precision in performance, thermal stability, adaptability using a programmable processor, multiplexing, data logging and perfect reproducibility. They can be designed in hardware as well as software platforms and can process both real-time and stored signals. The digital filters are divided into two categories, namely FIR and IIR filters. FIR filters are preferred in applications with requirement of no phase distortion. Moreover, FIR filters are inherently stable systems, and are less sensitive to finite word length effect. Whereas, IIR filters involves less coefficients, requires less memory and are implemented when the requirements are of sharp cut-off and high throughput with lower computational complexity [1].

The applications of digital filters are widespread. In communication systems, digital filters play a significant role in eliminating spectral leakage, reducing channel width, and eliminating interference (known as inter symbol interference, ISI) from adjacent symbols. Also, digital filter banks are increasingly employed in both wired and wireless communication systems [2]. Speech synthesis and analysis is another field where digital filters find applications [3]. In image processing applications, digital filters are selected to improve the quality of a distorted image containing regions with different characteristics [4]. Another important application of digital filters is to remove random noises in seismic data [5]. Digital filters are applied in the processing of biomedical signals such as ECG, EEG, MRI images and are incorporated in the life saving machines [6]. Research is made on the biological method for speech recognition and an artificial cochlea is modeled using the digital filters [7].

The process of designing digital filters can be characterized as an optimization problem with an objective of minimizing the error function. This error function is basically an approximation function which indicates the deviation of the designed filter from the desired response. Further, each requirement can contribute with a mathematical term forming as a constraint optimization problem. Traditionally, different techniques exist for the design and implementation of the digital FIR filters [8]. The most straightforward way of implementing a digital filter is the windowing method. In this method, based on the requirements of limitation on the ripples in passband and stopband, transition width and stopband attenuation, different window function (Hamming, Kaiser, etc.) is selected. Another frequently used method to obtain an optimum filter is the least squares (LS) based technique which approximates the error function in the form of L
                     2-norm. To avoid the overshoots in the filter response at discontinuities produced by LS approach, minimax technique is adopted. It approximates the Chebyshev error which is based on the L
                     ∞-norm and produces an equiripple filter. A relatively new approximation technique based on the L
                     1-norm approximation of the error function for the design of FIR filters was devised in 2007 [9]. The filters based on L
                     1-error approximation yield a flatter response in the passband and high attenuation in the stopband as compared to the LS and minimax techniques [10]. However, there are some drawbacks associated with these classical gradient based optimization techniques. In order to optimize multiple objectives in a single problem, these algorithms are discovered unfit. Further, they require fine tuning of parameters for fast and global convergence. Therefore, intelligent search paradigms and optimization methods were developed with which multiple objectives can be achieved in short computation time and with high accuracy [11].

Based on the concepts of natural selection and evolution, heuristic evolutionary optimization algorithms have been developed and utilized by the researchers [12,13]. In 1975, genetic algorithm (GA) was introduced which is a general purpose probabilistic search algorithms inspired by natural genetic populations to evolve solutions with a great measure of success in search and optimization problems. Since then, a lot of research is done for the design of optimal filters using GA and its variants [14,15]. Another probabilistic method, simulated annealing (SA) was proposed in 1983, used to obtain the global minima of a cost function [16]. In 1995, a robust population-based stochastic search technique utilizing the swarm intelligent behavior was developed, known as the particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO ensures global solutions and is capable of handling non-differentiable and multi-objective functions [17–21]. Differential evolution (DE) is another stochastic, population-based optimization method developed in 1996. FIR filter design methods based on the DE algorithm are described in [22]. Other bio-inspired algorithm includes artificial bee colony optimization (ABC) introduced in 2007, which is more diverse and utilizes interesting characteristics and intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarm in the search of food [23]. One of the latest nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization techniques, developed in 2009, is the cuckoo-search algorithm (CSA). Recent research reveals that CSA is the most efficient optimization technique that can be applied for solving structural engineering problems compared to other nature-inspired algorithms [24].

Some of the unique features of CSA [25] had made it very popular in a short span of time for optimization problems. These are summarized as following: (i) the parameter requirement in CSA is less as compared with other nature inspired optimization algorithms. (ii) With the elite behavior of cuckoo birds, the best solution always remains in the search space. (iii) The fine-tuning of parameters is not required in CSA. Furthermore, the convergence rate is independent of most of the parameters. (iv) Moreover, cuckoo search is more generalized as well as a robust algorithm for many optimization problems. (iv) CSA in combination with Lévy flight makes it possible to search for all the optima in a problem space for any multimodal functions. In a very short duration, CSA is being implemented on various kinds of optimization problems and is outperforming the other nature inspired optimization algorithms. Its applications includes: engineering design problems such as welded beam design, spring design optimization [26], structural engineering optimization problems such as cantilever beam design, corrugated bulkhead design, tubular column design, parameter identification of structures [24], optimization of PCB track length, robotics manipulator [27], annual crop planning problem [28], quadrature mirror filter bank design with fractional derivative constraints [29] design of fractional order differentiator [30].

In this paper, the comprehensive and integrated study of CSA is exercised in order to design an FIR HP and BS filter. These filters can be transformed applying the similar design method in order to design other FIR filters (LP and BP). The design of an optimal filter involves the computation of such filter coefficients that produce the filter response with low magnitude ripples in the passband along with high attenuation in the stopband. This is obtained by the coefficients calculated through CSA. The designs are analyzed and presented in comparison with other bio-inspired optimization techniques PSO and real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA).

Following is the structure of this paper. The mathematical problem formulation for the FIR filter design is described in Section 2. Section 3 focuses on the employed algorithms for the design of FIR filter and the problem specific implementation of the employed algorithms is described. The results and analysis of the simulations performed is demonstrated in Section 4. The progress report of CSA over other algorithms and comparison of the performance of FIR filters is also covered in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws the conclusion of the complete work.

In this paper, the error function given in Eqs. (6) and (7) is employed as the objective function. The objective function is evaluated by the optimization algorithms at each iteration while substituting the filter coefficients explored from the search space. Constructing it as a minimization problem, this function is minimized using the CSA, PSO and RCGA optimization techniques and the corresponding optimized symmetric filter coefficients are used for the design of linear phase FIR HP and BS filters.

In this section, the use of natural evolutionary systems as computational processes is presented which are applied for solving the complex problem of FIR filter design. The study of these techniques is interesting and is still attracting the researchers since small variations in these algorithms leads to great solutions. The SI-based optimization algorithms are flexible, versatile and can work on nonlinear design problems very efficiently with real-world applications. The employed algorithms in this work, CSA, PSO and RCGA are briefly described below.

CSA is a mathematical conceptualization which simulates the breeding strategy of the cuckoo birds. It is developed in 2009 [25]. It is based on the unique parasitism of some cuckoo bird species in combination with the Lévy flight behavior of some birds. These bird species aggressively reproduce and lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. The host birds sometimes belligerently throw away the foreign eggs to increase the probability of hatching their own eggs. Whereas, some host birds simply abandon their nests and build a new nest at a new location. In CSA, each cuckoo egg in the host's nest symbolizes to a potential solution of the design problem. Each solution is characterized by its fitness value. The objective of CSA is to exchange a low fitness value solution with a better solution iteratively. In the process of generating a new solution, the concept of random walk performed by Lévy flights is applied. In this, the next step of the random walk is based on the current location (solution) and the transition probability to the next location. The direction and the step length it chooses can be modeled mathematically depending upon various factors.

In order to simplify the algorithm, it is governed by three guiding rules. (i) Each bird is allowed to lay only one egg at once, which is randomly placed among the host bird's nests. (ii) The nest with the high quality eggs (solutions with high fitness values) will be imparted over to the next generation. (iii) A predetermined number of host nests are available, in which the probability of identification of alien eggs by host birds is also fixed (P
                           
                              a
                           
                           ∈[0, 1]). In instance of discovery, the host bird can either throw the alien egg or abandon the nest.

This algorithm is formulated for optimal results by making a balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space. An exploiting local random walk and the explorative global random walk is performed using the controlling parameter p

The steps adopted for the implementation of CSA for the FIR filter design problem are summarized. The error objective functions (fitness function) defined in Eqs. (6) and (7) for the design of FIR HP and BS filters, respectively, are evaluated at each iteration for all the possible solutions. The optimal solution of this problem is to achieve N
                           +1 symmetric filter coefficients in order to design a Nth order FIR filter. This is ensured by specifying the condition of symmetry on the coefficients to be optimized which states that h(n)=
                           h(N

The social behavior of certain animals within a team such as fish schooling, insect swarming and bird flocking is transformed into an artificial swarm and is mathematically modeled as the PSO algorithm. It is a robust, population-based stochastic search technique, which is also suitable for non-differentiable and multiple objective functions. It was developed in 1995 [31], and is successfully being applied to many optimization problems. In this algorithm, each particle acts as agent and is a potential solution. It is characterized by its position in the solution space and velocity with which it moves towards the optimal solution evaluated by the best (least) fitness value. At each iteration, all the particles are attracted towards the position of the current global best location. The velocity of the particle (say i) in the current iteration (let l), is adapted by evaluating the sum of three terms: the global best position vector, gbest, its personal best value, pbest and the particle's present velocity,

Genetic algorithm is the most former evolutionary computing technique. It is based on the genetic evolving system in living beings [32]. The approach of GA uses the string representation for individuals along with the string-oriented reproductive operators to procreate offsprings. The standard GA encoded the binary strings which reduces the precision level. While using RCGA, the chromosomes are represented with real values, and higher precision optimization problems are solved using the real-coded GA. The process of coding and decoding of binary values is avoided, thus improving the speed of operation, efficiency and precision in results. The mutation operator flips the bits of the string with fixed probability, and recombines using the crossover operator. To produce offsprings with characteristics of both the parents, a randomly selected initial sequence of genes from one of the parent is merged with the remaining sequence of genes from the other one. The three important processes carried in RCGA are: selection, it chooses the better individual genotype chromosome evaluating their fitness; crossover, it combines the two fitted chromosomes to produce a new generation chromosomes which may have a better fitness; mutation, it make small random variations in the bit strings to provide diversity. RCGA is a robust search procedure, which can be applied to a broader range of parameter optimization problems.

The procedure for the design of RCGA based FIR HP and BS filter is summarized. The lower and upper bounds, selection operator and the mutation rate values are set after performing several simulation runs to impart appropriate results.
                              
                                 Step 1:
                                 Initialize the population size as 100. Adjust the upper and lower bound values of the unknown coefficient values as −1 and +1, respectively. Select an initial random solution set of the chromosome strings.

Use the tournament operator for parent selection. It carries out a tournament amongst the competitors (tournament size: 6) evaluating their fitness values. This selection improves the fitness of each succeeding generation, thus is considered as best.

Specify elite count at 2. This count denotes the number of genes which are best fitted and guarantee their survival to the next generation, thus decreasing the error fitness values from the minimum value.

Crossover is applied between the two selected chromosomes. The heuristic crossover operator uses the two fitness values and determines the direction towards a better solution and produce offsprings. Finally, the adaptive feasible mutation randomly makes some alterations which is also adaptive with respect to the last generation.

With the iterations, fitness function is evaluated for each set of coefficients and the least fitted coefficients are unexpended.

The iteration terminates either with the convergence of minimum error function or if the maximum number of generations, i.e., 1000 has reached. The best fitted chromosome string gives the optimal filter coefficients and corresponding HP and BS filters are designed.

Here, the employed algorithms are compared on the basis of their exploitation and exploration capabilities, controlling parameters selection, computational complexity and convergence rate. The technique RCGA provides diversity (exploration) for new solutions with crossover and mutation, however, mutation may drift away the solutions with converged characteristics. The selection process in RCGA is the essence for algorithm convergence by selecting only the fitter solutions and discarding the unfit solutions gradually. The PSO algorithm mainly consists of the mutation and selection processes which provide exploration capability with high mobility in the particles. The use of gbest variable has an advantage of high speed of convergence as well as the disadvantage of premature convergence since it misleads if the global optimal solution is not selected. Finally, CSA is observed to be advantageous over RCGA as well as PSO with its exploitation and exploration capabilities. It is explored in the past research that RCGA and PSO are incapable to guarantee global convergence of the algorithms [12,13]. Whereas, the updating equation (Eq. (9)) of CSA can satisfy the global convergence requirements and thus premature convergence is avoided in CSA. Moreover, the local search and global search in CSA is controlled by p
                        
                           a
                         with which a balance is maintained between these characteristics to achieve good performance. The efficiency of CSA is highly improved with the Lévy flight exploration as compared to standard random walks or Gaussian processes. Furthermore, the complexity of the algorithms are counted upon their execution time (compared in the next section) and the applications of CSA demonstrates a fast convergence with lesser algorithm execution time as compared to RCGA and PSO.

The setting of algorithm control parameters is a challenging task. It is itself an optimization problem and the performance of the algorithm can be greatly influenced for a specific problem. Intrinsically, there is no explicit method available in the literature for the fine tuning of parameters. Researchers performs extensive simulations with different sets of parameter values within their specified range. Thus, similar methodology is employed in this work while performing loads of simulations with slight variations in the control parameters’ values within the specified range provided in the literature [13].

In this paper, parameters of each algorithm are chosen after multiple simulations from the range suggested in the previous literatures. The control parameters for all the algorithms selected for the filter design process are given in Table 1
                        . For RCGA, the selection process is performed by the tournament operator (size of 6) which increases the efficiency as it selects the best individual by creating a selection pressure. The suggested crossover probability is in the range 0.6–0.95 and it is set to 0.8, since the algorithm was found to converge in a large number of iterations below this value and converged prematurely with the increase in crossover rate. The mutation probability ranges from 0.001 to 0.05. Less perturbation is achieved in the solution for low values whereas high diversity is offered with high mutation rate. The mutation rate of 0.01 is fixed in this work to enhance the exploration capability. For PSO algorithm, the social and cognitive learning parameters are set at 2 for an efficient exploration performance. The range of particle velocity is found to be in between [0, 1]. The optimal results are obtained with the inertia weight factor, W
                        =0.4, with which the algorithm is observed to converge quickly. The success rate of CSA is more due to its dependency on few parameters. It is found that no fine tuning is required and CSA is not sensitive to any adjustment in p
                        
                           a
                         and n
                        
                           c
                         
                        [13]. For p
                        
                           a
                        
                        =0.25, 1/4 of the search time is fixed for the exploitation process and the rest for exploration of the search space for global solution. This guarantees the global optimality condition with higher probability.

The performance of the designed FIR filters using different evolutionary algorithms (EA) is evaluated by means of filter function, efficiency and algorithm execution time. Simulations are carried on MATLAB using Intel Core i5, 2.53Ghz, 4GB RAM. Results reported here are obtained as best after performing around 60 simulation trails with random alterations in the parameters. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimally designed filter using CSA and other EA, the standard Parks McClellan's (PM) technique, used to design the equiripple filters is also employed for comparison. The set of solution for which the minimum fitness value is achieved is recorded as the optimal solution. The controlling parameters of the three algorithms, CSA, PSO and RCGA are mentioned in Table 1. In order to ensure fairness in the operation of the heuristic algorithms, the desired filter specifications were kept same, and the algorithm specific parameters were fixed according to the recommended settings.


                     High-pass FIR filter: The design specifications are as follows, filter order, N
                     =20 and cut-off frequency, ω
                     
                        c
                     
                     =0.43π. The objective function for the employed algorithms is expressed in Eq. (6), which is evaluated at each iteration for the optimal solution. The lower and upper limit for the filter coefficients is set to −1 and +1. The optimal coefficients obtained for the 20th order FIR HP filter using PM, RCGA, PSO and CSA techniques are reported in Table 2
                     .

The graphical comparison of the magnitude response in dB is shown in Fig. 2
                     . The plot clearly depicts that CSA has the highest capability of attenuating signal in stopband. To more accurately visualize the performance of all the four employed algorithms, the stopband is magnified and shown in Fig. 3
                     . The filters are mainly characterized by the magnitude of minimum stopband attenuation (A
                     stop) and the maximum passband attenuation (A
                     pass). These measures are given in Table 3
                     . It is observed that the CSA yields the minimum stopband attenuation of −28.80dB in comparison to PSO (−21.63dB), RCGA (−17.90dB) and PM (−15.60dB). Moreover, the maximum A
                     pass for CSA is 0.02dB, which is least amongst all. From Table 3, it is observed that the execution time of CSA is least. This is due to the involvement of less number of parameters in the algorithm, along with the independence of most of parameters to the convergence rate. Table 4
                      lists the A
                     stop profile of the designed filters by examining the mean, variance and standard deviation from the ideal response. The mean value to the lowest degree for the CSA filter signifies the consistency of the performance in the stopband region.

In Fig. 4
                     , the normalized magnitude response of designed filters is plotted. It is seen from the plot that CSA delivers least overshoot at the discontinuity of the ideal filter whereas PM produces the highest. RCGA and PSO give rise to a moderate and almost same magnitude of overshoot. This portion of the response is enlarged and shown in Fig. 5
                     . It shows that CSA based filter yields the flattest passband. These observations are vascularized and analyzed by computing the mean, variance and standard deviation of the passband ripples in Table 5
                     . The maximum normalized passband ripple for the CSA filter is 1.0096, which makes the overshoot of 0.009% above the ideal response. Furthermore, the maximum and average values of stopband ripple are complied in Table 6
                     . In the field of transition width, it is observed that the filter designed using PM techniques approaches towards the ideal, whereas CSA based filter possesses slightly higher transition width.


                     Band-stop FIR filter: The design specifications are as follows, filter order, N
                     =20 and cut-off frequencies,

                        π
                     . Fitness function defined in Eq. (7) is valuated for optimal design of FIR BS filter. The optimal filter coefficients are limited to a maximum value of +1 and minimum of −1. The optimal coefficients obtained for the 20th order FIR BS filter using PM, RCGA, PSO and CSA techniques are reported in Table 7
                     . The comparative analysis is presented below.

The magnitude response in dB of the BS filters designed using PM, RCGA, PSO and CSA is shown in Fig. 6
                     . The A
                     stop is −28.19dB and A
                     pass is 0.320 (normalized), in the CSA based filter. These filter characteristics are favorable as evident from Fig. 7
                      and are reported in Table 8
                     . The computation time of CSA is much less than other mentioned algorithms. In Table 9
                     , the statistical analysis of the stopband is computed and presented. The A
                     stop profile of CSA based results are found better.


                     Figs. 8 and 9
                     
                      show the normalized magnitude response of the BS filters. This indicates the flat response of CSA based filter in passband. From Table 10
                     , it can be observed that the maximum normalized passband ripple for the proposed CSA based BS filter has a difference of 0.12 from the filter designed with PM technique, 0.063 from the RCGA based filter and 0.044 from the PSO applied filter. The mean, variance and standard deviation measured for the passband response is ascertained to be least for the CSA based filter. Thus, it can be concluded that it offers the flattest response to the passing signal compared to all other techniques. Moreover, in Table 11
                      other statistics concluded from the filter response are accounted. The calculated normalized mean and maximum stopband ripples for the proposed CSA based filter are with the smallest magnitude, hence can provide high attenuation required in most of the application. Further, while comparing the stopband width of all the design techniques with the ideal width, the filter using RCGA was found approaching towards accuracy. Also, in terms of the stopband width the performance of PSO was slightly better than CSA. To judge upon the overall prosecution of CSA with its application to design the digital filter, the amendments in presented designs are described in the next section.

A statistical examination known as t-test results are reported in Table 12
                     . The t-test is a hypothetical testing method that indicates the statistical significance of the difference between the two sets of samples under consideration. The t-test results are evaluated using the following formula:

                        b
                      are the number of samples evaluated for the respective technique. Here, the t-test results are computed for the mean and standard deviation values of both passband and stopband. This test is more relevant than calculating mean for any distribution. It is due to the fact that for different distributions also, identical mean results can exist. Whereas t-testing is capable of providing the correct outcome in such cases. CSA is considered here as algorithm a as reference. The test is performed for both PSO and RCGA taken as algorithm b individually. High positive t-result denotes the goodness of reference result over the comparing results and vice-versa. The high positive results obtained for passband and stopband ripples for both HP and BS filters, indicates the optimum results of the CSA technique.

Finally, to demonstrate the effective comparison in terms of the optimized error fitness values and algorithm convergence time, the convergence profile of CSA, PSO and RCGA is plotted in Fig. 10
                     . The plot is shown here for the design of 20th order HP filter. The result reveals that CSA converges to the minimum fitness value. Besides this, among the three techniques, CSA optimizes the error to the least value at any iteration. Highest convergence rate and lesser execution time indicates a low computational complexity of CSA in the digital FIR filter design problem. Similar results are procured for BS filter, and are not shown here. Hence, for this design problem CSA can be applied with less number of iteration cycles to obtain the optimal solutions.

This section presents the anatomy of designed filters in detail which bring in advancements in the designed filter using CSA over filters designed using PSO and RCGA. The percentage improvement in various filter characteristics of the CSA design over others is represented in form of bar chart in Fig. 11
                         for the HP filter. It portrays that the CSA based HP filter features with a betterment of 61% and 33% over RCGA and PSO based filter, respectively for the minimum stopband attenuation. Counting on the highest ripple developed, it shows the amendment of 9.3% and 9.7% over the RCGA and PSO design respectively. Further, computing the absolute relative magnitude error expressed in Eq. (6), CSA outperforms with the improvement of 26% and 33% over the other two filters. Finally, the major advancement in the filter design process is noticed when the algorithm execution time was compared. CSA converges much faster and terminates to an optimal solution with 86% and 80% less duration than RCGA and PSO, respectively.

On similar fields, the bar chart presentation for the percentage improvement observed in CSA design for the BS filter is plotted in Fig. 12
                        . It interprets that the proposed BS filter using CSA exhibit a substantial progression of 59% and 68% on the minimum A
                        stop using RCGA and PSO, respectively. Similar elevation in the results of relative magnitude error can be noticed with around 40% betterment in the projected CSA design. With slight improvement in the passband ripples, CSA based filter guarantees added flatness. Lastly, a phenomenal advancement is testified with the application of CSA for its execution time. Hence, the same length filter is efficiently designed with 85% and 80% less time than RCGA and PSO, respectively. Thus, the overall improvement accounted for the HP and BS filter design using the cuckoo-search optimization techniques is extremely significant and the proposed filters can be implemented in loads of applications with a considerable amount of accuracy.

                         lists the performance characteristics of the designed filter using different optimization techniques. The measurements on the basis of minimum stopband attenuation (dB), maximum passband ripple (normalized), transition width and computational time (s), reported in the respective literatures are presented. The overall performance of the proposed filter designed using CSA, is better as compared to the GA [18], PSO [18], adaptive GA (AGA) [14] and craziness based PSO (CRPSO) [19,20].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, the performance of designed FIR HP and BS filters using different metaheuristic algorithms namely, RCGA, PSO and CSA is addressed. The design aims at determining such optimal filter coefficients that minimizes its absolute relative error with the desired filter response. The observed solution develops an efficient design fulfilling the requirements of high attenuation in stopband and a flat response in the passband of a digital filter. In order to design the LP and BP filters, transformations can be applied to the proposed design method.

On performing the comparison among three optimization techniques on the same platform and with similar specifications, CSA delivered the best solution. The CSA based filter achieved the smallest design error and demonstrates the best performance in terms of magnitude response with high stopband attenuation, minimum passband and stopband ripples on almost same transition width and lowest execution time. The superiority in the functionality of CSA over PSO and RCGA is because its implementation is based on very few parameter adjustments which considerably increases the convergence rate, thus, reduces the execution time and the optimal solution is achieved with a good balance of exploitation and exploitation. The reported execution time and convergence profile for the proposed CSA based design ensures that in the required time frame it can effectively compute the optimal solutions for the practical applications. Further this leads to more flexibility in designing the FIR filter with the absence of fine-tuning of parameters. Moreover, the CSA eliminates premature convergence exhibited by other EAs. Thus, it is concluded that CSA is the best heuristic algorithm in this area of research.

Currently, we are working on the problem of system identification employing CSA and optimize results in order to obtain the reduce filter length. As future plans, the design of Hilbert transformer and optimize 2-D filter coefficients for the application of image processing will be considered.
