                  A quaternion rational surface is a surface generated from two rational space curves by quaternion multiplication. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how to apply syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. We show that we can easily construct three special syzygies for a quaternion rational surface from a μ-basis for one of the generating rational space curves. The implicit equation of any quaternion rational surface can be computed from these three special syzygies and inversion formulas for the non-singular points on quaternion rational surfaces can be constructed. Quaternion rational ruled surfaces are generated from the quaternion product of a straight line and a rational space curve. We investigate special μ-bases for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and use these special μ-bases to provide implicitization and inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces. Finally, we show how to determine if a real rational surface is also a quaternion rational surface.

A quaternion rational surface is a special real rational surface constructed from two rational space curves by quaternion multiplication. This construction allows us to change the location, orientation, and shape of a rational surface by manipulating two simple curves that generate the surface. Moreover, rotating each curve that generates the surface by a constant angle θ about a fixed axis through the origin will rotate the entire surface by the same constant angle θ about the same fixed axis through the origin (see Section 4). Examples include the Möbius strip, generated from the quaternion product of a line and a circle; pipelike surfaces, generated from the quaternion product of a circle and a rational curve; and a masklike surface, generated from the quaternion product of two non-coplanar circles—see Section 4 for further details.

There is another method for generating special rational curves and surfaces by quaternion multiplication. R. Krasauskas and S. Zube construct quaternion rational curves and surfaces by allowing quaternion weights as well as quaternion control points in classical rational Bézier curves and surfaces [15,24]. They show that Bézier patches on Dupin cyclides can be generated in this manner. This quaternion technique is an extension to 3-dimensions of complex rational Bézier curves, which are the quotients of two complex valued functions in Bézier form constructed using complex control points and complex weights [17,23]. These quaternion rational curves and surfaces are invariant under Möbius transformations. However, it is not so easy to construct rational curves and surfaces in 3-dimensions using this quaternion approach, since the quaternion weights and quaternion control points cannot be freely chosen. In contrast, in our approach there is no constraint on the rational space curves whose quaternion products generate our quaternion rational surfaces. Moreover, our quaternion rational surfaces are invariant under double isoclinic rotations of

                      (see Section 4 for further details).

The goal of this paper is to show how to apply syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. It is difficult to find syzygies, and especially μ-bases, for general rational surfaces [10]. Computing the implicit equation for a general rational surface from a μ-basis is still an open problem [4]. However, there is a simple relation between syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces and syzygies of the corresponding rational space curves that generate these surfaces. Based on this relation, syzygies for quaternion rational surfaces can be calculated easily. Indeed, we can get three special syzygies for any quaternion rational surface from a μ-basis of one of the corresponding rational space curves. Moreover, these three syzygies can be used to compute the implicit equation, to construct inverse formulas and to calculate all the singularities of the quaternion rational surface.

A quaternion rational ruled surface is a particular quaternion rational surface constructed from the quaternion product of a straight line and a rational space curve. Unlike the computation of μ-bases for general rational ruled surfaces [7], we show that μ-bases for quaternion rational ruled surfaces can be calculated directly without performing any Gaussian elimination. We then use these special μ-bases to compute the implicit equations as well as simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces.

This paper is organized in the following fashion. We begin in Section 2 by recalling some preliminary results about syzygies for rational space curves and rational surfaces. In Section 3 we review some basic facts about quaternions and in Section 4 we define quaternion rational surfaces and we provide some interesting examples of such surfaces. We show in Section 5 that syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces can be calculated from syzygies of the rational space curves that generate these surfaces. We build a sparse resultant matrix in Section 6 for three of these syzygies generated from a μ-basis for one of the rational space curves that generate this surface, and we prove that the determinant of this sparse resultant matrix is the exact implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface without any extraneous factors. We also use ratios of subdeterminants of this sparse resultant matrix to construct inversion formulas for the non-singular points on quaternion rational surfaces. Section 7 is devoted to the study of singularities on quaternion rational surfaces. In Section 8, we investigate μ-bases that are easy to construct for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and we show how to use these special μ-bases to compute implicit equations and simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces. We give necessary and sufficient conditions in Section 9 for a real rational surface to be a quaternion rational surface — that is, for a real rational surface to be the quaternion product of two rational space curves. We also include two appendices. In Appendix A, we discuss three equivalent notions of singularities of order r on rational surfaces of degree n. In Appendix B, we provide an example to illustrate how to compute all the singularities on a quaternion rational surface.

We begin with a brief review for the uninitiated of syzygies and μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces. Knowledgeable readers may skip this section.

One of the important properties of μ-bases concerns their outer product. Consider three vectors

                         be the set of all syzygies of S(s, t). It is known that syz(S(s, t)) is a free module over R[s, t] with a basis consisting of three elements [4].

Geometrically, any syzygy l(s, t) of S(s, t) can be interpreted as a moving plane

Actually any basis of the syzygy module syz(S(s, t)) is a μ-basis of the rational surface S(s, t) (see Corollary 3.1 in [4] for more details). Unlike Definition 1 of μ-bases for rational space curves, Definition 4 has no limitation on the degree for a μ-basis of a rational surface since the homogeneous syzygy modules of rational surfaces are no longer free. Moreover, unlike for rational space curves, we still lack an efficient algorithm for computing μ-bases for rational surfaces [10]. In addition, an efficient algorithm for calculating the implicit equation for a rational surface from a μ-basis is still an open problem.

A rational ruled surface is a rational surface of bi-degree (1, n) which is defined in homogeneous form

Before we can introduce quaternion rational surfaces, we first need to recall some basic facts about quaternions. For further information about the theory and applications of quaternions, see [1,12,13,20].

                     Therefore, rotating the curves p(s), q(t) by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N will also rotate the quaternion rational surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N.

The quaternion rational surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) has bi-degree (m, n). This surface has no base points. A base point of a rational surface P(s, t) is a pair of parameter values (s

                     So quaternion rational surfaces have no base points. Therefore, the degree of the implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) is 2mn.

Next we provide some interesting examples of quaternion rational surfaces.

Quaternion rational surfaces are special rational parametric surfaces, constructed from two rational space curves through quaternion multiplication. We are going to use syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. To find syzygies for quaternion rational surfaces, we begin with the following lemma.
                        Lemma 8
                        
                           m(s) is a syzygy of 
                           p(s) if and only if Re(m(s)
                              ⋆p(s)*) ≡ 0. Similarly, l(s, t) is a syzygy of 
                           P(s, t) if and only if Re(l(s, t)
                              ⋆P(s, t)*) ≡ 0.

These results follow directly from Eq. (3). □

Based on Lemma 8, we get a simple relation between syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces and syzygies of the corresponding rational space curves.
                        Theorem 9
                        
                           Let 
                           m(s) be a syzygy of 
                           p(s). Then 
                           m(s)
                              ⋆q(t) is a syzygy of 
                           p(s)
                              ⋆q(t).

Since m(s) is a syzygy of p(s), it follows by Lemma 8 that Re(m(s)
                              ⋆p(s)*) ≡ 0. Hence by Eqs. (2) and (4),

                      cannot be expressed in the form m(s)
                        ⋆q(t). Nevertheless we shall see shortly that the syzygies m
                     0(s)
                        ⋆q(t), m

                     2(s)
                        ⋆q(t) behave much like a μ-basis for the surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t).

To see how, recall that we use [r
                     0, r
                     1, r
                     2] to denote the outer product of the vectors r
                     0, r
                     1, r
                     2. For brevity, let [r, r
                     0, r
                     1, r
                     2] denote the determinant of the 
                        
                           4
                           ×
                           
                           4
                        
                      matrix (r, r
                     0, r
                     1, r
                     2). Expanding by cofactors of the first column, it follows that

                         be the implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface p(s)
                           ⋆q(t) of bi-degree (m, n). Using the Sylvester resultant to compute F(w, x, y, z), we get a

                         matrix whose entries are linear in the variables w, x, y, z. The determinant of this matrix is equal to w
                        4mn
                         · F(w, x, y, z), where w
                        4mn
                         is an extraneous factor. Using the Cayley/Dixon resultant to compute F(w, x, y, z), we get a 
                           
                              2

                              mn
                           
                         matrix. However, the entries of this matrix are cubic in the variables w, x, y, z. So once again the Cayley/Dixon resultant also introduces the extraneous factor w
                        4mn
                        .

Next we shall show how to compute the implicit equation of a quaternion rational surface p(s)
                           ⋆q(t) from the determinant of a matrix of size

                              ×
                              
                              2
                              mn
                           
                        , whose entries are linear in w, x, y, z and whose determinant has no extraneous factors.

                        . So we cannot use the Dixon method to compute this resultant, since the Dixon method requires the bi-degrees to be equal. To proceed, we need to construct a sparse resultant for three generic polynomials f(s, t), g(s, t), h(s, t) of bi-degrees (μ
                        0, n), (μ

In this section, we shall discuss the relation between singularities of quaternion rational surfaces and singularities of the corresponding rational space curves that generate these surfaces.

Consider two rational space curves p(s), q(t) and the corresponding quaternion rational surface 
                        
                           P
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                           =
                           p
                           (
                           s
                           )
                           
                              ☆
                           
                           q
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                     .
                        Theorem 13
                        
                           Suppose that 
                           p
                           0 
                           is a singularity of order r on the curve 
                           p(s). Then 
                           p
                           0
                           
                              ⋆q(t) is a singular locus on the quaternion rational surface 
                           p(s)
                              ⋆q(t). Similarly, if 
                           q
                           0 
                           is a singularity of order r on the curve 
                           q(t), then 
                           p(s)
                              ⋆q
                           0 
                           is a singular locus on the quaternion rational surface 
                           p(s)
                              ⋆q(t).

Here we only prove the first part of this theorem, the second part can be proved similarly.

Let p(s, u) be the homogenization of p(s). Since p
                           0 is a singularity of order r on the curve p(s), it follows that there are r parameters

                              ⋆q(t) is a singularity of order at least r on the quaternion rational surface p(s)
                              ⋆q(t). □

Based on Theorem 13, we can calculate singular loci on a quaternion rational surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) by computing singularities on the two rational space curves p(s), q(t). However, not all singularities on the quaternion rational surface p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) are generated in this manner.

                            is a singularity on the surface P(s, t). However, both rational space curves p(s), q(t) are quadratic and therefore they have no singularities. Hence, the singularity (1, 0, 1, 0) is not generated from a singularity of one of the corresponding rational space curves.

To compute all the singularities on a quaternion rational surface, we can use the implicitization matrices presented in Section 6.1 along with algorithms derived in [3]. Based on the drop-of-rank property [2], we can calculate in this way all the singularities of quaternion rational surfaces. For an example, see Appendix B.

In this section, we shall derive two special syzygies for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and show how to use these two special syzygies to derive the implicit equations and simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces.

                      on the quaternion rational ruled surface, we can calculate the corresponding parameter t
                     0 using Eq. (19). However, unlike the system of linear Eqs. (14) for general quaternion rational surfaces, the system of linear Eqs. (18) does not involve the parameter s
                     0. So we cannot get the parameter s
                     0 corresponding to X
                     0 directly from Eq. (18). But quaternion rational ruled surfaces p(s)
                        ⋆q(t) are linear in the parameter s, so the other parameter s
                     0 corresponding to X
                     0 can be computed by solving the following system of linear equations:

                           0) correspond to double points on the surface P(s, t). Hence the curves P(s

                           0) are singular loci on the surface P(s, t). Moreover the point P(s

                           0) at the intersection of these two singular loci is a singular point of order 4.
