                  Objective
                  In medical information retrieval research, semantic resources have been mostly used by expanding the original query terms or estimating the concept importance weight. However, implicit term-dependency information contained in semantic concept terms has been overlooked or at least underused in most previous studies. In this study, we incorporate a semantic concept-based term-dependence feature into a formal retrieval model to improve its ranking performance.
               
               
                  Design
                  Standardized medical concept terms used by medical professionals were assumed to have implicit dependency within the same concept. We hypothesized that, by elaborately revising the ranking algorithms to favor documents that preserve those implicit dependencies, the ranking performance could be improved. The implicit dependence features are harvested from the original query using MetaMap. These semantic concept-based dependence features were incorporated into a semantic concept-enriched dependence model (SCDM). We designed four different variants of the model, with each variant having distinct characteristics in the feature formulation method.
               
               
                  Measurements
                  We performed leave-one-out cross validations on both a clinical document corpus (TREC Medical records track) and a medical literature corpus (OHSUMED), which are representative test collections in medical information retrieval research.
               
               
                  Results
                  Our semantic concept-enriched dependence model consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art retrieval methods. Analysis shows that the performance gain has occurred independently of the concept’s explicit importance in the query.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  By capturing implicit knowledge with regard to the query term relationships and incorporating them into a ranking model, we could build a more robust and effective retrieval model, independent of the concept importance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the growing availability of medical literature and clinical records in digital form, as well as predominant evidence-based medicine (EBM) philosophy [1], having an effective information search technique has become increasingly important in the medical domain. Semantic knowledge has been actively used for medical information retrieval (IR) research, by virtue of extensive resources such as UMLS® [2]. In previous studies, semantic concept information has been used mostly in two different directions. The first direction is to recognize important concepts that belong to semantic types such as Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (PICO) and to strengthen their term weights appropriately in a ranking formula [3,4]. The second direction is to expand the original query terms or document terms with lexical variants or synonymous terms to resolve the term mismatch problem [5–7].

In a separate line of work, recent studies in general information retrieval research attempted to combine query term dependencies into a ranking formula to utilize the mutually interdependent characteristics of term occurrences [8,9]. In most of these studies, sequential query terms are blindly assumed to be dependent, which is a fairly reasonable conjecture, but this approach still leaves a substantial amount of opportunity for improvement.

In a specialized domain such as the medical field, people strongly tend to use standardized terms when they communicate, whether in the spoken or written form. For example, ‘Disseminated intravascular coagulation’ is a medical concept; this concept will be less-often described as ‘Coagulations are spreading out through the entire blood vessel’ or ‘Coagulations are observed, and they are intravascularly disseminated’ by medical professionals, although the alternatives could convey similar meanings. Those preferred terms are combined to represent a single semantic concept and would more often occur in a static pattern rather than appearing separately.

In this study, we assumed that the implicit term dependencies provide information on a search user’s behavior, on the way that the users perform their work, and on the way that they choose words and arrange them in sentences. Utilizing domain-specific semantic tools such as MetaMap, we can capture implicit term dependencies that are contained in a query automatically. We hypothesized that, by elaborately revising the ranking algorithms to favor documents that preserve those implicit user requests, we can improve the ranking performance further.

In this paper, our main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we propose a semantic concept-enriched dependence model, which utilizes semantic knowledge to refine query term dependency elements in a ranking formula. Second, we conduct extensive experiments on both a clinical document corpus (TREC Medical records track) and a medical literature corpus (OHSUMED). Experimental results show that our semantic concept-enriched dependence model is more effective compared to the state-of-the-art baseline. Third, we show that these performance gains are achieved independently of the concept importance, which is distinct from previous approaches.

In the following section, we provide a detailed summary of related studies. In Section 3, we describe other state-of-the-art methods and introduce our semantic concept-enriched dependence model. In Sections 5 and 6, experimental results are presented, and in-depth analysis is performed. In Section 7, we summarize our entire work and introduce future research directions.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

MetaMap [10] is a computer program that was developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM®) for mapping concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus® from biomedical texts. MetaMap is freely available and is the most popular semantic tool in medical text processing.

Input texts go through lexical and syntactic analysis, variant generation, candidate identification and mapping processes. For a detailed explanation of MetaMap’s inner mechanisms, please see [11].

In this study, we did not use our own special methods to recognize medical concepts. Instead, we used default MetaMap settings to improve the ranking performance, which means that our work is generalizable and can be easily reproduced by others.

Many recent studies in IR attempted to identify important concepts and strengthen their term weights to improve the retrieval effectiveness, especially with regard to verbose queries [12–14]. In medical IR, PICO elements are considered to be key information from the perspective of EBM, and it is recommended to formulate clinical questions by the PICO framework [15]. Demner-Fushman and Lin [16] developed a series of knowledge extractors to automatically identify various types of knowledge, including the PICO elements, clinical task type and strength of evidence. To score relevance from the EBM perspective, they designed a direct relevance scoring function that is based on those knowledge components. Boudin et al. [3] identified PICO elements in documents and queries automatically using a machine learning classifier. They incorporated PICO elements into a baseline KL divergence ranking formula by increasing their weights to improve the retrieval performance. Both studies made use of semantic resources to identify the PICO elements.

To resolve the term-mismatch problem in IR, a large number of studies used semantic resources, finding relevant terms to allow matching between word pairs that are semantically related to each other. For a comprehensive survey with regard to ontology-based query expansion, please see [17]. In the TREC Genomics track [18], Zhong and Huang [19] attempted to apply a concept-oriented retrieval technique by utilizing the full name of the biomedical entity, its abbreviations and morphological variants. Zhou et al. [6] expanded query terms utilizing several vocabulary sources, including the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH®) [20]. They utilized not only the synonym relationships but also the hypernyms, hyponyms, lexical variants or implicitly related concepts, and they proposed a unified conceptual IR model. Ide et al. [5] used the ESSIE concept-based search engine. Utilizing UMLS, they experimented with five different levels of expansion when they handled synonyms, word variants or missing fragments. In the ImageCLEF medical retrieval task [21] and the TREC medical records track [22], many studies utilized the MeSH in query expansion [23–27]. To name a few, Crespo Azcárate et al. [28] utilized the MeSH tree hierarchy structure when identifying expansion terms. Sondhi et al. [29] used both a medical thesaurus (MeSH) and manual physician feedback in query expansion, comparing different combinations of methodology.

This study is targeted in an orthogonal direction to the two prevailing approaches of concept utilization because it incorporates implicit term dependency that is veiled in semantic concept knowledge.

Bag-of-words retrieval models [30,31] represent queries and documents as unordered sets of terms; this strategy is based on an independence assumption. Although bag-of-words models have been shown to be simple and effective, a richer method of representation has been sought to enable further performance gain. Several models had been proposed, such as the n-gram language model [9] or the inference network model [32], but these models are typically more complex yet less effective [33].

Metzler and Croft [8] proposed the Markov random field model as a formal framework to include various term dependencies as ranking features. (A detailed explanation of [8] is presented in Section 3.) Others investigated proximity-based retrieval models [34–39], but they are roughly in the same line of work with Metzler, utilizing term position information.

Recently, many studies have attempted to improve the dependence model. Concept importance was estimated by utilizing collection statistics or external resources and was applied to weight both individual terms and sequential term dependencies [13,14,40]. Park et al. [41] incorporated syntactic relationships that were acquired from syntactic dependency parsing into the retrieval model. Inspired by a quasi-synchronous stochastic process in machine translation, four different types of syntactic dependency were specified to allow inexact matching between them. Lioma et al. [42] analyzed discourse structure in texts and utilized rhetorical relations for retrieval.

Bendersky and Croft [43] introduced the query hypergraph to represent higher-order term dependencies. By using a hypergraph structure, they laid abstract theoretical background to flexibly model dependencies between different query concepts, each one corresponding to the arbitrary number of query terms. However, their work utilized only three types of structures (query term, exact phrase and proximity) as a local factor, which had been commonly used in previous studies. In this study, we adopted medical concept information from a semantic knowledge source as a novel dependency feature for ranking medical documents.

@&#METHODS@&#

Our approach builds on a query-likelihood model and a sequential dependence model. In this section, the query-likelihood model and sequential dependence model are introduced in advance. Then, we augment those models with semantic concept-enriched dependence.

The Indri search engine [44] was used in the experiment, and we attached an Indri query example for each method. The same example query, ‘Elderly patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia’ was used repeatedly for better understanding. For a detailed explanation with regard to the Indri query language, please see [45].

We used the unigram query likelihood (QL) model with Dirichlet prior smoothing [46] as our baseline method. In a statistical language modeling approach, query q is assumed to be generated by a probabilistic model based on document d. Thus, the documents are ranked according to the query likelihood, p(q|d). The unigram query likelihood model is based on the independence assumption, which presumes that each word occurs independently of each of the others. When query q is given, the query likelihood is unfolded as a multinomial model.

For each document d, the probability of word w is modeled using the Dirichlet prior smoothing method to relieve the data sparseness problem by adjusting the maximum likelihood estimation.

                        c(w; d) is a term occurrence of word w within document d, and p(w|C) is a collection language model that is estimated from the entire corpus C. The variable μ is a Dirichlet prior parameter.

The Indri query example for QL is described as follows.
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          #combine (elderly patients ventilator associated pneumonia)
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

‘#combine’ Indri query operator combines scores of terms inside bracket. Note that the stopword ‘with’ has been removed from the original query.

The sequential dependence model (SDM) [8] assumes dependency between adjacent query terms. SDM shows better experimental performance compared to QL or a full dependence model (FDM) [8,12,13], which assumes that all query terms are dependent on each other.

Three types of features (occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases and unordered phrases) are combined into a unified model for modeling the term dependencies.

The ranking functions are summarized according to the following formula,

In the ranking formula, there are two types of features: the occurrence of a single term, the occurrence of a sequential query term pair. Single term feature type has one element fT
                        , which denotes single term feature. Sequential query term dependency feature type has two elements: fO
                         denotes ordered phrase feature; fU
                         denotes unordered phrase feature.

(λT
                        , λO
                        , λU
                        ) are weight parameters for single terms, ordered phrases and unordered phrases, respectively. If we set (λT
                        
                        =1.00, λO
                        
                        =0.00, λU

‘#od1’ denotes terms must appear in the exact same phrase. ‘#uw8’ denotes terms must appear within window of length 8 in any order. ‘#combine’ Indri query operator combines scores of terms or phrases inside bracket. ‘#weight’ operator combines score of each element with different weighting (λT
                        , λO
                        , λU
                        ).

We presumed that we can build a more elaborately designed dependence model by properly utilizing domain-specific knowledge. The UMLS Metathesaurus contains comprehensive medical concepts. Using MetaMap, all of the existing UMLS concepts in queries are identified. Then, we incorporated them into the ranking formula.

We presented the input query to MetaMap 2011 (with UMLS 2011 AA) in its default configuration. MetaMap analyzed the input text and printed out the recognized concepts with Concept Unique Identifier (CUI), with zero-based character offset and length of match information.

We took all of the concepts in the top-scoring final mapping results from MetaMap. When there are separate concepts that have a partially overlapping scope but that are tied in the scores, we choose a concept that has a broader term coverage. For example, for the input text ‘prostate cancer’, when MetaMap produced two concepts: ‘C1278980: entire prostate’, which is matched to ‘prostate’, and ‘C0376358: prostate cancer’, which is matched to ‘prostate cancer’, the latter concept was chosen.

Based on the concept information from MetaMap, the query terms are divided into separate groups. For query terms that do not belong to any MetaMap identified concept, we regarded those terms as single-term concepts. An example query is grouped as (elderly), (patients), (ventilator associated pneumonia). Multiple terms are grouped within the same brackets, such as (ventilator associated pneumonia) in the above example, which are the main target points for the semantic concept-enriched dependence model (SCDM).

We incorporated semantic concept-based dependency into the language model. Similar to the way that SDM builds upon QL, SCDM builds upon SDM by adding semantic concept-enriched dependence elements.

We designed four variants of the model, which are summarized in Table 1
                           . Each variant has a slightly different meaning with regard to the constraints that each one imposes on the dependence feature element.

A detailed mathematical formula and Indri query example is described below.

                              SC is defined as a set of multi-term semantic concepts that are recognized in query Q. A single-term concept is not included in SC. Qj is defined as all of the sequential terms in the jth
                               semantic concept.

In the ranking formula, there are three types of features: the occurrence of a single term, the occurrence of a sequential query term pair, and the occurrence of semantic concept-based dependency. Single term feature type has one element fT

In SCDMmulti-term only, pairwise, semantic concept-based dependency feature excluded single term concept elements (‘elderly’, ‘patients’), and inserted multi-term concept terms by paired group (‘ventilator associated’, ‘associated pneumonia’).

The ranking formula of SCDMsingle+multi-term, all-in-one is identical to SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one. The only difference from SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one is that SC is defined as the set of all of the concepts that are recognized in query Q, regardless of whether a concept is multi-term or single-term.

In SCDMsingle+multi-term,all-in-one, semantic concept-based dependency feature included single term concept elements (‘elderly’, ‘patients’), and inserted all multi-term concept terms into single bracket (‘ventilator associated pneumonia’).

The ranking formula for SCDMsingle+multi-term, pairwise is very similar to that of SCDMmulti-term only, pairwise. The difference from SCDMmulti-term only, pairwise is that SC is defined as the set of all of the concepts that are recognized in query Q, regardless of whether a concept is multi-term or single-term. Qj is defined as the set of adjacent term pairs in the jth
                               semantic concept; however, when there is only a single term in the jth
                               concept, a single term occurrence qj
                               is substituted for Qj accordingly.

The Indri query example for SCDMsingle+multi-term,pairwise is described as follows.

In SCDMsingle+multi-term, pairwise, semantic concept-based dependency feature included single term concept elements (‘elderly’, ‘patients’), and inserted multi-term concept terms by paired group (‘ventilator associated’, ‘associated pneumonia’).

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

We utilized the TREC Medical records track 2011′, 2012′ [22] and OHSUMED [47] as our test collection. Test collection statistics are described in Table 2
                        .

The TREC Medical records track [22] is about an ad hoc search task for patient visits. This track tackles the problem of providing content-based access to free-text fields within health records. The test collection contains 100,866 de-identified medical reports, which are aggregated to 17,265 patient visits. Report-to-visit mapping information is provided from the test collection. Please note that the TREC data sets used for this experiments are no longer available, thus reproducibility of the results on these data sets is not possible. This is for the 2011 and 2012 Medical records track, while this is not the case for most of the other TREC collections.

OHSUMED [47] test collection was created to assist information retrieval research, led by William Hersh et al. at the Oregon Health & Science University. It consists of 348,566 MEDLINE® documents, which contains all references from 270 medical journals over a five-year period (1987–1991). MEDLINE is a bibliographical database maintained by the NLM. Each document has various fields such as Title, Abstract, Publication type or Author.

We used the Indri search engine [48] for this study. The documents were stemmed using the Porter stemmer. In OHSUMED, only Title and Abstract fields were indexed by a search engine. We removed stopwords from the query using the standard 418 INQUERY stopword list. Queries were stemmed using the Porter stemmer. In all of the experiments in this study, the default Dirichlet prior parameter (μ) value of 2500 is used. This study targets evaluating the usefulness of introducing a novel dependency feature to the ranking performance. We fixed all of the settings uniformly across different methodologies and different collections, changing only the dependency features that are used in the ranking formula, to rigorously evaluate its impact on the performance.

We have done leave-one-out cross-validation for performance evaluation (Fig. 1
                        ). In leave-one-out cross validation, one instance (in this study, one query) is chosen for the test set and all the other queries are assigned to the training set (Fig. 1(b)). Best performing parameter setting is chosen from training set, and applied on test set (Fig. 1(c)). This process is repeated for every query in turn (Fig. 1(d)).

In SDM, there are three parameters (λT
                        , λO
                        , λU
                        ) to be trained. In SCDM, there are five parameters (λT
                        , λO
                        , λU
                        , λO
                        
                        _
                        
                           SC
                        , λU
                        
                        _
                        
                           SC
                        ) to be trained. We performed a parameter sweep, changing each of the parameter values from 0.00 to 1.00 in steps of 0.01. To reduce the computational workload accompanied by an excessive number of possible parameter combinations, we applied the following heuristic constraints:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 λT
                                 
                                 +
                                 λO
                                 
                                 +
                                 λU
                                 
                                 +
                                 λO_SC
                                 
                                 +
                                 λU_SC
                                 
                                 =1.00.


                                 λT
                                 
                                 ⩾0.60.


                                 λO
                                 
                                 =2×λU.


                                 λO
                                 
                                 _SC
                                 =2×
                                 λU_SC
                                 .

With regard to constraints (2), (3) and (4), we account for the fact that optimal parameter settings across various collections in Metzler’s work [8] were (λT
                        : 0.85, λO
                        : 0.10, λU
                        : 0.05).

In SDM, there are 14 parameter combinations, such as (0.61, 0.26, 0.13), … , (0.82, 0.12, 0.06), … , (1.00, 0.00, 0.00), that satisfy the above constraints. In SCDM, there are 105 combinations, such as (0.61, 0.26, 0.13, 0.00, 0.00), (0.61, 0.24, 0.12, 0.02, 0.01), … , (0.82, 0.12, 0.06, 0.00, 0.00), … , (0.82, 0.06, 0.03, 0.06, 0.03), … , (0.82, 0.00, 0.00, 0.12, 0.06), … ,(1.0.0, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00). Note that the QL run setting is included in the SDM runs and that all of the SDM run settings fall within the SCDM runs.

In OHSUMED, mean average precision (MAP) served as a primary evaluation metric and an optimization target criteria of the leave-one-out cross-validation. MAP has been commonly used and has been shown to have good discrimination and stability [49,50]. We used trec_eval [51] to evaluate the top 1,000 ranked search lists. We used IBM SPSS Statistics 20 [52] to perform a two-sided paired t-test. Given two paired sets of values, the paired t-test determines whether there is a significant difference under the assumptions that the paired differences are independent and identically normally distributed [53,54]. The results are marked by the significance level (*: p
                        <0.05, **: p
                        <0.01) compared to the baseline (QL).

In TREC collections, relevant assessment was not done exhaustively, so extended inferred evaluation measures [55–57] were selected as an official evaluation measure to get the more accurate estimates of run’s quality [22]. In this study, we used bpref [55] for TREC Medical records track 2011′, and infAP [56] for TREC Medical records track 2012′ as primary evaluation metric and optimization target criteria of the leave-one-out cross-validation.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The overall experimental results are summarized in Table 3
                     . Compared with QL, the number of queries ‘improved’, ‘harmed’ or ‘unaffected’ by the primary evaluation metric, is also presented. Other informative measures, such as precision for the top 10 documents(P@10), infNDCG [57] or recall rate for the top 1000 documents(Recall) are presented together.

In previous TREC search tasks, SDM showed good performance, especially on a web search task such as Terabyte Track and Million Query Track [13,58,59]. However, in this experiment, SDM failed to bring a statistically significant improvement over QL in all of the test collections. SDM is based on the assumption that sequential query terms are dependent on each other. We speculate that when this assumption is not well supported in a given query, the performance is degraded as a result.

In contrast, SCDM variants consistently outperformed QL. When we compare the number of queries improved, harmed and unaffected between SDM and SCDM methods, SCDM variants clearly have less harmed queries than SDM. By selectively utilizing term dependency using semantic concept information, a robust performance gain is made feasible. We will analyze the performance of each method’s variants in detail in Section 6.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In TREC Medical records track, many submitted runs including best run [60,61] used vocabulary normalization or term expansion technique to resolve term mismatch problem [22]. King et al. [60] expanded query terms using two kinds of sources: (1) UMLS Metathesaurus (2) pseudo-relevant document retrieved from medical reference encyclopedia such as The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. Dongqing Zhu et al. [61] formed mixture of relevance model by utilizing various external collections [62], such as TREC 2007 Genomics track dataset [63] and TREC 2009 ClueWeb09 Category B dataset [64], and expanded the query using those models.

Analogous approaches have been also tried on OHSUMED. Hersh et al. [65] assessed thesaurus-based query expansion using the UMLS Metathesaurus. The queries were expanded using synonym, hierarchical, and related term information from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The retrieval performance which is measured in precision and recall, improved in specific instances, but declined generally. Yoo and Choi [66] compared the performance of various pseudo-relevance feedback algorithms for query expansion. They split queries in OHSUMED into training set and test set, and parameters for each algorithm is optimized for the training set and then applied on the test set for performance evaluation. Up to maximum 20% improvement in MAP is observed, compared to the baseline retrieval model using unexpanded query.

This study rigorously focuses on incorporating semantic concept-enriched dependence feature, without trying to draw additional expansion terms using thesaurus or pseudo-relevance feedback. However, the performance of SCDM is comparable to other systems as shown in Table 3. More importantly, all these different approaches are complementary to each other, toward building a more effective and robust search method for medical information retrieval.

Many previous studies [12–14] attempted to estimate the importance of the concepts and reflected them directly back to the relative feature weights in the ranking formula. In this study, we focused on an orthogonal approach that captures implicit term dependence knowledge in a semantic concept and incorporates it into a ranking model, independent of the concept importance. Thus, we utilized all of the concepts recognized by MetaMap without considering the concept importance estimation.

To examine the importance of the concepts utilized in this study, we performed leave-one-out cross-validation for concept weighting. We weighted multi-term concepts with varying weights (λ
                        imp) from 1.00 to 2.00 in steps of 0.01.

The Indri query example is described as follows:
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          #weight (1.00 elderly 1.00 patients λimp ventilator λimp associated λimp pneumonia)
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

The results are described in Table 4
                        .

In all of the test collections, no significant increase is observed by direct concept importance weighting. Table 4 shows that the concepts utilized in this study were not selectively chosen from the concept importance perspective; instead, they were found to be useful by exploiting implicit dependency information contained within a semantic concept.

In summary, previous medical information retrieval studies that used semantic concepts could be classified into two major categories: (1) Expand the original query using semantic concepts; (2) Apply term weighting based on a concept importance estimation. In this study, we added a third category; and (3) Refine the ranking algorithm based on a term dependency constraint harvested from semantic concepts.

In this study, we attempted four variants of a model. Usually, the ranking performance was very similar, but SCDMsingle+multi-term,all-in-one and SCDMsingle+multi-term,pairwise were more robust across the collections. As depicted in Table 1, SCDMsingle+multi-term, all-in-one and SCDMsingle+multi-term,pairwise are distinct from SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one and SCDMmulti-term only,pairwise by the fact that a single-term concept is included within the model.

Here, we describe a practical example with 4 documents.

In the above example, both SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one (and also SCDMmulti-term only, pairwise) and SCDMsingle+multi-term, all-in-one (and also SCDMsingle+multi-term, pairwise) rank Doc1 higher than Doc2. However, in SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one, Doc2 is ranked equivalently to Doc3 and Doc4. However, in SCDMsingle+multi-term, all-in-one, Doc2 is ranked higher than Doc3, and Doc3 is ranked higher than Doc4. We suppose that SCDMsingle+multi-term, all-in-one and SCDMsingle+multi-term, pairwise show robust performance by selectively intervening with a specific portion of the rank order to minimize any unintended impact on the overall rankings. If single-term features (in the above example, ‘elderly’ or ‘patients’) are very important in discriminating relevant documents from non-relevant documents, SCDMmulti-term only, all-in-one or SCDMmulti-term only, pairwise could do harm in the ranking performance by flattening the relative orders among Doc2, Doc3 and Doc4.

In Table 3, the semantic concept-enriched dependence model improved primary evaluation metrics for each test collection, but the recall rate was not improved. We assume that the semantic concept-based dependency helps to refine the initial retrieved document rankings, especially regarding top-ranked documents, but does little to draw previously unfound relevant documents into the top 1000 ranks.

This finding conforms to our intention and intuition. If we utilized concept information to expand the original query with synonymous words, then the recall rate could be improved by resolving the term mismatch problem, which would result in retrieving more relevant documents. However, because we restricted our experimental method to utilize concept information only as a dependency information source to refine our ranking algorithm, primary evaluation metrics were improved although the recall rate was unchanged.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study, we proposed a semantic concept-enriched dependence model for medical information retrieval.

First, semantic concepts in the original query are identified using MetaMap. Second, we assumed that each group of query terms within the same semantic concept boundary has implicit term dependency with the others. Therefore, we revised the ranking algorithm to favor documents that preserve those implicit dependencies by incorporating semantic concept-enriched dependence features into the formal language model framework. The experimental results show that the semantic concept-enriched dependence model is both effective and robust, in contrast to the sequential dependence model, which blindly assumes sequential query term dependency and failed to derive consistent improvement.

This work proceeds in a direction that is orthogonal to the two prevailing approaches that utilize semantic concepts: (1) lexical query expansion and (2) term weighting by semantic concept importance. For academic purposes, this study focused on a rigorous evaluation of the impact of semantic concept-enriched dependence features on ranking performance, maintaining all of the other conditions uniformly and prohibiting another way of utilizing semantic concept information. In our future work, we would like to perform comprehensive experiments that encompass other previous approaches. By combining all of the explicit and implicit information that is contained in the medical semantic resource, we hope to make a unified medical information retrieval model in the future.

                                    • By expanding the original query with synonymous words that utilize a semantic concept, medical information retrieval performance could be improved.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    • By applying a term weighting method based on concept importance estimation, medical information retrieval performance could be improved.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    • A sequential dependence model showed good performance in general information retrieval, especially in web search tasks.
                                 
                                 
                                    What this study added to our knowledge
                                    • We can refine the medical IR ranking algorithm based on term-dependence constraints harvested from semantic concepts.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    • Compared to a sequential dependence model based on the sequential query term-dependence assumption, which failed to show consistent improvement over the baseline, our semantic concept-enriched dependence model showed robust performance.
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                    • The semantic concept-enriched dependence model achieved a performance gain independently from the query expansion or concept importance weighting approach, which means that these three approaches could be used in a complementary way to make more effective medical IR ranking models.
